It would give me a better idea of where we are in the game. They normally do hence me sending this one out” Ah scorecard - yes. Apologies Harold. I’ll try and find someone to sort it in the office.. But you do know you can follow it on free to air via Sky’s youtube channel or free to air channels showcase and pick.“Good afternoon Tanya (well good morning in your time)“ Hello Christine Mulhearn. “It’s a cold and dreary day in Canberra and it looks infinitely better weather in New Zealand – which is not really how this usually works! I am at work preparing for a big week ahead finding it very distracting whilst reading the blog and listening on the radio Alyssa Healy’s innings was just magnificent and whilst it has done amazing things for Australia, I fear it means a couple more hours in the office as I haven’t been working that hard…. Perhaps the Aussies can bowl England out quickly and I can get back to concentrating on work (well that’s my excuse for wanting a quick win anyway)“Lovely to hear from you Chris!After 12 overs, Australia were 49-0, but Healy was yet to really get going.  We spot Lisa Keightley on the boundary with her ever-present notebook. Is she noting down that at the end of the power play England are ahead? “Morning Tanya!” Hello there Martin Wright. “Just in case Andrew Pearson (5th over), has made you too jealous, let me balance that by telling you that I’m on a very early train to Luton, en route to Inverness. Hope that helps.  And facing down 356, hope is all we have left, really…”  Oh, the glamour!“Much as I love the blog, it’s a disgrace that this isn’t on free to air TV here in Australia, where many major matches are still shown in that way. I’d love to have watched Healy’s fantastic 170.Go Australia! (Not that they need the superfluous encouragement.)“ I had no idea it wasn’t on free to air telly Australia - I’m really surprised. Has there been an outcry? Was brilliant of Sky to do it in the UK. Andrew Pearson sends me some lovely pictures from Christchurch which the computer won’t let me attach. “Kia ora from two Brits in Hagley Oval!England have a mountain to climb thanks to some fantastic batting from the Australians, but the sun is shining, the gin is flowing, and the cricket is glorious! Come on England!!!” I’ve got to admit I’m jealous.An email arrives from the frozen north. Good morning Sara Torvalds! “Good morning from chilly Karis, Finland. It’s -4 degrees and sunny here, but at least Anya Shrubsole’s late wickets mean England are not chasing 400. Still, nobody said winning the World Cup should be easy!”  “Morning Tanya” Lovely to hear from you Ed Kay. “Well, it’s enough to make you want to go straight back to bed Anything’s possible, of course, and looks like a good batting track, but if we’re honest Australia will be worthy winners and have finished off with a bang.At this point I just hope we put in a good showing - and at least make it past Healy’s total of 170!” If you’re in sunny Christchurch, or (cloudy) Sydney, or just waking up on chilly English morning - do say hi: tanya.aldred.freelance@theI was making a cup of tea when she was out, and on the radio they mentioned that not only did every member of the England side congratulate her, but every person in the ground stood and applauded.  The story of the innings was of course Alyssa Healy. An absolutely sensational 170 from 138 was the key to Australia’s dominance and she looked so mature and composed out there. There were no early rash shots, she eased her way into the game, building her strike rate as she went on. It was beautiful to watch, though perhaps quite painful if you’re English. Mooney and Haynes were incredible in support and Perry came through at the end to ice the cake in the most elegant way imaginable. The batters have played their role and set the stage for their bowlers to bowl at a team that has to take risks if they want to come close to this total.  I’m going to leave you here in the very capable hands of my excellent colleague Tanya Aldred, who will guide you through the England batting innings. Thank you for your company throughout this and I hope you enjoyed watching Alyssa Healy exert her dominance on this match as much as I did. I’ll be settling in to watch the rest of this match with great delight. Shrubsole bowls the last over and McGrath chips it over the infield for a single to start. Perry shows no sign of injury as she pushes through for two from the second ball and then cuts one that almost finds the boundary. Next ball she does find the rope and brings up the 350 for Australia, what a batting display it has been today. Just completely clinical in its dominance. Perry is so elegant at the crease and is playing the ‘icing on the cake’ role to perfection here. There’s a run out attempt on the last ball of the over, but Perry is safe and they finish a sensational innings here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e136a77df311f30d94d78e66128df01d3689bce/0_200_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=2492ed1b686bf4507fc90c4f806722eb","title":"twenty photographs of the week","story":"Warning: readers may find some of these images distressing"},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Options to consider \u0026ndash and reasons to be cheerful \u0026ndash when selecting your move after the examMaking important life decisions is never easy - but there are tools to helpJunior Cycle and Leaving Cert exams to commence on Wednesday, June 8thThe fairness of some aspects of the college application system is open to questionMinister for Education confirms move for Leaving Cert and Junior Cert studentsSudden shift to pre-pandemic standards is not expected, says Department of EducationYou need to register now to apply for college through the CAO, but you have until July 1st to make a final decision on your course choiceCAO 2022: Most applicants get an outcome which enables them to successfully progress to the next stage of their educational journeyFrom nursing to engineering and environmental studies, there\u0026rsquos plenty of choice"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: Western seaboard housed ancient breeds adapted to the leanest of dietsStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"meat plant worker sues over covid 19 infection","story":"Rosderra Irish Meats.

Photograph: Diarmuid GreeneA Co Offaly meat plant worker who nearly died from Covid-19 is suing his employer for personal injuries in the first known damages claim involving a case in a meat factory.Paul Feighery has taken a High Court action against Rosderra Irish Meats Group claiming that he contracted the virus while working at its plant in Roscrea, Co Tipperary.Mr Feighery took ill in March 2020. His health rapidly deteriorated and he was admitted to Midland Regional Hospital Tullamore. He spent more than two weeks on a ventilator in ICU before recovering and being discharged in May 2020. He still suffers ill effects from the disease.His solicitors, Deirdre K Ryan \u0026amp Co in Roscrea, confirmed that Mr Feighery was taking a personal injuries and negligence case against Rosderra.He is claiming damages for severe personal injuries, allegedly caused by the company’s negligence, breach of contract and breach of duty, including statutory duty.Total disregardIn his claim filed in January, he is alleging that Rosderra showed a total disregard for his safety and welfare. The company has yet to file a defence in the action.Rosderra chief executive Jim Hanley had no comment. The firm’s solicitors, Benjamin J Higgins, said: “As this matter is the subject of legal proceedings, we cannot comment at this stage.”The first legal case arising from a Covid-19 case in a meat-plant worker could spark a flurry of similar actions by people who claim they contracted the virus as a result of their working conditions.Rosderra suffered one of the biggest Covid-19 outbreaks at any workplace in the country during the first wave of the pandemic. Regarded as an essential food business, the company – the largest pig-meat processing plant in the State – remained open throughout the pandemic.Sinn Féin TD for Laois-Offaly Brian Stanley raised concerns in the Dáil about staff infections at Rosderra in April 2020 claiming that out of about 350 workers in Roscrea, up to 140 were out sick.He claimed at the time that workers who later tested positive were allowed to work next to healthy staff. The outbreak prompted the HSE to mass-test hundreds of staff for Covid-19.Meat plants have been among the workplaces worst affected by the virus as the circulation of chilled air and close-quarters working conditions encourages transmission.A surge in infections out of meat plants in August 2020 led to regional restrictions in Kildare, Laois and Offaly, the first and only local lockdowns of the pandemic.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"charlie bird reaches summit of croagh patrick as 1 5m raised for charity","story":"Charlie Bird reaches the top of Croagh Patrick with his wife Claire Mould and supporters. Photograph:  Conor McKeownCharlie Bird and his supporters reached the summit of Croagh Patrick in Co Mayo\u0026nbspon Saturday afternoon\u0026nbspin an effort to raise funds for the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association and suicide charity Pieta.Tens of thousands of people took part in almost 200 Climb with Charlie fundraisers across the world, according to organisers.The charity campaign, led by the broadcaster Mr Bird (72) who was diagnosed with motor neurone disease last year, has already raised more than €1.5 million.Among those who took to the Reek on Saturday morning were Mr Bird’s wife, Claire, daughters, Orla and Neasa, and five grandchildren, as well as singer Daniel O’Donnell, Matt Molloy of the Chieftains, boxer Barry McGuigan and the Late Late Show host Ryan Tubridy.In a tweet on Saturday morning, President Michael D Higgins sent “every good wish and warmest support” to Mr Bird.He said: “Charlie’s strength and dignity over recent months has been a source of true inspiration to people across Ireland and beyond. I know that the public will be with him every step of the way.”Separate Climb with Charlie events were also planned across the world, in countries such as the United States, South Africa, Australia and Spain.Other climbs included a 17.5km hike up Mount Cooke in Western Australia, a 700m-high climb up Ben Gorm in Co Mayo, a 6km night-time trek from Glenmore to Barnavave peak (350m) in Co Louth, and a 494m-high hike up Cnoc Bulaba.The journey up Croagh Patrick began at 9.30am on Saturday from the mountain’s base in Westport, Co Mayo.Temperatures were expected to range between seven degrees in the east and about 10 degrees in the west “and as we climb of course it will be colder”.“I have no idea how many people are going to scale the Reek with me, but I feel it is going to be a day like no other,” he added.Mr Bird made a speech to his supporters and lit five candles in the church at the summit of the mountain one for his friend Vicky Phelan, one for people suffering a terminal illness, one for anyone in a dark place with their mental health, one for everyone involved in the fight against Covid and one for the people of Ukraine.The Climb with Charlie campaign is still accepting donations on www.climbwithcharlie.ie for the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association and Pieta.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"i have found peace says charlie bird amid outpouring of public support","story":"Charlie Bird: ‘I’m not as afraid now as I was when I first got my diagnosis because I have my family around me.’ Photograph: Aidan Crawley“I have found peace, I really have,” he said of coping with his condition. “I cried every day. I don’t cry now.”Mr Bird, a veteran journalist and broadcaster, made his diagnosis public last October saying he had been given a maximum of three years to live.Since then, he explained, a flood of letters and cards from members of the public, many of whom would have watched him on their television screens over the years, had helped him adjust to his new reality.On Friday he told Late Late Show presenter Ryan Tubridy of his plans to lead a group of climbers to Co Mayo’s Croagh Patrick in April to raise money for the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association and Pieta House charities, and to send a message of encouragement to anyone else coping with a terminal diagnosis.His mission, under the banner Climb With Charlie, has been backed by a host of well known figures – former president Mary McAleese, architect Dermot Bannon, and retired GAA commentator Mícheál Ó Muircheartaigh among them – who have vowed to join him or encourage others to undertake similar efforts elsewhere on the day.Mr Bird was due to be joined by cervical cancer campaigner Vicky Phelan whom he recently met with, but she was too ill to attend, instead sending a pre-recorded message to the show.“The support of the public around the country has lifted me like nothing else,” Mr Bird said, his voice clearly deteriorating as a consequence of his condition.He spoke of receiving letters “out the door, mass cards everything. It has been unbelievable. And in a way Ryan it has lifted me even spiritually if you understand”.Noting that people had been climbing Croagh Patrick for 1,500 years, he said it could mark the end of his own journey.“And in one sense – I mean this – I’m not as afraid now as I was when I first got my diagnosis because I have my family around me.”Mr Bird was joined by his wife Claire, daughters Orla and Neasa, and his dog Tiger who spent the initial part of his interview on his lap. One unforeseen advantage from almost four decades of broadcasting is that years of recordings of Mr Bird’s famous voice were available to a specialist company who have “banked” it and synthisised it in the event he eventually loses the ability to speak.Details of how to participate in April’s event are available at climbwithcharlie.ie and Mr Bird is hoping it will raise significant funding for motor neurone disease research.“We need to raise money … to try and save somebody’s life,” he said. “It may not save mine, it won’t, but we need to do research to try and save other people.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"mardi gras in mayo as charlie bird s carnival winds up croagh patrick","story":"Climb with Charlie: Barry McGuigan, Ryan Tubridy and Charlie Bird on the summit of Croagh Patrick. Photograph: Conor McKeownThe Celtic gods of Lugh and Danú may have been confused by Charlie’s carnival caravan as it wound its way up Croagh Patrick in resplendent sunshine on Saturday morning. This pyramidal peak overlooking Clew Bay is usually associated with penitents and the Reek Sunday pilgrimage on the last Sunday of July. It may be the season of Lent but it was more Mardi Gras in Mayo as benevolent weather gods stayed mainly in check for the 764 metre-high ascent for some 10,000 people who joined the Climb with Charlie.As Chieftain Matt Molloy mused shortly after he landed in the carpark at the mountain’s base in Murrisk: “What a release after the last two years of confinement and everything we have been going through.”An Air Corps helicopter had delivered all the instruments and technical equipment to the peak on Friday but Molloy was happy to carry his flute up himself.Volunteer Maria O’Malley, who was helping direct traffic into the carparks, explained that there were over 50 people - one third of the population - from her native Clare Island waving from the top of the Big Hill across the bay.Across the carpark, Tom Tiernan, from Ballinrobe, had a van full of hazel sticks , to aid walkers and a shoebox for donations.“I lost a sister to motor neurone about ten years ago.She was a nurse and was sick for five years, it was an awful disease,” he said.Meanwhile, Charlie’s family and friends gathered in the garden behind the adjacent Campbell’s pub.Speaking to The , Charlie’s wife Claire Mould, said: “This is a very spiritual day for us. We had climbed it six years ago and really the whole thing has happened because of a throwaway comment by Charlie after his diagnosis. We are just overwhelmed by the response and the benefits it will bring to the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association and Pieta.”Along the pathway, Joe Freeley from Ballyhaunis was ready and waiting with doves for Charlie to release, as he, and his entourage, set off on the odyssey shortly before 10.30am.“I’ve climbed the mountain loads of times and I wanted to be here to support Charlie. We released doves in Ballyhaunis too recently for the Ukrainian people,” he explained.Dublin native Ciarán Callaghan was climbing in memory of his father who died from motor neurone disease 14 years ago, aged just 58.“I think Charlie has created a great awareness nationwide and after my Mam signed me up, we raised €2000. If I survive the climb, I’m meeting her and the kids in the Tavern bar down the road for a big lobster dinner,” he said.Broadcaster Ryan Tubridy may have landed a little late but himself and former boxer Barry McGuigan were determined to catch up with Charlie and bounded up the lower slopes like two March - oops! - April hares. McGuigan later likened Tubridy to “a gazelle”.The sun may have become more tentative but the children from Brackloon NS were waiting for Charlie on the shoulder, about half way up.Pupil JJ Kenny (9) said: “Charlie called to our school on Thursday and he gave every pupil an elbow. He is brilliant.”No better man than Donegal crooner, Daniel O’Donnell to act as MC as the hordes negotiated the final approach of slippery shale on the precipitous peak.It didn’t matter about the cold mists - a magical micro-climate - sporadically enveloping the peak. Nature held its breath as Charlie’s message of hope - a recording made with special cloning technology - boomed across the skies.Referring to his “mad idea” to climb the Reek, he said that “you never know what is around the corner” but that “for every moment he is around he will extend the hand of friendship to people”.The poignancy continued when Daniel sang the Bruce Springsteen song, “Dream Baby Dream”, which had been played at Charlie and Claire’s wedding in 2016. But it was a song called “Irish Heroes” written by Des Cafferkey of the Clew Bay Pipe Band in the aftermath of the Rescue 116 helicopter crash off Blacksod that left Charlie Bird breaking down in tears.He wasn’t the only one.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"temperatures to drop below freezing on saturday night","story":"Lowest temperatures of -4 and +1 degrees are forecast over Saturday night.

They were wrong.”Yet Marina remains remarkably upbeat as she chats about her past, present and future, showing the strength of character that has got her this far, and which she still believes will see her facing Putin in the International Criminal Court one day.Her biggest ambition in life is “to live longer than Putin, and one day see him tried for war crimes and for the murder of my husband”. The war in Ukraine might even have brought that day closer.For now, though, Marina has a rather more introspective mission at hand. She and her son Anatoly are about to begin work on a joint memoir about Alexander, about his murder, and about the international criminal investigation that has dominated their lives ever since.Anatoly was just 12 when his dissident father died, and Marina believes the process of writing a book together will not only help them to relive cherished memories of Alexander, but also confront unresolved, unspoken elements of their grief.“Anatoly was definitely traumatised by his father’s death,” she says of the boy who was taken to see Alexander as he lay dying in University College Hospital, “but he was very protective of what he was feeling inside. He didn’t cry, and it was only when he got older that he started to talk about it.“When we write this memoir together it will be interesting to hear maybe for the first time his feelings about what happened, from his perspective.”Anatoly, now 28, still lives with his mother in their small flat in West London. He has been working as a paralegal but has decided his future lies in IT and is about to embark on a course in computer coding.Marina and her son talk about Alexander – or Sasha, to use the Russian diminutive form – “a lot” and she has always tried to impress on him the fact that “yes, your father died, but in some way he is with us”.Keeping Alexander’s memory alive, of course, has been a highly public affair for Marina, but not one which came easily.“I’m a very private person,” she says, “and I’m always really surprised when people recognise me in the street, though they are always very polite and generous.“What I do in public, I am doing for my husband, but it doesn’t come naturally. When he was lying in that hospital bed I refused to do any interviews. Sasha said I should do them, and tell people what was happening, but I thought he was going to recover so I never thought I would need to.”Before his death at the age of 44, Litvinenko dictated a statement to be read after his passing, in which he said: “You may succeed in silencing one man, but the howl of protest from around the world will reverberate, Mr Putin, in your ears for the rest of your life. May God forgive you for what you have done, not only to me but to beloved Russia and its people.” Putin’s blood-curdling reaction to Alexander’s death was to say: “The people that have done this are not God, and Mr Litvinenko is, unfortunately, not Lazarus.”A public inquiry chaired by Sir Robert Owen concluded in 2016 that Litvinenko had been the victim of a Federal Security Service (FSB, formerly KGB) assassination “probably” approved by Putin.It named two Russian agents, Andrey Lugovoy and Dmitri Kovtun, as his killers they had slipped a lethal dose of the radioactive substance polonium 210 into a pot of tea drunk by Litvinenko when they held a meeting with him on Wednesday, November 1, 2006 at London’s Millennium Hotel.Litvinenko told Marina that as he sipped his tea, “in one second he realised something wasn’t right”.Twenty-two days later, he was dead and she believes that if he had finished the cup he might have died very quickly, meaning the cause of his death might never have been detected.Two days after the meeting, he was admitted to Barnet General Hospital, before being transferred to University College Hospital on November 17 when his condition worsened. Doctors diagnosed acute radiation syndrome, and on November 23, after losing consciousness, he suffered a cardiac arrest and died after attempts to resuscitate him failed.And so he became the key witness in the investigation into his own murder. The public inquiry was a personal triumph for Marina, who had spent an entire decade pushing for it, despite the obvious risks to her own safety from taking on Putin and his hitmen.I ask if she feels she has to spend her life looking over her shoulder, but she says she has never had bodyguards and refuses to allow security concerns to constrain her.“In 2006 I was given close communication with the police, which meant I could always contact someone 24 hours a day, and I still have that access, but I don’t really need it,” she says.“I do pay attention to what happens around me – if I see the same person cropping up too many times I might want to know why.”Later this year a four-part ITV series, starring David Tennant as Litvinenko, will dramatise the murder and Marina’s fight for justice, which she hopes will bring the story to a new audience too young to remember the scarcely believable events of November 2006.Anatoly acted as a consultant for the series, but contractual obligations elsewhere meant she could not be involved in the production. Did she meet Tennant? She blushes and smiles, which gives away the answer, even though the official version is that they have never met.Marina, who will soon celebrate her 60th birthday, retains the unmistakable poise of her former life as a ballroom dancer (she still teaches dance), and sits straight-backed on the edge of a sofa as she sips green tea at a hotel near her west London home.]She recalls her first meeting with Alexander, in 1993, when he was working for the FSB investigating organised crime – she was 31 and he was 30.“I had heard about him before I met him,” she says, “and I was really quite surprised when this very young man arrived, looking quite shy. He certainly wasn’t what you expect a KGB man to be!”She was meeting friends for drinks on her birthday (“I always joked afterwards that he was my birthday present,” she says) and Alexander accompanied a friend of hers who was nervous about her safety because of her involvement in a case he was investigating.“Sasha gave you so much confidence. He supported you, he protected you, you felt very confident around him, whether you were his wife, his friend or his child. I never thought I could feel so loved, so protected and so happy.“He was always very open-minded, open to anything new. I never thought I would find all of those qualities in one person.”She also, of course, remembers the last time they spoke, and tears prick her eyes as she recalls leaving his hospital bedside to go home to Anatoly for the night.“I told him: ‘Don’t worry, I’ll be back soon’,” she says. “He said: ‘I love you so much’, and he looked so sad. I tried to make a joke by saying ‘finally you tell me!’, but it was the last thing he said to me. Two hours later he was unconscious.”Campaigning for justice can be lonely work, and Marina does not rule out marrying again one day, saying the idea of having another relationship “isn’t a problem to me”, but that any suitor would have to realise that “Sasha will always be in my life, so it would have to be a strong personality to accept that because most people want to be the only one”.At the start of our interview, before bombarding her with questions about her husband, about Ukraine, about Putin, about Roman Abramovich and so much more, I ask her if there are any particular messages she wants to get across, and her answer comes as a surprise.“Firstly, I’m worried about Russophobia,” she says, without pausing for thought. “Of course I support sanctions against Russia, but now people don’t even want to play Russian music, they want to boycott Russian composers. It’s stupid. The past 100 years have not been good for Russia, but it is also the country that produced Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Tchaikovsky and Prokofiev.”She accepts that it might seem odd to some people that she is so passionate about defending the country that murdered her husband, but she believes that “there may be a chance for Russia to become a different country” in future.Could she ever see herself going back to a Putin-free Russia if a modern-day Gorbachev were to take over one day and bring about a new glasnost?“When I left Russia I didn’t think I had left forever,” she says, recalling the couple’s arrival in the UK as political refugees in 2000. “There were people who left during the Cold War that knew they were leaving for good, but for me I thought it was going to be temporary.“Now, though, I would be more happy to go to live in Ukraine. It’s a very similar culture I have friends there and there will be plenty of work to do in rebuilding the country once the war is over.”She praises British people for being so “welcoming and open” to taking in Ukrainian refugees, but warns that “they need to be serious about it. “It’s not just about being generous it’s about being capable of supporting people who are traumatised, who have just come from a war zone. People also need to be prepared to be in this for the long haul you can’t just reject someone after a couple of weeks.”She does not have space in the small flat she shares with her son to be able to house a refugee, but is acting as a liaison for others who want to open their homes. She admits the war took her by surprise – a few days before the invasion, Moscow-born Marina was in Ukraine visiting friends in the south-west of the country.“I didn’t think there was going to be an invasion at all,” she admits, “or certainly nothing beyond the Donbas region. There were so many reasons for Putin not to do it, especially the effect that sanctions would have, that I thought he would hold back.”She says the West has been guilty of a collective failure to see Putin for what he is – “someone who has turned Russia into a mafia state and then a terrorist state” – because successive leaders have convinced themselves they knew how to handle him.“During the Cold War it was simple, because the West didn’t really have any personal relationships with Russia,” she says. “But after glasnost the West started doing business with Russia, private companies got deeply involved, personal relationships formed and they wanted to give Putin the benefit of the doubt.”She recalled George W Bush’s meeting with Putin in June 2001, when the US president said he had “looked the man in the eye” and found him to be “straightforward and trustworthy… I was able to get a sense of his soul”.“No-one believed the president of Russia was a real monster,” she says, “but he is and my husband Sasha tried to show it before his death, and he tried to show it through his death.“Russia carried out an act of nuclear terrorism on British soil by murdering Sasha, and it should have been a watershed moment, but it wasn’t.“In 2010 the new government of the UK gave Russia another chance to build its relationship, and more money came in, big donors with Russian surnames gave money to the Conservative Party. It was a big mistake.”She fears the West will become “fatigued” with the situation in Ukraine, and that President Volodymyr Zelensky will accept a peace deal that would be too advantageous to Russia.“It might suit western leaders to push Zelensky into agreeing everything Putin wants so that they can move on, but the Ukrainian people would not accept that, so it won’t be over.”She even suggests that Zelensky’s position as president could be in doubt if he is too accommodating, despite his Churchillian popularity at present.It is Marina’s misfortune that she knows more about Russia’s use of poisons than almost anyone else in the UK, so what does she believe happened to Abramovich, who claims he was poisoned while acting as a go-between in peace talks?“I believe this is all part of a propaganda exercise to frame Ukraine,” she says. “The Russians have already tried to suggest that Ukraine has chemical weapons so that they can stage false flag operations if they want to, and I think Russia will tell its people that Ukraine has tried to poison Abramovich.She believes that ultimately, Putin’s miscalculation in invading Ukraine could have profound consequences for him. “Russia could break up it’s such a huge country that it’s a nightmare to govern, as history has shown.”As for the war, she is concerned that Putin could use battlefield nuclear weapons, but thinks he would not risk all-out nuclear war because “he doesn’t look like a kamikaze he likes his money and his yachts too much”.Even if Putin were to give the order to use tactical nuclear weapons, Marina still has enough faith in the country of her birth to believe his soldiers would refuse to carry out their orders.“My husband refused to carry out orders to kill people,” she says. “I still believe Russia has heroes.”More from NewsUkrainian port city attacked by missiles, residents await evacuationBritain now has a moral duty to ditch the Northern Ireland ProtocolInside Prince Charles\u0026#39 country estate ahead of public openingThe West is beating Russia at its own gameHungary\u0026#39s Viktor Orban ‘will do a Trump’ if he loses electionHealth and social care levy is right thing to do, say Rishi Sunak and Sajid JavidMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"american dream disintegrating eyes","story":"Over the last decade the American presidency has passed from a man who arrived at his Inaugural shaking his fist in the air like a tinpot dictator to one who carelessly inserts dangerously impulsive remarks into crucial diplomatic speeches. What on earth is going on here?Of course, the United States, like all mass democracies, has had some pretty poor leaders over the centuries. Those figures who embodied the great moments in its history - Jefferson, Lincoln, Franklin Roosevelt - are memorable because they are rare. But what is happening now seems like something more than a routine spell of mediocrity which will pass with the coming of a new generation.What is wrong with the presidency seems more closely connected to what is happening in the wider society: nothing less than a collapse of the political culture which affects the daily lives of ordinary people in ways that failures of the federal power structures rarely have.It is important to understand that throughout much of the country’s history, the complexion and competence of the government in Washington had relatively little bearing on the everyday quality of local American life. The quite explicit design of the Constitution guaranteeing states’ rights ensured this. It was the clear intention of the Founding Fathers to limit the central authority of Washington which was seen as a threat to the self-determination of citizens almost on a par with colonial rule. The explosive confrontations between federal and state authority over the abolition of slavery and, a century later, the enforcement of racial integration, were the most vivid examples of this but disputes over abortion and gun laws still revolve around that basic principle, built into the nation’s idea of itself, of state autonomy.Very rarely, in fact, has the quality and tenor of the presidency seemed so closely aligned with the state of the nation in ways which can be felt in the streets and the homes of real people. The demoralisation and paralysis in Washington plays out in everyday experience. There is endless news coverage of crime, racial violence and civil disorder on a scale that many Americans believed until quite recently was behind them, as well as the continued decline of what would once have been thriving industrial enterprise. But much more ubiquitous and bewildering is the sense that the idea of an American mission - the country’s original idea of itself - has disintegrated. The collapse of that self-belief, of the accepted understanding of what America was for, is stunning.But, you may ask, what is so different and dangerous about this? After all, identity crises of a similar kind have occurred in many countries - particularly former imperial powers which have had to come to terms with their role in a changed world order. There can be a temporary nervous breakdown and then a recovery which reframes a country’s goals. Why shouldn’t this formula which appeared to work in so many European countries apply in the United States with its famously enterprising and adaptable population? Because America is different. I would venture to say that it is much more different from any Old World society than most Europeans appreciate. In the sentimental twentieth century, there was understood to be an American Dream which animated the hopes and aspirations of those millions who arrived there in search of safety, freedom and economic opportunity. The real truth is that America itself was a dream: its national identity, and the patriotism which was a mandatory part of it, was a beautiful fiction created by a small group of people and sanctified by a handful of superb documents which enshrined the 18th century idea of liberty under the law.Most pertinently, this new entity was intended to bind all incomers from anywhere in the world into a cohesive society which was prepared to accommodate anyone who would sign up to the social contract that was on offer. (This is precisely how the Constitution is taught to American schoolchildren: as a contract between the government and the people.) This was an unprecedented political project. Not even the original French revolution which based itself on a similar Enlightenment foundation had done anything like this: attempted to invent an entirely new nation composed of disparate, displaced people which would somehow cohere into a proud unified sense of statehood and inidual belonging. And miraculously, for the longest time it worked. The patriotic rituals which most Europeans found faintly absurd, if not positively sinister, like the pledge of allegiance to the flag which began every school day, served their purpose. The children of immigrants, many of whom, like my grandparents, spoke only the language of the Old Country, went to school and learnt - like my father - to speak English. They became proud Americans who wanted more than anything to belong to this new thing that they felt a part of and were told that their commitment had helped to create.True, there was a constant tension between loyalty to the American national identity and the sense of one’s family roots. So there were communities of Italian-Americans and Polish-Americans and Irish-Americans (like Joe Biden) who never forgot where they came from even though anything that hinted at a lack of full-hearted commitment to America was a kind of blasphemy. But even that uneasy settlement is finished now. The contractual agreement that Americans were one people with one sense of purpose, has been smashed to pieces by wilful isiveness: identity politics which sees historic injustice as unforgivable and life choices as creating irreconcilable differences, have blown apart that fragile accord.The people who abandoned their inherited identities in order to take part in this extraordinary, brave project are now faced with the consequences of rootlessness. Without the resources that go with generations of life in a recognisable place they are lost. Maybe the great American experiment has finally failed.More from NewsUkrainian port city attacked by missiles, residents await evacuationBritain now has a moral duty to ditch the Northern Ireland ProtocolInside Prince Charles\u0026#39 country estate ahead of public openingThe West is beating Russia at its own gameHungary\u0026#39s Viktor Orban ‘will do a Trump’ if he loses electionHealth and social care levy is right thing to do, say Rishi Sunak and Sajid JavidMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"conversion therapy law must not rushed","story":"If the child asserted they were trans could the parents, counsellor or therapist, find themselves hauled through the courts if they asked questions, or prompted reflection over the time? How would the line be drawn in law between what was and was not acceptable? What safeguards were there to be to prevent the overzealous application of the law?These issues have not seemed of primary importance to LGBT lobby groups, but they add great complexity to declaring children ‘transgender’ in law.  This is why questions started to be raised as to how the legislation could be written to avoid criminalisation of parents or clinicians who encouraged a child to explore what else might be going on, given the possible medical consequences. This would be less of a concern in a world in which the lead LGBT organisation, Stonewall, had not aggressively pushed ‘no debate’ and to simplify a complex issue, including calling on the UN to deprive the UK’s Equality and Human Rights Commission of international standing for raising concerns regarding the legislation. Vagueness in law leaves ordinary people vulnerable in this environment. Unfortunately, despite the Government’s decision to work on these elements further, any bill banning conversion therapy for sexual orientation is bound to see poorly drafted amendments to insert gender identity tabled within weeks of introduction. Lobby groups will whip up a social media storm, portraying anyone that votes against the amendment as transphobic and MPs will have to decide whether they have the courage to intervene or whether to hope that it will all be okay.

I asked why they’re like that. “The movies”, was her response, a lifetime spent watching films like The Wolf of Wall Street and The Big Short.It rang true, a reminder of how incredibly powerful Hollywood is. Whole generations behave in certain ways because of films they watched growing up. Women imbibe many of their ideas about romance and love from Hollywood movies, and some men do too, and these end up impacting their entire lives.Given its power over us, it is unsettling to watch contemporary Hollywood succumb to odiousness and toxicity. Its crimes are manifold.The call was part of Disney’s chilling-sounding Reimagine Tomorrow campaign, in which executives vowed that by the end of this year 50 per cent of characters should be from “under-represented” groups (whatever that means, given that some of the groups they include - like trans people – represent a very small percentage of the world’s population).The enforcement of the doctrine doesn’t stop there: those visiting the Disney theme parks – probably the closest to pure heaven I got as a child – will no longer be addressed as “ladies and gentleman” and “boys and girls” but rather as “dreamers and friends”. “Princesses” is out too, of course. God forbid a child be addressed as either one sex or the other it might trigger them.Most infamously, its live action 2020 version of Mulan was filmed in Xinjiang, the province in which Uigyhers are being systematically killed in what is widely thought to be genocide. Yet the credits thanked eight government bodies in Xinjiang, including the security bureau in Turpan, and the “Publicity Department” of CPC (Communist Party of China) Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region Committee – the very people authorising some of the most egregious human rights abuses of the 21st century. Disney claimed it was not responsible for the credits, saying the decision was taken by local contractors. But it was hardly a good look.How can an industry as steeped in double standards as this make anything good, let alone great? In 2019, tree-hugging celebrities arrived by private jet and superyacht to attend a Google Camp focused on climate change. Hollywood ostracises those accused of racism, but in the film Mank it cast Gary Oldman, on record with an anti-Semitic rant in 2014 (he later apologised to offended Jewish people), as Herman Mankiewicz, the Jewish producer of Citizen Kane. And the anti-Semitic ranter in chief, Mel Gibson, is still merrily making films for giant studios.All this heavy-handed and hypocritical playing at identity politics at the cost of actual integrity is destroying Hollywood and setting the stage for worse and worse films coming downstream.In the wake of George Floyd’s death, the Academy, the outfit behind the Oscars, set out a bizarrely rigid set of rules, stipulating that minorities must win a higher percentage of Oscars, and that a certain number of behind-the-scenes production top jobs (director, cinematographer etc) must go to minorities. “Minorities” included LGBTQ people, disabled people, anyone from an ethnic minority and, weirdly, women. It seemingly has nothing to do with getting the best people and making the best films, and everything to do with the obsessive box-ticking that has become the contemptible hallmark of the identity politics age.Hollywood has always had its own ugly inner demons as well as showy outer morality. It introduced morality clauses in 1921, after Fatty Arbuckle was arrested on accusations of rape and murder, but rarely used them. It was racist. It was sexist, and these things appeared in its films.Yet its main business was still making great movies, and indulging wild and expensive bursts of creativity. It made the movies that shaped our whole perception of the world.I went to Dubai mid-March to investigate the newly confident Jewish community of the UAE, which has been emboldened by the seismic Abraham Accords of 2020 declaring normal relations with Israel. Although my reason for going was interesting, it was not a destination I boasted about to friends.In my circles – middle-class intellectuals, wannabe intellectuals and generally “cultured” folk – everyone scorns Dubai. It’s vulgar, it’s artificial, it lacks culture, history and what we consider beauty, and of course, it’s morally dubious, given that an Islamic sheikh decides what’s OK and what isn’t. Smooching in public can land you in prison homosexuality is illegal.As it turned out, I found it an interesting and valuable trip on two levels. One, the Jewish community was lively, interesting and happy. Two, it made me realise my friends and I are the odd ones out in scorning Dubai. The place may have dodgy morals and exude brashness, but it seems to delight the planeloads of people flooding in from all over. Families and people with lots of tattoos frolicked and drank by vast swimming pools in corporate-looking hotels – but seemed to be having a whale of a time, splashing their cash as they saw fit. On a “heritage” safari into the pristine desert, arranged for me by the Dubai Tourism Authority, I was annoyed at lots of waiting around, and horrified to be given Vimto to drink while watching a falconry display. I was the only one: everyone else was all smiles, laid back, enjoying themselves.More from NewsUkrainian port city attacked by missiles, residents await evacuationBritain now has a moral duty to ditch the Northern Ireland ProtocolInside Prince Charles\u0026#39 country estate ahead of public openingThe West is beating Russia at its own gameHungary\u0026#39s Viktor Orban ‘will do a Trump’ if he loses electionHealth and social care levy is right thing to do, say Rishi Sunak and Sajid JavidMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"macron losing le pen now real possibility","story":"How do you solve a problem like Marine? This is the question troubling Emmanuel Macron nine days before the French vote in the first round of the presidential election. In the last fortnight opinion polls have shown that Macron’s stock is falling and Le Pen’s rising.Such a scenario was inconceivable at the start of the year. The name on everyone’s lips then was Eric Zemmour, the right-wing polemicist, who announced his candidature with a promise to go after Islam and immigration. But Zemmour has peaked, his manifesto too narrow and too nasty, appealing in the main to right wing middle-class Catholics. Le Pen, on the other hand, is popular among the young and the working class, particularly blue-collar workers who in an earlier age would have voted for the left what we in Britain would call Red Wall voters. Economically, Le Pen has always leaned to the left, and in recent years she’s softened her stance on many social issues.In a debate last year with Macron’s Interior Minister, Gérald Darmanin, she was mocked for being ‘soft’ on Islam. Unlike Zemmour – and it would seem Darmanin – Le Pen has no grudge with Islam, only with Islamic extremists. And herein lies the problem for president Macron: how can he describe Le Pen’s National Rally party as extreme right when his own Interior Minister ridiculed her on live television for being soft on Islam? The fact is that Macron has at times during his presidency acted in such a heavy-handed and authoritarian way that great swathes of the public won’t fall for his alarmist rhetoric about the advance of the “far right”. This, after all, is a president whose police force inflicted scores of terrible injuries on demonstrators during the Yellow Vest protests of 201819, injuries that were condemned by the UN, the European Parliament and human rights organisations. This is a president who subjected his country to probably the most stringent lockdown measures of any western nation, and then sneered that his objective in introducing a Covid Passport was to “piss off” the unvaccinated or those unwilling to have a third jab.During a television debate on Thursday evening Le Pen referenced the Covid Passport, expressing her disapproval of the draconian measure and portraying herself as the champion of the nation’s liberté. Le Pen looked confident as she fielded questions from journalists and members of the public. She believes the force is with her.Inflation, crime and energy prices are all on the rise in France, and so are the number of Covid cases. It was only a month ago that Macron told his people he had won his war on the virus and consequently masks and Covid Passports were no longer necessary. He dare not reimpose either before the election because he knows what his political adversaries would say: voila, yet more proof that this is a president who fails on all fronts.Instead Macron’s strategy in the final week of campaigning is negativity, to resort to the tried and trusted, to go on the attack against the “extreme right”. In the past it’s worked, but it is unlikely to work this time in the event of a second round head to head between Macron and Le Pen. Macron is loathed by millions on the left and they will not heed his call to lend him their vote to keep out Le Pen.Just as Britain’s Red Wall collapsed in 2019, in 2022 it could be the turn of France’s Republican Front to disintegrate and when the dust settles France could have its first female president.More from NewsUkrainian port city attacked by missiles, residents await evacuationBritain now has a moral duty to ditch the Northern Ireland ProtocolInside Prince Charles\u0026#39 country estate ahead of public openingThe West is beating Russia at its own gameHungary\u0026#39s Viktor Orban ‘will do a Trump’ if he loses electionHealth and social care levy is right thing to do, say Rishi Sunak and Sajid JavidMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"mi6 officer sent get kim philby confession vulnerable blackmail","story":"The MI6 officer sent to extract a confession from double agent Kim Philby was himself compromised and vulnerable to Russian blackmail, it has emerged.When Philby was finally unmasked as a Soviet mole in 1962, intelligence chiefs in London despatched his close friend and drinking partner Nicholas Elliott to Beirut to confront him.What happened next remains mired in uncertainty and recrimination, with MI6 refusing to reveal details even 60 years later.Although Philby, who had signed up to the Soviet cause in 1934, admitted to passing secrets to his Russian handlers, he fled to Moscow shortly after, without revealing the names of fellow communist sympathisers in the West or any other significant information.The scandal at the height of the Cold War was a humiliation for Britain and soured intelligence sharing with the US for years.Now, a updated book reveals further crucial vulnerabilities at the top of MI6 and the “chaps” culture at the heart of it.It details how Elliott had a decade-long extra-marital affair with a Swedish woman, which ended some months before Philby disappeared.The existence of such a personal guilty secret would have left him vulnerable to Russian blackmail, according to James Hanning, author of Love and Deception, Philby in Beirut.Moreover, he believes that due to their close friendship, it was likely that Philby would have known about the affair, and therefore that his Russian masters would have done too.“The facts are still a bit foggy, but it looks like a major lapse of Elliott’s invulnerability to blackmail,” said Mr Hanning.“I can’t see how Philby would not have known about it. They were very close.“They did a huge amount of naughty stuff together, in Beirut and elsewhere. They were drinking buddies, they loved talking about the cricket scores and they shared a schoolboy sense of humour.“That being the case, and knowing where his sympathies ultimately lay, I’d be surprised if the Russians didn’t know as well.”Tipped at one stage to become head of the service, Elliott’s MI6 career never achieved its expected heights following the Philby affair.He also missed out on the knighthood that would normally have been considered a right of passage for someone of his seniority.Mr Hanning believes it unlikely that MI6 knew about the affair at the time of Philby’s unmasking or they would not have entrusted Elliott with the mission to Beirut.After getting wind of the affair during his research into Philby’s time in Lebanon, he subsequently confirmed it with Elliott’s son Mark.Elliott’s devoted wife, Elizabeth, discovered the infidelity when she came across a letter from the Swedish woman.“The feelings of his Catholic wife, a dutiful, loyal and widely respected figure, can only be guessed at,” said Mr Hanning.“This was the era of John Vassall, blackmailed by the Russians over his homosexuality and subsequently gaoled, and of John Profumo, who resigned as a minister after lying over his relationship with a woman having an affair with a Soviet official.“In some circumstances, Elliott’s lapse – if something that lasted over a decade can be so described - would have meant the end of his career, or the end of his time at the sharp end of the espionage business.“At the very least, it is an unflattering glimpse of the boys’ world of two generations ago where the chaps play around and keep the women in the dark as far as possible.”Although Philby could theoretically have used his knowledge of Elliott’s affair against him during that crucial meeting in Beirut, Mr Hanning does not believe it explains how Britain’s most notorious traitor of the Cold War managed to escape to the USSR.“I believe it was cock-up, rather than conspiracy,” he said.He explained that although some historians believe Elliott actively encouraged Philby to flee to Moscow to lessen the embarrassment to MI6 of seeing him put on trial in Britain, their failure to interrogate him properly is more likely explained by oversight and indecision.Moreover, such was the power of the old school tie and the gentlemen\u0027s club that even after Philby’s confession, Elliott may not have believed his true loyalty lay in Moscow, he said.Love and Deception, Philly in Beirut is out in paperback this week.More from NewsUkrainian port city attacked by missiles, residents await evacuationBritain now has a moral duty to ditch the Northern Ireland ProtocolInside Prince Charles\u0026#39 country estate ahead of public openingThe West is beating Russia at its own gameHungary\u0026#39s Viktor Orban ‘will do a Trump’ if he loses electionHealth and social care levy is right thing to do, say Rishi Sunak and Sajid JavidMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather temperatures plummet 6c britain braces wintry weather","story":"The UK is braced for further wintry weather over the weekend, with frost creeping in overnight and temperatures set to plummet as low as -6C in some areas.Forecasters said the peaks and troughs of spring will hit most of the country over the next week, with sunny spells and windy intervals expected in most regions.Gardeners have been warned to keep an eye on their blooms as sub-zero temperatures expected on Saturday night could disrupt flowering.Simon Partridge, the Met Office meteorologist, said lows of -6C were likely in northern regions on Saturday night, before a slightly milder turn on Sunday.Tonight will be cold, with widespread frost across the UK.

A small group of men trooped solemnly across a leafy cemetery in central Moscow. The priest in flowing black robes was Archimandrite (Abbot) Tikhon Shevkunov of the Sretensky Monastery. Obligingly, he held a black umbrella over his honoured guest, President Vladimir Putin.Much of the graveyard was filled with victims of the Soviet secret police, the Cheka, but it was not they he had come to see. The president was there to pay his respects to a philosopher called Ivan Ilyin, whose body had on his orders been dug up in Switzerland four years before and flown 1,400 miles to be reinterred in Moscow. He laid a bouquet of red roses before the black granite headstone and stood with Tikhon a short time, regarding the grave. Then he left.This week, across Russia, devastated families also gathered to honour the dead. They were burying young men killed fighting for Moscow in Ukraine. At one funeral witnessed by The Moscow Times, the priest spoke of the deceased, a lad in his 20s: “He fought against evil, Satanic spirits: Ukrainian Nazis, created by American multinational corporations.”The young man in the coffin was separated by 80 years from the remains of Ilyin in that Moscow cemetery, but according to the Kremlin’s increasingly strident ideological creed, the dead shared one important feature: they were part of the same God-given mission to gather up the scattered lands of mother Russia and rebuild its Christian empire.Putin doesn’t strike most of us as the pious type. He wears a £10,500 coat, reportedly owns a £500 million superyacht and is known the world over for vaguely homoerotic, topless photoshoots. He is brutal to the point of being labelled a madman or a psychopath. He spent the first 16 years of his career fulfilling a childhood ambition to work for the KGB, the secret police of a regime that persecuted Christians and preached atheism. And he is, in the words of various Western leaders and scholars, a “war criminal”.Yet somehow, this billionaire Soviet gangster has become a leader beloved by the Russian Orthodox Church, held up as an ideal by a messianic, neo-fascist movement called Eurasianism and presented by his propaganda machine as the man who will establish the Third Rome of Christendom in Russia.Western analysis, trapped in its own worldview, has tended to focus on arguments about Nato, the EU, resources or spheres of influence in the search for Putin’s rationale. But this misses that the war in Ukraine is a conflict with an overwhelmingly religious and cultural dimension, in which the Ukrainian government is cast as a malignant tool of Satanic and degenerate Western forces. The Russian takeover of this land was to be the start of a great revival of the ancient Russian civilisation, welcomed by its virtuous Slavic inhabitants, and signal a precipitous decline for the decadent, doomed West.Somehow, while most of the West wasn’t paying attention, Russia’s nostalgia for Soviet greatness merged into a longing for the imperial father-king, the tsar, and Putin duly transformed himself from a ruthless but boring state functionary into a modern approximation of the old autocrat: an infallible messenger of God in Aviators. But how did this happen, how did it help to justify a bloody invasion of Ukraine and what will happen now that the venture has stalled and Russia is teetering on the cusp of bankruptcy?Growing up poor in a dingy Leningrad tower block, Putin spent his youth chasing rats around the stairwell and dreaming of a future as a KGB strongman. He joined the secret police straight out of university, but it was not exactly a 007 existence. His first posting was in Dresden, a relative backwater in Soviet East Germany.Accounts differ as to what exactly he was doing there – grooming agents to smuggle Western technology, fostering the growth of anti-Western terrorists or more humdrum work. Whatever Putin was up to, it gave him a front row seat on the collapse of the Soviet Union. After witnessing the crumpling of East Germany’s Soviet government, he returned to St Petersburg (then Leningrad) to see the Soviet motherland succumb to the same disease.When and how he left the KGB has never been entirely clear, but Putin quickly made himself indispensable to a wide array of politicians and officials. He moved from a job working for Anatoly Sobchak, the St Petersburg deputy mayor seen at the time as a pro-democracy liberal, to a role at the Kremlin, where he won President Boris Yeltsin’s favour through mastery of his brief and zealous loyalty.But when Yeltsin passed on the reins in 2000, he handed over a country that had just been through a calamitous economic depression, during which its economy halved in size, inflation took off, the ruble was devalued and the state went bankrupt. This was to be the experience that many Russians now associate with their brief period of “democracy”.Still, Putin quickly disappointed his authoritarian fans by adopting a firmly pro-Western stance, in particular supporting the US invasion of Afghanistan after 911. Russia’s economy, buoyed by a rising oil price, recovered, and US president George W Bush declared that he had peered into Putin’s “soul” and seen a good man.Even back then, Father Tikhon was no ordinary, run-of-the-mill Orthodox priest. Rumoured to be the man who brought Putin to Christianity and hears his confessions, he was also a rising star of a new generation of conservative imperialists in the Church, who openly advocate a return to Russia’s monarchist days. “He’s a very conservative cleric with an imperial mindset,” says Lukin.One way of forgetting is to reach back beyond the Soviet era to a much older period of history. In that vein, in 2008 Father Tikhon released a documentary on the collapse of the Byzantine Empire, called The Lesson of Byzantium. The film purports to be a straightforward history of the empire, although in interviews Tikhon admitted that it is also “propaganda” aimed at giving Russians a place in history and a spiritual mission.The 70-minute film argues that Byzantium collapsed primarily because it failed to stay true to the Orthodox faith and abandoned a highly centralised model of imperial control that stamped out nationalist separatism. Instead it succumbed to the oligarchy, Italian finance and corrupting Western notions about the primacy of the inidual over the collective.Still, the empire did pass on an invaluable treasure to the Russian people: their Orthodox Christianity. “It was upon this treasure our forebears founded not banks… or pawnshops,” Tikhon preaches. “They founded Rus, the spiritual successor of Byzantium.” The “forebear” to whom he refers is, in fact, Prince Volodymyr (or Vladimir) of Kiev, a Viking ruler of a region encompassing much of modern Ukraine, who was baptised by Byzantine priests in the 10th century. Ukraine, in this reading, is simply relabelled as ancient Russia.Despite its obscure subject, Tikhon’s film was a runaway success, reportedly sparking more than 500 articles, many hours of radio and TV coverage as well as conferences and speeches. Fans of the film declared that Moscow must rediscover an ancient tsarist tradition of seeing itself as the Third Rome of Christendom.By 2013, the year before his invasion of Crimea, Putin himself took part in a state-produced follow-up film called The Second Christianisation of Rus, which positioned Russia’s post-Soviet surge of interest in Christianity as a second iteration of Volodymyr’s original conversion to Eastern Orthodoxy. The next year, in the midst of Russia’s annexation of Crimea, state TV aired a reading of an essay by Fyodor Dostoevsky chastising Slavic tribes who were ungrateful to mother Russia. In addition to being a brilliant novelist, Dostoevsky was also a committed monarchist who believed that Russia would one day reconquer the Byzantine capital Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul).In truth, according to Peter Eltsov, a professor of security studies at the US National Defence University, this obsession with Byzantium was hardly an ancient tradition: “It’s a 19th century invention.” The idea of Russia’s spiritual Byzantine roots took off in this period as an explicit bulwark against the break-up of empire, just as the notion of national identity was taking hold in Europe. As the anti-Western, monarchist philosopher Konstantin Leontiev argued: “Whether we like this Byzantine foundation or not, whether it is good or bad, it is the only secure anchor not only of Russian but of all-Slavic preservation.”In both Putin’s 2021 essay and 2022 presidential address on the invasion of Ukraine, there are clear echoes of the same strategy, appealing to an ancient religious bond between the peoples of Russia and Ukraine as a justification for war: “Ukraine is not just a neighbouring country for us. It is an inalienable part of our own history, culture and spiritual space,” Putin wrote in 2021. “Since time immemorial, the people living in the south west of what has historically been Russian land have called themselves Russians and Orthodox Christians.”The Eastern Orthodox Church, in other words, is a way to stitch the Russian Empire together.The heritage of Byzantium Rus was not the only idea to emerge in the dying days of the tsarist era with the aim of countering the appeal of the Western nation-state. Alongside a soup of conservative, religious and exceptionalist ideas of Russia, a new breed of Russian fascism was being developed. And that is where we return to our disinterred friend, Ivan Ilyin.Ilyin was a conservative philosopher exiled from communist Russia for his opposition to the Bolsheviks. He washed up in Berlin just as the new ideology of fascism was taking off in Italy and Germany. Ilyin saw in Mussolini and Hitler models for the reinvention of a new Russian tsarism, in which a strong leader could abolish the iniduality of his people and bind them into one spiritual, collective whole, free of corruption and impurities.Putin is clearly no philosopher, but of all the intellectuals in Russian history, it is Ilyin whom he quotes the most. According to the Yale historian Timothy Snyder, just as troops were being readied to invade Crimea in 2014, the Kremlin arranged for all of Russia’s senior officials and regional governors to be sent a copy of Ilyin’s Our Tasks, in which the philosopher predicts the emergence of a “national dictator” who will be “the living organ of Russia”.Today, the task of popularising this sort of messianic fascism falls to a movement called Eurasianism, propounded by a zealous supporter of Putin named Aleksandr Dugin, who appears with regularity on Russian TV screens. Russia must rediscover itself as a Eurasian civilisation, according to Dugin, which means that it must impose upon the continent a new political model that is collectivist, religious and autocratic. For this task, he maintains, conquest of the old Russian Empire is essential.Like Ilyin, Dugin casts this battle in apocalyptic and moral terms. He claims that it falls to Russia to save the world from Western degeneracy and nihilism, evidenced by phenomena like gay marriage and the transgender debate. In this, Dugin is at one with the Russian Orthodox Church.On March 6, 10 days after the invasion had begun, Patriarch Kirill gave a sermon calling the war “a metaphysical struggle”. It was essential for Russia to intervene, he said, to combat the “so-called values” offered by the West, in which “you have to have a Gay Pride parade” to be a member of the club.Putin, in his presidential address on the eve of the war, likewise blamed the West for trying “to destroy our traditional values” and replace them with “attitudes that are directly leading to degradation and degeneration, because they are contrary to human nature”.But the hostility to Gay Pride is not just ideological. The opposition to anything seen to undermine the family, like feminism or homosexuality, is mixed up with a more worldly anxiety that Professor Eltsov believes is driving the war: demographic change.Like much of Europe, Russia is undergoing a significant demographic shift. Its Muslim population is having more babies than its Christian population and, by some projections, Russia could become a majority-Muslim country in the foreseeable future. By taking over Ukraine, using largely ethnic minority, non-Christian conscripts as cannon fodder, Eltsov says “the idea was to get a bunch – 40 million people – who are Slavs and Europeans”.In his 2008 film on Byzantium, Tikhon had explicitly linked the failure to have children and the rise of abortion to the empire’s spiritual decline and “demographic problem”. The obvious result, he noted, while showing footage of a modern Istanbul student smoking a cigarette, was that the city succumbed to Sulton Mehmed, a homosexual 21-year-old, who, in his telling, demanded the 14-year-old son of its governor as a lover immediately after his conquest.Aside from demography, the Church’s anxiety has been exacerbated further in recent years by a direct threat to its authority: a schism.In 2018, the chief patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church, Bartholomew I of Constantinople, decided to recognise a new, independent Ukrainian Orthodox Church. At a stroke, Ukrainian Christians were taken out from under Russian religious authority, changing an arrangement that had existed for centuries. Patriarch Kirill immediately cut all ties with Constantinople – the very seat of Byzantine Christianity from which Russia supposedly derives its entire spiritual heritage.In a letter written to fellow Orthodox churches in mid-March this year, Kirill blamed the West for the war and emphasised that “the peoples of Russia and Ukraine, who came from one Kievan baptismal font, are united by common faith, common saints and prayers, and share common historical fate”. Kirill and his fellow clerics believed that the Ukrainian government had deliberately engineered the schism, and began to push for measures to undo this calamity with increasing urgency.The Church was not the only authority feeling threatened by developments outside Russia. Putin himself moved further and further away from the liberal values he had talked about in the 1990s in response to a series of challenges. At first, he cracked down on Russia’s oligarch-owned media to avoid criticism of his mistakes, like his poor handling of the 2001 sinking of the Kursk submarine, in which 118 crewmen died, and the security services’ mismanagement of a 2002 terrorist siege in a Moscow theatre, which resulted in 170 people dying.After that, the Arab Spring and the colour revolutions spreading across Eastern Europe unsettled the aspiring dictator. Faced with the need to legitimise his rule and consolidate power, he turned to the Church and the useful hodgepodge of imperialist, autocratic ideas floating around Russian military and intellectual circles. It wasn’t long before his regime was televising footage of priests sprinkling holy water over missiles bound for Syria.Unfortunately, he appears to have spent too much time drinking his own Kool-Aid. He convinced himself that the story told about the ancient, spiritual union of the Russian and Ukrainian peoples was true. If Russia were bold enough to regather the land, the lost Russians of Kiev would soon come flocking back to the bosom of the motherland.Still, there is not yet a general sense in Russia that the war and its consequences threaten Putin’s grip on the country. Sergey Utkin, a scholar of international relations at the Russian Academy of Sciences, is one of the few Russian academics brave enough openly to state his opposition to the war. But he does not believe speaking out will change anything. Hostility to the West is too deeply embedded to dissipate and ordinary Russians will simply blame Nato for the impact of sanctions, he believes. “What’s happening is catastrophic for Russia. It’s not opposition to what’s happening, but the nature of what’s happening that will reveal it was a terrible idea,” he says.Nor are Western ideas likely to make inroads. Utkin used to call himself a liberal, but he has found “realist” models of international relations, like Samuel Huntingdon’s Clash of Civilisations, better predict the course of events. Similarly, Lukin says he is disillusioned by Western hypocrisy over Iraq and its mismanagement of Covid: “I used to be a pro-western guy but now I am very disappointed with the West… I’m thinking more and more about the China model as most suitable.”Over in the US, however, Eltsov, a native Russian who grew up in Leningrad, sees the war as a pivotal turning point not just for Putin, but for Russia as we know it. His 2019 book, The Long Telegram 2.0, argues that for all of the weird and wonderful dogmas promoted by the Kremlin, from Byzantium Rus to Eurasian fascism, at the base of it all is “absolute cynicism”. There is no truly unified Russian identity that could be held together by these ideas if the region weren’t ruled by a brutal autocrat, he argues, and sooner or later – sooner, given the impact of sanctions – he thinks Russia is likely to break up.The prospect is surely stomach-churning, I suggest, given that Moscow controls the world’s second-biggest arsenal of nukes in the world. But Eltsov points out that a similar problem was resolved after the break-up of the Soviet Union. “It’s solvable,” he says, “but it’s frightening.” The future, he believes, lies not with Putin’s new Holy Russian Empire, but with the fragmentation of Eurasia. “Russia is over,” he says. “It’s the beginning of the end.”More from NewsUkrainian port city attacked by missiles, residents await evacuationBritain now has a moral duty to ditch the Northern Ireland ProtocolInside Prince Charles\u0026#39 country estate ahead of public openingThe West is beating Russia at its own gameHungary\u0026#39s Viktor Orban ‘will do a Trump’ if he loses electionHealth and social care levy is right thing to do, say Rishi Sunak and Sajid JavidMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"would pass bbcs class test","story":"Here’s a question: what did your father (or, in some cases, your mother) do for a living when you were 14? Your answer could determine your chances of getting a job at the BBC, which has announced that by 2027, it wants a quarter of its staff to be from a working-class background – defined by the Social Mobility Commission as “the main parental earner” having a “low socio-economic or working-class occupation”.Besides the substance of the BBC\u0027s pledge, its real problem is one of definition. It is much easier to categorise a person’s race, sex or disability than it is their class. Would you call Sir Keir Starmer working-class? His father was a toolmaker, so by the BBC’s standards he would count. But he went to a grammar school, was classmates with future Tory peer Andrew Cooper, and was a QC and Director of Public Prosecutions before becoming an MP and Labour leader. I wouldn’t have made it to the BBC thanks to my father’s City job, but plenty of his colleagues, especially those who worked on what was still then an open outcry trading floor at the Stock Exchange, were East End and Essex boys from working-class roots.Class is our national obsession, with thousands of microsignifiers.  Names, accents, vocabulary, education, address, clothing, political affiliation… all these and more help us pigeonhole others, often without even being consciously aware that we are doing so. Do you shower before or after work? Do you have your dinner in the middle or at the end of the day? Do you say “lavatory‘toilet” or “loo”, “serviette” or “napkin”, “settee” or “sofa”?But the sands of these definitions are not immutable. Although the tripartite (upper, middle and lower class) ision of the famous 1966 Frost Report sketch is still conversational shorthand, it feels too simplistic now. A 2013 BBC survey identified no less than seven social classes: the elite, established middle class, technical middle class, new affluent workers, traditional working class, emergent service workers and precarious proletariat.Two generations ago, private education was something which solid middle-class families could afford: now they have been largely priced out. Signet rings have expanded from posh to middle- and working-class, too tattoos have gone the other way. Good luck finding a Conservative voter in a multi-million-pound Islington townhouse, but you will come across few fiercer Tories than in working-class Kent and Essex. For every class signifier, there is not just an exception, but an equal and opposite. The true sign of class, of course, is to treat everyone you meet just the same.When I was 14, my father was unemployed, so I guess we were part of the non-working class.He left school without qualifications and became an engineer, one of the Stakhanovite shock troops of BT (in work at 10am, home by 4pm). After privatisation, he got a company car, which was a mixed blessing. The vehicle had Cable and Wireless blazoned across both sides, making us look like a mobile billboard.Mum came from a family of bohemians who had refused to work on principle (she also left school early, to tour the Caribbean and Australia). She married my father, I think, because he looked exotically ordinary. They scrimped and saved until they could afford a nice house in West Kent, and I was the great hope for class mobility.Dad got the boot shortly after I joined the local grammar, and mum took several jobs to keep the mortgage going. My weekends were spent delivering leaflets and newspapers.My father had what I guess would be diagnosed nowadays as a nervous breakdown. He got another job within a couple of years but never recovered his self-confidence. Poverty is humiliating. The school organised a two-day activity celebrating the EU (this was John Major’s Britain). They demanded we all contribute ten quid and I didn’t want to ask my parents for it. So, when a teacher demanded payment, I told her I thought the EU was rubbish and I was withholding our money in protest. From little acorns, Brexit grew.We were not working-class, we were lower-middle-class, which the BBC wouldn’t begin to understand: people who are doing OK but are within one sacking or sickness of losing it all.As laughable as it may sound coming from a Daily  journalist living in north London, I still consider myself to be working class. I’m not any more, obviously, but it’s all about your roots, innit?I was brought up in a two-up, two-down in the North East. Dad was a fireman, my step-dad worked in a factory and my mother (or Mam as we say up our way) was a waitress. I went to a comprehensive school and was the first in my family to go to university.So technically, I’ve got all the badges needed to qualify for the BBC’s new recruitment policy.My children wouldn’t get a look-in though. They will have to fight it out with all the other middle-class kids in the ever shrinking pool of graduate schemes for non-quota jobs.Even in 2022, class remains the one characteristic that too often defines a person’s life chances in this country. Social mobility is stalling and the cost-of-living crisis is only going to make things worse.White working-class children persistently underachieve at school and the albatross of tuition fees means even fewer aspire to university. But what they lack in opportunity they often make up for in spark, determination and drive.Schemes like this are not only a good idea, they are vital if we are to tackle one of the most lingering inequalities left in modern Britain.So bravo BBC for lowering the ladder a little and recognising that true ersity is about more than just protected characteristics.Aged 14 I was smacked in the face by a girl in the PE changing room. She had called me posh. My retort: “How can I be posh if I have to go to school with people like you?” Mean, yes, but she had just set fire to another girl’s hair.Class, I learnt, is in the eye of the beholder.Whenever I asked Mum (the Leonard in my name) what class we were, she would say “professional working class”.At weekends my dad would don oily overalls and fix whatever was ailing the family car. The neighbours in our leafy Stockport suburb assumed he was a mechanic. Had that been the whole truth, then I would have met the BBC’s definition of working class.Dad (the Fox) was the son of a lorry driver, he left school in north London without any qualifications to become an apprentice toolmaker on the Caledonian Road.Yet he dreamt of something bigger. Night school, followed by the University of Manchester as a mature student, and he eventually became a chartered engineer.Mum’s cursus honorum reads: council house, grammar school, mature graduate, Civil Service and then teaching.I’m middle class today because grants meant my working-class parents could become graduates.But no one ever expects to find Boudicca Fox-Leonard with a distinct northern twang.Yes, I went to state school, but my home life was culturally rich, if not always financially. There were books and conversation, but no TV (or licence). It was an eccentric upbringing that defied class categorisation. And that, I’ve learnt, frustrates the type of people who work for the BBC.Let’s indulge the BBC’s tick-box exercise just this once. At 14 I was splitting my time between learning and caring for my single mother, a political refugee suffering the consequences of having been a journalist in a dictatorial country. I was on free school meals out of necessity. I lived in one of the poorest council wards in London – and still do. I knew boys who were stabbed to death.Our household income, excluding benefits, was approximately zero. Yes, I am working class.But telling this story is not how I got my job in the media. I got that by starting a political blog aged 16 which went viral, graduating twice before 22 and breaking stories as a freelancer. It is a testament to social mobility and equality of opportunity in this country that I was able to do all these things without the patronising discrimination of a quota scheme.Some ersity programmes are designed in good faith, but all ultimately negate a person’s innate abilities and leave a cloud marked “positive discrimination” over the heads of every professional from a working class background. Is that not the opposite of equality?If the problem is that BBC recruiters cannot be trusted not to judge on the basis of accent or skin colour, then the answer is to introduce more meritocracy, not less.

Brits are being clobbered by the biggest rise in household energy bills in living memory with a % hike to the energy price cap from April . Households on default tarfs who pay by direct debit will see an eye-watering £ annual rise to their bills, from £, to £,. There will be an even bigger jump for prepayment customers of £, from £, to £,. The Chancellor unveiled a package of help for families, including a £ council tax rebate in April and a £ energy bill discount in the autumn, which will be clawed back in instalments over  years from .But the measures were slammed at the time for being too stingy. MPs have raised alarm that people could miss out on council tax rebate or see payments delayed due to loopholes in the system.In a letter to Cabinet Minister Michael Gove this week, Levelling Up Committee chairman Clive Betts said: The Government needs to get a grip on the operation of the council tax rebate and give clear guidance to councils so that this rebate is delivered to households reliably and effectively.If the Chancellor is minded to bring forward additional support to households through the council tax system later in the year then it is even more crucial that every effort is made to create a process that works now. How does it work  People living in homes in council tax bands A to D in England will be eligible for the £ payment. It must be your sole or main home to qualy, so second homes and empty properties are not eligible.  Local authorities will deliver the rebate, with eligibility determined on your situation on April  .You can check which council tax band your home is in on the government website. Councils have also been given a £ million discretionary fund to use in areas of high deprivation or for people outside the eligibility criteria. . People need to be signed up to direct debit Payments will be made automatically to people who pay their council tax by direct debit, meaning local authorities already have their bank details. Councils have been told to contact people who do not pay their bills this way to make sure they donapost miss out.

The Levelling Up Committee has been pressing ministers for estimates of how many households are in this category. Figures sourced by the Local Democracy Reporting Service last month found that , households in County Durham and Northumberland did not pay council tax by direct debit. The overall figure is expected to be much higher. The Government has ordered local authorities to ensure people get their rebate by September   - months after it was initially supposed to be received. . People should have a current account Another concern is people who donapost have a current account, which has been estimated to be around ,. The Government states where the recipient has no bank account, for example Post Office Payout vouchers. But the committee said it wasnapost clear how this would work and asked whether councils could hand out cash payments.  .

Older people often live in homes that are dficult and expensive to heat, leaving them at greater risk of developing health complications because of the cold..

The Government introduced tough tarfs on Russian products on March , hitting them with “an additional tarf increase of  percentage points, over and above any existing tarf rate under the terms of the move”. But legally they can still be brought to these shores. UK companies have also bought , tonnes of “rebar” from Putin’s closest ally and neighbour, Belarus. However, it is unclear which firms are buying the Russian and Belarusian products - and potentially helping prop up the Moscow and Minsk regimes by pumping cash into their economies. Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletter One furious UK steel executive told the Mirror: “Proper transparency of origin is essential. “All buyers should check where their materials are coming from and be happy with the complete supply chain they are using.” They added: “I assume that the importers are not exactly shouting from the rooftops about the origin of the steel they may be using. “I also wonder whether construction companies or end users are actually aware of the provenance of the materials. “I assume that nobody would really want to be knowingly using material from either of these sources in their projects.” Labour MP Stephen Kinnock, who chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Steel, called for UK firms to snub steel from the two countries. Mr Kinnock, whose South Wales constituency includes Britainaposs biggest steelworks, Port Talbot, said: “The Government must immediately call on British companies to boycott Russian and Belorussian steel. “British companies should always seek to buy British steel as a matter of course, to support local communities and to help meet environmental targets. “But choosing to buy specically from Russia and Belarus is a gt to Vladimir Putin at a time when we should be seeking to freeze the country out of the world economy.“Worse still, it is an insult to the thousands of brave Ukrainians who have lost their lives in Putin’s barbaric war.” Community steelworkers’ union general secretary Roy Rickhuss said: “The scenes from Kyiv, Kharkiv, Mariupol and across Ukraine remain horrying, and we need to ask ourselves how does the UK respond as a country  “Sanctions are an important tool in the resistance of Russian aggression, and the UK steel industry is more than prepared to manufacture steel domestically.  “Not only should we not be importing steel from Russia or Belarus, this further demonstrates the case that we should maintain our ability to manufacture all grades of steel in the UK.” A Government spokeswoman said: “The UK has taken swt action, including an unprecedented package of diplomatic and economic sanctions, to punish Putin for his barbaric actions in Ukraine.  “This includes introducing a % additional duty on top of existing tarf measures for ious goods from Russia and Belarus, including steel. “This will further isolate the Russian economy from global trade, and ensure it does not benefit from the rules-based international system it does not respect.” The Mirror has been campaigning to Save Our Steel since the industry was rocked by plant closures and thousands of job losses in .

On Thursday all of us spent the day desperately reading gas and electric meters, photographing them from seven angles and spent two hours trying to send the numbers to a crashed website, while we screamed and family members muttered “take six deep breaths and try again” because the next day the price was going up by two million per cent. Thanks to this sense of fun from companies such as EDF and E.On, from now on we can play this jolly game every year. It can become like searching for Easter eggs, and we’ll all laugh about the time Grandma didn’t quite get her reading in on time, bless her, so she spent the next month living in the sideboard clutching guinea pigs inside her nightie to keep warm.  In a few years, it will be a festival, like Halloween. Each March  one person will dress up as the EDF man and ­children will scream “aaaaagh don’t take our heating away”. People will run from house to house looking into cupboards with a torch, then we’ll all eat raw pizzas that we cannot afford to cook to celebrate ­Meter-reading Day. This has happened becausewe don’t have an exact reading from the moment the price goes up, the energy companies can charge us for everything at a higher rate. They’ve been given a licence to do whatever they fancy. Next week it will be announced: “Due to rocketing fuel prices, energy companies can marry one person from every household” and it will be considered a great honour to hand your sister over to Scottish Power.  The Government gives advice on how to “shop around” for cheaper tarfs, as it’s our responsibility to see which of the big six suppliers are slightly less impossibly expensive than the others. It’s like the police saying: “There have been a lot of robberies in this area lately, so we’ve decided to crack down. We’ve set up an app, so you can contact all the muggers in the area and arrange which one you would like to hold you at knepoint and run off with your bank card.” Because it’s all down to you. This is why you’ll find Government websites that give advice such as: “Save money on boiling water by filling a pan, and taking it to your local crematorium to pop it on the furnace during a funeral, so you enjoy a well-earned brew.”  The only people who aren’t told by the Government how to reduce energy costs are the energy companies who set the costs. I suppose there’s no point in ordering them about as they’re completely helpless. Since  they’ve paid £billion to their shareholders, but there’s nothing they can do to stop that. Their prices and profits just keep shooting up until eventually they’ll own the universe, and creatures from other galaxies will wonder why they have a bill for £ from British Gas. So all we can do is huddle around a candle with a raw fish finger to celebrate.

MPs will arrange a date for a Westminster showdown on outlawing “Stone Age” devices that can wound and kill cats and dogs. TV presenter and campaigner Chris Packham backed calls for snares to be made illegal. He told the Mirror: “These Stone Age contraptions really have no place in today’s Britain.

A petition urging the Government to “prohibit the sale, use and manufacture of free-running snares” has attracted more than , signatures. The demand warns that “people setting free-running snares cannot ensure animal welfare as required” and that snares “cause unnecessary suffering to mammals, are indiscriminate and should be banned”. Downton Abbey actor and wildle activist Peter Egan said it was “bewildering to think that there are people who would oppose a ban on snares”.  He added: “They are such cruel and unpleasant contraptions. “For a country that claims to protect wildle, it is bizarre that they’re still in use at all – they cause the most tremendous and unnecessary suffering.” Green MP Caroline Lucas said: “It’s shameful that in  we’re still catching, injuring and killing animals in the most inhumane and indiscriminate way. “Parliament supported calls for a ban on snares as long as six years ago, and yet we’ve seen no concrete action.  “The Government must urgently bring an end to this horric practice by outlawing the sale, possession and use of snares immediately.” Paying tribute to the National Anti-Snaring Campaign and Hunt Investigation Team’s work on fighting for a ban, Animal Aid director Iain Green said: “We’re delighted that more than , people have signed our government petition to ban snares. “Clearly, the public want to see an end to these hideously-cruel, archaic, torture devices that trap, maim and kill millions of animals, and we will now take the campaign to ban snares to Parliament. “No animal deserves to be trapped by a wire noose and we are sure that, judging by the strength of public opinion on this matter, we will get a ban on snares.” Responding to the petition, the Government said it “recognises that some people consider snares to be an inhumane and unnecessary means of trapping wild animals and will launch a call for evidence on the use of snares”.

The junk, some of which is being burned, was bought through a government High Priority Lane for PPE buying set up by Boris Johnson at the start of the pandemic.It let Tory MPs and top civil servants recommend companies to supply PPE.  Michael Gove, shamed ex-Health Secretary Matt Hancock and former minister Esther McVey were the biggest names among  Tories who brought contracts in – but they are not accused of any wrongdoing. The true depth of the scandal emerged after Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner and Public Accounts Committee MP Dan Carden put a written question to DHSC minister Edward Argar.His Commons reply confirmed that £.bn of £.bn worth of PPE “which cannot be used” or “was not suitable for use in the health and social care sector” had been bought through the VIP lane. The lane was ruled unlawful by High Court judge Mrs Justice O’Farrell in January. Mr Carden said all suppliers of PPE ­products not fit for purpose should be made tothe money. He said. “Those responsible must be held to account and steps taken to recover losses.”  Ms Rayner added: “Unusable masks, gowns, goggles and gloves our frontline key workers desperately needed are now literally going up in flames, along with billions of taxpayers’ cash spent on it. “The next Labour government will establish an Office for Value for Money that would ensure taxpayers’ cash is treated with respect.” The DHSC claims around £m of PPE was not fit for use and a further £.bn was unsuitable for NHS staff.

A new survey shows we are bottom of the European league when it comes to delivering the financial benefits of going plug-in. Danish motorists get the best deal with savings of more than £, within  months of choosing electric over petrol. The comparison site money calculated the average price of buying a new car plus the cost of , miles of travel in ten dferent countries in the first year. That showed Danes would spend £, on an EV plus travel costs compared to £, for a petrol driven car, a saving of more than %. A litre of unleaded in Denmark costs £.. A British motorist would shell out an average of £, on electric and £, on a traditional car, costing an extra .%.  Germans are £ worse off by going plug-in though the percentage dference is higher than the UK’s at .%. James Andrews of money said: “Denmark leads the way. You could buy and run two electric cars for a year for the same cost as a petrol VW Golf. “But in Britain chargepoint rollout is slow and EVs are also still more expensive than their petrol equivalents .” Denmark also offers EV drivers free parking up to £ a year and payment of road tax in installments. One in six new car registrations in Britain last year were plug-ins compared with one in  in .

The government’s ambition is that by  we need to get that to one in three.” The most popular EV is theTesla Model  followed by Kia e-Niro and Volkswagen ID . Mr Andrews added: “Access to rapid chargers is still harder than finding a petrol station. You need to make sure you have public points available nearby before you commit to a purchase.” A Government grant for EVs has been cut from £, to £, and the £ toward the installation of a home charger was also scrapped.

Sam Barton, , has had Botox, veneers, fillers in his cheeks, lips, jaw and chin amid speculation he wanted to look like reality TV star Joey Essex.But he says he has now given up the treatments and his old party lestyle following the pandemic and is instead focusing on his business - which specialises in cosmetic work, reports Birmingham Live.Barton has also stepped away from social media and says some of his surgery was pointless in his quest for fame. I used to spend £, on a bottle of Champagne, he said. I was just interested in being pictured on a night out enjoying a lavish lestyle so I could post the pics on Instagram and other social media.I wanted fame and I said some stupid things in the past just to get in the papers. I had surgery on my face and other parts of my body, which cost me thousands of pounds . It was pointless and - although I may give myself a little bit of workI think I need it - I will never undergo needless surgery again. I have changed.When I was younger and partying every night, I wasnapost truly happy. I was constantly concerned about what I looked like. I was scrutinised on social media and it wasnapost having a good impact on my mental health. Donapost get me wrong. I still enjoy the occasional blow out - it is part of my personality. But the party lestyle doesnapost define who I am anymore. I was silly. I took advice on how I should behave with the media and told to say things which would get myself headlines. I wanted fame. I wanted to become a star but it was just so shallow.  I was never truly happy like I am now. I feel I am achieving great things through hard work. I often work six or seven days-a-week but it is paying off. I have just bought a house with the money I have made through my business. I am self-sufficient. Sam has used his experience of plastic surgery to set up his Sutton-based business, AMC Aesthetics. He said: It was due to open as we went into the first lockdown, which was a huge blow. I spent the lockdown giving online training and working really hard. The business has gone from strength-to-strength and we have had a turnover over £, since it opened. We are forecasting a turnover of £, next year. Although I will not spend any more money on surgery transforming my body, I still have a keen interest in cosmetic work and I like to pass on my knowledge in the field to other people. We are very responsible and will generally only treat people over . They need to be sure they want cosmetic treatment. I think young people can be influenced very easily by celebrities who have treatment. Everything we do is very responsible. He said travel would be a big part of his future - and had a message for a new generation of fame-hungry youngsters. I love travelling, he said. I enjoy my holidays in places like Dubai and Tenere and want to spend more time travelling.The wannabe celebrity lestyle is so shallow. You will be happier going out and getting a fulfilling job or setting up your own business rather than chasing fame. Real happiness lies deep within you, seeking the celebrity le the way I did is is very shallow. I no longer use social media like Instagram and Twitter in my personal le.

This is notorious fraudster John Darwin who plotted with his first we Anne to swindle nearly £, – including le insurance and pensions – by faking his death in the North Sea in a canoe in . Now,  years on from an outrageous con-trick that made headlines around the world, -year-old Darwin does a spot of shopping at a store called WILCON.The former teacher and prison officer may be hoping to cash in on his crime again as his story is turned into a major ITV drama about to hit our screens – and he is writing a tell-all book about his story.We caught up with the Canoe Man in the C Pacic heat of the Philippines – a far cry from chilly Seaton Carew in County Durham where he faked his demise.The crook refused to answer questions as he hopped into a £, SUV and sped away from the Wilcon store car park in Antipolo,  miles from capital Manila. Later his Mercy, Darwinaposs -year-old second we, told us: “The book’s about his le, but it’s not yet finished. You have to wait.” It will follow her husband’s autobiography The Canoe Man: Panama and Back, which he wrote while serving three-and-a-half years in jail before his  release. Mercy is angry the four-part ITV drama The Thief, His We and the Canoe, starring Eddie Marsan as Darwin, has been made without her husband’s permission.  In real le, Darwin and Anne carried out the fraud in . He was seen paddling out from Seaton Carew beach near Hartlepool. Then Anne reported him missing while he hid in a tent down the coast. He then moved to a bedsit next door to the family home, making a door behind a wardrobe into Anne’s bedroom and growing a bushy beard as a disguise for trips into town. The couple’s grieving two sons were never aware of what had really happened. Four years later the couple headed to Panama to start a new le with their ill-gotten gains.  But they were caught after he came home to get papers from police needed for a change in Panama’s immigration laws – and gave them his real name, saying he had amnesia. At first it was hailed a miracle that the missing canoeist had somehow survived. But his lies unravelled when the Mirror ran a story under the headline “Canoe’s this in Panama ” in December , with a snap of the pair in an estate agent’s office. Both he and Anne got just over six years for obtaining cash by deception. It emerged they had staged his disappearance as part of a pension, mortgage and insurance scam to avoid bankruptcy. They were ordered to repay £,.The couple had £, of assets – £, had been repaid by . Anne orced him after  years of marriage. Now almost , miles away from the scene of his crime, le appears far rosier for Darwin, who still receives a state pension. A friend said: “John and Mercy are really happy together. He feels like he’s been given a second chance at le and he’s grabbing it with both hands.” One associate of Mercy’s said: “I have always believed John to be a rich guy. He still seems in good health.” Darwin and Mercy, who has businesses including a clothes stall, are said to own three properties in the area. The couple are understood to have met online in .

And when she died, Tom suffered the loss of a true friend too. Amani’s family have the comfort of knowing what a dference Tom made to her final days. The disease that killed them both was an aggressive brain cancer known as glioblastoma multorme. Tumours like it kill more children and adults than any other cancer, yet only % of research money is allocated to finding a cure. The best legacy Amani and Tom could wish for is for the Government to agree to provide much more financial support.Darwin a loser We tracked down canoe fraudster John Darwin to the Philippines, where his we told us he will make nothing from a new TV drama about his extraordinary fraud.

The enemy aircraft swung into attack formation after a plume of smoke from Stinger anti-aircraft missiles exposed the Brits’ position. The Stingers – like those now being used in Ukraine – missed. And Tony and his SAS buddies were sitting ducks. “My heart was in my mouth,” Tony reveals. “They knew where we were and there was no outrunning them. “Thoughts flashed through my mind – what were they armed with  Rockets  Cannons  Napalm ” But lady luck was on Tony’s side. As the jets flashed overhead he could see their empty missile pods – they were out of ammo, having dumped everything on Goose Green, a major battleground in the Falklands War of . Tony lived to fight another day. And he tells his incredible story – on the th anniversary of the war – in his new memoir Born For War. Tony, , tells of fierce hillside battles and despair at witnessing the deaths of  comrades when a helicopter ditched into the sea.  In a second hair-raising mission, as he advanced on an oil refinery, he lay face-down in the Falklands peat as Argentinian snipers wearing night-vision goggles fired anti-aircraft rounds at his position. Artillery shells and bullets flashed by in a thick hail of fire. When the shooting stopped he made his dash to safety. It was all in a day’s – or night’s – work. While the Argentinian air force was formidable, its army consisted largely of under-trained conscripts – no match for elite SAS soldiers. As Our Boys gained momentum, Tony joined the push towards the capital, Port Stanley. The war took him to the slopes of nearby Mount Kent where, after one victory, he claimed a grisly trophy – a blood-soaked parka which he wore for the rest of the campaign.  For a week, Tony remained holed up on the mountain as the SAS repelled a string of attacks. Some  enemy soldiers came at the British position and  were killed or wounded. “Attacking high ground is a dangerous proposition at the best of times,” Tony writes in his memoir. “Attacking the SAS on high ground is tantamount to suicide.” He recalls another le-threatening episode as British forces closed in on the capital. From the slopes of Mount Kent, his squadron conducted a daytime assault on Argentinian defenders. The SAS men were outnumbered two-to-one. Tony writes: “While keeping my eyes ahead for the enemy, I moved from one piece of cover to the next. “Perhaps I moved too quickly, because the next time I looked around I was on my own.” Argentinian conscripts, startled by the ferocity of the advancing SAS, had abandoned their trenches and fled. But Tony had run into a minefield. “Looking back down the slope, I saw that the rest of my troop had stopped. Thankfully, I found a goat track and followed this back down.” By then the war was almost over. But liberating the Falklands – British territory in the South Atlantic – had come at a price. And Tony tells of the haunting day he lost some of his closest friends.On May  – over six weeks after the war began on April  – he was on the deck of HMS Intrepid, the British vessel where he was stationed. A Sea King helicopter was on its way carrying more SAS men. It was dark and Tony recalls the chopper’s lights winking closer and closer... then disappearing. The helicopter had crashed into the sea and despite a frantic rescue effort,  men died,  from the SAS.  It was the regiment’s worst day since the Second World War. An army chaplain asked Tony to take a dead crewman’s hand as he delivered the Last Rites. “It was undoubtedly the lowest point of the war for me,” Tony says today. “It was devastating. Even now I don’t think I’ve got over it.” The -day conflict cost the lives of  British servicemen,  on the Argentine side and three civilians. The th anniversary brings back vivid memories for millions who were glued to compelling nightly TV updates on the fate of our troops. Tony, who is now a security consultant, had been in the Army for nine years when the conflict began – and the Forces were in his blood. His father was a flight engineer on a WW bomber and his grandfather and uncles served as Royal Marines.  Tony – who went on to train SAS recruits including Bravo Two Zero author Andy McNab – enlisted on his th birthday and says he was always playing soldiers as a child. He was often sent home from school in Hayes, Middlesex, for turning up for class in his Army Cadet unorm. “While I do think that it’s possible to turn people into soldiers, I believe a certain few of us are born to be warriors,” he writes. “I didn’t ever have a choice about being a soldier – it was my fate, a fate I welcomed with open arms.” He served two tours in Northern Ireland with the Royal Green Jackets – in  and  – before being “badged” into the SAS. When Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher declared Britain was at war with Argentina, a flotilla sailed from Portsmouth to reclaim the Falklands, , miles away.  Tony said goodbye to his we Jenny and admits: “I was desperate to get my teeth into it.” He received the Queen’s Gallantry Medal for his accumulated service in Northern Ireland. After  years in the SAS, he retired from the army at . The Falklands left a lasting mark. He writes: “Today it is common for people to think of those who served in the SAS as heroes, but the only heroes in the regiment are the dead. “The rest of us are just ordinary men who were asked to do extraordinary things in extraordinary times.”Born For War is published by Welbeck and is available now.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON British ArmyRoyal MarinesFalklands WarWorld War SoldiersArmed forcesThe Falklands\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

In the midst of a cost of living crisis, with all-time-high inflation, national insurance tax hikes and rising interest rates, many have been fearful about the beginning of this new financial year. But the start of this month also saw the enormous rise in the price cap on energy bills set by regulator OFGEM, to a record £,. The soar in cost will mean the average household will see a rise of £ per year in their gas and electric bill.  So which of the two is cheaper to run  Most central heating models use gas radiators pumping hot warmer from a boiler to heat several rooms at once. Naturally, this can prove expensive as it uses gas over a wide area for several hours a day. The alternative is to heat only the room youaposre using or need to heat with an electric appliance that works independently. Electric heating units take their power from wall sockets rather than one central system, but this isnapost necessarily cheaper upfront.  While market chaos has made it near impossible to estimate accurate electricity and gas prices, tradespeople estimate the former is more expensive, The Express reports.Data reported by checkatrade from the last time prices were stable - in December  - show gas heating costs approximately .p per kWh.Electric heating is almost four times more expensive at p per kWh. But using electricity creates savings where, such as in installation. Gas central heating systems require the hand of a specially trained tradesperson and cost up to £, on average. Electric central heating systems cost markedly less, averaging out at £,.  Heaters not hardwired to the mains usually require a single plug socket, with no electrician necessary. But there are other factors to consider when considering whether to use electric heating. One such consideration is efficiency, as gas wonapost convert to heat at a : rate. Most research shows that, at peak efficiency, gas boilers are roughly  percent effective. Electric heaters generate one unit of heat per hour of operation.

The great-grandad woke up to find his window had been forced open and the £, he had painstakingly saved to spare his family the burden of his funeral costs was gone.The burglars had also taken the ­retired painter and decorator’s CCTV camera to cover their tracks. Heartbroken John told the Sunday People : “I just don’t want to be in this house any more. I don’t feel safe and this makes me angry. “I struggle to sleep at night worrying they will come back. I should not have to feel like that living in my own home. I will not be keeping money in the house any more. But I will never have that type of money again. “It took me a really long time to save and I felt at ease knowing I had that money there because it really would have helped my family when I am gone. “My family now have to help with everything.”  His granddaughter Chloe-Ann Preedy, , added: “He is very upset. This is an old, frail man and he’s been hugely affected by this. It has really hit him hard. “What they have done is absolutely disgusting. They are the lowest of the low. He is particularly upset as he hoped to save the money for his funeral and to help the family. “He is just old-fashioned like that. He is very selfless and is the most ­generous man.” John lives mostly in his living room ­because of his health conditions and his daughter, Jeanette Preedy, visits him up to five times a day in Milton Keynes, Bucks. After waking up and realising he had been robbed, the partially-sighted pensioner called the police, then Jeanette.  Chloe-Ann went on: “My mum hasn’t slept well since, being worried about him. All my mum and dad want to do is help my grandad. “Police think there was more than one person because the window – which grandad usually leaves slightly open to help with his breathing – was open completely and the back door was open. “When he went to sleep, everything was locked – so someone must have climbed in through the ­window and opened the back door for the other one or two. “They’ve then sneaked past my grandad, taken the money and left through the front door. On the way out, they snatched the CCTV camera and threw it on the ground outside. Police found it but the footage ­obviously isn’t there.” John, who is also hard of hearing, had been keeping the money in his wallet at home because he struggles to use the bank.  Chloe-Ann, who works as a carer, said: “He helps his neighbours a lot, so he likes to have cash at hand. “He gave a family nearby money when they were struggling to provide for their son. This is just how my granddad likes to be. He has the kindest soul and will go out of his way for everyone.” She added of John’s ordeal: “He is usually so strong but he is so upset now. “He actually doesn’t want to live there any more. He’s been there for at least  years and it’s been his haven – but he doesn’t feel safe now. “It is not a nice time at the moment. We as a ­family are not sleeping properly.” Thames Valley Police confirmed that officers ­had attended John’s address on March .They said the burglary was believed to have taken place some time between ­midnight and .am.

When we entered the shop and asked him about the police statement, he simply shook his head and said theyaposre causing so much trouble. They come in and ask for a vape but as soon as I ask for some ID they just start shouting abuse, Mr Patel added. A group of six will all come in at the same time with some just stealing stock, I tell them to stop what theyaposre doing but they just donapost listen. Iaposm in here on my own and need to be behind the kiosk, it can be very intimidating when thereaposs a big group.  I call for security straight away but by then itaposs already too late. You canapost say anything to themthey just donapost care. Sometimes itaposs absolutely terrible to work here. Iaposve been here  years but itaposs got so much worse recently, at the weekends there is so much trouble. I can see them stealing things but I just canapost do anything when thereaposs a big group. Sometimes kids are even coming in with their parents and stealing still, itaposs like theyaposre being encouraged too, but nobody listens. A senior sales assistant from HMV said that all the surrounding businesses were suffering, with groups running riot over recent weeks.Speak to any retailer here and theyaposll tell you the same thing, he said. You might get two or three groups all combining with crowds of at least  or so forming and looking for trouble. Last week we had someone, who could have only been nine or , ride their bike into the shop and make as much mess as they could. At the weekend there were lots of fights, all between themselves. Itaposs been a big problem recently. It can happen any day of the week too, not just weekends or school holidays when you might expect more kids around. At least two or three times a week thereaposs trouble kicking off with really young looking kids recently. Theyaposre just looking to get a rise out of someone. Itaposs like theyaposre wanting police or security to be called so they can have fun running away from it.  Itaposs been a bit better this week since the police did that post and hopefully more is done to keep on top of it. We canapost really do anything either, theyaposre just young kids. And they know that we can only really ask them to politely leave but nothing more. It seems like theyaposre doing this just because theyaposre bored, theyaposve got nothing better to do. The story was very much the same in the Ann Summers store opposite. Itaposs getting ridiculous now, one member of staff said. You can hear them coming and we have to go and stand at the store to stop them coming in. On Saturday a young kid rode in on his bike, itaposs crazy. People are always having to call security on their radio to help. If you argue with them they start throwing drinks around, itaposs become a massive problem now. Weaposve got a business to try and run but this going on just makes it a lot harder than it needs to be. You always see the same faces too. £Hopefully the police do genuinely deliver what theyaposre promising from that post, we need it.  There was a clear and large security presence around the shopping centre on a Thursday afternoon. One young man was stopped by security before trying to cycle through the Merseyway centre, with an argument starting when they were asked to leave their bike outside. One man shopping with his we, who wished not to be named, said: We used to come here every weekend for shopping or going to cafes. Itaposs okay around the market but can be terrible down here. Thereaposs always big groups around on bikes and these scooters. Police definitely need to be doing more about it. GMP Stockport have placed a lot of emphasis on parents to make sure their kids arenapost visiting the area after school and getting involved in trouble. The full statement from GMP Stockport said: Parents and s - Do you know where your kids are  Recently there has been a large increase in children aged nine to  coming to Stockport Town Centre and doing what I can only describe as running riot. I have charged my team to tackle this as it simply isnapost fair on people who are trying to go about their daily business, be that shopping, socialising, travelling, working or any other reasons. Please can I ask you all as parents, carers and s to speak to your children and make sure they are not coming to the town, after school and causing issues with their friends. We will be using our powers of arrest where they are required and conducting home visits to speak to youyou children are involved in less serious offences. Please help us, your community and your children by doing your bit to keep them out of trouble.

He said: The day started with a thorough tour of the site, taking a look behind the till and into the kitchen at all of the state of the art fryers, ious storage chillers and freezers, plus numerous hand washing and cleaning stations throughout. Cleanliness really stood out as one of the most important practises in the kitchen, across the day I lost track of how many times I washed my hands which is obviously so important when handling food of any kind but especially chicken. The site was incredibly impressive, the whole kitchen was modern and thoroughly clean - the true sign of a well run kitchen.  The sheer amount of appliances in use really did take me by surprise also, countless fryers, cookers, defrosters and ovens, the list goes on. I suppose as you order fast food you tend not to think of all the inidual parts necessary to craft the end result. Not only this but the sheer speed and precision of the experienced staff when using all of this equipment was very impressive. As Sam rolled up his sleeves and got his hands dirty, he described breading the chicken as an artform. He said: The first step was to get the chicken breaded, an entire artform unto itself.Once Iaposd been given a very useful demonstration it was my turn, and I have to say I was very excited. The flower was so unbelievably soft, it felt like it was working absolute wonders for my skin and great fun to work with. To make sure each fillet is up to standard you must totally cover each, then fold over a hefty amount of the flower on top in one fluid motion before repeating the process for a total of  times. They are then dipped in water and breaded once more, again repeating the previous steps  times. After getting a real hands on experience with the breading process it was time to get cooking with the help of the shiny, new fryers.With all of the fillets ready on the grills, it was frying time which was every bit as satisfying as youaposd expect it to be. Dunking them into the oil was an easy process once I got my head around the mechanics of the fryer, though it did take me a couple tries mind you. After a few short minutes they were done, with a perfect golden coating and a smell that made me instantly hungry, I was now very eager to try the fruits of my labour. All that was left to do was get my fillet burger bunned-up, a portion of chips ready on the side and a drink to wash it all down. Before I knew it, my lunch was on a tray and ready to eat, tasting all the more satisfying after both seeing and helping with the creation process.  As his day came to a close, Sam claimed he left the branch with even more respect for KFC workers than before he arrived. He said: I left my visit with much more respect for all the hard work that goes on behind the scenes at KFC and all fast food chains. Itaposs easy to assume that fast food is easy to make given the name but I can assure you that your lunch time treat really does take a lot of effort from a skilled team. Definitely some food for thought to take away when your next in thought for food.

Pampered Putin cronies in Surrey’s St George’s Estate – an exclusive gated enclave where a third of residents are Russian – are unable to pay for private jet flights, holidays or even taxis now their credit cards are frozen. Many have been forced to ask staff to fork out for cabs after finding Uber executive accounts linked to their cards had been closed.A personal assistant to several oligarchs on the estate told us yesterday: “I have had to endure hearing them in tears because they can’t get on board a private jet or book a holiday or even get an Uber any more.

Oligarchs in the heavily guarded -acre enclave near Weybridge, Surrey, include oil tycoon and close Putin pal Oleg Deripaska, , a mining and energy company boss. Properties on the estate sell for more than £ million. The whistleblower, who asked not to be named for fear of reprisals, told us: “These people care nothing for the suffering in Ukraine.  “They care only about themselves and how the sanctions are starting to affect their champagne lestyle. “Just before the war one of the wealthy Russian families I know in Surrey paid £, to fly a live crab and some black caviar from Moscow on a private jet for a party. “But that’s all changing now and it’s good to see them having to adjust to their new place in the world.“I laugh at their bleating. I get five calls a day from Russian billionaires asking me to help them with blocked credit card problems. “They askthey can use my address when they apply for new cards to avoid the sanctions. I just put the phone down. I can’t talk to these people any more – they should understand what is happening and what their leader is doing.”Foreign Secretary Liz Truss plans to sanction even more oligarchs.

Maryrose McCready, , from County Derry in Northern Ireland, initially believed she was suffering with the common ailment, which presents as bloating and constipation.Thinking she was reacting badly to food, she made drastic changes to her diet, which helped for a while - but her symptoms reared up again and persisted until they led to a rectal prolapse. She was later rushed to Altnagelvin Hospital in an ambulance after experiencing excruciating pain.Doctors referred her on for a colonoscopy, which revealed a tumour in her bowel, MyDerry reports. Maryrose told MyDerry: I just had a feeling whenever the rectal prolapse happened that there was just something that wasnapost right. I had the prolapse in May  and was then referred for a colonoscopy in the August of the same year. And in between that time my symptoms were getting worse, I had rectal bleeding, constipation, bloating and noises coming from my tummy. It was a massive shock for me when they told me that I had cancer. I was only -year-old and bowel cancer isnapost usually something somebody gets when theyaposre so young. Itaposs usually older people that are diagnosed with it.  This was something that was never discussed or never mentioned when I had gone to get checked by the local doctors and I had just thought that this was normal. Of course, I knew something wasnapost right whenever I had rectal prolapse but I still would never have guessed that it was cancer. She underwent surgery to remove a tumour from her bowel, meaning surgeons had to reattach her bowel after the procedure. Maryrose said she was completely floored by the entire situation which was a total blur at the time. I just wanted to get better, she said.I couldnapost even begin to comprehend how any of this was actually happening. Looking back now I definitely suppressed a lot of the mental side of being ill to the backburner. I just didnapost know how to react to the situation. I considered myself quite lucky because I didnapost have to get a stoma bag at the time or I didnapost have to have chemotherapy. This was the sort of way that I was thinking even know the situation was a godsend for me. I was mentally all over the place. I just wanted to get back to my normal le as quickly as possible.

Following surgery Maryrose aposgot on with thingsapos and was eager to have children of her own, something doctors werenapost sure would be possible following the surgery. Doctors told Maryrose that it was a possibility that she could be infertile, destroying her chances of having any kids in the future. However, two years later, the Derry woman defied the odds and fell pregnant with her firstborn Cian in  and then Lochlain a year and a half later. I was delighted when I had my two wee boys, Maryrose said. It was such a positive time in my le and I was really looking forward to seeing what the future held for us all. But there was some concern because at the start of my second pregnancy I started to get issues again with the bowel.Bloating, irritation and discomfort of the stomach all ed for the mum-of-two, prompting concern that Maryroseaposs problems were ing. She added: This went on until  when the pain became unbearable one night and I had to the AE department. There was nothing passing, no stool or air. They had to perform emergency surgery due to a blockage in my bowel. And even after that surgery I still didnapost feel right at all. My body was trying to tell me something. My bowel was enlarged in areas and felt completely twisted. Thataposs when I went back in March , just before the first lockdown, and thataposs when I had the CT scan.  Doctors investigating Maryroseaposs second blockage in less than a year, discovered two growths within the bowel - something which was described to her as a aposle and death situationapos. She said: I was told before the surgery started that I would need a stoma bag this time around but it would most likely be temporary. My large colon was also removed because it was so badly damaged that it couldnapost be saved. This left me with only my rectum and Iaposll need another operation in the future. Post ileostomy surgery, Maryrose admitted that she was in a dark place and hated having the stoma bag in. I was really conflicted at the time, she said. I really didnapost want this bag on my body but I knew that it saved my le. Thataposs what they told me. They told me thatthey didnapost perform the surgery there and then that I would I die and when youaposre left with a decision like that youaposre going to do whatever it takes to save your le. But afterwards I didnapost have a good opinion of myself. I hated my body because of the stoma bag and I did everything possible to try and cover it up as best I could. Bleeding from the bottom and or blood in faeces A persistent and unexplained change in bowel habits Unexplained weight loss Extreme tiredness for no obvious reason A pain or lump in the tummySource: Dr Hashim We had just entered lockdown so I wasnapost seeing anybody at the time anyway and that was hard in itself because I didnapost have the people I usually could rely on. Thataposs why I decided to create the page because I needed somewhere where I could talk to people who were going through the same thing but I decided that I wasnapost going to show my face because I was too embarrassed. That when a local wax melt company, Brona at Urban Ivy Aromas asked methey could name their torso candle which was created with a stoma bag after me. They wanted to tell my story and I thought aposno chance, thataposs never going to happenapos. But I went away and I had a conversation with my sister and she told me that I shouldnapost be feeling the way that I was and that I had nothing to be embarrassed about. She said that my story could help empower so many people and the more I thought about it the more I decided that it was something that I should consider and thataposs why I decided to reveal myself. She added: I sort of found my calling in a way and ever since all I have been trying to do is help educate and create awareness about stoma bags and bowel cancer. Nobody should have to sit in silence in the way that I did for that year and feel horrible about themselves. People who are getting this procedure can be at ease knowing that this isnapost a death sentence and le can be as normal as you want it to be. Yes, there are some adjustments but the way the bags are designed now and the supplies that come along with the bags are amazing. People should feel confident with their stoma and not be afraid to show it.If you would like to follow Maryrose on her journey, you can do so by following her Instagram page @big_c_stomaandme HERE.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HospitalsPregnancyBowel cancerCancer\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The resident said that he reported what had happened to them and that, while two contractors came to take pictures, nothing had happened six hours later. Yesterday afternoon , the residents said the stench was filling the block of flats and that they were unable to go into their kitchens as they described them as a health hazard, reports BristolLive.Resident Martin Hewer said he had also turned his electricity off as a precaution because water is pouring through the ceiling of his tenth floor flat.Iaposm absolutely fuming, Iaposm furious - itaposs a scandal, he said. I went for a walk this morning and just as I got back at around am, there was a great big bang from the kitchen and I walked in to find it like this. I talked to my neighbour who was out, and told him to come back, and his kitchen was the same. I donapost know how many flats are affected like this, but Iaposm on the tenth floor so it could be a lot of them.The council had contractors in doing something with the drains, and God knows whataposs gone wrong. I went and found them and told them, and two of them came up, had a look, took some pictures and then went off again. I havenapost seen them since. Mr Hewer, who is retired, also said heaposs waiting to hear back from the council, adding that he is worried for his health.I couldnapost believe what I saw when I walked into the kitchen. There was all this dirt everywhere, itaposs like a sticky black tar-like substance and it stinks. Obviously the kitchen is unuseable and Iaposm worried about what this substance is anditaposs safe to clear up - it needs professional cleaners because now my kitchen is contaminated with this black stuff.  It needs proper disinfecting - this is a health and safety issue, he added. Bristol City Council was contacted for comment. Bristol Live met another resident who said her flat had not been affected, although she said her sink hole was blocked with a plug.

Speaking to the Times Now News Portal, Dr Stankovic said: “Pain is often associated with ringing in the ears. Surprisingly, these symptoms, although more rarely, can also appear in patients who have been vaccinated with a full course. She also advised those with hearing loss, ringing in your ears and dizziness to not dismiss these symptoms and still take a test. Brits can no longer have testing kits for free after the scheme was stopped, with those looking to test having to buy from local pharmacies or online.

The Princess and her father have been featured in evidence given to a judge overseeing a High Court financial dispute between an elderly Turkish woman and a former banker this week. The dispute is between Nebahat Isbilen, who is in her s, and has sued Selman Turk, a Turkish businessman based in London.She is reportedly suing him over £million that she says is missing, Mail Online reports.A judge overseeing the dispute has been told that the Duke of York was allegedly paid £, for assistance he provided in relation to Mrs Isbilenaposs passport.  According to records of an alleged phone call between the dukeaposs former private secretary Amanda Thirsk and Mrs Isbilenaposs private bank, the money was sent to Andrewaposs private bank account as a wedding gt for Beatrice and her now husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi. Mrs Thirsk said Itaposs a gt for the wedding, a wedding gt, it was reported. Court documents reportedly show that Andrewaposs ex-we the Duchess of York was sent payments totalling £,, while his younger daughter Eugenie received £,, including a £, aposbirthday gtapos. The Duke of York is not accused of any wrongdoing and is not a central figure in the case. It is understood neither Beatrice nor Eugenie had any knowledge of their parents’ dealings with Mr Turk, thereported. Mrs Isbilen is the we of a Turkish MP jailed in their homeland on apospolitically motivatedapos charges. She had needed help moving assets out of Turkey after her husband became a political prisoner, High Court judge David Halpern was told. Mr Turk, a former banker, agreed to help. Mrs Isbilen alleges he breached fiduciary obligations he owed to her and advanced claims in deceit but Mr Turk is fighting the case, which is ongoing and has been heard in London. Mrs Isbilen said police had seized her previous passport and Mr Turk had obtained a new passport for her through connections with Turkish authorities.Mr Turk told me that he received help from the Duke of York to show or send the picture of my old passport to Turkey and that this service would normally be worth £ million, but it would cost lesswe made the payment by way of a gt, she said. I did not understand the nature of the services received then and have also dficulty of explaining it now. I have seen an e-mail from Mr Turk... explaining that this transfer was a wedding gt to Princess Beatrice owing to the close connection between our families. This email is entirely . A document outlining Mrs Isbilenaposs case said the Duke had subsequently ed the £,. Judge Halpern said, in a ruling, that a lawyer representing Mrs Isbilen told him in an affidavit that information had emerged to show evidence given by Mr Turk was misleading. He said solicitor Jonathan Tickner told him evidence showed money was used for purposes unconnected with Mrs Isbilen,substantial sums were paid to Prince Andrew, Duke of York, and to Sarah, Duchess of York. Judge Halpern said barrister Dan McCourt Fritz, who is leading Mrs Isbilenaposs legal team, told him the total sums which his client claims were misappropriated amount to million . Mr Turk has provided explanations for approximately two thirds of these sums, most of which have been allegedly spent on professional or other fees or lost in bad investments, the judge added in his ruling. No explanation at all has been given for the remaining one third.  A statement of claim drawn up by Mrs Isbilenaposs lawyers said: In or around November , Mr Turk told Mrs Isbilen that she needed to make a purported aposgtapos of £, to HRH Duke of York by way of payment for assistance that he told her HRH Duke of York had provided in relation to Mrs Isbilenaposs Turkish passport. The representation that Mrs Isbilen needed to make a gt to HRH Duke of York in connection with her passportwas , and Mr Turk made it dishonestly, knowing it to be  and intending Mrs Isbilen to rely on it. The lawyers added: Mrs Isbilen authorised a transfer of £,... on  November . They went on: Mrs Isbilen has now received £, from HRH Duke of York. Mr Tickner, head of fraud and commercial disputes at law firm Peters  Peters, told the PA news agency in a statement on Friday that Mrs Isbilen had trusted Mr Turk to help her through extremely dficult circumstances.

Buckingham Palace will calculate an elderly monarchaposs above criticism on the day of her dear, dead husbandaposs memorial service. But choosing to be escorted to and from Westminster Abbey by a man who paid a reported £-million to settle a sordid sex case to avoid court was deeply distasteful. It wasnapost a sweet old maaposam who wanted to travel from Windsor Castle in state limousine with a scoundrel shunned since paying off a woman who alleged when a teenager she was force to sleep with a dad of two old enough to be her own father.  This was an elderly monarch exploiting sympathy at a personal yet very public event to walk back into polite society a reviled man forced to give up even honorary membership of a posh golf club over the scandals spewing from a close friendship with a convicted paedophile and his jailed fixer. What Virginia Giuffre makes of it one can only imagine but much of the watching world, particularly women victims of abuse, will have been revolted. The removal of his military titles and royal patronages, including the use of a His Royal Highness title, look a ersion.  The Duke of York, her favourite son, remains promoted despite stomach-churning behaviour that shouldaposve seen tainted Andrew seated out of sight at the back behind a pillar. Perhaps age and frailty are distorting her judgement because this was a colossal mistake by a declining monarch. She put her son and family before decency, trying to sell a leper to the country at a service commemorating her husband. Knee-bending courtiers will struggle from now on to argue sheaposs principled and does what is right in the service of the country.  She held on to Andrewaposs arm but it was her parading him. He continues to deny the claim but embracing the humiliated sex case settler damaged her own reputation.

Wheelie bins were laid side-by-side in a busy Birmingham street in a bid to stop other drivers pulling in.But that didnapost stop one driver, with a people carrier seen double parked next to the bins, narrowing the lanes for approaching traffic. A shocked passer-by who saw the scene in Oldfield Road, Balsall Heath, told Birmingham Live : I was walking back to my car from a funeral and I saw it on the way.The bins were flat and did not have waste in them. The white people carrier parked there next to the bins.  It was double parked next to the bins. The car was sticking out into the road. The bin was placed so the lids did not open. It was ridiculous. It was taking up two spaces. There were no dropped kerbs. It was not anyoneaposs driveway. The wheelie bins were the latest in a long line of obstacles used by householders to desperately claim blink-and-youaposll-miss them on-road spaces.In March, fuming residents resorted to using rock-filled trollies to reserve parking spaces.Two trollies were seen placed facing each other outside homes in Sparkbrook, weighted down with slabs of concrete. Rocks had also been wedged behind the wheels to secure them in place.  And one driver was left stunned after finding a wheelie bin aposselfishlyapos chained to the ground to save a car parking space. Chad Miah was trying to find a parking space near his friendaposs house when he came across a wheelie bin blocking an empty parking space, when he went to move it Chad was astonished to find the bin was chained to the ground. Chadaposs friend was getting married and the only parking spot nearby had a wheelie bin anchored into the tarmac blocking anyone form using it, Birmingham Live reports.Chad tried to wrench the obstacle free of its moorings near his friendaposs property in Handsworth, Birmingham, but found it was secured with a chain and a padlock to an anchor deep in the road.Furious Chad told reporters: My mate lives opposite and he was getting married on that day. I went to move the bin, but realised the person who did this had drilled it to the ground with a bolt and hook. The bin was attached to a metal chain and had a padlock on it. They must have gone through some effort to do it, just to save a parking space. I was yanking it, but it wasnapost moving. Iaposve seen it all now. Residents have gone to extraordinary s over the years to reserve much-coveted parking spaces in front of their homes.

Below the cobbled and winding streets of Stockportaposs Old Town are secret cellars and bygone doorways that reflect the townaposs rich history. One expert said Stockport is filled with holes and connecting tunnels, comparing it to a rabbit warren.Stockport-born and bred Phil Catlin has deep knowledge about what is hiding below the old pubs and many new independents in Underbanks and around the Market Hall. Phil, who is also known as the Tunnel Inspector, said there are cellars upon cellars, dungeons, and old nightclubs, including where Jimi Hendrix once famously played in the s, reports the MEN. The expert discovers, investigates, and documents man-made and man-used spaces underneath Britain. With expertise in health and safety, history and archaeology, Phil has explored a large portion of the abandoned sections of the town, taking photographs along the way. And heaposs worked out why the Old Town is higgledy-piggledy in design, with dferent levels of terrain. He said:was essentially a big sandstone lump, with a church, a castle, and then they ended up with a market.It was so easy to dig, so they kept digging down and down. Everyone has cellars underneath and some units have double cellars. The Bakers Vault pub had a nightclub beneath it, and then another cellar they didnapost know was there. The grade-II listed Market Hall was erected in , but the site has housed a market dating back to the late Anglo-Saxon period, with the granting of a formal charter in .  While Phil says he isnapost aware of anything beneath it, itaposs evident that the locals dug outward from this point. The pavement slopes down to Mealhouse Brow road, and on that corner lies Stockport Dungeons - which is a tourist attraction open today. Here, the drunk and disorderly were locked up in a cell below ground. It was also where the Court Leet was held from the th until the late th century.Prisoners were held in the dungeon before being taken to the court or transferred to Chester or Lancaster Assizestheir crime was more serious. Next door to the dungeons, at what is now a barber shop, a hatch - with a secret cellar behind it - was discovered by the owners, Phil says. Further down into Underbanks, Phil explains there was once a stream there, which led to a V-shape forming in the ground, creating a valley.  It was then covered over and became part of the thoroughfare from London to Glasgow. Underneath independent business Underbank Studios, on Little Underbank, an extra doorway was discovered that led to a staircase, Phil believes, while the owners of neighbouring dry salon also found another secret room that had been covered up.

Thereaposs a school of make-up in one part of the building, but below it was once the home of the Sinking Ship Club - where Jimi Hendrix performed in . It was a sandstone cave, Phil said. It would get really crowded, and condensation would drip from the ceiling, it would be like sandy water.  The cobbled Royal Oak Yard road leads to a carpark, which could be mistaken for any old rundown space. Butyou take a closer look, large vaults can be found underneath that were used for storage, and caves carved into the sandstone remain. Hidden behind the gates there are air raid shelters that the Queenaposs Head Pub, which owns them, uses for storage now, Phil said. You can see old chimneys built into the sandstone too, which were used for smelting tin. Behind a garage door, my father and I found an old Victorian bottling machine, that they used in Victorian times for bottling sparkling wine.Phil also says the area was connected to the Market Place via the yard behind where the Angel Inn pub is now located. It was used as Stockportaposs first theatre and a aposhaunt of prostitutesapos lined the staircase down to Underbank. There was also a rumoured brothel, called aposthe dust holeapos, by where the old coffee warehouse was on Rowston Brow, which has a number of cellars deep into the ground. Where The Light Gets In now occupies the top floor of that building.  Not so secret are Stockportaposs official air raid shelters, located on Great Underbank, where, today, visitors can explore the network of tunnels that was carved into the natural sandstone clfs during World War II. First opened in , the shelters were the largest purpose-built civilian air raid shelters in the country, designed to provide shelter for up to , people. They were extended in - to accommodate ,.

And for lots of families, their shopping habits are the first thing to change - with cutting down on big brands and opting for supermarkets own branded ranges a good way to save money.A reporter for the Manchester Evening News shopped around Tescoaposs budget brands and Aldi Price Matches to see where savings can be made against the household brands.They were also left impressed by Tesco merging their cheaper ranges with the rest of their products, after scrapping its old aposEveryday Valueapos brand. With some of the products the reporter knew what they were getting as some food items were already a regular feature of their Tesco big shop - like the chicken goujons, cheese pizza and tortilla wraps.  In their everyday shop they refused to pay £. for a pack of branded wraps, when they decided they could get own-branded wraps for nearly half-price at p. During their shop, they said it was like they had stepped into a time machine and arrived back in the s, because of the foods they were getting as well as the prices. Some of the products they shopped were new, but aposrefreshinglyapos cheap with chicken kievs, £. for two, and potato croquettes, just p for g, two stand out products.  On top of prices like the s, the MEN reporter was left thrilled at the prospect of some aposblast from the pastapos puddings like Angel Delight, especially at only p a pack. On top of that, there was a number of other treats they loved from Tescoaposs Ms Mollyaposs range from flapjack traybake and ice cream roll, to milk lollies and trle. Whilst not quite the branded Mr Kipling given the price dference it was a no brainer for the reporter. The tray of flapjack was just p for g, less than half the price of Tescoaposs £ pack of flapjack bites . After the reporter got past the sweet treats, they found plenty to make substantial from the budget range. Aided by the Aldi Price Matches, on some meat and fruit and frozen veg, such as the g bag of broccoli and caullower florets for p and the g bag of Groweraposs Harvest garden peas for just p, they said the meals were aposcheap as chipsapos.  They were also left pleasantly surprised by the quality of fish and chips theyaposd made, and the cut-rate price they made it for. With the .kg of Hearty Food Co straight cut for p, Growers Harvest British mushy peas G for p and the Hearty Food Co four breaded fish fillets G for £., the meal worked out at around p a head. The Willow Farm whole chicken, at £., was enough for a Sunday dinner, and they still had some meat leftover to stick in a curry afterwards. However, despite the price, not all of the products went down well. Instead of the classic Heinz beans, they opted for p Stockwell  Co baked beans which were less popular and they were unable to persuade anyone to eat the chicken paste butty they bought. Although, not all of the bargains went down badly, the Stockwell  Co teabags, at just p for , less than half what youaposd pay for Tetley or a similar brand were said to have made a pretty decent brew.

But while many of us have shivered indoors, working outwe can afford to put on the heating again, others have made the most the ­bracing conditions outside.  Skiers and snowboarders hit the slopes at Lecht Ski Centre in the Scottish Highlands as hardy jet skiers and sea swimmers braved the waves in the North East. And dog walkers wrapped up warm to take their pets for a stroll in Richmond Park, West London. Coral spokesman John Hill said: “The prospect of snowfall during the Easter weekend is now strong.” Last month, temperatures hit C in some areas. It was the the ­sunniest March in the UK since .  Since then, temperatures have fallen. Tomorrow should be nearer the April average but a second Arctic blast, and possible snow, is expected later this week.

But for some reason, we still keep trying, even when the odds are stacked against us and we know that anyone listening to the forced conversation and bad jokes will be curling in on themselves with secondhand embarrassment.And to prove that point, one Tesco employee on TikTok has shared some of the most common things customers say to her when they put their shopping on the conveyor belt - and all of them make her cringe.The worst part  I know Iaposve definitely said each one at least once, and I bet you have too. Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Holly Dixon posted a video in which she listed some of the things she hears at least  times each sht while working on the tills at Tesco, including the cringeworthy joke people always make whenever an item doesnapost want to scan.In the clip, posted to her @hollydixon account, she explained the first thing she hears every day is customers telling her they only came in for one thing, despite having what seems like the whole shop in their trolley.Next up was the classic joke: Oh, itaposs not scanning  It must be free! To which an unimpressed Holly simply wrote in text on the video: Absolutely not.  Finally, the employee said she isnapost fond of customers who say she looks bored and state theyaposre going to give her something to do by choosing her till for their shopping. She said: I was happy chilling and counting down the minutes until I finish. In the comments, some people shared their own experiences with working in supermarkets as they quoted other popular phrases that customers use whenever theyaposre at work. One person said: I get askedIaposm worried about losing my jobthey use the self-service till. While another added: Or they ask for a lottery ticket and then go aposthe winning one would be goodapos when you ask what one they want. And others admitted theyaposve definitely used these common sayings at least once, with one user posting: I hold my hand up that Iaposm probably one of these people that say these things. While Holly might poke fun at the customers she sees while working in Tesco, she defended her job in the comments when someone suggested it was time for a job change, as she said: I love my job.Do you have a story to sell  Get in touch with us at yourmirror@trinitymirror .Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TescoViral\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts with news to brighten your daySubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The regimentaposs commanding officer, Col Sergei Sukharev, was killed in Ukraine on  March - a major blow for any military unit.His deputy Major Sergei Krylov was killed alongside him.Want all the latest news and analysis from Ukraine to our World News Bulletinhere According to the BBC, in the month since the invasion began, at least  other members of the st have lost their lives in Ukraine.The men had been part of a column that advanced into Ukraine from Belarus, led by Russiaaposs airborne forces, that was tasked with capturing Kyiv. Like many other regiments they soon found themselves bogged down by intense resistance fighting and logistical dficulties. Videos circulating online show vehicles marked with VDV - the symbol for Russiaaposs airborne forces - wrecked and abandoned in villages near the capital.  While the Kremlin has not been forthcoming when it comes to announcing the deaths of its men in Ukraine, Russians have been posting tributes to fallen soldiers on social media site VaposKontakte. One has been set up Sergeant Sergei Duganov, a member of the st. Nobody knows anything, one woman wrote on it, the BBC reported. The st regiment is disappearing. Almost every day, photos of our Kostroma boys get published. It sends shivers down my spine. Whataposs happening  When will this end  When will people stop dying The deaths of so many members of the st will come as a blow to the Russian military, in part symbolically due to their reputation. In a video posted online last May, a general tells soldiers of the st Parachute Regiment that they are the best of the best. As well as serving in the Balkans, Chechnya and Donbas, they regularly took part in Red Square parades in Moscow. However many of their number have died, its clear that the st did not achieve their central mission of circling and then taking Kyiv.Earlier this week the Kremlin announced plans to focus the invasion effort on the east of the country in what has widely been interpreted as an acceptance that the army was stretched too thin. This morning Volodymyr Zelenskiy warned that retreating Russian forces are creating “a complete disaster” by leaving mines in homes as they retreat to the east. “They are mining the whole territory, the Ukrainian president said.  They are mining homes, mining equipment, even the bodies of people who were killed. There are a lot of trip wires, a lot of other dangers.” Zelensky went on to urge Russian families not to let their young men sign up for the army as the Kremlin’s annual military conscription drive began. “We don’t need more dead people here. Save your children so they do not become villains, he said.  Don’t send them to the army. Do whatever you can to keep them alive. Keep them at home. According to the BBC the following members of the st have died: Klim Abramov, Cpl Artem Arbuzov, Oleg Bedoshvili, CaptYurii Borisov, Snr Lt Ilya Chernyshev, Cpl Yuri Degtaryov, Konstantin Dobrynin, Sasha Dolkin, Sgt Sergei Duganov, Kiril Fedoseyev, Andrey Kovalevsky, Maj Sergei Krylov, Stanislav Kutelev, Cpl Yanosh Leonov, Sgt Alexander Limonov, Snr WO Sergei Lobachyo, Cpl Ivan Mamzurin, Cpl Ilya Martynenko, Lt Lev Ovchinnikov, Maksim Ovchinnikov, Cpl Leonid Panteleyev, Maj Oleg Patskalyev, Sgt Stanislav Petrutik, Sgt Roman Pomelov, Snr WO Pavel Rudenko, Snr Lt Alexander Shalygin, Sgt Nikolai Smirnov, Col Sergei Sukharev, Maxim Svetlenko, Snr Lt Nikolai Symov, Daniil Titov, Maxim Trokai, Ivan Turyev, Sgt Maxim Vorotyntsev, Capt Alexei Vyshegorodtsev, Alexei Yelimov, Cpl Artem Yergin, Sgt Ravshan Zhakbaev, Cpl Danila Zudkov.

Hannah, , had been with her friend Cheslin Marsh in a secluded part of Stellenbosch, South Africa when their car was stopped by a pack of wolves gang who held them up at knepoint in May . The pair were taken hostage and driven around by the thugs for hours, before they nearly beat Cheslin to death and dumped his body. The gang then proceeded to repeatedly gang-rape Hannah, stabbed her in the neck and dropped a ft rock on her head. The abhorrent killers, Nashville Julius, , Geraldo Parsons, , Eben Van Niekerk, , and Vernon Witbooi, showed no remorse as they were sentenced to jail for le in .  Now a new documentary five years on has shed light on the events that took place before Hannahaposs tragic death and how her family struggled to come to terms with her ordeal. Hannahaposs mother, Anna, drowned just a year after the studentaposs death as she took her daily swim - her battered body spotted in shallow waters in Cape Town, The Sun reports.Hannahaposs father Willem said the impact of his daughteraposs death on the family was “beyond devastating” and said his we “walked into the ocean and didnapost ”.He added: I believe our family died with Hannah. Annaaposs death was ruled as a fatal accident, and while Willem claimed he did not believe his we intended to kill herself he added that she lacked the physical or mental strength to deal with the horrying slaughter of her daughter.The night of terror began for Hannah and Cheslin, on May , , when the pair were heading home from a night out. Hannah had offered Cheslin a lt home but while the pair were parked up, CCTV captured the moment the four strong gang encircled the vehicle. Armed with a screwdriver and flick kne they forced Cheslin into the backseat and then the boot while Hannah was cramped between the two front seats. Talking during the new documentary, Cheslin said: I kept telling her, basically, to stay calm the whole time...everything is going to be okay.The gang were again caught on CCTV as they drove to a nearby petrol station to withdraw money from a cash machine with Cheslinaposs card, but were given the wrong pin. During a police interview, Witbooi describes how terried Hannah didnapost talk at all and just looked out in front of her. The callous killers even offered her a glimmer of hope, claiming they wanted to take them both home - but the student would never see her loved ones again. After driving them to a remote area, Cheslin was beaten with bricks and left for dead, but miraculously survived the attack.  He said: They were taking me into the bushes...and then they told me I should lay my head on a piece of brick and thataposs when I realised these people are gonna take my le away. And as I was laying on the brick, I closed my eyes and prayed and asked the Lord for forgiveness for whatever I did in this le. Because I definitely knew Iaposm gonna go to another one and I didnapost want to go. Traumatised Cheslin awoke from the brutal attack partially deaf and not knowing whether Hannah was dead or alive.  In fact Hannah had been driven to a farm road, where the gang claimed they had planned to leave her alive until she began to struggle and was stabbed in the neck. During the trial, Parsons said they believed they had killed Cheslin and admitted being the first one to rape Hannah.According to Times Live, he told the trial: She didn’t want to climb out of the boot. She was holding on to the car. She started panicking.“Eben came up and stabbed her.  But family friends of Hannahaposs claimed she would have tried to comply with her killersapos requests and even empathise with them in a bid to survive. After killing Hannah, the men continued their terrying crime spree, chasing a woman walking to work in nearby Kraaontein before stealing her bag and phone. The group were then arrested following a high-speed police chase after Hannahaposs car was spotted by undercover cops. Her cruel killers were sentenced to a combined  years behind bars with three out of four facing le sentences following the trial at Cape Town high court.  Her heartbroken father Willem admitted during the trial that it had taken him a while to attend the court hearing because he didnapost want to hear what had happened to his beloved daughter - who was described as a aposdaddyaposs girlapos. Willem and Anna went on to create the Hannah Cornelius Foundation to help children in their local area get into education and escape violence within their community. Friend Toni, who went on to become director for the foundation told the Sun Online: Hannah was never a typical child, teenager or adult. She was always unusually compassionate and empathic and deeply moved by the people she encountered, their stories and their struggles. The way in which she saw the world and wrestled with her place and purpose therein was paradoxically both mature and innocent.  Hannah could be naively carefree and even careless at times. A dreamer. An idealist. Distracted and curious. But not many people saw her struggles and her personal suffering, which she carried bravely and faced fearlessly. Hannah loved completely. Firstly her parents and brother, but also friends and often even strangers. She suspended judgement and sought to know and understand. Itaposs easy to idealise the dead. Especially the young, beautul and tragically taken. But Hannah really was everything people say she was. And more.

He said: We are the first EU country among Gazpromaposs supply countries to secure independence from Russian gas supplies, and it is the result of a long-term consistent energy policy and timely infrastructure decisions.President Gitanas Nausėda wrote on Twitter the decision to cut off reliance on Russian energy was made many years ago.He added it allows us to sever energy ties with the aggressor without pain. The president went on to slam Europe for failing to cut ties with the Kremlinaposs supply, saying: If we can, so can the rest of Europe.  During a joint news conference with the Danish prime minister, Mr Nauseda added: [The] Kremlin regime uses this money to finance destruction of Ukrainian cities and attacks on peaceful civillians. The fth sanction package must deliver a maximum blow to the Kremlin regime, he said. Responding to the news, Russian gas supplier Gazprom told Amber Grid it no longer plans to import gas through Belarus and into Lithuania.Despite several countries imposing outright bans on Russian crude in the wake of Vladimir Putinaposs war in Ukraine, the European Union - which gets % of its gas from Russia - remains ided.Australia, Britain, Canada and the United States have implemented total prohibitions on purchases of Russian oil in the time since Putin ordered the invasion on February . The blocaposs  members have been unable to agree on an embargo, with Germany warning against hasty steps that could push the economy into recession, and, some countries, such as Hungary, opposing any bans.  However, Germany aims to phase out Russian oil imports by the end of this year, officials said, as does Poland. Many buyers in Europe are shunning Russian crude voluntarily to avoid reputational damage or possible legal dficulties. Russian oil product exports from the Black Sea port of Tuapse in March were just half of those planned, falling to , tonnes as European buyers stayed away. Meanwhile, India and China, which have refused to condemn the Kremlinaposs actions, continue to buy crude from Russian suppliers. Lured by steep discounts following Western sanctions on Russian entities, India has bought at least million barrels of Russian crude oil since late February. That compared with some million barrels for the whole of , data compiled by Reuters shows. British oil major BP is abandoning its stake in Rosneft and will not enter new deals with Russian entities for loading at Russian ports, unless essential for ensuring security of supplies, Reuters reports.  How far must the UK go before it can reach Lithuaniaaposs status At the start of March, UK Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng announced the UK will begin phasing out Russian oil imports as a direct response to the invasion.Unlike Lithuania, the UKaposs phasing out will not be immediate to allow time to adjust for businesses and consumers, a Gov.uk report said. But Britain, unlike the EU and other global powers, are not reliant on Russian oil - with it making up just % of total demand. Russian natural gases account for four per cent of British supply. Mr Kwarteng said the UK will be working with alternative suppliers beyond Russia - including the Netherlands and the USA. He also mentioned Saudi Arabia which still continues to account for a slice of UK oil demand despite its appalling human rights record.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it will take a year for the UK to abandon its Russian oil needs.The announcement came just days after another ban was announced. On March , the Government barred all Russian ships from entering UK ports - giving authorities new powers to detain vessels.  According to the Digest of UK Energy Statisticsfor  - the most recent data available - Britain doesnapost use any Russian oil for petrol, heating oil, or fuel oil. But to get rid of Russian crude from the UK supply, Brits will need to signicantly reduce reliance on diesel. At present, Russian diesel makes up a huge chunk of supply at %. Jet fuel, also known as aviation turbine fuel, is used in gas-turbine engine aircraft - and Russian supply accounts for around five per cent of all fuel used in the UK. Russian imports of red diesel - used in tractors, other agricultural machinery, and off-road vehicles - account for % of British supply.

Intelligence analysts Dragonfly correctly predicted Russia would invade Ukraine and now they claim Putin could be oustedthe West ramps up sanctions that trigger a financial crisis. It comes as Ukraine says its forces have seized back all areas around the capital of Kyiv with Russian troops pulling back as war drags on and another of Putinaposs top Russian colonels is killed.As Western sanctions target Russian business, Putin finds himself under pressure to keep his key advisers on side amid uncertainty over what happens when he can no longer guarantee their financial security. In a Dragonfly briefing, intelligence analysts said it’s likely to highly likely that President Putin will not be in the position he is within the next two years, reports The Sun.Putinaposs fate reportedly lies in the hands of six of his closest allies - Sergei Naryshkin, head of the foreign intelligence service, defence minister Sergei Shoigu, former head of the FSB internal security service Alexander Bortnikov, head of Russia’s Security Council Nikolai Patrushev, head of state-owned Rostec Sergei Chemezov and oligarch Igor Sechin.Dragonfly suggests rather than a military coup, what we would be more likely to see a group of squat men in ill-fitting suits walking into the Kremlin. President Putin then being explained as either ill or having to step down for other reasons – family reasons and so on. Speculation has been re over Putinaposs health and state of mind with some experts suggesting he may be taking steroids as a treatment for cancer - which can trigger nasty side effects, including rapid mood swings, behavioural changes, confusion and altered cognitive patterns In recent public appearances, Putin - known in Russia for his strong man image - has looked bloated and noticeably weakened when compared to earlier images. The decline in his physical state has led outsiders to wonderheaposs battling a serious illness as others claim his decisions relating to the Ukraine war may be caused by psychological instability.  It comes as horrying details emerge of mass killings and Ukrainian men being slaughtered in the street, in the previously Russian occupied areas around Kyiv.Ukrainian forces have been greeted with scenes of dead bodies littering the streets. At least  people were found dead in the village of Bucha, after Russian forces left the settlement. Photos show the widespread destruction and horric actions of the Russian armies as video footage shows Ukrainian troops having to slalom their trucks down the streets to avoid all the dead bodies.

A video posted online showed the tail of a Mi-N helicopter being snapped off over the Luhansk region in eastern Ukraine  Wallace had previously vowed to send more “lethal aid” to Ukraine after Russia invaded in February. Kelin told Kremlin News agency TASS: “All arms supplies are destabilizing, particularly those mentioned by [UK Defense Secretary Ben] Wallace. “They exacerbate the situation, making it even bloodier. Apparently, those are new, high-precision weapons. “Naturally, our armed forces will view them as a legitimate targetthose supplies get through the Ukrainian border.” President Zelensky said his troops had taken back at least  towns, including Irpin and the Hostomel air base on the outskirts of the capital.It also regained control of the heavily contaminated Chernobyl nuclear site. He said that while Ukrainian forces had regained  towns in the Kyiv region, the battle raging in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region and Kharkiv remained “extremely dficult”. Zelensky said: “The occupiers are withdrawing forces in the north of our country. The withdrawal is slow but noticeable. “Somewhere they are expelled with battles. Somewhere they leave positions on their own.” The MoD said Russian forces were withdrawing from the area around Kyiv, as Ukrainian forces advanced. The MoD’s intelligence assessment said: “Ukrainian forces continue to advance against withdrawing Russian forces in the vicinity of Kyiv.  “Along the north western axis, Ukrainian forces’ attempts to advance from Irpin towards Bucha and Hostomel are ongoing. “Russian forces are reported to have withdrawn from Hostomel airport, which has been subject to fighting since the first day of the conflict. “Along the eastern axis, Ukraine has re-taken several villages.” Zelensky said more than , people had escaped the besieged Mariupol – which has faced weeks of ferocious Russian shelling – through a humanitarian corridor in a convoy of buses and cars. At least , have been killed in the city and the estimated , who remain face shortages of food, water and electricity. Defence sources last night said that Nato is planning to send tanks to Ukraine.  Polish T-s could start arriving in days. Zelenskyy has been calling on Nato to send tanks and aircraft to help force the Russians out of his country. Putin’s negotiators this week said that Russian forces would ease back from attacks on Kyiv and northern Ukraine although shelling has continued and there is a fear that they are simply regrouping. Colonel Richard Kemp, a former British Infantry commander, said: “It’s not clear whether the Russians were ever intending to fight through Kiev street by street. “It is more likely Putin hoped Zelensky would capitulate as soon as Russia invaded and Kiev was threatened. “Encircling Kiev may also have been intended to fix Ukrainian forces in the city, preventing reinforcements being sent south and east to defend against Russian offensive action there. “It looks like they now wish to withdraw forces from the Kiev area to complete operations in Donbas. “That does not mean they won’t continue to attack Kiev and the surrounding area with artillery and air.” The UK has insisted it will not put troops on the ground in Ukraine but, along with NATO allies, it will supply defensive support to President Zelensky’s troops. The UK provided , anti-tank weapons.

The Ukrainian has shot down two Russian jets and a helicopter in the week since she left university to join the war effort. Sources say the woman has become an expert at firing the Igla surface-to-air missile launcher – which ironically is Russian-made. Her identity is being kept secret amid fears Russian agents will try to assassinate her. At least  Russian aircraft are believed to have been destroyed in the war so far. Defence sources have said that one of the aircraft destroyed is believed to have been an SU-, combat aircraft. A source said: “The Ukrainians have had a lot of success with surface-to-air missiles.The young student who has shot down three aircraft is one of the reasons why Russia does not control the air.”Meanwhile Russia yesterday vowed to target high-precision defensive weapons being sent to Ukraine from Britain, claiming they only worsened bloodshed.Andrey Kelin, Putin’s UK ambassador, issued the warning after reports that a Russian helicopter had been shot down by a portable high-velocity anti-air missile called Starstreak, supplied by the UK.An online video showed the tail being shot off an Mi-N helicopter over Ukraine’s eastern Luhansk region.

They work well in a sunny or partially shaded area in fertile well-drained soil.Climbing jasmine can be highly scented, with ieties that flower in summer and winter. All produce pretty flowers and are fairly easy to grow against walls or up trellis.There are some fun options for kids to plant such as sunflowers, snapdragons and the four o#clock flower.If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o#clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock # so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.You will need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot. Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types # bush and cordon. Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall, supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.According to the Royal Horticultural Society, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom. Expect the inevitable April showers but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn.It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors. Just watch out for frosts.Top three jobs this month:"},{"url":null,"title":"mozart to jazz trio ecossaise delight ardrishaig","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwards.Subscribe NowMid Argyll Arts Associationwas delighted to welcome Trio Ecossaise as guest performers at Ardrishaig Public Hall for the fourth concert of the season.The impact of Covid has meant that many planned concerts had to be cancelled or dates changed so it was wonderful to have Trio Ecossaise perform on March .The concert opened with the Kegelstatt Trio by Mozart. Much of the chamber music that Mozart composed was music for friends to perform and this trio is just one of these.Originally composed for clarinet, viola and piano, the viola part can be performed on cello as Harriet ably demonstrated. Very typically Mozart # easy to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable.On to the Craftsbury Trio, written by the American Gwyneth Walker. This trio has four movements, each depicting the small town of Craftsbury, Vermont.Up Country Toccata, The Lark in the Morning, You Can Buy It at the General Store, to the final movement Craftsbury Common depicting the green with a white picket fence.The movements are as descriptive as their titles and show many dferent skills on all instruments # fluttering sounds, jazz harmonies, numerous glissandos, syncopation, decorations and finishing with gentle rhythmic tapping.There is even a hint of Rhapsody in Blue in the third movement. If you only listen to one piece again this is the one and should be seen live,possible, and not just listened to.Rachmaninov’s Prelude in B minor for solo piano was Claire’s choice for the programme.This prelude, The Bell was Rachmaninov’s own favourite and was the one that he would often perform. The audience was delighted to be introduced to it by Claire.Brahms composed four chamber works which featured the clarinet later in le after a period when he wasn’t writing anything at all.This was the third trio of the evening and was again very dferent in style allowing Jenner , Harrietand Claireto demonstrate their considerable skills as a trio to a very appreciative audience.An arrangement of Consolation No. by Liszt for Trio Ecossaise was their encore.This was the second visit by Trio, and it is only a matter of time before they are welcomed back.There are two MAAA concerts planned for April # The Willow Trioand the Ugly Bug Ragtime Three.

established in the region to deal with a range of low level anti-social behaviour, including dog fouling, parking and minor crimes.At the time, the £, annual cost to local tax payers was felt necessary because of a lack of regular officers patrolling the area.The CAT provided the option of deploying dedicated officers in a high profile way to tackle issues impacting on communities.But despite what Mr McAteer calls “limited success” in  Scottish Borders Council decided to double the numbers of the CAT at an increased cost to the tax payer of £,.Mr McAteer, a former detective chief superintendent head with Lothian and Borders Police, said: “This sizeable investment has not produced the expected benefits and perhaps is being managed in a less than transparent way within Scottish Borders Council.“This substantial investment in policing was made at the same time that this council decided to remove town centre CCTV across the Borders leaving our communities vulnerable and forcing many to fund their own systems.“Recent statistics, disclosed at a private council meeting, supported evidence that little material change has taken place and consequently the continued support for the CAT cannot be justied.”Mr McAteer said his views were not a criticism of the officers in the team who “have tried their best despite challenging operational pressures”.He added: “I do believe there is an alternative and more effective use of the recurring £, and have suggested the council establish an ‘in-house’ enforcement team that could deal at a very local level with unacceptable

Baby young cod are not caught in prawn creels. The scientists at the Rural Affairs Committee meeting on March  said that there was zero evidence for creels to be included in the ban, and that the previous evidence cited on the Scottish Government website had now been removed.Our MSP represented to the creel fishermen in Campbeltown that she would:.    Seek a relaxation of the ban to enable the creel fishermen to continue to work as per the scientic evidence advice..    Seek compensation for the creel fishermen for almost three months loss of income.However, in the event she VOTED.    To keep the ban in place.    Against compensation.This is absolutely duplicitous.

If you look at a sunflower, you can’t help but smile. Not only does it remind us of the sun, but its head will track the sun through the sky and wherever the light is a sunflower will find it.Snapdragons are great because they come in a iety of colours and sizes, and you can pinch the blossoms so they open and shut just like a dragon’s mouth.Snapdragon flowers are specically designed for bumblebees, which are just the right weight to trip the opening mechanism of the lower lip of the flower to gain access to the nectar.The four o’clock flower, also known as the marvel of Peru, is a bushy plant with trumpet-shaped flowers in shades of pink, yellow or white.The fragrant flowers don’t open until late afternoon, around four o’clock – so they are good for telling the time.If you are growing your own vegetables, now is a good time to start sowing tomatoes, so you can enjoy them throughout the summer.To grow tomatoes successfully, you need rich, fertile soil or peat-free potting compost, and a good sunny, sheltered spot.Water regularly and feed regularly once the plants start to flower.Tomatoes are split into two main growing types – bush and cordon.Bush types are usually planted in containers and their stems trail around the edge. Cordon types are trained to grow tall and are supported by a cane or stake and will require pinching out.Growing tomatoes from seed is best done under cover, into seed trays, then when the seedlings get to -cm tall, transplant to small cm pots. Keep potting on as they grow in size.They can be planted outside with cane supports once the last frosts have gone, so around May time.For best results, choose trusted ieties like Gardener#s Delight, Money Maker or Sweet Olive.As usual, April really kick-starts the gardening season.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, spring is finally in evidence as daffodils and flowering trees start to bloom.#Expect the inevitable April showers this month but with sunny days too, when you can turn your attention to the lawn,# said a spokesperson.#It#s an exciting month, with indoor-sown seeds well into growth, and it#s also time to start sowing outdoors.

Now the Bingo shops are open from  in the morning and you can imagine the type they bring into the place – busloads of people and the experience of the residents has been disgusting. When the place empties they just use the first door they come to as a public toilet.“I have seen it all happen before, it is just the first seeds of destruction for North Berwick. It will finish the place. It will finish the High Street.” ...and  years agoChildren at Saltoun school enjoyed “amusing conjuring tricks”, told The Haddingtonshire Courier on March , .Through the generosity of Mrs Fletcher of Saltoun, the pupils attending the public school here were entertained to a treat on Friday evening. The first part of the entertainment consisted of a number of clever and amusing conjuring tricks, performed by a gentleman from Edinburgh.The children watched the tricks being performed with great interest, and many of them departed for home fully under the impression that they knew how the tricks were done. The children then sat down to an excellent tea and did ample justice to all the good things provided."},{"url":null,"title":"tranent-travel-agents-closes-premises-operate-part-time-home","story":"Location Travel Agency, an independent agency located on Tranent High Street founded in March , is operated by Keith Hutchison.Due to the impact of the Covid- pandemic, Keith has made the dficult decision to permanently close the shop and work part-time from home.He said: “The pandemic has been very hard for the travel industry and the high street in particular.“Travel is starting to pick up again, but not anywhere near the levels we saw before the pandemic, so we as a business need to cut costs down.“All customers with bookings have already been contacted.”Location Travel Agency will continue to operate from home on Tuesdays and Thursdays, between am and pm, and Saturdays from am to noon until the end of May.Keith added that details for the business moving forward after May would be disclosed in due course.Contact the agency on  ."},{"url":null,"title":"inaugural-east-lothian-council-young-musician-year-taking-place-haddington","story":"Sixteen musicians will perform a five-minute programme in the afternoon to a  of judges.Then, later that evening, about  will be invited to perform their full eight-minute programme in a gala concert to an audience of parents, family members and music lovers.The evening gala, at St Mary’s Parish Church, will also feature a performance from East Lothian’s newly formed senior brass ensemble, which brings together nine of the top brass players from across the county’s six secondary schools.The event is the inaugural East Lothian Council Young Musician of the Year and Jonathan Gawn is part of the judging .East Lothian Council’s instrumental music service team manager and low brass coach for the National Youth Concert Band of Great Britain will be joined by musician Christine McGinley, who is currently sub-principal horn with the Scottish Ballet Orchestra.Jonathan said: “We are very excited to be able to offer this performance opportunity to our talented young musicians and have been delighted to see so many enter.“St Mary’s is a beautul building and with this being our first live public performance since the pandemic, I personally can’t wait to hear our young people perform.”Seats can be reserved at bit.ly wJMCXY and the evening concert starts at pm."},{"url":null,"title":"meet-band-named-lane-dunbar---now-recording-debut-album-germany","story":"Logan’s Close – named after a narrow lane off the High Street in the founding members’ home town of Dunbar – have finished their UK tour and ventured to Hamburg to start work on Heart-Shaped Jacuzzi.The band were formed in  by Carl Marah and Scott Rough, and they are busy raising thousands of pounds to make their dream a reality.A crowdfunder campaign is already under way, with the band, which now includes Sean Morrison, Stuart Neil and Gavin Lamont, offering ious incentives for people to donate.The money collected will go towards the task of producing the album, which is hoped will be released next year.Carl, who plays electric guitar, said before their departure: “That moment where we are literally holding the album in our hands, it represents eight years of being in this band.“Having something like that to look at, and everything we have learned over these years and everything that has happened – it is a huge part of our lives.“To see the real thing, a tangible thing, a culmination of that work on a disc, would be pretty special.”Carl and Scott, who also plays guitar as well as lead vocals, formed “the rock-solid defence” of a Dunbar Colts team when they were younger and went on to bond over a love of s music.Since then, the pair have moved away from cover versions to writing their own material.As to the origins of the band’s name, Carl and Scott previously lived on the town’s Woodbush Court, with three-foot-wide Logan’s Close the quickest way to High Street.Carl said: “When we were thinking of what to call the band, the idea of making that close one day as famous as Abbey Road was pretty amusing to us, so we went with that.”The band had previously been looking forward to heading out to Germany but revealed they had run into an unexpected problem: the studio exploded.A huge bang destroyed much of the building in the early hours of the morning at the end of May last year.Carl, , said that the setback almost “scuppered” their plans but the studio equipment had now been moved to a new location.He added: “We are going to Hamburg to record the album because before the pandemic we did a wee tour there.“On our travels, we met a guy called Dennis Rux, who was saying he had got a studio with all the analogue vintage gear. My eyes lit up and I was already thinking that was cool.“We stayed in touch and it got to the stage where we thought maybe we should pursue this. We hit him up and askedhe would be up for doing the album and we worked it out and are going over there to do it.“We cannot wait.”Logan’s Close, who headlined the Dunbar Music Festival last year, created the Crowdfunder page in a bid to raise thousands of pounds to cover the cost of the album.People can make a donation of anywhere between £ and £, in exchange for a range of incentives, including a digital download of the finished album and a live concert.The band are working alongside Creative Scotland’s Crowdmatch programme, where the national body match-funds initiatives as the band reach funding milestones.Already, more than £, has been raised.Former Dunbar Grammar School pupil Carl described the sum raised as “unreal”.He said: “We have not been up to much in such a long time [due to the pandemic].“It is nice to think that after two years, people are still supporting us.

Then we have the institutionalised cultural corruption of the corporate lobbying, directorships, revolving doors and political donations .It has been alleged that the way the UK Government handled bids for supplying personal protective equipmentand other Covid- response contracts was biased in favour of those with political access. Some  contracts have been identied as possibly corrupt, some  per cent of contracts awarded between the beginning of the pandemic and November . How did this happen  Well, safeguards to prevent corruption were suspended. The cost to the taxpayer  This has been estimated at £. billion. That’s a lot of ferries.I am sure this will be met with charges of \"special pleading\", that independence supporters would let the SNP off with anything at all, that it is \"whataboutery\". However, as the saying goes, \"in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king\" and we should judge governments by their actions in the round, and not just focus on a single one, or only those where they have come up short. In this regard it is interesting that little is heard about free university tuition, no prescription charges, the baby box, free nursery care, the Scottish Child Payment , lowest student loan debt in the UK, water still being publicly owned, to identy only a small sample.Perhaps though its most signicant achievement is no Russian oligarchs around Holyrood, or indeed cash for questions or for access, or awarding contracts worth millions to the pals of government ministers. One might expect Holyrood, and the Scottish Government, to \"learn\" from Westminster, but there are some lessons it has missed, and that is to our benefit.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.* BOB McDougall may be right, he may be wrong, but one thing is for sure: given that everything in le is relative – fat-thin, tall-short, empty-full and so on – this SNP Government is as close to perfection as possible compared to the Johnson Government. Whether the criteria is ability or attitude, humanitarian, level of achievement, or anything , compared to the current Conservative Government in London this SNP Government is very good indeed.George Archibald, West Linton.PARTY IS JUST A MEANS TO AN ENDBOB McDougall seems to think that were Scotland to achieve independence, it would become a one-party state, permanently ruled by the SNP. Unionists often peddle this myth in an attempt to sway voters.As the only party supporting independence, the SNP is a necessary means to that end. When we achieve independence, the other parties will accept that reality and make their own cases to the electorate.The only reason the SNP would be in government would be because both its record in government and its electoral manesto appealed to a sufficient number of the electorate. That’s how democracy works.John McCallum, Glasgow.INDYREF THE BIGGEST THREAT TO SCOTLANDNEVER known to shy away from problems, unless it is to do with the ferries crisis, Nicola Sturgeon continues to promote her  independence referendum with vigour. She claims the \"biggest threat\" is not seizing the chance for independence and is now claiming there is \" massive potential\" in independence.The key word here is \"potential\", which can suggest success but equally can end in failure. On its own it does not signal which of these outcomes is more likely. When you leave this aside and just consider the position of Scotland today in a war-torn, energy-strapped, climate-crisis world the chances of success drop off exponentially, especially given the Scottish Governments current poor track record in health, education, industry, transport, the economy and even its own climate change targets.In light of all of this the biggest threat to Scotlands potential is actually Indyref itself.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow.REFLECTIONS ON SILLINESSON being told by Aberdeenshire Council to remove pro-separatist signage from his garden, erected without planning consent, Alex Salmond responded by asking \"how much money [has been] wasted on this bureaucratic silliness\". Many of us ask the same question about the SNP administration under his and his successors leadership.Martin Redfern, Melrose.WHY JOHNSON MUST RESIGNFORMER Prime Minister David Cameron’s notorious description of his Old Etonian Bullingdon Club alumni Boris Johnson as a \"greased piglet\"’ is surely an apt characterisation of the man now occupying  Downing Street.Mr Johnson behaves like an entitled Arthur Daley – minus car coat and cigar – and now looks set to evade culpability, and the conventional resignation required of any MP, and especially a government minister, found guilty of misleadingParliament.Partygate is his Achilles heel and should signal his fall from what little grace he can muster, and from elected office ample broadcast evidence exists of him, inside Parliament and beyond, insisting on multiple occasions that, “all guidance was followed completely”and even, at times, bizarrely, that there were no parties.The threat of Tory MPs submitting sufficient letters to the  Committee during the Russian invasion of Ukraine has receded, gting the \"greased piglet\" a convenient get out of jail free card. But now he is insulting the nation’s intelligence, passing the buck and insisting he personally broke no Covid rules, splitting hairs with the anaemic excuse that he had been \"repeatedly assured” by others unidentied that there had been full compliance at all times.But there is a huge, gaping hole in the PM’s slippery, oleaginous alibi he was there, in the room, attending at least three of the said parties, or \"gatherings\" as he prefers to describe them. There is photographic evidence of a party in his No  flat – his home, not his office – and further corroboration of his birthday party in the Cabinet Room no question, no doubt, bang to rights.Prime Minister or no Prime Minister , war in Ukraine or no war in Ukraine, he must, for once, take responsibility and resign, and,not, immediately revoke every single fine and criminal record handed out to thousands of ordinary citizens for their breaches of Covid laws.Mike Wilson, Longniddry.RAIL PROPOSALS WILL COST TOO MUCHI WAS interested in the proposals detailed in your article on the Railfuture Scotland list of new railway stations across the Scottish network .As someone who has recently retired after nearly  years working in the railway industry I recognised many of the locations mentioned. During part of my Railtrack and Network Rail employment many of these were investigated and the cost of providing an attractive level of service at an affordable price to the taxpayer could not be justied. Whilst climate change and other world energy influences have changed the UK and Scottish governments strategies on public transport, any network enhancement must be affordable.The Edinburgh South Suburban Line passenger service would require changes to the signalling on the line to reduce headways, and, more importantly, capacity in the Haymarket to Portobello rail corridor would have to be created.This capacity issue was also a factor in the proposed Carlisle to Glasgow local service via the West Coast Main Line not being progressed. The provision of new stations at Beattock, Abington, Symington and Law would have had an adverse impact on cross-border passenger and freight services. This particular route is seeing increased freight and logistics use, which makes the introduction of any local service very challenging.The introduction of one new station on an existing railway will add a minute of three minutes to existing end-to-end journey times. This also has to be factored into existing services at strategic centres such as Edinburgh Waverley and Glasgow Central.These are an ambitious set of proposals but the cost to the taxpayer will be high and it may be that light railor electric and hydrogen buses offer a better solution.Kevin A McCarthy, Glasgow.STRIKING THE WRONG NOTEIAIN Macwhirter is wrong when he writes that Cardf Philharmonic Orchestra removed Tchaikovsky compositions from its programme because he was Russian . The orchestra will, in fact play three concerts later this year with music by Rachmaninov, Prokofiev and Rimsky-Korsakov, all of whom were Russian.Orchestra members were uneasy about playing Marche Slav opus , and Overture  opus  with their Russian nationalism and triumphalism as well as Symphony No, which is nicknamed \"Little Russian\". The Overture  with its cannon fire and the former Russian national anthem was considered particularly inappropriate. Considering that one orchestral members partner is from Ukraine and still has family members trapped there, the orchestras management agreed to delete these items from the programme for now.Hugh Brennan, Kilbirnie."},{"url":null,"title":"world-heritage-status-bid-landmark-scottish-football-sites-steps","story":"With just six months to go before the th anniversary of the first ever international match staged in Glasgow, and which coincides with the World Cup in Qatar, campaigners calling for Scotland to be recognised as the birthplace of football are pulling out all the stops in their bid for UNESCO status.They have recently launched Hampdens Square Mile Alliance to help push for historic sites which have been linked to the formation of the modern game to be given their rightful place.Footballs Square Mile has been hailed by campaigners as the cradle of modern football, where some early players, known as the ‘Scotch Professors’, founded the modern passing and running game of football.Read more: Hampden site: Kick off for historic grounds Unesco world heritage bidIncluded in the square mile are the birthplaces of Queens Park, Celtic and Third Lanark, the site of Rangers first game, and the final resting place of several Scotch Professors.And now campaigners are hoping to spread the word even further as a series of walking tours will be launched next weekend and follows on from a the successful tours held last year.  The Three Hampdens Walking Tour kicks off on Sunday, April  with tours running through until September.

Gov. Macquarie has been credited with helping to shape modern Australia, however, he also ordered the massacre of indigenous people who resisted settlers who had taken their land.His grave, near Salen on the Isle of Mull, is maintained by the National Trust of Australia and inscribed “The Father of Australia”.As well as Australian-themed plants and areas designed to provide peaceful spots for reflection, the revived garden will also pay homage to the Hooker family of Victorian plant hunters who had links with Lochbuie, and the Beatons of Mull, the family of doctors who from the th century onwards provided medical care to the Lords of the Isles and a string of monarchs.The first Beaton doctor is said to have saved the le of a chief of Lochbuie who was suffering from a serious throat abscess, by brewing a vile tasting herbal potion. The mixture was given to people to taste before being given to the chief, who laughed so much at their expressions of disgust, that he strained his throat and inadvertently cleared the troublesome abscess.The same medic is said to have used the treatment to save another girl’s le after she swallowed at a tadpole which, legend has it, grew into a frog.From the th to th century there were more than  physicians linked to the family, with their skills in high demand from kings and clan leaders.The revival of the garden is being supported by the CalMac Community Fund, which provides grant funds to non-profit groups in areas across the ferry network.The latest rounds of the Fund, delivered in partnership with Foundation Scotland, has provided grants for west coast community groups spanning sport, mental health, social isolation and environment.The revival of the walled garden within Aros Park, just outside Tobermory, comes decades after the grand Tudor Gothic style house which it once served was destroyed as part of an Army explosives training exercise.The house was originally planned as a winter residence for Lt-Col Hugh Maclean of Coll, the last laird of Coll, but was never fully completed because he ran out of money.It was eventually bought by wealthy shipping heir Bryce Allan, one of five brothers involved in the family-run Allan Line, which traded between Scotland and Canada and became the inspiration for s television drama, The Onedin Line.One brother, Sir Hugh Allan of Ravenscrag, developed commercial interests in Canada which propelled him to a fortune of around £ million by the time of his death in .However, Bryce Allan’s descendants struggled to maintain the grand property on Mull, and it was sold in  and stripped it of its fixtures and fittings.With walls too thick for easy demolition, the house was destroyed in  by the Army.The Aros estate was taken over by the Forestry Commission in , however, the walled garden was not originally included and instead left to grow wild. It was recently taken over by the Mull and Iona Community Trust.Lauren Fraser, of the group carrying out the restoration, says the finished walled garden will provide a space for gatherings and peaceful contemplation.“It’s a big challenge, and at the moment you need a bit of imagination,” she adds. “In its current state, the garden is more akin to wilderness than a cultivated space.“It has been abandoned for decades and as a result, what was once a productive and impressive space is now all but impassable, overgrown with bracken and invasive rhododendron ponticum and dominated by self-seeded trees, roots and fallen timber, making it an unappealing and unsafe space.”The revamped garden is intended to provide benefits for mental and physical health, with opportunities for locals and visitors to volunteer and join workshops, and with parts of the garden designed particularly for quiet meditation and sensory benefit.An open area of lawn will also provide space for community performances.The initial phase of the project will involve repairing the unusual lime mortar stone wall, creating paths and preparing the ground for planting.

Any organism can be analysed.”Just as genomic sequencing has enabled scientists to track the emergence and spread of distinct Covid iants, it is expected to become a routine tool to pinpoint mutations in everything from legionella to Clostridium dficile and guide treatment and outbreak responses.Recently, Brown - an expert in Salmonella - used the technique to identy that two cases of the bacterial infection in Scotland were part of a UK-wide cluster affecting around  people.The outbreak, which sickened some young children and infants, was ultimately traced to a Lithuanian supplier of dead mice: pet owners were falling ill after feeding the infected rodents to snakes and other reptiles.Sequencing labs across Europe reported matching results and imports into the UK were banned.As well as rapid and highly accurate monitoring, information new strains and potentially worrying mutations can now be shared and compared internationally in real-time.“In the past samples would have to be packaged up and mailed around the world,” said Brown.“Obviously that was much slower, but potentially dangerous too - these are harmful pathogens.”Derek Brown with one of the GRI labs £, genomic sequencing machines To date, over , versions of Salmonella have been logged on the worldwide database.One particular Salmonella strain, known as XDR, has mutations which make it highly drug resistant. It is becoming more common but does respond to a lesser used antibiotic, azithromycin.Slowing or preventing the rise of antibiotic resistance is expected to be one of the most important uses of genomic sequencing for public health.Failing to do so would send humanity back to the \"dystopian pre-antibiotic days\", notes Leonard, when a quarter of patients died from post-operative infections.So far thousands of genes associated with antimicrobial resistance have been identied, with more added to the database all the time.: From Joseph Lister to X-rays - how Glasgow Royal Infirmary changed medicineLeonard believes the next five to  years will see a growth in \"personalised medicine\" to combat infections, driven by increased reliance on genomic sequencing.\"Well see a tailoring of drugs to particular strains - so an infected patient would be given the most appropriate antibiotic based on rapid sequencing of their bacterial isolates,\" he said.Sequencing is also important to understanding outbreaks and transmission, both in the community and in hospitals.Back in , Dr Diane Lindsay - GRIs legionella expert - worked with colleagues at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh to investigate a fatal outbreak of legionnaires disease in the capital linked to cooling towers.Sequencing revealed a \"really surprising\" ersity in the genetic make-up of the bacteria causing infections, including unexpected mutations associated with increased virulence.Dr Diane Lindsay, an expert in legionella More recently Lindsay has been monitoring an increase in Scottish cases of legionella longbeachae - so-called because it was first isolated from a patient in Long Beach, Calornia.\"Its a bit of a mystery,\" said Lindsay.\"Were seeing gardeners becoming infected - isolated cases rather than outbreaks. Probably from handling compost.\"To understand just how mammoth a task infection control can be it is worth noting that the average person has  times as many organisms living on and inside them as they do human cells.Staphylococci are the most common of all infectious organisms. Around  per cent of the population carry Staphylococcus aureus in their nose, and another % will pick it up intermittently.: Is Italys revolutionary mental health model finally coming to Scotland Around  to , samples are isolated from patients every year in Scotland. Mostly it is harmless, but around  samples a year are sent to GRI for sequencingthere is suspected cross-transmission.\"Its a sliding scale from harmless to an infection that will kill someone within  hours, depending on the strain or the patients condition,\" said Dr Andrew Robb, GRIs staphylococci specialist.\"Usually its not particularly virulent but its a good indicator for infection control because it is passed on through touch, and on surfaces.\"Dr Andrew Robb One of the advantages of DNA mutations - or RNA mutations in the case of viruses - is that they tend to occur at a fairly predictable rate, depending on the organism, which helps infection scientists to gauge whether a bug is spreading in a particular environment - such as a hospital ward.Dr Aleks Marek, a consultant microbiologist and senior infection control doctor at GRI, said: \"Covid is known not to mutate that quickly, so just because two people have got exactly the same strain and they happen to be in the same place, it doesnt necessarily mean theyve given it to each other.\"In the case of Staph aureus, weve been doing whole genome sequencing for a very long time so we have an idea of how long it takes for mutations to develop.\"That gives us an idea thatan isolate is this close to another there probably has been a transmission event, whereas this close probably doesnt mean theres been a transmission.\"Whole genome sequencing can also tell us whether the bacteria causing infection has a resistance determinant, and whether thats arising inidually in the community multiple times or whether theres some sort of spread going on.\"Soa particular resistant organism did look very similar in all the samples then we might start to think is there some spread , or the oppositeyouve got lots of bugs that look quite dferent genetically but happen share this one resistance gene.\"That helps to guide our response.\"Were really at the start of the journey with using whole genome sequencing, but more and more organisms are starting to come online. I think over the next while well start to use it much more.\""},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

Now, many highly-skilled people have found themselves unemployed for the first time, and are considering new roles in new sectors.

We did not expect the extremely positive and proactive response we received from the jobcentre. The team was very helpful,# said Jordan.The support Elite got from the jobcentre was invaluable in streamlining and accelerating its recruitment process which would take up to five weeks.#Now, the jobcentre advertises our vacancies via a sector-based work academy.#Candidates attend a two-week course at Weston College, Yeovil, to gain their Scaffolding Operative Training Scheme and Health  Safety Certications, as well as to prepare for an interview. Now when we interview candidates, they already have a scaffold labourer trainee card and the basic knowledge and understanding of the scaffolding industry. What’s more, all this support via the jobcentre comes without the additional fees of private agencies.#Out of seven candidates, six were offered jobs and five have remained with Elite which has  qualied operatives.#The process was seamless and effective, providing quality candidates who were keen to learn.#Working with the jobcentre is a no brainer! As well as alleviating the burden of interviews that don’t progress into jobs, the savings in cost and time to get candidates suitably qualied are a bonus. It takes the pressure off our own resources and provides top quality candidates in the process.#‘Delighted’: Simon, Employer Adviser, Yeovil JobCentreOnce approached by Elite Scaffolding, also based in Yeovil, he set up a meeting with one of its office managers and worked out a bespoke recruitment package.As part of the programme, he contacted the local Weston College and together they “built” the course content.At the end of the two-week course, six candidates were offered a place on the apprenticeship scheme at a starting salary of £,.#Elite had exhausted all other channels to recruit and were delighted with the outcome#, he said.Moreover Elite referred other local employers to the jobcentre and Simon is running another sector-based work academy with a local roofing company.#The jobcentre has an incredible pool of talent.

Everything went through really quickly.#Continued the  year-old: “My team at JD were great from day one. They made me feel welcome and supported me. I spent six months on the placement and I got paid, too. It’s a proper job which was exactly what I needed. Day to day, I’d look after anything from HR queries and issuing contracts to payroll and pension questions. It gave me a whole picture of what it’s like to work in HR and I’ve been doing it ever since.“After six months, there was the option to stay on and I’m now doing an apprenticeship with JD. Once I’d finished with the placement I got started on a qualication – CIPD level three in HR support. It was another perfect step for me and I’ve now been there for a year. Now I’m learning about dferent parts of HR, building on what I was doing on the placement.

He might have more competition and he might be a year older, but at the moment he is doing really well.”Fabianski will line up opposite England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, a player Moyes knows well, when West Ham host Everton on Sunday.“I think Jordan is a really good keeper. I had him at Sunderland. He was great.

But it is also the stream – the carrying stream – slowly weathering stone, flowing ever on from generation to generation."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4553935.jpg--.jpg?1648651423000\n","title":"wrightbus continues recruitment search with 50 new jobs","story":"WORLD leading bus manufacturer Wrightbus is hosting a recruitment evening on Thursdayas it continues to bolster its ranks with an additional  staff after an increase in orders.The Ballymena-based company is launching the second phase of its recruitment drive ready for an increase in the production schedule after Easter. It has attracted hundreds of people to similar events held earlier this year, with numerous job offers made on the spot after express interviews.Wrightbus’ recruitment evenings provide prospective employees with the opportunity to look around the company’s Galgorm factory and speak to company managers and the HR team about potential career opportunities.The firm had previously announced it was looking to recruit an additional  people as orders for its buses flooded in. This time, it’s especially keen to attract more women.“We’ve taken on a number of new staff so far this year, which is fantastic - but we still have roles available that we need to fill,” said Wrightbus HR director, Nicola McCloskey.“Our staff work in great conditions on some of the world’s leading zero emission technology, which is helping to make a real dference to climate change.“We’re especially keen to get more women into the workforce, as most of the interest we’ve had to date has been from men. “I think there’s a bit of a misconception that the work we do here is all very physically demanding, but we’ve got many dferent roles across the factory.“We’d encourage anyone interested in joining us to pre-book a slot. All our jobs will be posted on the company’s website and social media accounts.” Wrightbus is at the forefront of the zero emission public transport movement.

This increase will see the yearly gas bill of a typical household with a credit meter rise by about pound per year to pound,. Those customerswith a prepayment gas meterwill see costs increase by around pound per year to pound,. Raymond Gormley, Head of Energy Policy at the Consumer Council said: “It is important that consumers are made aware that their domestic gas bills will stay high for at least the next year because the wholesale price that the companies pay for the gas continues to be much more expensive than the norm. Unfortunately heating oil prices are also very high, so regardless of the fuel we use, many of us will experience extreme pressure on our household budgets. This will further increase the numbers of people in fuel poverty, as many families may struggle to find the extra money they will now need to pay for heating. “As the Winter   Emergency Fuel Payment Scheme ends today , we implore firmus energy, and the wider energy industry, to commit to financially supporting the continuation of a fuel hardship scheme in the coming financial year. For the longer term, it is clear that energy companies, policy makers, the Utility Regulator, charities and the Consumer Council must continue to work together to develop sustainable solutions to help support those in need as the problem of high energy prices will likely be with us for the foreseeable future.” Consumers who are struggling to pay their energy bills or struggling to pay to top-up their meter should contact their supplier directly for support.

The SDLP#s MP for the area, Claire Hanna, who romped home in the last general election with some , votes, around , more than the nearest candidate — expressed her shock at the turn of events. The constituency is also larger than East and West Belfast and is the most erse of all NI#s electoral areas, ing MLAs from five dferent parties: SDLP, DUP, Alliance, Sinn Fein and Greens. There is a term for this move by Sinn Fein we are all too familiar with: gerrymandering.What is most curious about this move is that, back in , proposed changes to electoral boundaries here that would seemingly have favoured the DUP were branded “gerrymandering to placate” Northern Ireland#s largest unionist party by Sinn Fein. This criticism was not voiced by one Sinn Fein representative or party spokesperson at the time, but at least half a dozen, in what was essentially a media blitz in a bid to put a spanner in the proposals.What is even more curious is that press statements on Sinn Fein#s website referring to said gerrymandering have vanished. If you simply google “Sinn Fein on gerrymandering” and click on any of the ious links which previously directed to statements from Conor Murphy, Colm Gildernew, Francie Molloy and others on the Sinn Fein website, you are greeted with the following  error message, reading: “We#re sorry, but the page you requested could not be found on our servers. We may have recently moved, renamed, or deleted certain pages.”It seems, much like the party#s previous stance on Russia, they are simply trying to avoid accusations of double standards and prone to extreme stance-switching when it suits them.Read MoreSinn Fein defend proposals to redraw Belfast’s electoral boundariesAn April Fool’s wish listDaily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Ah, April Fool#s Day. Given the state of world at the minute — war in Europe, the cost of living crisis on the tail end of a pandemic that hasn#t gone away - I was hoping we would give it a rest this year, lest we cause more unneeded distress. One humorous political wish list, however, was posted on Twitter by human rights organisation Participation and the Practice of Rights , reading: “‘Stick your hostile environment’ — Givan tells UK Home Office. ‘Mackies will be % social’ — Hargey takes action on housing rights. ‘Our policies are the problem, not you’ — Swann promises counsellors in every GP practice.” We can but dream.NI#s most unambiguous partyAn interesting press statement was released by the TUV on Friday, which declared that the party#s designation on the ballot paper for May#s poll will read: ‘TUV — No Sea Border’.Explaining the move, TUV leader Jim Allister said: “Having led where others have followed we wish every voter to see the issue identied without ambiguity on the ballot paper. There will be no doubt as to what a vote for TUV means.”Now, the TUV have been accused of being many things, but ‘ambiguous’ is definitely not one of them. Anyone with even a slight grasp of Northern Ireland politics could probably predict the party’s stance on any given issue before Jim Allister’s party has voiced its opinion. So this just seems like a needless waste of ink. I doubt anyone was going to be mistaken that they were actually voting for a bunch of liberal Europhiles.Related topicsSinn FéinSDLPConor MurphyClaire HannaMore On Sinn Féin PremiumGail WalkerOpinionThere’s an easy way for BBC NI to defend its broadcasters against toxic sectarian slurs PremiumPoles apart: politicians and experts split over election posters’ value PremiumSam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worseDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson claims Sinn Fein ‘solely focused’ on border poll PremiumCouncil concern for future of famous Derry store Austins amid fears it could collapseMost ReadCouncillor praises INLA killers of MP and Thatcher aide Airey NeaveFormer RTÉ and BBC football pundit arrested after being found passed out in car with children in the backSam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worseBelfast-made missile downs Russian chopper in UkraineA week on from her wedding and BBC’s Emma Vardy is back to work reporting from UkraineTop VideosPlayThe moment a Belfast made Starstreak missile shoots down a Russian helicopter PlayHarry Styles shares message of support for the people of UkrainePlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election Poles apart: politicians and experts split over election posters’ valueNorthern Ireland is the ‘begging bowl corner’ of the UK, Doug Beattie claimsSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatSam McBrideOpinionUlster Unionist Party’s all things to all people manesto involves ambition as well as populismAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: It’s battle stations for UUP, but indferent Tories need a nudgeLatestMurder victim Roy Reynolds filmed partying with suspect accused of killing him just hours laterCo Antrim dream house draws actress Jayne Wisener back to her home roots: ‘I moved back as I wanted to give my kids the lestyle I had as a child’Rathcoole residents left shaken exactly one year on from harrowing double murder-suicideKwarteng: Community consent must lead any decision on fracking or onshore windUkraine sees openings as Russia fixates on besieged Mariupol,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Graham Baalham-CurryAmy CochraneTwitterEmailApril   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailElection posters are on almost every lamppost on every corner of our towns and cities ahead of the big vote.Faces of the men and women hoping to take a seat at Stormont after May  stare down at us almost everywhere we go.But how effective are these posters as a form of advertising for would-be MLAs Some have argued they are a great way of showcasing the names and faces of candidates entering the election race, but others fear they are old-fashioned, crude and bad for the environment, with some placards also being stolen and placed on bonfires.Realistically, the only way to banish posters altogether isevery party agrees, but in Northern Ireland, consensus is a hard thing to achieve.According to PR expert Tom Kelly, posters and billboards are better at selling ideas here than in England, parts which have moved to more digital forms of canvassing.Mr Kelly, who has worked in PR for  years but also dabbled in politics as the former vice-chairman of the SDLP, told the Belfastposters could be a powerful advertising tool, even beyond facial and name recognition.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “There is a certain physical aspect to a poster or a billboard compared to just seeing the candidates’ faces on social media,” he said.“Not everyone can get to every constituent’s door, so [posters] a good way to get your face out there.“There’s also an element of competition between candidates where you may go to an area to canvas and you see your opponent’s name and face. “It makes you uneasy, and candidates really do get obsessed about how many posters they have up compared to others, so you’d be a brave man or woman to decide not to put them up. In reality, I would like to see none, but we aren’t quite there yet.”Mr Kelly used the Brexit referendum as an example of canvassing where posters and billboards influenced an outcome.“I remember crossing England in  and seeing the big Leave campaign billboard on the motorway from Manchester to Leeds,” he said. “You couldn’t not see it, and you started to notice they had a real presence.“Everyone remembers the big red bus that promised £m a week for the NHS. It may have been a lie, but it worked.“The Remain campaign, however, ignored those traditional forms of canvassing and instead focused solely on digital, whereas Leave did a bit of both.”While the PR expert sees merit in posters, they must be strategically placed.“I think most people would not want posters in their back yard but instead on main arterial routes in and out of towns and cities,” he said. “They could be a bit more effective in these areas, so as not to swamp residential areas.“For urban areas, billboards can be really effective, or a bus, whereas posters work better in rural areas.”Former Alliance party executive director Gerry Lynch believes that the colour, typeface and font of a poster can also have an impact.Mr Lynch, who was heavily involved in poster design and campaign tactics throughout his time in politics, explained: “Graphic designers have a very important job in elections that many don’t know.“Generally, Sinn Fein and Alliance would have the name of the party more prominent in the poster, and in some cases use posters with slogan words only and no photograph.“Unionist parties focus more on colour — reds and blues, which project strength — where they compete on which candidate can deliver the strongest for unionist interests.“It can come down to so many small details, even the fringing or shadowing on the image. “Graphic designers are able to express visual identity in a way most people don’t know. Even voters don’t know.”Mr Lynch, who was involved in the Alliance party for  years but is now a CoE priest based in England, said that in some areas across the water, particularly in southern counties, councils did not allow election posters in public spaces, with the tradition dying out over the years.“It’s a bit of a mix of digital canvassing and door-to-door, finding out where their supporters are and stopping voters from wavering to opponents,” he added.“While I don’t think posters with people’s heads on them make much of a dference on the campaign trail, Northern Ireland isn’t quite at the point yet where they can stop.“It requires everyone to stop — and everyone to agree.“I think a physical presence still matters, and the most impactful poster is one that resembles one of an advertising agency, more leaning towards a slogan than someone’s face.”The SDLP’s Colin McGrath has been involved in politics for almost two decades, being elected to his local council in  and becoming an MLA in . Next month’s election will be his sixth, and he believes that all posters should be banned.“They can be unsightly and many people don’t want to see them,” he said.“They’re also terrible for the environment, a waste of cardboard and plastic ties, but there is unfortunately an element of competition, which is the main motivator.“You see who has the most up where, and as soon as one puts theirs up, the others are at a disadvantage.“It can become white noise after a period of time, butyou’re a first-time candidate, you want to be part of the white noise everyone  is a part of. For things to change, it would need legislation.”Mr McGrath said posters mainly benefited new candidates but added that local media often played a bigger role.“Nine times out of , people say they recognise me from the local papers — the Mourne Observer or the Down Recorder — or sometimes social media and TV,” he explained. “Rarely do you win the election in the four or five weeks leading up to it. “People get to know you over the better part of a year or more.”TUV leader Jim Allister, however, believes that posters are “very much part of the fabric of an election”.The upcoming election will be Mr Allister’s fourth, after first being elected into the Assembly in .“Posters do serve a purpose, I believe, and an educational purpose as it shows voters who the relevant candidates are,” he told this newspaper.“They can also be a bit of a morale booster, in a sense, for each respective party.“They are very much part of the scenery of elections in Northern Ireland, and traditionally it has always happened.“There are occasions where you may see too many, but I don’t think that anyone here is going to give up on posters anytime soon.”Related topicsSDLPAlliance PartyJim AllisterSinn FéinColin McGrathTraditional Unionist VoiceMore On SDLP PremiumGail WalkerOpinionThere’s an easy way for BBC NI to defend its broadcasters against toxic sectarian slursAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From gerrymandering and an April Fools’ wish list to Northern Ireland’s most unambiguous party PremiumCouncil concern for future of famous Derry store Austins amid fears it could collapse PremiumSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatSDLP leader Colum Eastwood condemns attempts to intimidate candidatesMost ReadCouncillor praises INLA killers of MP and Thatcher aide Airey NeaveFormer RTÉ and BBC football pundit arrested after being found passed out in car with children in the backSam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worseBelfast-made missile downs Russian chopper in UkraineA week on from her wedding and BBC’s Emma Vardy is back to work reporting from UkraineTop VideosPlayThe moment a Belfast made Starstreak missile shoots down a Russian helicopter PlayHarry Styles shares message of support for the people of UkrainePlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election Andrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From gerrymandering and an April Fools’ wish list to Northern Ireland’s most unambiguous partyNorthern Ireland is the ‘begging bowl corner’ of the UK, Doug Beattie claimsSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatSam McBrideOpinionUlster Unionist Party’s all things to all people manesto involves ambition as well as populismAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: It’s battle stations for UUP, but indferent Tories need a nudgeLatestMurder victim Roy Reynolds filmed partying with suspect accused of killing him just hours laterEstelle Harris, Seinfeld and Toy Story actor, dies at What the papers say – April North Korea warns Seoul of ‘serious threat’ over missile remarkJenner Kupcho in the driver’s seat at the Chevron Championship,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit :Sinn FeinGarrett HarganTwitterEmailMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailA victims’ campaigner has questioned the use of the Europa Hotel as the setting for Sinn Fein’s election launch, saying it’s a venue the Provisional IRA “systematically bombed”.On Tuesday, Michelle O’Neill gave a speech at the Great Victoria Street hotel, which was bombed  times during the Troubles.She outlined Sinn Fein’s priorities ahead of the upcoming election including the cost of living crisis and “fiercely defending” the Good Friday Agreement.“The facts are that the balance of power at Stormont has shted irreversibly and political unionism must come to terms with the fact the world is moving on fast,” Ms O’Neill said.“So, while the DUP and the TUV are trying to take us backwards, our message is clear, we are only moving forward.”Commenting on the choice of venue, Kenny Donaldson, spokesman for Innocent Victims United said: Sinn Fein clearly don#t do irony, to bleat on about upholding democracy at the very venue which the Provisional IRA systematically attacked again and again, making it the most bombed hotel in Europe is brazen to say the least.However, due to the intensity of the Provisional IRA#s bombing campaign — and that of other terrorists, few hotel venues across Northern Ireland have come away unscathed by the Troubles.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up TUV South Belfast candidate Andrew Girvin said Sinn Fein’s campaign launch at the Europa was a “grotesque spectacle” given the setting.“Here we had the political wing of the terrorist organisation which repeatedly bombed the hotel in which they met daring to ponticate about democracy and respecting the will of the people.“There is nothing undemocratic about refusing to operate the Belfast Agreement structures which could foist a Sinn Fein First Minister upon Northern Ireland.“The choice of venue for this republican jamboree underscores the fact that no unionist should ever agree to take up the position of deputy to a Sinn Fein First Minister.“Yet just weeks out from the election both the DUP and UUP are dodging this vital question.Will they act as bridesmaid to Michelle O#Neill  Why is there reluctance to be open and honest with the public on this point ”The DUP#s Gordon Lyons said Sinn Fein#s election launch demonstrates their priority lies on holding a border poll rather than on helping families or rebuilding Northern Ireland’s economy.The party#s director of elections said: Sinn Fein#s rally was a show of strength for a border poll.“Whilst the DUP has a five-point plan to build a better future for Northern Ireland, Sinn Fein wants to win the election to implement their plan for a border poll.“There is a clear choice on offer to people whether they want a future focused on fixing our health system, tackling the cost of living crisis and replacing the protocol, or one fixated on a isive border poll.“When Michelle O#Neill talks about making history, we know it isn#t record levels of investment into our hospitals she is referring to. Now is not the time for ision and uncertainty.That is why this election is so important.Sinn Fein has been contacted for comment.Speaking at an election launch, Ms O’Neill said that Sinn Fein will defend but not renegotiate the Good Friday Agreement.The former Deputy First Minister said those who hanker for the past need to realise that there is no going back, only forward.Sinn Fein#s Stormont leader also described the DUP#s collapse of the Executive as political vandalism, although her own party also brought Stormont down in the same Assembly mandate.She said: When the Assembly, Executive and North South Ministerial Council were restored in January  it was with a shared commitment to deliver the public services, societal reforms and future that our people need and deserve.It was ambitious to form a five-party coalition Executive, but it was achieved, getting us back to genuine power-sharing, and thankfully so, because while everyone knew there would be challenges ahead, no one could have predicted that in only a matter of weeks that our Executive would be dealing with a global pandemic that would have such devastating impacts on every part of society, community and people#s lives and livelihoods.It is to the credit of all ministers from across the five parties that they responded and have worked with a unity of purpose, and unity of leadership for the past two years.This is what the public want to see more of — co-operation and delivery.Ms O#Neill added: Sinn Fein will be defending, not renegotiating the Good Friday Agreement now, or in the time ahead.Ms O#Neill said the May  election was the most important in a generation.Related topicsSinn FéinMichelle O#NeillIRACost of LivingTraditional Unionist VoiceGordon LyonsThe Executive OfficeMore On Sinn Féin PremiumGail WalkerOpinionThere’s an easy way for BBC NI to defend its broadcasters against toxic sectarian slurs PremiumPoles apart: politicians and experts split over election posters’ value PremiumSam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worseDUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson claims Sinn Fein ‘solely focused’ on border pollAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From gerrymandering and an April Fools’ wish list to Northern Ireland’s most unambiguous partyMost ReadCouncillor praises INLA killers of MP and Thatcher aide Airey NeaveFormer RTÉ and BBC football pundit arrested after being found passed out in car with children in the backSam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worseBelfast-made missile downs Russian chopper in UkraineA week on from her wedding and BBC’s Emma Vardy is back to work reporting from UkraineTop VideosPlayThe moment a Belfast made Starstreak missile shoots down a Russian helicopter PlayHarry Styles shares message of support for the people of UkrainePlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election Poles apart: politicians and experts split over election posters’ valueAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From gerrymandering and an April Fools’ wish list to Northern Ireland’s most unambiguous partyNorthern Ireland is the ‘begging bowl corner’ of the UK, Doug Beattie claimsSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatSam McBrideOpinionUlster Unionist Party’s all things to all people manesto involves ambition as well as populismLatestMurder victim Roy Reynolds filmed partying with suspect accused of killing him just hours laterCo Antrim dream house draws actress Jayne Wisener back to her home roots: ‘I moved back as I wanted to give my kids the lestyle I had as a child’Rathcoole residents left shaken exactly one year on from harrowing double murder-suicideKwarteng: Community consent must lead any decision on fracking or onshore windUkraine sees openings as Russia fixates on besieged Mariupol,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Credit: Brian Lawless PAMarch   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe UUP manesto has enough meat to show that the party is starting to think seriously about being a major player in the Executive once more, and enough bare bones to reveal that the process is incomplete.At , words, this document is serious in its scope and suffused with the liberal unionist tone of new leader Doug Beattie.But it is what this manesto does not say which reveals most: hard choices or unpopular proposals are either absent or presented in oblique terms — and that jars with Mr Beattie’s straight-talking style.Health is the first and the iest section — unsurprisingly, given that polling has shown Robin Swann to be Stormont’s most popular minister.The manesto indicates support for radical measures, saying that the pandemic has shown that both patients and medics are willing “to travel longer distancesit means receiving care and support in a more timely manner. It is essential that the opportunities currently before us are not lost”.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Read MoreNo united Ireland for generations to come, UUP leader insistsAndrew Madden:OpinionElection briefing: It’s battle stations for UUP, but indferent Tories need a nudgeThat seems to hint at support for implementing the decades of reports which say Northern Ireland has too many small hospitals, some of which need to be closed or downgraded to centralise expertise in centres of excellence.But the UUP is not explicit about this.There are other hints of centralising services — “a regionally consistent approach to cancer services across Northern Ireland” with “regional pathways and rapid diagnostic clinics”.The party also proposes greater evening and weekend use of theatres, but hints at the cost by saying it will mean “properly incentivising the move towards a genuine seven day a week health service”.Signicantly, the party says it would ban the use of contract agency workers — but only “once the immediate HSC pressures subside” .Health trusts are sharply criticised, with the UUP saying that for too long “sub-optimal trust performances [have been] tolerated”, something which suggests frustration at what Mr Swann has seen within the system.His solution is a new operationally independent HSC chief executive accountable to a board with political, professional and civic society membership, similar to the Policing Board.On the NI Protocol, the UUP says that “unionists cannot accept an internal border within the United Kingdom. There can be no border in the Irish Sea between Northern Ireland and Great Britain”.That simple commitment seems to prevent the UUP signing up to any revised protocol involving an Irish Sea border.Its tone is dferent to the DUP, talking about wanting to “maintain good relations with the EU”, but the content is similar to that of the ERG — pushing mutual enforcement, with a new north-south body to oversee this. A requirement to label GB goods coming into NI “for UK sale only” would only avoid a new Irish Sea borderit was enforced for all UK products.The party would ban gay conversion therapy, establish a gambling regulator, allocate overdue investment to football stadia, and examine letting private garages do MoT tests.The party opposes a Troubles amnesty and robustly says paramilitaries “need to be put out of business permanently” by focussing on their leaderships and criminal assets. It wants to curb legal aid, due to “the culture of lawfare which has been allowed to develop within our legal system and which has proved extremely lucrative for a number of firms”.The manesto is laden with more spending — new train stops, new busses, new roads, more rates relief for some businesses, spending on city deals,  more police officers, and looking at giving everyone in primary school a free meal.How this would be paid for is unclear. There is no talk of increasing rates. Water charges are ruled out. And giving Stormont more tax powers is also rejected. Changing the status of NI Waterand the Housing Executive to allow them to borrow is about as far as funding proposals go.This is a detailed document, yet many of the proposals are all things to all people – it is pro-business, but also pro-worker pro-grammar schools, but looking to review how academic selection operates, pro-EU, but anti-protocol.None of those things are necessarily contradictory, but in not being clearer about some of the most controversial or unpopular areas, the party is putting off having to take those decisions until after they’ve got the votes.Related topicsUlster Unionist PartyDoug BeattieThe Executive OfficeRobin SwannNI ProtocolMore On Ulster Unionist Party PremiumCouncil concern for future of famous Derry store Austins amid fears it could collapseAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: It’s battle stations for UUP, but indferent Tories need a nudge PremiumJust £k spent as multi-million pound Northern Ireland football stadiums scheme lies idleCarrickfergus murder probe: Woman’s horror at reservoir body find PremiumSam McBrideOpinionDUP gains ground, but overall support drops for ided unionismMost ReadCouncillor praises INLA killers of MP and Thatcher aide Airey NeaveFormer RTÉ and BBC football pundit arrested after being found passed out in car with children in the backSam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worseBelfast-made missile downs Russian chopper in UkraineA week on from her wedding and BBC’s Emma Vardy is back to work reporting from UkraineTop VideosPlayThe moment a Belfast made Starstreak missile shoots down a Russian helicopter PlayHarry Styles shares message of support for the people of UkrainePlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenLatest Northern Ireland Assembly election Poles apart: politicians and experts split over election posters’ valueAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: From gerrymandering and an April Fools’ wish list to Northern Ireland’s most unambiguous partyNorthern Ireland is the ‘begging bowl corner’ of the UK, Doug Beattie claimsSDLP MP Claire Hanna’s ‘shock’ over proposal by Sinn Fein to abolish her South Belfast seatAndrew MaddenOpinionElection briefing: It’s battle stations for UUP, but indferent Tories need a nudgeLatestMurder victim Roy Reynolds filmed partying with suspect accused of killing him just hours laterCo Antrim dream house draws actress Jayne Wisener back to her home roots: ‘I moved back as I wanted to give my kids the lestyle I had as a child’Rathcoole residents left shaken exactly one year on from harrowing double murder-suicideKwarteng: Community consent must lead any decision on fracking or onshore windUkraine sees openings as Russia fixates on besieged Mariupol,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Photo: Mark CondrenMargaret Donnelly and Breda HeffernanApril   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailRyanair boss Michael O’Leary has called on the Government to draft in  army personnel to help deal with the security delays which have hit Dublin Airport in recent weeks.Speaking to Independent.ie, he also said the DAA needs to step up its recruitment drive as it grapples with a shortage of security staff.His comments come as security queues at the airport peaked just before am today when it took passengers around  minutes to get through security. A DAA spokesman said queuing times were “well under  minutes” later in the morning.Read MoreTransport minister to hold daily crisis meetings over Dublin Airport queuesDublin Airport says queues likely for passengers in coming weeksHowever he said there are “peaks and troughs” for queues and reiterated advice for passengers to allow plenty of time at the airport – at peak times this can be up to three-and-a-half hours before departure time.Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseMichael O’Leary.

In the meantime, we want to see  army personnel called out, just for Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays, for the next eight weeks.They will help do the frisking at the security points and it will enable the airport to open all of the x-ray scanner machines in both Terminal  and Terminal  and keep the queues down,” he said.We need that combination of a dramatic recruitment drive by the DAA, we need the army in there at weekends and it’s reasonably small numbers –  army personnel would allow the DAA open up all the security things.”A DAA spokesman said the busiest time at the airport on Saturdays are between am and am when the first wave of departures takes place.He said the queues peaked just before am this morning when it was taking a maximum of  minutes to get through security. It was a busy first wave. Nobody missed a flight as a result of queuing for security,” he added.He said passengers were heeding the advice to allow more time at the airport and airlines were also opening their check-in desks earlier than usual which was helping to keep people moving.He said the airport will be busy again this afternoon and at around tea-time and urged passengers to be aware that it will be busy at peak periods.We’re doing all we can to alleviate delays for passengers, however, anyone travelling through Dublin Airport over the coming days and weeks should be aware that it might be very busy at peak periods.Our advice to passengers is to allow plenty of time. At peak times, this can mean up to three and a half hours before departure time. If parking a car, allow a further  minutes.Dublin Airport#s customer service team is working tirelessly with customers who have missed flights in recent days.Where security delays are found to have been the cause of a missed flight, DAA is issuing refunds to passengers. This process is ongoing and we ask affected passengers to bear with us over the coming days as we work through the ious claims,” he added.Read MoreTransport minister to hold daily crisis meetings over Dublin Airport queuesMost ReadCouncillor praises INLA killers of MP and Thatcher aide Airey NeaveFormer RTÉ and BBC football pundit arrested after being found passed out in car with children in the backSam McBrideOpinionA third of our MLAs weren’t put there by the voters... and it may get even worseBelfast-made missile downs Russian chopper in UkraineA week on from her wedding and BBC’s Emma Vardy is back to work reporting from UkraineTop VideosPlayThe moment a Belfast made Starstreak missile shoots down a Russian helicopter PlayRoy Reynolds just hours before his death videoed with Michael Campbell the man accused of his murderPlayHarry Styles shares message of support for the people of UkraineLatest Republic of IrelandBroadcaster Charlie Bird reaches mountain top in ‘inspirational’ charity climbDriver killed in overnight crash in TipperaryTaoiseach gives terror threats short shrt during low-key trip across borderBrexit continues to ‘bedevil’ politics in Northern Ireland, Martin saysTransport minister to hold daily crisis meetings over Dublin Airport queuesLatestMurder victim Roy Reynolds filmed partying with suspect accused of killing him just hours laterCo Antrim dream house draws actress Jayne Wisener back to her home roots: ‘I moved back as I wanted to give my kids the lestyle I had as a child’Rathcoole residents left shaken exactly one year on from harrowing double murder-suicideUVF-linked charity’s £k in Irish cashRevealed:  PSNI officers embroiled in misconduct investigations,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Irsquod just broken up with my first girlfriend and I think it was me subconsciously expressing stuff about that.Confirming the sci-fi influence, Tim mdash who recently became a dad for the first time mdash said Girl From Mars mostly revolves around the verse and chorus.ldquoI wrote them as a slow little strummy thing and then when we worked on it as a band we rocked it out quite a lot. My little brother Pat was always my first port of call of seeinga song was good and then Irsquod bring it to [bandmates] Mark [Hamilton] and Rick [McMurray].ldquoI used to love going and knocking on his bedroom door and playing him ideas and I remember that he flipped out about the song and loved it. He had the idea for the quiet verse after the guitar solo and it was great.Tim said as soon as the band started playing it they got a really good reaction from their friends.ldquoI used to play stuff before Irsquod even fully written the lyrics wersquod play stuff at shows and Irsquod mumble my way through it. I donrsquot think I wrote the second verse until we actually recorded it two years later.ldquoI wasnrsquot too worried about lyrics back then, maybe because I listened to Nirvana so much and could never really understand them. Our manager and the record label were sure it was going to be a hit, so we put it aside until wersquod be able to promote it. We put it out as a single two weeks after leaving school and it just blew up.Meanwhile, as part of the Church Street investment plan in Downpatrick, around pound, has been earmarked for a shop front improvement scheme with the emphasis on painting and repairing existing facades.Elsewhere, it is proposed to spend pound, on what is being described as a ldquoconcept design of Church Street with the work due to be carried out by a consultant, with pound, earmarked for improving shop fronts in Bridge Street.Fteen thousand pounds has been earmarked for De Courcey Place in English Street to replace a number of heritage-style lamps and signposts, alongside the provision of new litter bins and planting out existing granite water troughs.Just over pound, is to be spent on other planting and landscaping schemes in the Church Street area, while there are also proposals for a new bus stop and power washing the area outside the former telephone exchange, with new safety railings installed outside  Church Street.There are also plans to invest pound, on new interpretation material highlighting the Tower Bell at Down Parish Church and the grave of United Irishman Thomas Russell in the church grounds.Last Christmas, new festive lighting was provided on the side of the Down Arts Centre and on trees in De Courcey Place.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has praised everyone involved with the work in Church Street, in particular, the talented artists responsible for the murals.ldquoCongratulations to everyone involved in the project designed to breath new le into this part of the town. Given the fact that it has missed out on major funding over many years, the pound, investment initiative is particularly welcome, he said.ldquoThe money will help property owners revitalise their respective businesses at a key part of the town where there are a number of family-owned businesses..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Ballynagross make it past Castlewellan  ","story":"BALLYNAGROSS progressed to the final of the Harry Clarke Cup after defeating Castlewellan Forest by way of penalty shoot-out at Ballyhornan on Friday night.Ballynagross arrived at the match looking for a fourth Harry Clarke final in a row, but Castlewellan Forest had momentum following a close win against Ardglass in the quarter-final.Ballynagross got off to the best start they could have hoped for after a great attack from their defence through the field found Philip Doran, who easily finished to put his side one up in the first seven minutes.Castlewellan stepped it up a gear when a throw-in close to the box found Aidan Dornan, who headed just wide.Castlewellan had an appeal for hand ball ruled out closely after in the Ballynagross box, with the referee having none of it.Ballynagross responded to the pressure from Castlewellan with a pass from Philip Doran to Shea McComiskey out on the right wing. McComiskey saw team-mate Joseph Burns in the mouth of the goal and looped the ball in, but Burnsrsquo effort goes just wide.Castlewellan had their first real chance on the th minute when their corner-kick met the head of Donagh Steele. However, the ball went just over the bar.Ballynagross got their second goal on the th minute after a throw-in from Ryan Tumelty to John Shields allowed the attacker to spray a pass to the right wing to find team-mate Doran. The lively lsquoGross forward found Joseph Burns and the chance was duly converted into a goal.With half-time nearing, it looked like Ballynagross would be going into the interval with a comfortable lead, but an error when clearing the ball from the defence enabled Castlewellanrsquos David Gilmore to close the lead to just a goal as the referee blew his whistle.Castlewellan came out in the second-half with an all out attack approach and it paid off through a corner kick in the st minute.This time Donagh Steele ensured the ball was going into the back of the net and the game was level. It was not to stay this way for long as the Castlewellan goalkeeper clearly took Ballynagrossrsquo Shea McComiskey down inside the box and a penalty was awarded.Connor Marron stepped up to take the penalty and finished well into the top left corner of the net.Castlewellan continued to push forward, but Ballynagross defence of Corey Davis, Connor Marron, Ryan Tumelty and Tom McNeill were holding strong.For the next  minutes it was pretty even, Castlewellanrsquos Sean Dornan took a chance on the edge of the box but Cathail Arnold easily saved. Castlewellan were awarded a free-kick close to the Ballynagross net, but David Gilmorersquos effort was straight at the goalkeeper.Ballynagross had a chance from a corner but it was well cleared by Castlewellan.Forest striker Shane Mooney found himself booked for his comments to the referee in the rd minute.Castlewellan were very much seeking out a goal to level and it came in the th minute after a scrap for the ball in Ballynagrossrsquo box resulted in Shane Mooney scoring with the last kick of the game to send the tie to extra-time.There were a few chances during extra-time for Ballynagross, although neither team could find a break through to escape the need for penalties. Castlewellan swapped out Brian McVeigh in goal for Sean Dornan.Ballynagrossrsquo Connor Marron, who had already scored a penalty during the game, was first to step up and easily converted.Castlewellanrsquos Shane Mooney and Ballynagrossrsquo Declan Dowie followed and both scored.Forestrsquos new lsquokeeper Dornan came out of the net and rushed his penalty, sending the ball over the bar.John Mahoney made no mistake to give his lsquoGross side a further advantage before Ciaran Stratton kept Castlewellan in with a chance.Ballynagrossrsquo John Shields walked up to take his penalty but the lsquokeeper saved to bring it level again.Eoin Travers converted his penalty and now it was sudden death.Tom McNeill confidentially scored his penalty meaning all of the pressure fell on Castlewellanrsquos Ryan Morgan to keep the game going.However, his effort was saved resulting in Ballynagross progressing to the final.Ballynagross: C Arnold, T McNeill, R Tumelty, C Marron, C Davis, J Polley, J Shields, J Burns, L Shields, P Doran, S McComiskeySubs: D Craig, D Dowie, J Mahoney, K Taggart, A Beattie.Castlewellan Forest: B McVeigh, C McCabe, C Stratton, C Burns, J OrsquoNeill, N Travers, S Dornan, D Steele, S Mooney, A Dornan, D Gilmore Subs: S Kinley, G Kidd, E Travers, R Morgan, J Murnin..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Dismal end to league campaign  ","story":"DOWN senior footballersrsquo miserable campaign reached its conclusion as they lost out on home soil to Clare on Sunday.The Mourne side entered this fixture already relegated from Division  and were hoping to gain some,any, momentum ahead of their crucial upcoming Ulster campaign.The uphill task will include having to better Monaghan on May  and then the winner of Cavan and Antrim to make the concluding stage to feature in the All-Ireland series and avoid ato the second-tier championship.Down took to the field in Newry against a Clare side who had endured a mixed bag of results within their league fixtures having won their opening three before losing the next trio of matches.For Down, the loss concludes a point-starved run of fixtures having finished with just one draw and six losses.Clare fielded what appeared to be a physically stronger outfit than their counterparts at Paacuteirc Esler and Downrsquos efforts werenrsquot aided by their lack of discipline.Both Gerard Collins and Pat Havern picked up black cards towards the end of each half while team-mate Finn McElroy picked up a red card with  minutes played.By that stage, the Mourne side didnrsquot appear to be getting anything from the game but that will be little solace to Down boss James McCartan, who has endured a nightmare beginning to his second stint at the helm.Aaron Grfin scored the first goal of the match with nine minutes played, courtesy of a smart left-footed finish which bested Kilcoo-native Niall Kane at his near post.To their credit, Down showed some resilience and managed to notch the next four from five points available with Burren man Liam Kerr kicking over a well-taken score amongst these.However, Clare continued to attack the Down goal and found their second major of the match thanks to Cian OrsquoDearsquos effort.His lowly struck shot took the wind out of Downrsquos sails and the Mourne side entered the break six points adrt at -

ndash The Government is poised to unveil an astonishing pound million scheme to replace the Strangford ferry service with a road tunnel under the lough.The scheme has already been approved at ministerial level and it is believed that the pound million originally intended for the Downpatrick bypass road will be used as start-up capital, with phase top-up grants being sought from the European Community and the Ireland Fund as the scheme progresses.Plans for the mile-long road tunnel have been drawn up by senior consultants engaged by the government and it is believed that the entry points will be manned toll booth terminals in Strangford and Portaferry.The move to replace the ferry service with a tunnel received an extra impetus recently when it was revealed that the ferry service was running at a substantial loss and villagers in Strangford vetoed plans for a new jetty for the vessels.Sources within the government say that the tunnel plan, which has been gathering dust for a number of years, has now been reactivated and local roads bosses intend erting the money intended for Downpatrickrsquos ring road to the scheme before the end of the financial year.Publicly, however, officials are remaining tight-lipped about the project. ldquoThe tunnel plan was first put forward several years ago, but as far as I am aware there are no plans to revive it, said a press office spokesperson.Nevertheless, conservation organisations have been consulted about the possible environmental impact of a tunnel, and a study of its possible effects has been carried out by a university team under the guidance of Prof A Lilo.Prof Lilo told the Recorder: ldquoAs far as I can see, there would be little threat to the loughrsquos balanced ecosystem from a tunnel.There may, however, be an unsightly visual impact created by the large tunnel entrances needed in Strangford and Portaferry.CASTLEWELLAN ndash A new school is to be constructed on the site of the existing St Malachyrsquos High School in Castlewellan, it has been revealed this week.South Down MP Mr Eddie McGrady said he has been informed of the commitment of the Department of Education to a new school in the town.ldquoAn investment appraisal has recently been carried out by the Department of Education to consider how best to meet the long-term needs of the pupils at St Malachyrsquos and this has come out in favour of a new school on the existing site, he added.Mr McGrady said this week: ldquoI welcome this development as I have been making on-going representations on the matter to Lord Belstead and his predecessor as Education Minister, Dr Brian Mawhinney.ldquoThe school definitely requires additional accommodation and I am keen that is is provided on the existing site, he added.DOWNPATRICK ndash Teenagers, some as young as , are taking part in open-air drinking parties at secluded parts of Downpatrick it was revealed this week.The youth are paying adults to buy drink for them and then going to quiet parts of the town for their parties, a special meeting was told on Tuesday.The police have raided a number of these gatherings in recent months but the teenagers simply move to a dferent location and continue their drinking sprees.While the problem of underage drinking in Downpatrick has not risen in recent years it is nevertheless sufficiently worrying to prompt a group of local community representatives to get together to discuss ways of tackling the issue.Last week youth workers, headmasters, teachers, publicans and councillors met together under the auspices of the RUCrsquos Community Relations Branch and debated the causes and possible remedies of underage drinking.The end result of the discussion was that public awareness needs to be heightened, while teenagers, and their parents, should be appraised of the dangers of alcohol abuse in the young.Superintendent Ronnie Hawthorne, Downpatrick sub-isional commander explained that the problem is a province-wide concern and is not just confined to Downpatrick.He added that underage drinking is also taking place in other parts of Down District.ldquoThere is a problem throughout Northern Ireland and we cannot stop underage drinkers ourselves, we need the help of the whole community, said Superintendent Hawthorne.ldquoThere are a lot associated problems with underage drinking and we will talk to every interested body in a bid to cope with this matter, he added.The full extend of the problems were highlighted by the youth leader in charge of the Patrician Youth Centre, Siobhan Byrne, who has compiled a report on underway drinking which is to be presented to Down Council.KILLYLEAGH ndash The town of Killyleagh is set for a financial boost to help revive its economic, commercial and environmental appearance, it has been revealed.A preliminary application has been made to the International Fund for a core project to help trigger a revival in the townrsquos fortunes.And by the end of the year, plans to designate the town as a conservation area will be completed.The investment in Killyleaghrsquos future was revealed when the chairman of Down District Council, Mr Sean Quinn, officially launched proposals for the regeneration of the town.A special exhibition in the townrsquos library also features a display on the proposed conservation area for Killyleagh.Mr Quinn referred to community-led initiatives in Seeconnell and Strangford, and stressed the importance of a community coming together to take full advantage of the funding which is available to help themselves.The South Down MP, Mr Eddie McGrady, told the launch gathering that he has been delighted to assist the committee towards its goals of reviving the town.Mr McGrady said Killyleagh had recognised that it was very much an era of self-help.He looked forward to the day when Killyleagh is selected as the site for the Strangford Lough Liaison Office and is designated as the Gateway to Strangford Lough, fulfilling its tourist potential.LEITRIM ndash An  month battle to have a Leitrim footpath declared a right of way has found its way to Westminster.The Parliamentary Commissioner for Complaints has been asked to investigate Banbridge Councilrsquos handling of the matter after more than  people signed a petition asking for the adoption of the footpath as a right-of-way.The footpath, which is marked on ordnance survey maps dating from , sketches from the town lands of Slievenisky and Backaderry, through Carrivmoragh mountain and descends towards Leitrim by Heronrsquos Road.Local people claim that the path is very old and was once used to reach a Mass Rock on the Backaderry Mountain and in later times, to give a short-cut to the new church in Leitrim.It is also believed the footpath is part of the old highway system that existed before the road system was introduced, and links into a system of lanes that go to Ballynahinch.The Council first became involved in the matter in August

Since then, the organisation has grown and the level of support we provided has widened considerably, Linda revealed.ldquoWe now have a team of  volunteers who are in contact with  people across the district. Despite the global pandemic, we continued to deliver the service from our homes with the calls even more appreciated by clients who could not go out themselves.Linda said that during the pandemic, the volunteers made an additional  calls to people, such was the need of elderly and vulnerable people across the community.ldquoWe started off calling people for a little friendly chat but the service we provided started to evolve. While chatting with clients remains at the heart of what we do to support those who are isolated, we now find ourselves helping people with a range of complex needs.ldquoThe charityrsquos work has evolved and I suppose it will continue to in the future, but Good Morningrsquos Down core principle will always remain the same.Linda paid tribute to all the charityrsquos staff and those who have supported the organisation over many years.ldquoWe are like family and I will be sorry to leave, she said. ldquoI have spent a large part of my working le with Good Morning Down and have literally lived and breathed the organisation and have been assisted by great people.Linda said it was ldquotremendous to meet clients when the charity organised its get-togethers and while these were put on hold due to the pandemic, she hopes there may be an opportunity do something before the end of the year.ldquoThat of course will be guided by the public health situation at the time as we are mindful that our clients are elderly, with a number of them also vulnerable.Linda said the charityrsquos service has never been more important and while she is leaving the organisation, she knows it will continue to be a key part of peoplersquos lives.She added: ldquoI really enjoyed my time with Good Morning Down and worked alongside really great people. They were the friendly voice at the end of the telephone who helped make a dference to peoplersquos lives.ldquoFor many, their chat with our volunteers was the only interaction they would have with others during the day and we were always conscious of that. We worked to make a dference and you build a special relationship with clients which is why it was so wonderful to see them when we all did meet up.As Linda prepares to say her final goodbyes, Good Morning Down is looking for someone to replace her at the helm of the charity.Anyone keen to take on taking on her role or interested in getting involved in the work of Good Morning Down is asked to contact her on    or email lindabakergmd@yahoo..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"History project looks back at  Jewish family’s links to Shrigley  ","story":"THE remarkable contribution of Jewish families in saving Shrigley has been recalled in a unique history project.The story of how Jews, fleeing the Holocaust and Hitlers murderous purge in Europe, started arriving in the village just before the start of the Second World War and helped transform the fortunes of villagers after the Hungry Thirties is largely forgotten.But more than  years later, Shrigleys legacy is featuring in an on-line interactive map telling the stories of Jewish families who have left a lasting impact on Northern Ireland.Steven Jaffe has been researching the heritage of the Jewish community across Northern Ireland.ldquoThe goal of the Belfast Jewish Heritage project Shared History fund is to locate, preserve, document and make publicly available material relating to the Jewish community in Northern Ireland, said Mr Jaffe.ldquoIt shows  sites across Northern Ireland, including Shrigley, Saintfield and Downpatrick.

They also cause signicant damage to wildle and the environment.Mourne Heritage Trust staff helped with the response to last weekrsquos wildfires using strimmers to create fire breaks, also helping with a controlled back burn and using its argocat all-terrain vehicle and fogging unit to extinguish one branch of a fire that was threatening some field boundaries.In addition, one of the Trustrsquos teams, along with a firefighter, used this specialist equipment to extinguish the fire at Finlieve near Rostrevor.NI Water has also warned that wildfires can have impact on drinking water supplies.The organisation controls so-called water catchment areas in the Mournes which supply water to all of Northern Ireland. The organisation said while it is working hard to deal with the problem of wildfires, it wants to assure customers that tap water quality is unaffected and is of a very high quality.But NI Water has warned that wildfires within catchments not only pose a terrible risk to all le but can remove the primary layer of vegetation, leaving the burned bare soil exposed to erosion which then makes its way into the reservoirs, from where water is abstracted for treatment to provide drinking water.ldquoThe erosion caused by wildfire increases carbon and other polluting chemicals signicantly in untreated water, with sediment accumulating in streams, lakes and reservoirs, said NI Waterrsquos Rebecca Allen.ldquoThis makes raw water especially dficult and more expensive to treat at our facilities to the stringent standards required by the Drinking Water Regulations. A signicant amount of other work by our water supply colleagues also has to be undertaken at the treatment works to ensure excellent quality drinking water during these times.Rebecca added: ldquoExtra water samples have to be collected and analysed, streams from burned areas need isolated, and other remedial measures must be taken like blocking streams to protect reservoirs.Mournes councillor Willie Clarke has praised firefighters, other arms of the emergency services and the Mourne Heritage Trust for their efforts to bring the blaze at the Bloody Bridge under control.He said firefighters in particular were overwhelmed by the support from the community.ldquoI witnessed the devastation of the wildfire first hand which impacted a site that is a protected habitat renowned around the world, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoThe emergency services, particularly local fire crews, should be commended for the professionalism they displayed when dealing with these incidents. However, malicious fires place a massive strain on very limited resources and as we approach the summer I would urge people to be vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the PSNI.Cllr Clarke said the damage caused by gorse fires has a lasting impact and that areas of outstanding natural beauty can take years to recover, calling for a co-ordinated response from the Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs, NI Water, health and public safety departments and the Department of Justice.He continued: ldquoWe need to see a collective response with a sharing of resources and there needs to be additional funding provided to build upon the best practice Mourne Heritage Trust has undertaken to reduce the impact of these fires in the High Mournes. Controlled burns and better land-management needs to be re-established.ldquoMeasures should include the establishment of fire breaks to reduce the fuel load and a cross-departmental strategic response to ensure that the scale of these fires should never happen again.Cllr Clarke said it is important that police proactively investigate what are environmental crimes and those responsible need to be assured that these types of crime will not be tolerated in society.South Down MLA Sinead Ennis has also praised firefighters for their efforts in battling huge fires in the Mournes which started at Hen Mountain and Spelga Dam.She added: ldquoTragically, these fires will have caused widespread damage to the environment and our wildle. This is yet another stark reminder that everyone must behave responsibly while visiting the Mournes in order to protect the environment and the safety of the local community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Reality TV star Matthew visits ex primary school  ","story":"FRESH from Dancing With The Stars Ireland, TV star Matthew MacNabb and his new girlfriend took the chance to visit his former primary school last week.Matthew and his professional dance partner, Laura Nolan, visited St Patrickrsquos Primary School, Legamaddy, after making it to the semi-final of the top RTE show.The visit to the school, which the Downpatrickrsquos manrsquos brother and sisters also attended, coincided with the school celebrating news of receiving a sizeable grant.It has been awarded pound, which will go towards creating a pollinator garden in the school grounds.Pupils were delighted to show Matthew and Laura around the school, particularly its new outdoor learning hub which allows to have an outdoor classroom for eco projects.The schoolrsquos Eco teacher, Mrs Bronagh Reid, said the school was delighted to welcome Matthew back.ldquoHe was very friendly to all the pupils, who found him very inspiring, said Mrs Reid. ldquoIt was good that he called with us on a day off and it was down to his mother Margaret, who sits on our board of governors.ldquoWe were all hoping that Matthew would make into the final but very impressed that he cog to the semi-final.The schoolrsquos cash injection is part of the Rural Community Pollinator Grants Scheme, which is financed by the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairsand managed by the civic-pride campaign, Live Here Love Here.It is designed to allow community groups and schools across rural Northern Ireland to benefit from funding between pound, to pound, to establish, enhance or develop a local community pollinator garden.A pollinator garden is a shared space with pollinating plants, habitats, wildflowers, flowers, shrubs and trees, and the grants support new initiatives aimed at protecting and providing for pollinators.Mrs Sarah McDowell, principal, said: ldquoWe plan to use the money to create an outdoor learning space which will enhance our school grounds and the local community.ldquoWe will build an outdoor classroom and plant fruit trees to attract more wildle to our school grounds.`We are delighted to receive the support of Live Here Love Here to help us create this space which will benefit the children in our school and will help to improve bioersity in the area.She added: ldquoWe look forward to starting to create this area after Christmas and have it ready for the spring term.The pilot scheme, which made pound. million available for  , aims to cover % of costs to community groups and schools wishing to embark on the community environmental project.Successful grant applicants were required to illustrate their plans to maximise pollinator-friendly land-management techniques to increase the bioersity value of an area by planting for pollinators, and to transform unused spaces into valued community spaces, adding habitats and greening-up formerly grey areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/21February2021-NIMEA-ADVERT-.jpg","title":"Students involved in All Island lights switch off climate event  ","story":"THE lights went out at Stormont at the weekend thanks to ecologically aware local high school studentsA group of pupils from St Patrickrsquos Grammar School and Down High School, who are involved in the All-Island Schools  Climate Action programme, asked for the lights at Stormont to be switched off for one hour on Saturday evening.Local MLAs Harry Harvey and Colin McGrath helped ensure that the request was fast-tracked, with Mr Harveyrsquos we, Sharon, doing a lot of the work behind the scenes.Mr Harvey met with staff and pupils from the two schools in the grounds of Parliament Buildings to observe the dimming of the lights.Stormont joined in solidarity with the  countries from around the world that participated in the th anniversary of the global Earth Hour.

But when it comes to casting their ballots, up to % of people who go have hitherto gone to the polls in NI elections have voted for political parties who are primarily identied by their stance on the constitutional question.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Even in recent elections the non-aligned centre ground, despite having surged , are doing well to get more than % of the votes.Do not be fooled by anyone who says that the protocol is only of importance to unionists, and that even many unionists do not care. Many of the people who make this point themselves care very much about the Irish Sea border — they want to keep it, either because they support staying in the EU , or because they see it as major step towards an economic united Ireland, and thus towards a more general all-Ireland.It is true that many of the more apolitical unionists are much more relaxed about the protocol than they should be, but that is typically because it is complex .It is also because such unionists heard that the protocol offered the best of both worlds .Thus unionists should have been, and should still be, trying to explain and reiterate to some of the more apathetic pro Union voters the ultimate impact of the NI Protocol. This would entail trying to revive some of the spirit of indignation that there was in the early months of , when many people across the Province were suddenly finding that they could not get deliveries from Great Britain that they had always been able to get before.The EU has been keen to agree to case-by-case exemptions to checks in part because it does not want the wider public to be troubled by the protocol. Needless to say, therefore, unionists badly need to see a large vote for parties that oppose the protocol.Doug Beattie’s approach to the Irish Sea border, of opposing it but calling for engagement in the pursuit of political solutions to the problems that it creates, has a high-wire quality. If the Alliance vote goes down, even slightly, on recent elections, and the Ulster Unionist Party vote increases, Mr Beattie will be able to say that his tactics have stemmed the decline of unionism by broadening its appeal.If Alliance continues upwards, and the UUP does not rise, he will be seen to have not only been weak on the protocol, but having failed to win over moderates in the process.l The second key thing to watch out for in the election is turnoutThere was a time in the s and early s when it seemed voters in the western world were losing interest in politics.Countries such as the UK and United States were increasingly wealthy and many bitter political disagreements of the s and s seemed to give way to a more bland, moderate politics. In Northern Ireland itself, this wider trend towards consensus seemed to be reflected in the  Belfast Agreement. But this sense of stable politics has evaporated, at home and abroad. There are now bitter ides on major issues of national and global importance, and much turbulence in voting patterns.The Brexit referendum of  had a higher turnoutthan most recent UK general elections have done.The Scottish independence plebiscite in  had an even higher turnout .The fiercely contested, and narrowly decided, US presidential election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden in November  had one of the highest turnouts of any presidential race in modern memory .In Northern Ireland, the turnout surged from % of voters in the  Stormont election to % a year later, in the more fraught atmosphere of the election after Sinn Fein collapsed the institutions.There is now keen interest in conflicts and politics at home and abroad. Before Russia invaded Ukraine, I feared people in the UK would not care much, seeing it as a distant problem. I was relieved to be proven wrong by the massive interest there was in such a serious global matter.A high turnout next month would show that the population in NI still think that Stormont and issues such as the protocol matter.l The final thing to watch is the vote shares of the two communitiesWill it be like the  general election, when the DUP and Sinn Fein dominated thingsor like  when they plunged to a combined % Will unionists get a combined vote share in the high s %, as in the  and  Stormont elections, or will they be down round %, as in  Westminster  Will nationalists combined get more than % of the vote, as they have done in some elections, or go back under that level It will be a bad day indeed for unionismthe combined vote is as low as %, as some polls have suggested, or even in the high s.ProtocolNorthern IrelandDoug BeattieBen LowryIrish Sea  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most Popular‘TUV - No Sea Border’ given approval for ballot papersLough Neagh is shrinking and could be gone by ‘SF wants to sleepwalk other parties into border poll plan’Ben Lowry: Three things to watch out for in the coming Stormont electionRamadan : What is Ramadan  Ramadan dates  - and how to wish someone a happy RamadanMost PopularBest walking shoes for men UK : the best men’s shoes for hiking from Salomon, Inov-, and MerrellBest air beds for camping UK : inflatable beds to keep you comfy from Outwell, Vango, and SnugpakAldi’s popular hanging egg chair is back in stock - here’s how to buy online, and how much it costsBest women’s walking trousers for hiking : hiking trousers reviewed, from Arc-Teryx, Jack Wolfskin, AcaiRod Stewart tour : when tickets go on sale for extra UK dates - including London, Glasgow and Birmingham                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-jQrDum sc-fvxzrP bUrEZo ivPtAx\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisUkraine CrisisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It tramples on unionism. It’s promise of consent was a lie.” If this was not evident before the protocol was imposed on us, then it sure is now. Unionists who voted for the Belfast Agreement were sold a big fat pup by our so-called leaders.The pup has grown up now and it’s very evident it doesn’t like us.Harry Patterson, CastlecaulfieldFor more political news, click here:WATCH: Crowd cheers for the destruction of the  Belfast Agreement at loyalist rally RALLY BREAKDOWN: All the upcoming parades and protests against the Northern Ireland Brexit Protocol——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Your commitment and dedication has been truly remarkable. This was a team effort and it has been a huge honour to be involved.“From the outset we have known that every jab counts and it is thanks to you that there have been many lives saved, and far, far fewer people seriously ill in hospital due to covid. You should be very proud of the role you have played.”Speaking to the public, Ms Donnelly said: “Thank you for rolling up your sleeves and helping to protect yourselves and those around you from this terrible disease. However we’re not at the finish line just yet. I’ve made plenty of appeals to the public in the past  months but I’m sure I’ll be forgiven for one more - please come forward for your jabs.“It’s vital that everyone in the  plus age group and those who have severely weakened immune systems come forward for their spring booster. I would again encourage everyone who is eligible for their booster to get it without delay. Vaccination clinics are still running across Northern Ireland and people are still coming forward for boosters as well as first and second doses.

Stormont Health Minister Robin Swann says that testing will continue to play a vital role in Northern Ireland’s response to COVID- over the coming months but that a “more targeted approach” will be introduced on a phased basis from April, with the focus on supporting and protecting those at highest risk of serious illness.Under the new policy, PCR testing in NI will cease for most people with symptoms from  April - however free lateral flow tests will continue to be available to the public to use should they develop Covid symptoms.Lateral flow tests will also continue to be available free of charge to support those living in, working in or visiting a higher risk setting, such as a care home, until the end of June, with a further review then.The policy covers testing and contact tracing and takes effect from  April. No changes will be introduced in Northern Ireland until that date. The policy will be kept under review during the period of transition up until the end of June.The full range of changes to take effect from  April in Northern Ireland are as follows-* PCR testing will no longer be recommended or available for most people with symptoms. It will still be available to support the small group for whom it is recommended for clinical reasons. The PCR home ordering service will remain available for the general public to support those for whom PCR is recommended.* Publicly accessible COVID- testing sites will close. Local Health and Social Care Trusts will continue to provide PCR testing to support clinical care.* Those with symptoms will be advised to use lateral flow devicesto test instead of booking a PCR. This will be kept under review and could remain in place up to the end of June depending on disease trajectory.* Routine asymptomatic testing - testing for those with no symptoms - will continue to be advised for those living, working and visiting health and social care settings including hospitals and care homes and other high risk settings in line with public health advice. This will be kept under review.* Asymptomatic LFD testing for the wider population will cease. Access to free LFDs for this purpose will cease.* Routine asymptomatic workplace testing will cease.* Routine asymptomatic testing in most educational settingswill cease at the Easter break.* Asymptomatic testing in special schools will continue after Easter and will be kept under review. It may continue until the end of June .* Routine population contact tracing will be phased out between mid-April and the end of June.Chief Medical Officer Professor Sir Michael McBride said: “We will continue throughout the transition phase to support and protect our most vulnerable. After these changes are introduced from  April, I would urge people to check on NI Directtesting remains recommended for them - for examplethey are eligible for new treatments. In the coming weeks, the Department will also be working to provide advice and support to those eligible for treatments. It is particularly important that those who are at higher risk of serious illness follow the guidance on getting tested.”The Chief Medical Officer added: “The tools at our disposal to protect people who are at higher risk from COVID- have advanced considerably since the early days of the pandemic. Alongside the vaccine and booster programme, new COVID- treatments continue to be used by patients in Northern Ireland and new treatments are in development.“As the amount of testing across society reduces, our behaviour and actions have an even more important role in preventing transmission and keeping others safe. I urge everyone to continue to follow the public health guidance including continuing to wear a face covering in enclosed settings like public transport and when visiting hospitals and care homes.”The changes do not take effect until  April, and current testing provision will continue until then.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIt seems over the years, Barry Island seems to be the shining light of identity for the Barry and District.However, many times have I been asked this, \"Karl-James Langford, was Barry Island ever an island \"Well, I could ignore the question and reply in a sarcastic way, but one, never does. For when you look at the area today, it is dficult to think of a time when Barry Island was just that an island surrounded by water at hightide.For after  for all those dams, and bridges built across The Sound, slowly dragged Barry Island to the mainland. The water logged landscape has now been lost within a landscape of housing and other development.Barry Island until  was nothing more than a place lost in time with a rundown farmhouse, outbuildings and forgotten about sacred wells until things changed. Francis Crawshay purchased Barry Island in  a very eccentric man, who saw that his new home The Marine Hotel, was to accommodate friends visiting him on the Island.You may add that the image we examine today is of a dferent structure. The original Marine Hotel of Francis Crawshay building on the start of Friars Point, was eventually renamed Friars Point House, at which point the original name became redundant. However, as Barry Island became a focal point of day trippers, and visits for those building the dock, accommodation was required.Now, towards the end of the s, the Barry and District saw the construction of a number of Hotels, and  of which, after being opened never received the licences for the purpose they were built, such as the Sea View Hotel on Dock View Road, which became the Sea View Labour Club.One of these new purpose-built hotels one of which was on Barry Island, however opened in , and adopted the name The Marine Hotel, as it was no longer being used for the grand building Friars Point. The Marine Hotel on the corner of Plymouth Road and Friars Point, was infact a much larger building than you can find today alas some parts of it were demolished over the past few decades. However, what building still remains although it is now been converted into flats, is still impressive..removeBack in the day, in the late s you entered through a very impressive Portico entrance, with stone details picked out in Portland stone. The rest of the structure utilising locally sourced Red brick. The Marine Hotel was the place to stay on Barry Island, with an array of fine rooms to stay it, after a long summer evening eating icecream on the sands of the Bay, oryou had been visiting the Barry and District on business.Now when viewing the building facing onto Friars Road, the scroll work surrounding the lettering entrapping the words  MARINE HOTEL. This is an echo of times when we built in a much grander way. Most of the buildings of note were built to last in the late s, in such a way the Marine Hotel was constructed.One thing of final note is that one local resident told me story that The Marine Hotel was a haunt of Leguards and Coastguards from Barry Island. And then ironically inquests were held into deaths caused to drowning, and other reasons at the Marine Hotel also.Many thanks for joining us this week. More from our enigmatic Barry and District next week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe former Poland international turns  this month but is playing as well as ever as the Hammers chase another top-six finish.Fabianski’s form has been so impressive that he has restricted on-loan France keeper Alphonse Areola to appearances in the cup competitions.“He has been really good,” said Hammers boss David Moyes. “I actually think he has been pushed by Alphonse, who has done really well for us in European games and cup games as well.“I think maybe the age Lukasz is at we have tried to spare him, and I have to say I think Lukasz, touch wood, has been very, very good in the league and performed consistently well.“He has played really well this year and we will be keeping him next year, of course we will. He might have more competition and he might be a year older, but at the moment he is doing really well.”Fabianski will line up opposite England goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, a player Moyes knows well, when West Ham host Everton on Sunday.“I think Jordan is a really good keeper. I had him at Sunderland. He was great. He was brilliant for us and he was only a young boy then,” added the Scot.“I thought he played really well for England and quite often goes under the radar, because he made several good saves against Switzerland and also at the Euros.“What happens is we are waiting on Jordan making a mistake, but the truth is that I don’t think he has let England down in the games that mattered.“He is a really good distributer of the ball, he is good for modern football, he can kick it a mile, he can pass it.

He looked sharp.\"Meanwhile, Wasps flanker Jack Willis is set to make his first appearance in a year after finally recovering from the serious knee injury sustained against Italy at Twickenham in the  championship.England v Wales Six Nations: How to watch on TV, live streamThe England v Wales Six Nations match kicks off at .pm on Saturday, February .You can watch coverage on ITV or live stream the game via ITV Hub.Alternatively,you cant make it to a screen, you can also listen live on BBC Radio  Live Sports Extra. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log Share s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"  CommentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Her hand-painted ‘Welcome to Banbridge’ mural in Newry Street celebrates the Brontë link to the area using typography inspired by the world’s most famous literary family.Artist Friz pays homage to the town’s most famous landmark and Europe’s first ever flyover, Downshire Bridge. The mural of Irish physicist Professor Ernest Walton at Bridge Street.

Inspired by the area’s linen history, Rob Hilken’s mural at Linenhall Street depicts damask linen with a Jacquard weaving pattern that was created by local linen mills. The chrysanthemum damask design used was created by William Liddell and incorporates the distinctive pattern found on Jacquard loom punch cards, which were used to create the complex damask designs that made the Banbridge area world-famous for its linen.Belfast-based artist and illustrator FGB’smural at Bridge Street celebrates the town’s association to Irish physicist Professor Ernest Walton who was educated at Banbridge Academy Preparatory School.

Dublin-based Decoy’s mural at Scarva Street celebrates Banbridge as a strategic river crossing point, a communication route between Belfast and Dublin and a focus for agricultural industry, trade and commerce. An ancient king’s road connecting Ulster to the rest of the island once crossed the Bann at a forging place a short distance downstream at Ballykeel.In addition to the new street art, one of Banbridge’s most iconic landmarks - a B-listed monument dedicated to Captain Crozier which memorialises his contribution to polar exploration - has undergone signicant restoration work.Holly Pereira on Newry Street.

Do something instead‘Don’t worry!’ How often have we heard that and how often do we say it to others  I suspect it’s being said quite often at the present time, when there seems to be so much to be worried about, writes Rev. Ron Elsdon.By The NewsroomSunday, rd April , : am  \"       \"  There’s the state of the Health Service, the never-ending fallout from Brexit, the war in Ukraine, and the spiralling cost of living which is already inflicting so much hardship on so many. ‘Don’t worry!’ But the problem is that it’s far easier said than done. So when you come across it in the bible as well, you could be excused for writing it off as unrealistic. Please stay with me for a few moments, however, while I try to explain.        \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It points you to something rather more than that. I offer you two examples where it offers you responses that are practical – strategies,you like.Ron ElsdonFirstly, Paul directs people to pray instead, and to pepper their prayers with thanksgiving . The trouble is that we’re so good at finding things to complain about, often trivialities, that finding things to give thanks for doesn’t come easily, even to people who pray regularly, but why not switch course and actually do it, then keep on doing it  Then, says Paul, the protecting peace of God is there to be discovered, even in the midst of stressful situations. Secondly, Jesus talks about worry in the Sermon on the Mount . When it consumes us, he says, what we need is a new set of ambitions which point us beyond ourselves “Seek first God’s kingdom and God’s righteousness” is His command to His followers. As I write, I’m thinking about a local politician, one I shan’t be voting for. I know he spends Christmas Day at a place for the homeless, helping to serve up hot meals for that I admire him greatly. As I write, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians are fleeing the army of a tyrant from the east, many with nowhere to go in freezing weather. In neighbouring countries, churches and other organisations are swinging into action to help support these folk in their hour of desperate need. So, in their dferent ways, Jesus’ and Paul’s words in the bible are saying to us all, ‘Don’t worry! Do something instead.’Read: Covid travel requirement set to change"},{"url":null,"title":" pictures of historic day as royal black institution opens new headquarters ","story":"Roy Reynolds: Rathcoole murder victim suffered ‘barbaric injuries’, court told   Murder suspect arrested after PSNI stop car on dual-carriagewayNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisUkraine CrisisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My Businesscanonical_urlCANONICAL_URLhostnameCANONICAL_HOSTNAMElocationCANONICAL_URLreferrerEXTERNAL_REFERRERpage_view_id_PAGE_VIEW_ID_scroll_SCROLL_HEIGHTgeo__INJECT_GEO__cid_ga:CLIENT_ID,comScore:CLIENT_ID,compass_uid:CLIENT_IDversionsha-wJFtySqNnAxBmRbBZGkmXyZeJTYkxlpMdJsFNIrrGVlru-DcIEIZ\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-container\" i-amphtml-layout\"container\"Loading...NewsPeopleThe grand opening of the headquarters was officially declared open by Sovereign Grand Master Rev William Anderson.

With his ear for a good story and eye for detail, Jack, who founded the historical group in , takes readers on a mirthful trip down memory lane.       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"     \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily NorthernIrelandWorld Today newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

They gradually gained popularity with the audience and, being held on the Monday night before the annual May Fair Day, reflected the atmosphere of jollication that pervaded the town at this special time of year.An eye-catching image from Ballyclare.“The music was provided by ious groups of instrumentalists – fiddlers, accordionists, tin whistle players – and their sessions were interspersed with songs, recitations and stories by local inidual entertainers drawn from the lore and culture of the Six Mile Water region. Many of these songs and much of the material came from an oral tradition and few were available in written form.”Verses of material from local ‘balladeers’ Ernie Scott, Sandy Robinson, Jock Gilmour and Matt Meharg together with short biographical details of these and many others feature in the pages of the book.Jack continued: “Sadly the concerts came to an end when the security situation dictated that crowds gathering in halls became impossible. The Historical Society planned to celebrate the th anniversary of the founding of the society in  by reviving the Rhymes and Ructions concert in  but the outbreak of the Covid- pandemic put paid to their plans.”In his introduction to Rhyme and Ructions Jack, who is the author of a number of local history studies including ‘Stories of a Letime’, also reveals what inspired this latest publication.Author Jack McKinney with his latest publication.“What I am endeavouring to do here is to compile a collection of the ballads and anecdotes that proved so popular at the concerts. The tone and subjects of the ballads y considerably from the amusing to those of a more contemplative nature. As for their credibility I leave the readers to assess this for themselves.”Jack has pursued his interest in local history and its characters with zeal since retiring in  after a four-decade career as an assistant and principal teacher in east Antrim primary schools. The former Mossley Primary School pupil, taught at Abbots Cross, Ballyclare and Whitehead Primary Schools. And in the manner in which he inspired many pupils, Jack is keen to share his enthusiasm for knowledge with a whole new generation of readers.A founder member of the Ulster-Scots Language Society, Jack added: “The ballads are recorded in the style of language used in the originals – standard English or Ulster- Scots. The stories and other text may contain either or both. I have often followed the style of a mixture of Ulster -Scots and English as in the Scottish ‘Kaleyard’ novels, familiar to readers of Archibald McIlroy’s books, where the conversational dialogue of characters is in Ulster-Scots with the rest of the narrative in standard English.”The ‘Wreck of the Never Budge’, ‘Courting and Possible Consequences’ or ‘The May Fair and lots of Houzeldoo’ provide a hint of Ballyclare May Fairs past and possible inspiration for future balladeers and storytellers. As for those dogs on the front and back covers  Surely it’s worth the £. sale price to find out!

We told you that the tree used to make ballot paper – Flora Plio – was in short supply. Of course there’s no such thing as a Flora Plio, which is an anagram of April Fool. Our paper production expert, Poppy Cox, was indeed a load of poppycock, and of course we couldn’t do an April Fool about paper without mentioning foolscap. And we had to make our ‘official’ statement at midday because,we hadn’t, we’d be the fools for carrying on!  The forthcoming election is set to be postponed for a fortnight due to insufficient amounts of the correct type of ballot paper, we understand. It is believed that the specic type of tree used to make the paper - Flora Plio – has been in short supply in recent months. Paper production expert, Poppy Cox, explained why this specic type of tree was used for the production of ballot papers. “It has a special waxy quality that prevents the mark you make on your ballot paper being rubbed out,” said Mrs Cox. “That obviously adds an added level of security to the elections and stops people claiming that their ballot has been changed.” Alternatives are now being sought and the two week delay in the vote will hopefully allow for the ballot to be printed on a dferent type of paper. “It is possible that we could see a special kind of foolscap being useda secure alternative can’t be found,” Mrs Cox added. An official statement on the matter is due to be made at midday today .  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ceecfcbcbbbd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ffecbe   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
