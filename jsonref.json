I thought how they would be hurt by my death.\u0027This made me keep going. I had to fight until the very end. I kept trying to overcome my gloomy thoughts.\u0027There was another fear too - sharks or other threats lurking in the deep.\u0027I felt things touching my legs.\u0027I kept assuring myself it was just seaweed, nothing dangerous, that there was nothing down there that could harm me.\u0027I just kept hoping that the right wind would come, or a current would carry me back to the shore.\u0027Her family only realised something was amiss at 7pm when she failed to return from her spa appointment - by then Olga had been in there sea already for four hours.Her belongings including her purse were found on the beach.\u0027This was the start of our nightmare,\u0027 said Yulia, a TV producer.Police came to the hotel and several large boats were sent out.\u0027It was not possible to use small boats near the shore because the weather was bad, it was a storm.\u0027They would use a helicopter to search but only next morning, they were told.Yulia was in panic.

Australasian Olympic Team at Stockholm Roddforening includes Fanny Durack and Mina WylieAfter some fundraising efforts by supporters, Fanny was able to travel to London and then Stockholm where she became one of two Australian gold medallists following her 100 meters freestyle win. Her friend Mina won the silver.Fanny was then recognised as a national heroine, went on to tour the US and promote swimming more than any woman, apart from her fellow Australian Annette Kellerman. Between 1912 and 1918, she broke 12 world records before retiring and marrying Bernard Gately.She coached juniors and became a member of the organisation that had at first prevented her from competing, which was renamed the New South Wales Women’s Amateur Swimming Association. Fanny died in 1956.What is a Google Doodle?Sarah ‘Fanny’ Durack has been celebrated in the Google Doodle for July 12, 2018 and to this day, her name lives on because of her commitment to gender equality in sports.

Because, just under a year ago, she became an egg donor, an act of pure altruism to help a childless couple be given the joy of parenthood.What’s more, she did it not as well as, but instead of, having children of her own.‘I’m not really very maternal at all — I have no real desire to have children,’ she says. ‘My two best friends have had babies and, while I am really happy for them, and the babies are gorgeous, the moment they start crying, I just want to get out of there.‘I love my career and I just don’t see children in my future. So, for me, this was a way I could help someone else have a child without having one myself. That’s actually what made it attractive to me.’It’s a laudable instinct and one that Kerri believes should be more widely shared — one reason she set up a no-holds-barred Twitter account for the duration of her egg donation journey, documenting the injections, the scans and the physical changes she underwent on her three-month egg donor ‘journey’.Every painful needle and mottled bruise, every stomach cramp and hormone surge are all carefully photographed and honestly described. It’s not easy reading, and certainly not for the squeamish, but it prompts the very obvious question: what drives a healthy, fertile young woman to put herself through this physical discomfort and mental uncertainty without the reward of a baby of her own at the end?It certainly isn’t money: in the UK, egg donors cannot be paid, although they can receive up to £750 compensation per donation cycle to cover their travel, accommodation or childcare costs. So, what was it?‘I had friends who were struggling to conceive and I had seen first-hand how desperate they were to have a child,’ says Kerri.‘My father also works as a foster carer and seeing what he does is a constant reminder of the unfairness of the world: so many people would give everything they had to have a baby, yet can’t have them — while others have them and don’t deserve them.’           Kerri Middleton was thrilled when she found out a woman she had never met was going to have a baby using eggs she donated to herKerri was also determined to spread the word on how women like her — fertile, but without maternal instincts — could help.‘When I was researching egg donation, there was lots of medical stuff to read up on, but not much from people who had actually done it,’ she says. ‘I thought the blog might be helpful — and, if it gets just one more woman to think about donating her eggs, then it has achieved something good.’There’s certainly no shortage of demand — a demand that continues to grow as more women and couples are deciding to start a family later in life, before discovering that it’s not plain sailing.The latest figures in the UK show that 3,924 babies were born from egg donors in 2016, almost double the number ten years earlier.Demand, however, is not matched by supply: the shortage of donor eggs has been described as ‘critical’ with many women travelling abroad in order to fulfil their dream of motherhood — leaving clinics to rely on emotion-tugging adverts to entice prospective donors.Kerri spotted just such an advert early last year while travelling on the underground in London, where she was then working.At the time Kerri, who grew up the middle child of three in Bournemouth, had a well-paid job in sales for a medical supply company, and motherhood could not have been further from her mind.Yet something about the picture of a smiling baby caught her eye. ‘Alongside it was a question about whether you had considered egg donation,’ she recalls.‘I’d never even heard of it but I was curious and it played on my mind so I did some research, read around it and the more I read the more I wanted to do something about it so I contacted the clinic and made an appointment.’And so, in early March, Kerri arrived at a small private clinic in central London for a 40-minute initial appointment.          The latest figures in the UK show that 3,924 babies were born from egg donors in 2016‘There was a lot of paperwork, mostly about my health and any family illnesses — which happily we don’t have. They also explained the risks and they then gave me some paperwork to look over but by then I had already made up my mind,’ she recalls.While the health risks of donating eggs appear to be few, there is a risk of ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome (OHSS), a rare but potentially severe condition that occurs when fertility medication causes too many eggs to develop in the ovaries. If not treated in time it can prove fatal.‘My view was that the risks were small — obviously with anything of this nature there is going to be some risk, but it was a calculated one.’Initially, Kerri told no one about her plans, but eventually mentioned it to a flatmate. ‘She’s very sensible — she was the one who said I needed to talk to my parents,’ she says. ‘I actually hadn’t thought about it but she was right.‘They didn’t really say much. I think they were a bit surprised but they were supportive and knew me too well to try to talk me out of it.’Over the coming days and weeks Kerri confided in other friends and colleagues. ‘Most people were fine but I was surprised by the lack of understanding around it. Some friends asked if it meant I would never be able to have kids of my own and one person asked if it meant I would go through menopause early.‘It was amazing the amount of women who didn’t even understand what happens in their own body.’The more negative reactions came from some male friends. ‘Some seemed freaked out by it. I don’t know if it was because they felt threatened by it in some way.’Because the start of the process has to be carefully timed to coincide with the start of her menstrual cycle it was not until June that Kerri —who had also received a counselling session from the clinic to ensure she was psychologically prepared — returned to start the process in earnest, receiving the kit she would need for ten days of daily injections to do at home that would stimulate her ovaries to release more eggs.‘It was actually harder than I’d been prepared for,’ she admits. ‘The way the injection was described I thought it would be a pinprick but in fact it’s a two-inch needle. I’m not good with needles at the best of times but I knew it was something I had to just get on with.’Aside from the briefly unpleasant nature of the injections, Kerri said she had few side-effects other than mild period pain, bloating and headaches.Every three days, meanwhile, she had to go to the clinic for an internal scan to check that everything was happening as it should.‘Obviously it wasn’t always convenient but then I would be in the waiting room and I would watch some lovely couple filling in paperwork and it would be a reminder of what it was all about,’ she says.Woman, 25, WINS fight to use sperm harvested from her dead...More women over 50 are choosing to have babies later as...Boys born to women who delay motherhood to put careers first...Share this articleTen days in, a scan revealed that Kerri was successfully growing healthy egg sacks, which meant she could now undergo surgery to harvest her eggs — a procedure preceded by one rather more unpleasant injection.‘I had to inject myself once a few days before surgery with what felt like a huge needle,’ she says. ‘It actually made me feel a bit sick and it took me 40 minutes to pluck up the courage to do it.’The ten-minute removal procedure under general anaesthetic took place at a clinic on London’s Harley Street on July 4 last year and Kerri admits that she had underestimated quite how daunting it would feel.‘I had felt pretty ropey in the days running up to surgery — very tired, and with really bad bloating,’ she recalls. ‘I had never had a general anaesthetic before and I think it just suddenly hit me what was happening. I did have a little cry.‘More than anything I was just anxious that they would actually recover some eggs — even if everything has been going well up to that point there are no guarantees and it would have felt awful if it was all for nothing.’In fact, she woke in the recovery room to news that doctors had harvested 16 healthy eggs. ‘I was buzzing,’ she says.‘I had honestly never felt so proud of myself. It felt so good that I had another little cry.’Sent home with what she calls a ‘mass’ of paperwork it took two days for the dizzy spells and soreness that were a consequence of the surgery to die down. ‘I had been prepared for that so although it wasn’t great it didn’t bother me,’ she says. ‘I just felt I’d done a really good thing.’Her euphoria was not to last: two weeks later she received a call from the clinic asking if she could go in to see them. ‘I wasn’t sure what to expect but when I got there I was told that half my eggs had been given to a private buyer,’ she says.‘It was a woman who didn’t live in the UK but she had bought the eggs and fertilised them with sperm she had also bought separately. Apparently the sperm was infected and the eggs had all been killed. The reason they had called me in was to ask if I would donate again.’          Kerry endured daily injections and painful operations to donate her eggs to other womenThe answer was a robust no.‘I felt pretty angry and upset, like it was a misuse of my eggs,’ she says now. ‘I understood that you don’t get a say in where your eggs go but it felt like this woman was playing God.’There were some happier tidings: the remaining eight eggs had been given to an infertile couple who had been referred to the clinic by the NHS.‘I said that I would be happy to donate again in future if all my eggs were used and they wanted a biological sibling for any baby they had.’ Kerri heard nothing further until, in April, she learned that there was a ‘live pregnancy’ from her donation.She will, subsequently, be told the date of birth and the sex.‘I was thrilled,’ she recalls. ‘I knew how excited this unknown woman must be, that she would have been on the most enormous rollercoaster to get to the point where she was carrying a baby in her tummy.‘I felt nothing but happiness for her.’ Not so her mother, however.It was at this point, with a biological grandchild growing somewhere, that Kerri’s ‘gift’ started to feel real.‘I think it did make her see things differently,’ Kerry acknowledges.‘For the first time she said she felt a bit funny about the fact that she will have a grandchild out there she may never meet.’          A pictures of a scan showing Kerri\u0027s eggs which she goes through daily injections so she can donate themBut from Kerri? Nothing else? Not a twinge of curiosity, or a pang of longing for a child that is genetically at least, half hers? Not at all, she insists.‘Whether it’s a boy or a girl makes no difference to me’ she says.‘I don’t feel it’s my baby. The way I see it is that there was a couple who desperately wanted to get to an airport to go on holiday but they couldn’t find a car to take them there. I provided the car.‘So I helped them to their destination but their life there is nothing to do with me.’ The baby, of course, may see it differently: since the law changed in 2005 all donors in the UK are required to sign a register containing their contact details and babies born as a result of egg donation are allowed to access information about their donor when they turn 18.It means that some day, nearly two decades from now, Kerri may receive an email, or a knock at the door, from her biological son or daughter. ‘I am open to that but it is not something I worry about either,’ she says. It will, of course, be fascinating to see if she feels the same way in five years time — or if it impacts on future relationships.Currently single, might a future partner find it hard to accept that his girlfriend’s offspring is out there somewhere unknown to her.‘I actually don’t worry about that — for me I think the bigger conversation is the fact I don’t want children,’ she says.‘It’s a hard conversation to have.‘All I know is that there are women out there right now who are yearning to carry their own baby. I’m not one of them — but I have helped someone who couldn’t’.’ "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/06/03/4DF68EE100000578-0-image-m-13_1530843377347.jpg","title":"Black man told leave pool apartment complex Indianapolis","story":"Black woman films angry white motorist calling 911 on her...Black 12-year-old boy mowing lawns for the summer has the...\u0027Permit Patty\u0027 DID call the cops: Newly released 911 call...Outrage after black Oakland firefighter on property...Share this articleSpeaking to WRTV, he said he \u0027didn\u0027t want to jump to racism\u0027, but couldn\u0027t help but notice he was the only black person at the pool and had been the only one ejected.Barrett \u0026amp Stokely, the company that manages the River Crossing complex, said they were taking Holland\u0027s claims seriously and continuing to investigate.Candace, the property manager, has been placed on leave pending the results of an investigation.   \u0027We are disappointed that we weren\u0027t able to handle this situation in a way in which everyone felt respected and understood,\u0027 a statement shared to social media read.\u0027We should have communicated with all residents that we would have security on site, who would be asking for proof of residency.\u0027  Holland refused to give a security guard (left) his exact address because he says she had not properly identified herself, and when his property manager Candace (right) arrived on the scene and confirmed he was a resident, she asked him to leave for not complying with the guard          Instead of giving the guard his address, he showed her his key to the pool area to prove he lived there (pictured).

I have not been able to sleep in my own room and it worries me because I have no idea how long he was watching me for.\u0027I feel hate. I am incredibly anxious and I feel violated.

This has had a huge impact on my mental health. I was only trying to be friends with him.\u0027 The second victim said: \u0027I feel violated at being recorded in my own home. This has been a worrying time.\u0027Cooksey admitted three offences of voyeurism. He was handed a 10-month jail sentence suspended for two years after claiming he carried out the offences as he was \u0027lonely.\u0027          Minshull Street Crown Court, pictured, heard how Cooksey had become obsessed with the woman next door. He installed a hidden camera so he could watch her undressingHe has since moved house and is living with a family member near Salford, Greater Manchester. Prosecutor Andrew Evans said: \u0027The neighbour knew the defendant for a short period of time and she felt sorry for him as he appeared to be lonely.\u0027But he repeatedly asked to speak to her or contact her then began asking her if she needed any jobs doing. She felt that he might fancy her, although she did nothing to encourage him.\u0027During an unrelated incident, the complainant went outside and the defendant was stood with her and asked if she was alright. The conversation continued and he asked her if she was single and he then asked her if she wanted to be his f*** buddy. He then asked her if she needed a hug.

But following the incident he messaged her an inappropriate message that led her to believe something was wrong.\u0027She deleted the message immediately, went straight to her bedroom and she found a camera in the back of her wardrobe in the wall. \u0027She called the police immediately and told them she suspected a camera had been placed in the back of her wardrobe. Mr Evans added that Cooksey had admitted filming both women \u0027for sexual gratification\u0027. In mitigation for Cooksey, Brigid Baillie said: \u0027He was isolated. He has not had a relationship and spent his time on his computer watching adult pornography. He has experienced some trauma in recent years. His brother died and this was brought on by a faulty gene. He has now discovered he also suffers with this faulty gene.\u0027His character references show him to be a helpful, hardworking young man.\u0027Sentencing Judge Angela Nield told Cooksey: \u0027You listened to and watched her whilst she was engaged in private acts in the privacy of her own bedroom. She felt degraded and violated by this behaviour and this was extremely upsetting for both complainants.\u0027 Cooksey was ordered to take part in the Sex Offenders Treatment programme, complete 180 hours unpaid work and pay £1,000 compensation to each victim. He was also ordered to sign the Sex Offenders register for 10 years."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/13/08/4E2BAC9800000578-0-image-a-3_1531466586926.jpg","title":"Devoted couple celebrate anniversary having not spent single night apart 70 years marriage","story":"    Albert Twinley, 95, and Phyllis Twinley, 91, celebrating an astonishing 70 years of wedded bliss          The happy couple met in north London in 1946 when they were serving with the Royal Signals as company quartermaster sergeantsPhyllis said: \u0027There\u0027s no secret.

Dr Krish Kandiah said spirituality is leading more and more young people to churches.

I thought how they would be hurt by my death.\u0027This made me keep going. I had to fight until the very end. I kept trying to overcome my gloomy thoughts.\u0027There was another fear too - sharks or other threats lurking in the deep.\u0027I felt things touching my legs.\u0027I kept assuring myself it was just seaweed, nothing dangerous, that there was nothing down there that could harm me.\u0027I just kept hoping that the right wind would come, or a current would carry me back to the shore.\u0027Her family only realised something was amiss at 7pm when she failed to return from her spa appointment - by then Olga had been in there sea already for four hours.Her belongings including her purse were found on the beach.\u0027This was the start of our nightmare,\u0027 said Yulia, a TV producer.Police came to the hotel and several large boats were sent out.\u0027It was not possible to use small boats near the shore because the weather was bad, it was a storm.\u0027They would use a helicopter to search but only next morning, they were told.Yulia was in panic.

But this is definitely not the answer the interviewer is looking for.  Therefore it is not the answer you should be giving.If you honestly don\u0027t think you have any weaknesses then you risk coming across as arrogant if you say so – and nobody wants a perfect candidate anyway.          Don\u0027t let it throw you off balance: There are a number of ways to tackle this tricky questionTURN IT ROUND TO YOUR ADVANTAGEWhile this is a somewhat negative question, it is in fact full of opportunities for you to turn it round to your advantage and make your answer a positive point.Don\u0027t be perturbed by the question or let it throw you off balance. Your answer should be right on the tip of your tongue – because we will work on it right now.The first thing to make clear is that you should only ever discuss a \u0027professional\u0027 weakness, unless the interviewer specifically requests otherwise, which is extremely unlikely.In a nutshell, the interviewer wants to know that you are able to look at yourself objectively and criticise yourself where appropriate.TWO CHOICES TO TAKE WHEN ANSWERINGYou don\u0027t just want to come up with a straightforward list of what you consider your weaknesses to be. You basically have two choices:- Talk about a weakness that\u0027s not necessarily a weakness at all.- Talk about a weakness that you turned (or can turn) into a strength.The problem with the first option is that you risk running into serious cliché territory. I\u0027m talking about the kind of people who answer:- I would have to say that my main weakness is that I\u0027m a perfectionist.- I have a reputation for working too hard I often push myself far too hard in my work.You risk sounding like you plucked your answer straight out of a 1990s manual on interview technique.Personally, I prefer the second option: Talk about a weakness that you turned - or are turning - into a strength.You are answering the interviewer\u0027s question by highlighting a definite weakness, but you then go on to reflect positively on this by outlining the active steps you have taken or are taking to overcome it.You are demonstrating a willingness to learn, adapt and improve and that you have the initiative required to make changes where changes are due.Choosing a weakness that has its root in lack of experience and therefore has been (or is being) overcome by further training is ideal because it is a weakness that is relatively easily resolved.      £185 M\u0026S vouchers to switch and stayNo fees to use abroadJames Innes Group of CV Consultants - The James Innes Group"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/12/15/4E27F37000000578-5946461-MailOnline_can_reveal_that_he_ran_the_Mermaid_Fish_Bar_in_North_-a-20_1531404037258.jpg","title":"Rail boss battered ordering commuters class used run fish chip shop","story":"    Rail boss Mark Boon, who was slammed for kicking passengers on a busy train out of first class before spreading across two seats (pictured above), used to run a fish and chip shop, MailOnline can reveal          MailOnline can reveal that he ran the Mermaid Fish Bar in North Finchley (above left) for four years between 2009 and 2013 and was popular locally           Mehrdad Kayedpour, who now runs the chip shop, described how he\u0027d been well loved in the community when he\u0027d run the popular chippy, originally established in 1932 TfL tube strike: All you need to know about the Piccadilly...Rail services return to line axed by Beeching: Firm starts...Share this articleBrought up in Merthyr Tydfil, south Wales, he worked for National Express and TfL before running and owning a \u0027family catering business\u0027, according to his Linkedin profile.He ran the Mermaid Fish Bar for four years between 2009 and 2013.Mehrdad Kayedpour, who now runs the chip shop, described how he\u0027d been well loved in the community when he\u0027d run the popular chippy, originally established in 1932.He said: \u0027He lived in the flat above the shop.

Earlier this week, a photo of Mr Boon posted by hairdresser Emma Fitzpatrick showing him then taking up two seats in first class - including one for his bag and jacket - went viral online, prompting  fury          Emma FitzPatrick tweeted this message with the photo after being shocked by his actionsShe confronted him about his behaviour as the train pulled into London Victoria, telling him: \u0027I can\u0027t believe what you\u0027ve done today. You should be hanging your head in shame.\u0027 Ms Fitzpatrick claims Mr Boon handed his business card out to passengers as he turned them away.Sharing the photo on Twitter, Emma wrote: \u0027Totally shocked to see Govia Railway Head of Operations, Mark Boon, telling all commuters to stay out of an EMPTY First Class carriage on a LATE \u0026amp very packed train this morning. Meanwhile he took up two seats in there.\u0027She continued: \u0027It was a London bound Southern Train that arrived into London Victoria at approx 11.45am this morning.\u0027I still can\u0027t believe it. He even handed his business card out to the people that he was turning away! Talk about rubbing salt into commuters\u0027 wounds.\u0027Describing her experience on the train, she added: \u0027I saw First Class had just two men sat in there, so lots of spare seats - around eight or 10 available. So I started squeezing past those stood up, to go and sit in there.\u0027But then a lady told me the man there - pointing at Mark Boon, had told her not to sit in there as she had gone to sit down.\u0027I couldn\u0027t believe it. Then she showed me the business card he had given her. I said, \u0027You must be joking\u0027, but another female passenger nodded and said he had said the same to her.\u0027          Commuters on the line have experienced horrific conditions and delays in recent years          The franchise has been repeatedly criticised over the conditions on its trains. Pictured: 2017Ms Fitzpatrick said she made her way to the first class compartment - where Mr Boon glanced at her and immediately told her the same thing.\u0027He didn\u0027t even ask if I had a First Class ticket - he just looked at me and assumed I didn\u0027t,\u0027 she said.\u0027He told me the carriage was for First Class passengers only. I was so shocked.\u0027I told him I was feeling a little unwell so I needed a seat, but he dismissively said to go and get some water or something, and looked back down at his phone.\u0027I told him I would sit down on the arm of a chair, so as to keep the First Class seats free.\u0027I was just blown away looking back at the men and women packed in down the train.\u0027 Within 24 hours of sharing the photo, Emma\u0027s Tweet had been shared hundreds of times - with outraged Twitter users sharing their disdain.A Govia Thameslink spokesman said: \u0027Passengers need a first class ticket to travel in first class and there were other people with first class tickets in this compartment.\u0027This was an 11am off-peak service running just six minutes late and, while the front coaches were busy, there were seats and space in the rear coaches, as Mr Boon explained.\u0027       "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/12/09/4E270F4000000578-0-image-a-33_1531385867147.jpg","title":"Man spends 12 days building cat cardboard maze three feet high walls","story":"    Pusic - a black and white domestic short hair cat - was tested by his owner\u0027s makeshift mazePet owner faces hostile backlash after placing his cat Uma...Danish kitten likes to ride around the house on a robotic...Share this articleHe spent 32 hours making the three minute video.

He discusses the ‘cult’ of Catholicism, his love of poetry and giving up his vices“I’ve been doing this for a quarter of a century,” points out Dylan Moran. “I’m probably going to know about as much as I’m ever going to know on a working level. There’s a liberty in that.” It’s hard to believe so much time has passed since the Irish comic first shuffled on to the stage, cigarette and drink at the ready, and appeared not to know what on earth he was doing there. In 1996, aged 24, he became the youngest person to win the Perrier comedy award at the Edinburgh festival, and embarked on his first UK tour the year after. TV and film opportunities followed, often playing various iterations of his rumpled, grumpy stage persona: in the 1998 sitcom How Do You Want Me?, with the late Charlotte Coleman a cameo as a shameless shoplifter in the Richard Curtis film Notting Hill roles in the Simon Pegg vehicles Shaun of the Dead and Run, Fatboy, Run. More recently he’s appeared in the 2014 Irish film Calvary and the TV sitcom Uncle.But the show he remains best known for is cult favourite Black Books, co-created with Graham Linehan, in which Moran took centre stage as the operatically bad-tempered secondhand bookshop owner Bernard Black, a petty tyrant to his sweet-natured assistant, played by Bill Bailey. An extended love letter to booze, fags, dusty bookshops and stubborn iniduality, it ran for three series, from 2000 to 2004, and still inspires enormous affection.Drinking coffee in a London cafe on the same street where he worked on the show, Moran ascribes viewers’ love for Bernard to the fact that “he does what you want to do. He’s a refusenik child, he’s the child who doesn’t want to get out of bed. We all have a bit of that in us. Basically, Grumpy Cat stole my act.”Moran’s standup act has remained much the same over the decades: bumbling, hesitating, getting snarled up in microphone leads wandering off on surreal flights of fancy and gently charming the audience with routines about the differences between the sexes or the ridiculousness of Game of Thrones before dropping in a casual reminder that we’re all just “hot fleas in the gulping dark”. (On his 2015 tour he reduced life to four stages: “Child, failure, old, dead.”) Over the past few years he’s been travelling widely, “riding the jetstream of English as a world language” to Scandinavia and the Baltic states, as well as becoming the first English-speaking comic to perform in Russia in 2012.“The first few jokes were in Russian, messing around. I said, ya shpion, which means I’m a spy, vy shpion, you’re a spy too, I can tell. It’s nonsense, but you’ve got to come from nowhere, talking through the stereotypes and all the cultural baggage we have.” Gags about homophobic laws and an imprisoned oil tycoon may have been lost in translation: “I think there was some censorship going on,” he admits.His interest in global touring stems from seeing parallels between cultures. “I was always fascinated by eastern Europe growing up, because they were like us. A certain kind of isolation. Ireland was just this weird hangover of old-fashioned religiosity.” As an only child in Navan, Co Meath, growing up in the 1970s and 80s, his was one of the very few families not to go to church, giving Moran an early lesson in non-compliance.The saturation of religion – “it was everywhere, it was in your soup” – meant that he “didn’t have a great time” at school, and left at 16. “It was very church-oriented. Once you have the education system, you have everything. I’m very anti the whole jokey ‘Ah sure, isn’t it just Ireland, and the priests were part of the landscape’. I still think there should be a lot more reparations. It was a cult! And for women it was absolutely apocalyptic.” He settled in Edinburgh 20 years ago with his Scottish script editor wife Elaine, where they have raised two children.Even after escaping school, Moran’s late teens were miserable. “I was trying to figure out what the hell to do. I didn’t have any qualifications and I was pretty desperate. I wrote, I read, I bit my nails. I was kind of worried that I wasn’t more worried – I was a bit of a slacker about it. But it did give me time to think.” When he got to Dublin and tried standup, “It was like a throwing my cards in the air type of thing – trying on a suit that fits and it’s just perfect.”And the turbo-charged reading jag of those teenage years had laid down the literary seam that nourishes his comedy. Those artful hesitations and the gleeful dyspepsia share DNA with Beckett’s rambling, rumbling voices in the dark, while the surreal inventiveness and wordplay echo the spiky humour of Flann O’Brien. Moran was also an obsessive play reader, forging his dramatic sensibility and sense of timing without leaving his bedroom (“comedy is all about the ision of time, rhythms, the fall of language”). He remembers his father handing him Pinter at 15 he then flew through “all Ibsen, all Chekhov, Edward Bond – I’d even read all Noël Coward”. These days, though he tips his hat at Edward St Aubyn (“he’s our Waugh”) and is intrigued by Nicola Barker, he reads only poetry: Charles Simic, Frederick Seidel, Fiona Sampson, Sharon Olds.“Publishing should wake up to the fact that people’s attention loops are shrinking by the second,” he says. “Sell poetry as a hit, the way you sell coffee or chilli: you get a linguistic bang off this thing.” He has put out pamphlets of his own poems (“vanity publishing, self-published, whatever you want to call it”) and also posts them on Instagram, along with the trippy cartoons that form the backdrop to his live shows. “They’re just jingles and doodles, but people like them. It’s like a clearing desk. Every day I write, every day I draw. It’s all I’ve got.”The verbal fun of standup is much more like poetry than prose, he says, “because a lot of it is about elision, suggestion, inference, the white space around the words. They’re much closer than people think, poetry and jokes. Look at haiku, koans … dense, rich word forms. That’s where I live. I live in that.”In fact, Moran spent a long time feeling guilty that his love of standup was getting in the way of a literary career. “For years, I thought oh, this is terribly annoying, I’m on stage, I should be writing books, I should be staying at home and not leaving the house.” After decades of promising that a book was in the pipeline, he has finally realised that “I don’t have to write novels. What a terrible problem to have, eh?” He laughs at his own ridiculousness. “‘I feel so liberated now I’ve cast off that yoke of having to produce novels!’ My novel hell, I should call my memoir.”At 46, he feels “out of a rut” in more ways than one. Booze and fags were fuel for his early standup and louche persona, the drunken Irishman act a way to grab audience attention as well as calm his nerves. But now, having quit cigarettes four years ago – “smoking or breathing, one of them had to go” – he’s recently taken a “little holiday” from alcohol, a dry January that has kept going into May (and enabled him to “lose 485 pounds and extend each day to last 385,000 hours”). “You’re sort of embarrassed that you’re still the same person because you invested so much of yourself in the vice,” he says. “It’s incredible what you can give up, really.”The new show, Dr Cosmos, which is touring the UK this autumn, is about “the bonfire of now. The blazing relentlessness and the effect it has on you. How do you sit still without coming apart at the seams?” Middle age tends to accelerate the conviction that the world is going to hell in a handcart, but Moran points to “a massive consensus: we’re all agreed that the world is indeed fucked right now. Everyone knows that the American president is a ludicrous person, in this country we’ve got two zombie political parties having a pretend show of political debate that’s never going to lead to anything, and Britain is going through this extraordinary act of sending itself to its room and not coming down as a show of – what? You shat your pants in front of the whole world and you’re sulking?“It’s embarrassed by its own behaviour, frankly, and it’s a postcolonial sulk. Everybody’s just looking around, waiting for the embarrassment to fade. But Britain has this tradition of carrying on resolutely, because you’re committed to something, and is therefore locked into a position where it has to be seen to execute the absurdity it doesn’t want to go through with. These are desperate times.” Whereas in the past he often wrote shows out “like a book”, this year, “for the first time really, I’m not banking on having everything written up. I’m realising – and I really am just realising this now, I’m very thick, really –that I really am working in an oral tradition. So I am going to talk it. It’s like going back to when I began: sometimes I just talked because I didn’t know how you did standup.”Moran has always been unwilling to “dissect the fairy of comedy”, but with 25 years of experience under his belt he underlines that it’s about recognition – “people are amazed if you anticipate their experience” – and heart. “People forget how much gut is involved in it, how much your kishkas are involved. All this frontal, verbal, parlour game bullshit in British comedy is so boring and sounds like fucking Punch from 1850. It’s oppressive to any vigour and having a voice. If you listen to new British music, grime, how younger people speak: where’s the mainstream comedy reflecting those voices?“What really makes me laugh more than anything in the world,” he concludes, “is when somebody you love impersonates you. You are seen. You are shown back to yourself 3D, in the round, in motion, the dynamic of you. That’s what I want for an audience. I want them to feel that they have been seen. And I want to show them back to themselves.”• Dylan Moran: Dr Cosmos will be at the Edinburgh festival fringe in August, and then touring the UK from September 2018. dylanmoran."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bc285fe31e99f830f197797846d9031ddcb9ff8c/0_0_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6774ee43d81254c13ebe13ba4a5a5422","title":"on your bike the best books about cycling","story":"With the Tour de France in full swing, saddle up and check out the greatest books on two wheelsIn Mythologies, Roland Barthes argued that the Tour de France was an epic ritual as much as it was a sporting event. For Barthes the race, which set off from the village of Noirmoutier-en-l’Île in north-west France last Saturday, traversed “a veritable Homeric geography”, providing a way to map a nation and celebrate the heroic tenacity of those who cycled through it.Books about racing have tended to focus of the physical suffering endured by the long-distance road cyclist (and often on their chemical aids). As early as 1902 the experimental playwright and novelist Alfred Jarry, who scandalised French literary society by wearing his cycling outfit to the poet Stéphane Mallarmé’s funeral, described the way in which competitive cycling reduced riders to machines. His absurdist, whimsical novella The Supermale describes a race between a group of cyclists and a train. The riders are fuelled by a cocktail of drugs and one dies during the race but, being legally contracted to finish it, his body is obliged to carry on cycling.The finest account of the introverted suffering of bicycle racing – and one of the greatest sporting novels ever written – is the Dutch novelist Tim Krabbé’s The Rider, a first-person description of a semi-professional, one-day race, recounted kilometre by kilometre. Krabbé is a cyclist and also a championship chess player, and he’s exceptionally good on the tactics and mind games involved. In The Rider the race becomes a duel between the narrator and another rider. It’s also a book about obsession. “Non-racers,” the narrator thinks, as he surveys the crowd of race spectators. “The emptiness of those lives shocks me.”At its best cycling, like bicycle writing, provides a way of encountering familiar places in new and surprising ways. “It is by riding a bicycle that you learn the contours of a country best,” wrote Ernest Hemingway, “since you have to sweat up the hills and coast down them.” Two of the best books to celebrate this kind of discovery are Dervla Murphy’s Full Tilt: Ireland to India With a Bicycle, her classic account of a ride undertaken in 1963, armed with her bicycle, named Roz, and a pistol and Emily Chappell’s What Goes Around.Chappell’s book is a memoir of the years she worked as a bicycle courier, a difficult and dangerous job often thought to be dominated by men. She writes beautifully about the freedom provided by cycling and the way in which riding a bike allowed her to rediscover both the London she thought she knew, and also herself.While not a sports writer, the historian Graham Robb conducts much of his research from the saddle. His Cols and Passes of the British Isles is a loving, obsessive almanac of the 2,002 true cols (the lowest point between two mountains) and 105 passes in the UK. In The Discovery of France he pedalled across “l’Hexagone”, sticking to the backstreets and cobbled country roads that he would have missed had he driven. “A bicycle,” he writes in his warm, rich and fascinating book, “unrolls a 360- degree panorama of the land, allows the rider to register its gradual changes … and makes it hard to miss a single inch of it, from the tyre lacerating suburbs of Paris to the Mistral-blasted plains of Provence.” If only the riders of the Tour have time to notice.• Jon Day’s Cyclogeography: Journeys of a London Bicycle Courier is published by Notting Hill Editions."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/95909f403a40b7c6704e78f30144e800d0704477/16_133_2069_1242/master/2069.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6088079e29d0c30a31e22a262bcd841","title":"uk to pass 1000 hours without coal as energy shift accelerates","story":"Revival of last eight coal plants when ‘beast from the east’ hit Britain proved to be briefBritain has been powered for more than a thousand hours without coal this year, in a new milestone underscoring how the polluting fuel’s decline is accelerating.The UK’s last eight coal power plants staged a brief revival when the “beast from the east” pushed up gas prices earlier this year, causing coal plants to fire up.However, the blip proved short-lived and immaterial, figures compiled by MyGridGB show. The country passed the threshold of 1,000 coal-free hours in the early hours of Friday.The pace of coal power’s demise is speeding up. Throughout the whole of 2017 there were 624 coal-free hours, up from 210 hours in 2016.Andrew Crossland, an energy expert who runs the MyGridGB site, said: “In 2018, Britain saved its coal use for when it needed it most – during the March cold snap. The decline will deepen in the second half of this year, with the planned closure in September of a Yorkshire coal plant and one in Northern Ireland. After Eggborough and Kilroot cease generating there will be six coal plants left.For the first time since the industrial revolution, the UK went a day without coal last year, followed this year by three days in a row.Coal’s fortunes have been in contrast to a series of record highs for renewable sources of energy, including wind, solar and biomass.The recent weeks of sunny weather have also created a series of solar records. The most recent was a new high for solar output over a month, with 1.94 terawatt hours of power generated between 10 June and 9 July, beating the previous record of 1.77TWh.Alastair Buckley, a solar expert at the University of Sheffield, said: “Some of this increase is due to more solar having been installed since 2017 but most of the increase is climatic, with summer 2018 being the fifth sunniest on record so far. “These figures highlight the growing importance of solar energy as a low-carbon and low-cost source of electricity.”Ministers have pledged to phase out coal entirely by 2025 but generation will dwindle well before then. The government’s own projections forecast the amount of power from coal plants between 2019 and 2025 being less than was produced in 2015 alone, Friends of the Earth pointed out.Cottam in Nottinghamshire and Fiddler’s Ferry in Cheshire are thought by observers to be next in line for closure, from October 2019, when their contracts to supply backup power have expired.

With a working majority of only 13, including the Democratic Unionists, it would take just seven Tory MPs to oppose it. But there are at least 20-30 pro-European Tories minded to do so. Yet May’s softer Brexit blueprint has also significantly increased the prospect of Eurosceptic Conservative MPs voting against her EU deal when it is put to parliament later this year.In the febrile atmosphere at Westminster this week, there have been rumours that up to 70 Tories could oppose it – especially if, as seems likely, May makes further concessions in order to win the EU’s backing for a bespoke deal, instead of having to choose between a Canada or Norway-style agreement. Hints in the white paper about a preferential system for EU migrants, despite May’s rhetoric about ending free movement of labour, will fuel the Tory revolt.May’s embrace for a softer Brexit has therefore changed the Commons arithmetic – and the political calculations that come with it. It is now Labour MPs, rather than Tory ones, who may prove critical. In recognition of this, May has been reaching out to Labour MPs in the hope that soft Brexit supporters vote for her deal, neutralising the impact of the Eurosceptics voting against it. In an unusual move, David Lidington, the Cabinet Office minister and May’s de facto deputy, briefed Labour (as well as Liberal Democrat and SNP) MPs on the Chequers plan.But Labour won’t want to save May. Their leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will almost certainly whip Labour MPs to oppose May’s deal, in the hope that the ensuing chaos will result in an election. (Labour’s six tests, which include replicating the “exact same benefits” of the single market and customs union, are designed not to be met). Although some Labour MPs are no fans of Corbyn and would be tempted to vote for May’s deal if it offers a sufficiently soft Brexit, they would be branded “traitors” and potentially threatened with deselection if they helped a Tory prime minister avoid an election that Corbyn desperately wants. So, it is highly unlikely that there would be enough Labour MPs to balance out a rebellion by Tory Eurosceptics.If neither hard nor soft Brexit can win a parliamentary majority, no-deal can’t either. Hardline Brexiters privately hope that such parliamentary gridlock would allow them to run down the article 50 clock to an accidental exit next March on World Trade Organisation terms. But MPs in all parties say they would intervene to prevent such an economically damaging no-deal outcome.Chequers and the white paper have helped crystallise the problem the government will face in autumn: there is no majority in the Commons for the softer Brexit now advocated by May the “Canada-plus” free trade deal favoured by the Brexiters or the no-deal exit next March favoured by hardline Eurosceptics. In these circumstances, a cross-party alliance would probably call for the two-year article 50 process to be extended beyond 29 March 2019, to which the EU would agree. But there would be no guarantee that further negotiations would produce an outcome parliament could support.Winning the support of the cabinet and the EU was already proving difficult enough. But May’s biggest – if not insurmountable – hurdle now clearly lies at Westminster.• Mujtaba Rahman is the managing director for Europe at Eurasia Group, a political risk research and consulting firm"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f37e9c769794200732ab060a47f63f15c1b976b/0_71_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=43293d84a6e20191923b2498c13e14ef","title":"thameslink commuters govia chris grayling rail industry","story":"On Tuesday, normally mild-mannered commuters from St Albans waved placards and chanted outside London’s St Pancras station in protest at the new Thameslink timetable, which has brought misery to thousands of people. Inspired by those who protested against Govia’s Southern Rail, Govia Thameslink passengers are also now taking to the streets.Delays and cancellations have been a daily occurrence since the new timetable was introduced in late May, but those at least are recorded by the industry. It’s the physical, mental, financial and professional impact that takes its toll the most, but this isn’t factored into any offer of compensation. This is why St Albans commuters are taking matters into our own hands.I’ve set up a Facebook group for St Albans commuters to collect evidence of this broader impact, and it makes for grim reading. Already, a damning dossier has been sent to the cross-party transport select committee. These are just some of the examples they will have read: nurses and midwives late for their shifts heavily pregnant women squashed in so badly they can’t reach the priority seats fraught parents jostling to get the next train so they’re not fined by the school for picking up their children late.Passengers are fainting from the crush, members of the deaf community and disabled people are nearly in tears at the confusion of trains changing platforms and disappearing off the information board altogether, and low-paid workers are being forced into taking leave or losing work because they simply can’t get to their destination on time.Thousands more are stressed, exhausted, and worried about losing their jobs as their reputations at work are tarnished by being late several times a week. Commuters know they are testing the patience of their bosses and co-workers who simply don’t believe that “the train was running late – again”, “the train was cancelled – again”, “the train was delayed because someone fainted – again”.And who is responsible? Who is accountable? Who is the person that passengers can turn to? No one, it seems. There are calls for the transport minister, Chris Grayling, to resign, but local Conservative MPs voted against that in parliament. There are calls for Govia Thameslink to lose its franchise. But this seems unlikely. The government’s threat to pull the franchise within two weeks if performance doesn’t improve conveniently coincides with the third version of the “new” timetable, so hold on to your hats: if services do improve (from the current very low base), the government will probably claim disingenuously next week that its threat worked. The Govia Thameslink boss, Charles Horton, resigned but his replacement doesn’t have the greatest record (he was in charge of London Midland when it lost its franchise last year). It doesn’t inspire confidence.What about the Office of Rail and Road? Network Rail? The Transport Focus watchdog? The Rail Industry Readiness Board? And who in Thameslink, its parent company Govia or the even bigger Go-Ahead Group can give commuters answers? This spaghetti bowl mess that is the rail industry protects everyone except the ordinary folk trying to get to work.Well, commuters have had enough. We’re taking matters into our own hands. The industry and the government have failed us. The current system combines the worst of privatisation and the worst of nationalisation. Passengers need a new deal: we need legislation to give passengers and workers the right to own and manage their own railways in a new mutual.We’ve started collecting the evidence of industry failures ourselves, we’ll make recommendations to the forthcoming inquiry by the transport select committee, and we’ll stamp our feet and shout until the immediate shambles is sorted out and passengers have new rights to make sure this mess can never happen again.• Daisy Cooper was the Liberal Democrat candidate for St Albans in the 2017 general election and is a daily Thameslink commuter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f1a1b8aa3191bdc98987cec808a5bbd33b4d9f2/0_6_2689_1614/master/2689.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a16b359f079ee545621a0b74a0d47dbe","title":"world cup england football team grim reality","story":"Oh well. Take a wet wipe to the red and white face paint, remove the St George’s flag hanging from your car window, delete all the Lightning Seeds memes you had saved in your drafts. Football said it was coming home, but it stopped off in a bar in Zagreb on the way and, well, one thing led to another, and now football has shacked up with Mario Mandžukić.In the post-match interview, Luka Modric, the Croatian Zidane who is tragically trapped inside the body of a bass player from a forgettable 2000s indie band, said that the English pundits had been arrogant to think that football was coming home. I get his point, but he’s mistaking arrogance for escapism. The reason everyone was so excited about football coming home is that home hasn’t been that much fun for the past two years – it’s been angry, mean and fearful. This was the first time in a long while that I’ve seen a bunch of England flags and didn’t immediately think “didn’t the EDL just have a Free Tommy Robinson march?”England’s World Cup ride was like a glorious intermission from Brexit, from Donald Trump’s visit, from all the difficult and terrible things that the country is facing right now, like someone had pressed pause on the horror film we were all being forced to endure and let us watch Wallace and Gromit for a few minutes instead.England players replaced our problems, albeit briefly: instead of chaos, we had Kane instead of pathetic politicians, we had Pickford instead of sterling collapsing, we had Sterling running through the defence about to score a brilliant goal and then collapsing, which was admittedly frustrating but still way better than having to think about Jacob Rees-Mogg. And at the head of it all was Gareth our charming Gareth, a new humble role model for British masculinity, a man who radiates kindness, understanding and politeness so much that he must have been bitten by a radioactive Canadian. They were decent people to support in a country that has been starved of decency – not just in sport, but in public discourse – for a very long time.And now they’re gone. The intermission is over. We have to get back to the horror movie – and what’s worse, the horror movie has continued while we were away, and now the characters are meaner, bloodier and stupider. We’re in the middle of another political crisis, another round of back-stabbing Tories, another cull of mediocre faceless politicians, to be replaced by another set of mediocre faceless politicians. Just look at the calibre of cabinet ministers we have to talk about now – you can tell just from the names. “David Davis has been replaced by Dominic Raab.” There’s something weirdly apt about how neither of those names sound like real people – I could have said “William Billiam has been replaced by Jebediah Buuuuuurk” and really it would have made about as much sense.There was a time when these devious political machinations, this game of Whitehall Russian roulette, would have satisfied a bloodlust, a thirst for bastards and chaos in the news, but I think we’re all just fatigued now. We’ve been given a little glimmer of something different by Gareth Southgate and his beautiful, pure football sons – wholesomeness, honesty, inflatable unicorn battles in swimming pools – and once you get a taste for that, it’s hard to go back to a stingy diet of barefaced lies and duplicity. Politics has always been hideous and cruel, but Southgate’s team have laid bare just how gross the whole thing is. I don’t want to go back. You can’t make me go back.Imagine if we didn’t have to. The pessimist in me says that the only thing politicians will learn from this is that The Common Rabble like The Football again, so they’ll try to get a photo of themselves doing the robot with Peter Crouch. But there’s a deeper lesson to learn from the country’s reaction to this World Cup run: people in England want to feel part of something bigger, to feel united. Not the kind of unity that Theresa May urges every three months whenever she’s run out of things to say to the press, which demands that people change who they are, ignore their differences and become one homogenous, compliant British blob. Rather, a kind of community that celebrates differences, that rewards integrity, that tells people it’s OK to make mistakes, to be afraid, to be emotional.This is a erse, different England team who are open about their struggles – look at Danny Rose’s frank interview before the tournament about his battle against depression, or Raheem Sterling’s beautiful essay about growing up in Jamaica. Not only are they redefining what it means to be English in 2018, they’re redefining how we should treat each other and ourselves – with respect, with humour (I’m thinking Jamie Vardy asking Harry Maguire how big his head is midway through an official interview), and with honesty.As politics descends into recrimination and tribalism, the England football team have given the country an identity, but one which is inclusive, not proscriptive. There is no typical English person – this England side show that England should change to fit you, not the other way around. Our differences aren’t grounds for exclusion from a shared national identity – they are at its core. If only that footballing lesson could be learned by our politicians. I guess we’ll have to settle for empty soundbites and St George’s flags in their Twitter handles instead.• Jack Bernhardt is a comedy writer and occasional performer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4b1174aa398fc1031414b295621ceaef1ffaa3d/0_1195_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28b5c0fd1f97842a6f71c8ea74d3aad3","title":"built to last sand sculpture inspired by britains best castles","story":"‘Ultimate sandcastle’ goes on display in Kent as part of English Heritage eventNo mere scrape of a ditch surrounding an upended bucket of sand will do: a proper sandcastle, according to an English Heritage curator should have curtain walls, an inner bailey, a great tower or keep, a gatehouse and a ditch and bank.Roy Porter said: “By studying hundreds of years of trial and error by the real castle builders, our ultimate sandcastle contains everything you’d like to see, with each element showing off castle-building ‘perfection’ from a different era.”Sand sculptor Jamie Wardley has followed Porter’s instructions to the letter, creating what is billed as the ultimate sandcastle within the walls of the real castle at Dover, where it will be on display until mid-August.There will also be castle-building workshops at eight castles, from Pendennis in Cornwall to Warkworth in Northumberland.

All the fears I had about being in nature hit me in the face. It’s a very real fear for black people, especially those from urban communities, that bad things happen to black people in the woods, like lynching. It’s something that you see again and again when you look at the history of the civil rights movement and slavery: black people going into the woods and not coming back.My friend had grown up hiking. I talked to her about my fears and she respected my apprehension. I said to myself: “You’ve got to do this now or it will never happen.”I grew up in kind of a rough neighborhood on the south side of Chicago, so my mother kept us in a lot. Our house was across the street from a public park but it was rife with gang violence so we never went there.I always knew about hiking and camping from commercials and magazines. But the people doing it didn’t look like me. They were white, athletic and attractive. I’d never, ever seen anybody of color doing it, let alone a black male I associated the outdoors with whiteness. Nobody around me even thought about it. My mother grew up in the backwoods down south, but she never encouraged us to have a connection with nature.My friend and I headed to Starved Rock state park, two hours south of Chicago. We had to drive through this very wooded area and I remember thinking: “I hope nothing happens. I hope I don’t have to get out of the car.” When we started the hike, I had to let go of a lot of what I was feeling. An hour into it, we stopped to take in this view and I was amazed by everything I was experiencing. I loved not hearing the commotion of the city. No cars, no yelling, no arguments on the corner. Just the water, the birds and the wind. It was like a reset button. I remember thinking, “Why haven’t I been doing this all along? Everybody should be doing this. There’s nobody that shouldn’t be hiking!” It was overwhelming to realize that something I’ve always believed isn’t for me actually is. I had spent so much time being nervous about it when it was what I needed.I now go seven to eight times a month. Five days a week I work in sales, spending my time in ginormous condo buildings and busy infrastructure. As soon as I hop in the car to get out of town, the weight of the week lifts. I take my six-year-old daughter so that she knows earlier than I did that this is something beneficial. I let her lead the way on our path and allow her to make decisions for what she’s doing in nature. My mom’s proud of me but I’m still working on getting her out for a hike.Follow Aaron at @MidwestColorCampI grew up in a small town in North Carolina where most of the white people were farm owners and the black people were hired hands. My family farmed and as a child, I spent a lot of time topping tobacco and picking cucumbers, peppers and squash. We’d go out fishing and hang out on the rivers as a family but we were never encouraged to go far from the house. The feeling was that if you went out into the woods by yourself – and you’re black – if no one’s around, you might not end up coming back.The world has changed but that thought pattern is still there. Today, I’m the first African American chapter chair for the Sierra Club in the state of Virginia. It started because a friend took me to a local meeting and I walked in and there were all these old white people. I said, “OK, there has to be some other representation here.” Some people might have walked away but I think my background makes me a little different. Thirty-nine years ago I became a software developer when there were no black people, let alone women, in that industry, so I’ve always had to go a step above. Back then, all the guys smoked in the office and I didn’t, so I went home and practiced how to do it without coughing.But even now in my position as chair, I will still only go on hikes when I’m with a group of people I know. I live within walking distance of a nature trail and I would never go there by myself. It’s not the younger generation but the older generation that you see that look at you like you have no business there. Like you don’t belong. It’s like: “Get out. Get away.” Even though it’s public land, some people are like, “I’m white and therefore I have more rights and I’m better than you.” And some black people still think, “I’m black and if I’m out there, I’m supposed to be cleaning up or waiting on you.” Sometimes when I introduce myself to groups across the state, I have to take a deep breath because I’ll think: “Are these people going to respect me?”What I love about hiking and the outdoors is breathing that clean air and seeing the greenery around me and not hearing cars. Fresh air really energizes me. Part of that is probably because I was born and raised in the country. I don’t even want to think about my three-year-old great-grandson growing up in a world where he doesn’t know what a real river or real group of trees look like. I hate to think of him never ever seeing a live rabbit or squirrel or deer. I spend a lot of time talking to people about the future and keeping the planet livable.Within the Sierra Club, everyone is seriously nice, but understanding things from a different perspective is missing sometimes. I mean, why would a guy living in a $500,000 house know what it feels like to live in a place that you rent for $500 a month and the environmental issues that go with that? That people are just dumping trash in your neighborhood? A lot of older white people don’t know how to communicate with a black person of the street and the same the other way around. The older generation needs to be more embracing and think about how other people feel.My first trip to a national park was life-changing. It was four years ago and I went with some friends to Yosemite. I was getting over a breakup at the time. While there, I met Shelton Johnson, a black park ranger and writer. We got into a discussion about how there aren’t a lot of African American families visiting national parks. It made me sad because as a kid I would have loved to have seen Yosemite. That first trip, I pushed myself and my friends to do a strenuous hike I wasn’t expecting us to complete it but we did and when we got to the top, standing above a waterfall, just looking out on the valley, it made the whole breakup seem so small in comparison to everything that’s out there to explore.After Trump became president, I became a little nervous about traveling in the US. Racism became more overt. Just after the inauguration I went with a couple of friends to western Arizona. On the way, we passed lots of gun stores, some with Confederate flags, and I felt very uncomfortable. When we got there I mostly felt OK because I was with friends who blended in, but there was this one old man who stared at me from the other side of the street. He was eating an ice cream and wearing a Make America Great Again hat. I felt challenged and stared back until he looked away.My boyfriend and I have been together for two and a half years. This January, to celebrate our anniversary, we went on our first official road trip as a couple. He’s white and I’m black, and when we’re hiking in the LA area, I don’t even think about that. But this trip we were heading to Death Valley national park, in a relatively conservative area.On the trails we received nothing but stares. People just wouldn’t stop. They weren’t mean or evil but at some point I said to my boyfriend: “I don’t want to hold your hand any more.” I felt bad because he was being affectionate and wanted to hug and kiss my cheek but I was like: “No, not here.” I didn’t want to make anyone else uncomfortable, even though I was.I feel like it’s important for black girls to hike. When I was young I would have loved to have had someone encouraging me to get outside. To not be afraid. I’ve decided to apply for a master’s degree in parks and recreation management, and a friend and I set up a hiking group for women of color in LA called Black Girls Trekkin’. I want to be a model to other young girls.If you have an outdoors experience you’d like to share with the , please write to us at publiclands@the"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a0bbde69be8932be7ddeebe9745424ca501f797/0_155_2995_1797/master/2995.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64f625b3fa28f133cc51368e21f08736","title":"sunscreen for cows uk farmers struggle to cope with heatwave","story":"Traditional farming shows its benefits as stone barns and hedgerows provide cattle with relief from the heatSunscreen and waiter service for cows, and a renewed appreciation for traditional countryside structures such as stone barns and hedgerows, are some of the modern and ancient ways in which farmers are trying to cope with the heatwave.Record temperatures and a lack of rainfall have drawn comparisons with 1976, the UK’s biggest drought in living memory. Forecasters say the hot weather is set to continue, probably for weeks.While modern livestock sheds are usually cooled with fans and sprinklers, ancient stone barns are also effective in the hot weather, according to Robert Martin, a dairy farmer with a 120-strong herd near Carlisle. Their design means a good circulation of air, and the stones help moderate the temperature inside. “The cows are very comfortable in them.”Martin has also kept many stands of trees on his farm, which is benefitting the cows. Across the UK, much of this traditional shelter has been reduced, as farmers have removed or drastically cut back hedgerows to make for more efficient use of farm machinery. Without their shade, cattle face a hard time, as they are particularly sensitive to sunlight.Liz Bowles, head of farming at the Soil Association, said: “We’d advise farmers to ensure there is adequate shade for livestock to escape the heat, which is why trees on farmland are so important, particularly at this time of year.”The Royal Association of British Dairy Farmers (RABDF) advises moving affected animals to a shaded building, but in some cases – only on a vet’s advice – cattle can be given suncream if they have become sunburned.Cows, like many humans, also lose appetite in the heat, and Martin has got round this by delivering feed right up to each animal to encourage them to eat and drink. “Usually at this time of year they are self-feeding in the fields, but at the moment I’m having to do it,” he said. He is using winter feed, or silage, to ensure the cows have enough food and moisture.Martin, who is also national treasurer of the Tenant Farmers’ Association, said farmers across the country were doing much the same. “Farmers are very good at looking after their livestock. Every farmer will be doing their best, putting in the extra work. I don’t think there will be issues for animal welfare.”Matthew Knight, managing director of the RABDF, said:“With the hot weather set to stay, farmers continue to face the challenge of providing the necessary requirements for their livestock. We advise all our members to focus on best practice, making sure their cows have adequate water and shade, providing additional shade if required.”In the uplands, farmers reliant on natural water supplies were being particularly hard hit, reported Martin Lines, chairman of the Nature Friendly Farming Network. “Many burns are now dry, which is pretty unprecedented in recent times, and there are concerns that private water supplies to farmhouses could run dry.”The economic costs will be harder to avoid. The dry spell has meant the grass is growing less strongly, and becoming parched. Even after rain finally returns, it will take three weeks for the grass to grow sufficiently long for cattle to eat. This means farmers like Martin are having to use up supplies of silage. Lines explained: “Fields are ‘burning up’, leaving less grass for the animals to eat. This will have a knock-on effect on winter fodder and some upland farmers have made only about a third of the hay and silage they made last year.”To make matters worse, the heatwave has followed a long cold winter, when many farmers used up all their stores of feed as livestock were kept indoors longer than usual. Lines said: “They will be faced with having to sell animals or buy extra food from elsewhere, which could have a huge impact on next year’s breeding stock.”The National Farmers’ Union (NFU) has opened a “fodder bank”, a free service to members that allows them to access feed and animal bedding, and lets them sell any surplus they have back to the bank, and said it would remain open as long as necessary.To date, according to the industry body Dairy UK, there has been no effect on dairy prices to consumers. Meat continues to be threatened by the entirely separate problem of falling supplies of carbon dioxide, used in packaging to preserve meat products, but the situation is so far being managed.Some sectors are less affected by the hot dry weather. Richard Griffiths, chief executive of the British Poultry Council, said poultry farmers were challenged, but equipped. “All poultry houses have hi-tech ventilation systems that control and monitor the environment, and this, combined with the skills of our people, means the birds’ welfare is protected. Transportation in this hot weather is carefully managed: we reduce the number of birds on a lorry, maximise the air flow around them, and minimise the journey and waiting times. Our plants have cool well-ventilated areas called lairages, where arriving vehicles are parked and the birds moved from them as soon as possible.”Free-range birds also always have the option of shade or shelter indoors or outdoors, and access to fresh water.While many of the worst effects are falling on livestock farmers, Bowles noted that arable farms were also facing serious problems. “Due to a lack of rainfall and unusually high temperatures, it looks like yields for cereals, potatoes and other crops will be down this summer, which could lead to reduced availability in stores.”Soft fruit, however, is enjoying a bumper year. The winter rainfall and wet spring that hurt animal feed supplies helped to charge up on-farm reservoirs for fruit growers, although according to the NFU some of those are now showing signs of running out.Lines warned that this year’s weather could presage more to come, and that the government should take note. “Farmers need to be prepared for this extreme weather as it may become the new normal if we don’t accelerate our efforts to address climate change. This is why nature-friendly farming has never been more significant. Farmers need to work together to manage the impacts of climate change, and this action needs to be scaled up rapidly, with strong policy support.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cbc6649a2cda16b60b0054cc09b32e8816aae94/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=812f1135cdca541f1ef422101cead87c","title":"the best mens floral print shirts for all ages in pictures","story":"Make the Hawaiian shirt the star of your holiday wardrobe.

A revival of radical movies made by feminist and queer film-makers from the 60s promises to show that revolutionary cinema and the spirit of 1968 isn’t all about angry young men.As the weather sizzles, provocative films by directors including Věra Chytilová, Agnès Varda, Laura Mulvey, Greta Schiller and Mai Zetterling will raise the temperature inside the cinema, too. Leading the charge, the queer feminist collective Club des Femmes has collaborated with the Independent Cinema Office, the BFI and several international archives to roll out a programme called Revolt, She Said: Women and Film after ’68, to venues around Britain. The season is named after Julia Kristeva’s 2002 book, which defines revolt as “a permanent state of questioning, of transformations, an endless probing of appearances”.The films, which range in vintage from 1966 to 1991, speak to this idea in different ways. The oldest in the season is Daisies (1966), Chytilova’s kaleidoscopic classic, an irreverent vision of female rebellion the most recent is Pratibha Parmer’s A Place of Rage (1991), a documentary featuring interviews with Angela Davis and Alice Walker on racism and homophobia.“The story of ’68 as it’s often told is one that’s very much about a certain kind of masculine energy, a certain very explosive political activism,” says So Mayer, a co-curator of the programme. “We wanted to look at how women were at the forefront of many of those movements, and they were often making the first moves, and the first artistic moves, and then maybe their work was sidelined or less seen.” Mayer highlights Parmer’s A Place of Rage: “One of the things it’s about is the place of women, and particularly queer women, at the forefront of the African American liberation struggle, particularly the militant struggle, and of LGBT politics.”Four 1980s films in the selection, for example, deal with subjects and movements as geographically erse as the Troubles in Northern Ireland (Pat Murphy’s Maeve, 1981), the nuclear protest at Greenham Common (Beeban Kidron and Amanda Richardson’s 1983 Carry Greenham Home), LGBT culture in the US (Before Stonewall, Greta Schiller, 1984) and the life of indigenous women in Australia (Tracey Moffatt’s Nice Coloured Girls, 1987).At screenings, audience members will be able to pick up copies of the old-school typed-and-stapled Revolt, She Said zine, which places all the films on a timeline of history from the Cuban revolution in 1959 to the birth of third-wave feminism in 1992. New essays on all the titles, some of which have been very hard to see before, are available on the Club des Femmes website and many of the screenings will be combined with panel discussions to thrash out the politics and aesthetics of the films. The anger of these movies still seems uncomfortably relevant to the current political landscape, but perhaps cinema offers a therapeutic way to deal with these issues, beyond raising consciousness. The question is, says Mayer: “How do we bring together this desire to celebrate intergenerational relationships, activism being handed down, the things that we’ve changed, the gains that we’ve made, to reflect all of that, while also experiencing anger at incredible injustices and inequalities?”The 1977 feminist musical One Sings, the Other Doesn’t is a great example. Watching Varda’s playful exploration of the friendship between two women and their struggles is particularly poignant in 2018. The film may be entering its 40s, but the lead characters’ fight for the right to legal, safe terminations in France reflects recent events in Ireland. Its theme of female solidarity and the quest for personal happiness is timeless, while the lyrics to its quirky musical numbers are often drily witty and provocative at the same time – one song quotes Friedrich Engels’ comment that in a family “the man is the bourgeois and the wife is the proletariat”.Varda, who is still working at 90, is the subject of a continuing retrospective at the BFI Southbank in London and her latest video installation opens at the Liverpool Biennial this weekend.The other films in the season provide a backdrop to Varda’s seven decades as a film-maker. They are all deliberately stimulating: from Chantal Akerman’s domestic tragicomedy Saute Ma Ville (1968), to Laura Mulvey and Peter Wollen’s landmark video essay Riddles of the Sphinx (1977). The idea is that on leaving the cinema you will be enthused by the boldness of the film-making or inspired by the voices you have heard – ideally both. “It’s never just a radical exercise for its own sake,” says Mayer: “The formal and political radicalism are always working hand in hand, trying to wake audiences up, to get them thinking and seeing in new ways.”In fact, one film in the programme, The Girls (1968), Mai Zetterling’s brilliant re-imagining of Lysistrata, poses the question of what it means to be an active, engaged audience. Bibi Andersson plays the leading actor in a revival of the Aristophanes sex-strike comedy who is frustrated by her snoring audience and confronts them disconcertingly from the stage. “You’re sat there like stuffed creatures … Don’t you understand that it’s we who make the world what it is?”Revolt, She Said and Club de Femmes are not working alone. There are a proliferation of feminist and activist film festivals in the UK, as well as erse programming groups who curate one-off screenings and seasons. Bristol’s Cinema Rediscovered festival at the end of the month includes a strand called Women on the Periphery that will screen a series of feature debuts and shorts by female directors including Ildikó Enyedi, Margaret Tait and Gurinder Chadha.Mayer hopes Revolt, She Said will “open us up to a different way of thinking about film history – it’s not auteurist, it’s not national, it’s not about movements”. There’s an important film-preservation angle to the project, too, because it has always been tough to get hold of work by marginalised film-makers. Beyond censorship issues, very few prints tend to be struck in the first place and independent low-budget productions are often plagued by copyright limbos and distribution problems. Now that digital copies have been made of these works, they will reach broader and broader audiences, this summer and beyond.“With these kind of films, just obtaining the materials is a process of often detective work, persuasion and a lot of conversation,” says Mayer. “It seems counterproductive to do that and then not invest in making it so that other people don’t have to go through that again in 20 years’ time.”One example of this recovery process is a German film, Ula Stöckl’s 1968 work The Cat Has Nine Lives. This gorgeous, essayistic and often melancholic movie was Stöckl’s graduation film, and it follows five women testing the boundaries of the late 60s as they try to discover what they want out of life and how to get it – and it is the first question that is the most difficult to answer. The film sank without trace after its distributor went bankrupt and it was years before it was rediscovered and heralded by Christa Maerker as West Germany’s first feminist film. It was recently restored by the Deutchse Kinemathek, allowing its vibrant Technicolor photography to shine. Now, it is screening as part of Revolt, She Said.In a mordant fantasy sequence in the middle of The Girls (1968), a group of men congregate to chuckle over their womenfolk’s latest complaints. “Do you know what I think?” offers one of them, between guffaws and slaps on the back. “I don’t think women ever existed!” It’s a suggestion that tickles his comrades, who fall about all over again. “Whatever the case,” replies his pal, “we’ve always behaved as if they didn’t.”It is a grim analogy for the film industry, in which the contributions of women have consistently been erased or sidelined, even though they have been making successful and often very progressive films since the silent era. These screenings constitute part of the fight to put female film-makers, and their radical voices, back into the canon and to the narrative of film history, which is ripe, in Kristeva’s words, to be questioned, probed and transformed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/877b796961fed19f3a685661b5bf1d6186effd4e/162_0_2150_1290/master/2150.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=054f86d8ff007c89cde76b008ea0a232","title":"croatia pyry soiri finland world cup","story":"Croatia were sleepwalking towards the World Cup under Ante Cacic when Pyry Soiri started a chain of events that have taken their opponents to a World Cup finalPyry Soiri is a name that will sound vaguely familiar to regular followers of the Croatia team but most others in the country – in particular those who have jumped on the bandwagon as they have made their way to a World Cup final – are unlikely to have heard of him. But the 23-year-old Finnish player with a Namibian father, who plays for Shakhtyor Soligorsk in the Belarussian Premier League, had a key role in Croatia’s ascent to the top.It is probably safe to say that none of this – hordes of face-painted fans in Russia and in city squares across Croatia heroic comebacks at the World Cup speculation about Luka Modric winning the Golden Ball – would have been possible if it was not for Soiri.In fact, it is easy to imagine that the team would not have qualified for Russia without him and surely no one outside Croatia – or, perhaps, the Middle East – would be talking about the coach Zlatko Dalic now.Croatia met Finland at home in a World Cup qualifier last October, after three extremely poor and worrying performances. They had lost to both Iceland and Turkey away and only managed a 1-0 home win over Kosovo. The team had no identity, they were blunt in attack, erratic in defence, and even Modric, who was regularly their best player, could not shake them out of the lethargic, depressive state they found themselves in.But the key men in the football federation, with the help of their loyal journalists spread strategically across the mainstream media, invested much effort in assuring the public that everything was going to be OK. They made sure to communicate their full support to the manager, Ante Cacic, whose contract had been extended that year, through all channels available to them.Croatia were still topping the group, level on points with Iceland and two ahead of Turkey and Ukraine. They still had everything in their hands with two games to go and were preparing for the game in Kiev, which would seal their qualification regardless of other results. The match against Finland, a side that had no chance to qualify, was seen as little more than a nuisance.“Why are you being so pessimistic?” — Cacic asked the press the day before the game, trying to give the impression of being a man who fully knew what he was doing, but failing to do so. He produced an awkward grin and briefly turned to Modric, who was sitting next to him, probably expecting the captain’s body language to show signs of support. But Modric kept a serious face.The next day, the team again struggled to break through the not particularly impressive Finland defence, but things appeared to fall into place as Mario Mandzukic scored after 57 minutes. That seemed to be all there was to it the journalists had their match reports finished and ready to file on the whistle, the fans at Rijeka’s small but not sold out Rujevica ground were already leaving, and those watching on TV just waited for another tedious and unconvincing performance to end.But then Pyry Soiri, given his first taste of international football 10 minutes earlier, beat Danijel Subasic to a long ball played behind the back of Croatia’s defence and scored.Suddenly everything was upside down. Croatia now needed a win in Ukraine three days later in order to qualify for the play-off round.That one incident, that one touch, made all the difference in the chaotic world of Croatian football. Cacic was fired the next day and the federation appointed his successor hours before the team were due to fly to Kiev.Zlatko Dalic had watched the team on TV the previous evening that afternoon, he was their manager, having met his players just before checking in at Zagreb airport. Everyone on the Cacic’s staff was fired as well – “or otherwise this wouldn’t be shock therapy,” Davor Suker, the federation president, kindly explained – except for Marijan Mrmic, the goalkeeping coach. Why him? “Because it would look frivolous to have just Dalic sitting alone on the bench in Kiev,” Suker said.This is no joke – he really gave that as a reason. But somehow it all worked. Dalic, who had had an unremarkable coaching career in Croatia and Albania before leaving for the Middle East, where he was AFC Champions League runner-up with Al Ain two years ago, defeated Ukraine, easily dealt with Greece in the play-offs and proceeded to lead Croatia all the way to Sunday’s World Cup final.That they have had a bit of luck on the way cannot be denied, but more than anything, the squad have had guts and shown an incredible mental strength – something few at home thought they possessed.And for this, Dalic must be given huge credit. The talent of the players has never been in question, but Dalic has been the first manager to get the best out of them since Slaven Bilic, who laid the foundations for this generation when he was in charge from 2006 to 2012.Dalic took over with the players at their peak and managed to shape them into a proper, fearsome team something that his predecessors – Igor Stimac, Niko Kovac and Ante Cacic – were unable to do, or at least with any real consistency. There is just no way that they could have done all this with Cacic in charge, even if he had managed to qualify for Russia.And it was a lad whose name has already been forgotten in Croatia who triggered the whole series of events. Pyry Soiri must not be forgotten in these days of glory and celebration. He deserves at least a thank-you note from everyone in the squad."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7951287b268c4c1151ca35338e2ced0099f69cd4/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b136e3545bb6ec5518a56b28c4dec682","title":"england future sessegnon sancho foden gareth southgate","story":"Ryan Sessegnon, Jadon Sancho and Phil Foden are among those who hope to force a way into Gareth Southgate’s plansThe right-back, 19, progressed through the national age groups to be selected for Gareth Southgate’s World Cup squad on the back of an eye-catching campaign for his club. He was excellent while earning a second cap in the group game defeat by Belgium. He is quick, strong and with huge potential taking set plays and the only barrier between the Champions League finalist and the England first team has been the excellence of Kieran Trippier, but Alexander-Arnold represents the long-term future. Like Ruben Loftus-Cheek he will have gained from his experiences in Russia and has done nothing but impress, on and off the pitch, at the World Cup. A third cap surely awaits in Saturday’s third-place play-off.The Liverpool striker, secured from Chelsea in 2014 and prolific at junior international levels, scored eight goals to win the Golden Boot at the Under-17s World Cup last year and might have made an impact in the first team last season but for a knee injury from January. He has since apparently agreed a new five-year deal at Anfield – an announcement is to come – with the club having grown infuriated by interest from Borussia Mönchengladbach to the extent that they cancelled a scheduled pre-season friendly against the Bundesliga club.Another singled out by Southgate, Foden claimed the World Cup Golden Ball award after England’s Under-17s triumphed at the tournament in 2017. The midfielder has been with Manchester City since the age of eight, with Pep Guardiola so impressed that he promoted him into the first-team set-up in December 2016. His debut came 11 months later – he is the fourth-youngest Englishman to play in the Champions League at 17 years 177 days – and he made five Premier League appearances last season to claim a title winner’s medal. “Anyone who can get into Manchester City’s team – that’s a hell of a team – is doing well,” Aidy Boothroyd, the England Under-21 coach, said. The 18-year-old may also spend next season on loan.Mawson, at 24, is older than the rest and is expected to feature heavily in England’s future, not least with central defensive options relatively threadbare (for all that Trevoh Chalobah, on loan at Ipswich from Chelsea, caught the eye). The Swansea defender, like many of Southgate’s squad, forged a reputation in the lower leagues. He was called up for friendlies against the Netherlands and Italy in March but did not win a cap. That was a source of considerable disappointment and Southgate telephoned the player to suggest the World Cup might be one tournament too soon. Should he remain a top-flight defender next season, he will be very much in the national manager’s plans.Mount has been name-checked regularly by Southgate, trained with the seniors before their departure for Repino and, with Ryan Sessegnon and Phil Foden, attended England’s game against Tunisia in Volgograd as a guest of Nike to experience life at the tournament. The attacking midfielder spent last season on loan at Vitesse Arnhem, where he scored 14 goals and provided 10 assists in 39 appearances to be named their player of the season. To that can be added his Golden Player award at the 2017 Under-19s European Championship, where he supplied Lukas Nmecha with England’s winner in the final. The 19-year-old is expected to sign a new long-term contract at Stamford Bridge before continuing his development on loan, potentially under Frank Lampard and Jody Morris at Derby County.Another under-17 World Cup winner in India last year, Sancho took the brave decision to turn his back on Manchester City and Guardiola last summer and, aged 17, moved to Dortmund in search of first-team football. It is a mark of his talent that Real Madrid and Barcelona were as disappointed as City that the Bundesliga lured the forward away. He took the No 7 shirt vacated by Ousmane Dembélé, now a World Cup finalist, and made 12 league appearances, scoring his first senior goal in a 4-0 rout of Bayer Leverkusen in April. Formerly on the books at Watford, Sancho is one of a number of talented English youngsters – Mandela Egbo, Ademola Lookman, Keanan Bennetts, Jonathan Panzo, Noni Madueke are among others – who have pursued their development abroad.The 18-year-old, transformed from left-back to forward, excelled with 16 goals to help propel Slavisa Jokanovic’s team out of the Championship and is preparing for a first Premier League campaign. He has been pencilled in as key to England’s future. Boothroyd has described Sessegnon as “an exceptional talent” who will thrive for club and country, a player whose skill, pace and single-mindedness mark him out. “He is so focused in what he wants to do,” said Boothroyd, who handed Sessegnon a first Under-21s cap in March. “Nothing is going to get in his way. He’s a marked man now and the best players come through that. He will because he’s an outstanding talent.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8290ee577e595db1891843c27979e22f6597de7e/0_86_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ed8d492774ce000ff6b40b66a7f039b","title":"former banker maurizio sarri reap dividends chelsea","story":"The new coach at Stamford Bridge rarely surprised anyone with his tactics at Napoli, yet they often swept opponents asideAt last, Chelsea can see “a fumata bianca”. In the lexicon of Italian football journalism, that phrase – “white smoke” – is used to convey the moment when a drawn-out coaching appointment or transfer saga reaches its conclusion. The imagery is borrowed from the Vatican, where ballots are burned to let the world know when a new Pope has been elected. In this case, the smoke might simply be rising from the end of Maurizio Sarri’s latest cigarette.To say that Chelsea’s new manager is fond of a puff might be understating things. Dries Mertens estimated Sarri’s daily consumption at five packets a day. The manager is almost as keen on his coffee. At Napoli, he would have the club’s shopkeeper bring him a fresh espresso out at set breaks in training every day.Routines matter to Sarri: in part because he is a superstitious inidual. Mertens observed in another interview that Napoli would swap back and forth between specific different training pitches every day, changing the schedule only whenever a winning run came to an end.More than that, though, Sarri is a man who sees strength in consistency. Napoli have rarely surprised anyone with their tactical approach over the last three years, lining up every week in the same 4-3-3, and yet they have swept opponents aside with a dazzling brand of football.Arrigo Sacchi, who forged one of the greatest sides in European history at Milan in the late 1980s, has hailed Sarri as a “master” and his team as a “godsend”. They share a footballing philosophy, creating sides that are compact and seek to dominate possession. And they share the fact of never having played the game professionally as well.From his 20s right through to his 40s, Sarri’s day job was at Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, where he specialised in interbank finance. Coaching was something that he did in his spare time, for the love of the game.Even now, he struggles to frame football as a job. “When I go to lead a training session I never say to my family: ‘I’m going to work,’” he told the newspaper Avvenire. “I come from a family of labourers, and if I hear someone talking about ‘sacrifices’ in football, I get mad.”The contrast between his background and that of his predecessor at Chelsea is too obvious to ignore. Antonio Conte was a European Cup winner and five-time Serie A champion with Juventus as a player even before he led the Bianconeri to three further domestic titles from the bench. Sarri arrives in west London having never won a major piece of silverware.What he did do, in Naples, was create a team that challenged for the title on a wage budget barely half the size of Juventus’s. The team he inherited at Napoli had finished fifth under Rafa Benítez in 2014-15. Under Sarri, the Partenopei finished second, then third before last season becoming the first club to fail to win Serie A despite breaking the 90-point barrier.He did all this despite having the ision’s top scorer, Gonzalo Higuaín, signed by Juventus in the summer of 2016, and then seeing the player brought to replace the Argentinian, Arkadiusz Milik, tear his cruciate ligament weeks into the new season. Lacking a true No 9, Sarri reimagined Dries Mertens as a centre-forward. Napoli finished that campaign with 94 Serie A goals.And yet, for all he is reputed as an attacking coach, the greatest gains achieved in Naples might have been at the other end of the pitch. Napoli had conceded 54 goals in the league during their final season under Benítez. Under Sarri the figure has dipped to 32, 39, then 29. “Balance is the secret for every team,” he insisted in an interview with Il Mattino. “There cannot be a defensive formation and an attacking formation: such a concept is a limitation. The attacking capacity of a team is the fruit of the work of the manager and of the quality of the players.”As any coach, Sarri has his flaws. He has been accused in Italy of being too rigid: his almost ideological refusal to erge from set methods – and preferred starting XIs – leading journalists to brand him as a “Taliban trainer”. Critics have suggested that his Napoli team failed to win the title last season because he had failed to rotate against weaker teams, leaving players exhausted by the end of the season.Others will be more troubled by accusations of homophobia levelled against him by Roberto Mancini – who claimed Sarri called him a “faggot” during a Coppa Italia semi-final in 2016. Or indeed the response the Napoli manager gave to a female journalist, Titti Improta, who asked him about Napoli’s title prospects after a draw against Inter this March. “You’re a woman and you’re sweet,” Sarri said. “For this reason, I won’t tell you to go fuck yourself.”Sarri was quick to apologise after the latter incident, yet we can say Chelsea’s newest hire is not a man who puts public image over instinct. Before Napoli’s win at Juventus in April, he was caught on camera showing his middle finger to opposition fans from the team bus.Chelsea can see white smoke at last. The fireworks are still yet to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c1ac5be095dad40682a2a986d6b897f36d0d8dd/0_107_5152_3092/master/5152.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c32f0f2d0cd2c058299ff45d07c6a52c","title":"france croatia final world cup full of surprises deserves","story":"Teamwork has triumphed over inidual brilliance in the tournament so it is right that the finalists best represent that shiftFrance v Croatia is a surprising final but also a good reflection of this World Cup. After all it has been a tournament full of surprises in which we have seen that a different type of football is required to succeed, one based on team work and sticking to the basic principles over a reliance on inidual players and moments. France and Croatia have best represented that shift neither has sparkled but they have been consistent and hard-working and hence they will do battle on Sunday for the ultimate prize.France are rightly favourites to win what would be their second world title. They are the complete team – solid at the back, well-balanced in midfield and able to play with real flair in attack. But they have not done that often during this tournament due to the manager’s low-risk policy and seeming desire to do no more than what is required to win the game in front of him.Watching Didier Deschamps’ side, I have consistently been left with the feeling that there is another gear they can go to and this is also what makes them dangerous opponents – you cannot switch off against them for a second.Croatia will, therefore, need to be patient and not leave themselves as exposed at the back as they did during the first half of their semi-final against England. They were incredibly open during that period and, in truth, were lucky not to be more than 1-0 down. However, Croatia also showed during the second half that they are a remarkably mature and resilient team and one that, unlike France, play to their absolute limit. They will push Deschamps’ men all the way.Croatia’s aim will be to turn the final into a physical battle as this is the type of game their players like, no one more so than Mario Mandzukic. I played with him at Wolfsburg and as well as being a very good finisher he is a really hard worker, in training as well as on the pitch. He is constantly moving, constantly making life difficult for the defenders he comes up against and besides being prepared to take a challenge will give back as good as he gets. He is fearless.Ante Rebic is similar. I have watched him a lot in the Bundesliga with Eintracht Frankfurt and he is another attacking player who likes a physical battle. He and Mandzukic lead from the front, setting the tone for the entire team and, as Mandzukic showed against England, providing a killer touch at key moments.There is no doubt, however, who Croatia’s best player is. Luka Modric has been excellent during the tournament and particularly in the second half against England when, alongside Ivan Rakitic, he ran the game. I faced Modric in my time with West Ham, when he was at Tottenham, and I’m still traumatised by the experience. I couldn’t get near him he passed when he needed to pass, dribbled when he needed to dribble and basically did not make a single wrong move for the entire 90 minutes.What also stood out about Modric’s display on that day at White Hart Lane was how he protected possession. Much like Andrés Iniesta and Xavi he makes up for his lack of size and stature by getting his body between the ball and his opponent in the correct fashion. It may not look like much but it makes a huge difference.Someone else who is very good at that is N’Golo Kanté. Like Modric he is a deceptively strong midfielder and, for me, has been France’s best player at the World Cup. His sense of positioning and anticipation is consistently excellent as well as crucial to giving Kylian Mbappé and Antoine Griezmann the platform from which to attack they know they can pour forward as they have an ultra reliable player behind them.Given he was a similar player himself, I’m sure Deschamps appreciates what Kanté gives France and he will be vital in what is sure to be an important midfield battle in Moscow. Whichever team wins that is likely to win the match.For many people this has been a great World Cup. I disagree with the assessment. It has been unpredictable, interesting and fun but, overall, the quality has been lacking, certainly to the level provided by the Champions League. It has been a tournament more about great teamwork than great teams, hence the progress of the two teams that have reached the final as well as, of course, England.Gareth Southgate and his side deserve great credit for getting to the semi-finals and, more importantly, reconnecting the country with the national team. We have lost that a little bit in Germany so please, if you are English, cherish that as you reflect on this World Cup. I for one have enjoyed it and look forward to the final. It should be fascinating."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/183fdb558c4b4c7e15c491c0fa12f2cb97c684dd/0_93_2853_1712/master/2853.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c76b9c36c73bcac8acc2441ea36a15ed","title":"holding back the tears with trademark dignity world cup fiver","story":"Sign up now! Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!For their latest and trickiest trick at an Ethics World Cup in which they have dazzled with their PR skills, England must find a way of generating excitement about Saturday’s third-place play-off against Belgium. It is a match that traditionally features reluctant participants who are not particularly interested in winning the prize, like a custody battle for a foul-tempered hamster. So let’s see how canny Gareth Southgate’s selling it, shall we?“It’s the chance to have our second best-ever finish and the chance for the players to get a medal!” he whooped, attaching tassels to his waistcoat to reflect the prestige of the occasion. “And there’s the pride in playing for your country again!” he continued as Steve Holland played It’s Coming Home on a plastic party whistle. “So we’ll try and get the team that is best able to do the job,” he concluded, holding back the tears with trademark dignity.Word is England’s team will include Trent Alexander-Arnold, Danny Rose and Eric Dier, owing to knack for Kieran Trippier, Ashley Young and Jordan Henderson. But playmaker Jordan Pickford is fit and you know that Harry Kane wants to start, what with him being two penalties clear of Romelu Lukaku in the race for the Golden Boot. “The third-place game is not a match we wanted to be in,” Kane confessed. “But we will try to play with as much pride as we can and finish on a high. We will still be thinking of the semi-final defeat, and what could have been, but of course I want to play.” Another free shot from the spot and the Boot, at least, will be coming home. Although given how it’ll have been won, perhaps that, too, should be bronze.Elsewhere, France and Croatia are preparing for Sunday’s Big One.

Kylian Mbappé has been through this and is bound to be held responsible for the conflicts in his early career. But this kid, deeply devoted to the game, seemed stronger than anything, on the field and off it, as he prepared from a young age to navigate the pitiless environment of football.“His father Wilfried has videos of him as a child, in which he tells his story,” says family friend Alain Mboma. “He is four years old – four years old! – and he described the journey he wanted to take.”“I was a dreamer when I was younger,” Mbappé confided to us a few weeks ago. “My parents did care a bit about ‘my mouth’. But now they are the ones in the wrong position.”He had to fight to get there, guided by his own impatience, which in this case may have had some virtues. In 2015-2016, his third season in Monaco, Mbappé entered his last year as a youth team player and did not understand why Leonardo Jardim did not include him in the professional group. He had the ability, he knew it. But Jardim did not know, until the international week of November\u0026nbsp2015.“I remember very well the first training session Kylian had with Jardim,” says Luis Campos, Monaco’s former technical director who used to work as José Mourinho’s scout. “At the end of the session, Leonardo calls me and says: ‘This kid, he must not go down to the youth team anymore, he will work with us and when he gets his chance, I think he’ll get there.’ Leonardo was a little late, that’s the truth.”The period is crucial, for the player and for the club, who feared losing its prized asset for free at the end of that season. Behind the scenes, moves were going on. Paris\u0026nbspSaint-Germain, Liverpool and Arsenal had already made multiple approaches. Arsène Wenger met him in person to try to convince him to join the London club. Mbappé falters, he is especially on the brink of answering PSG’s call. But, in Paris to sign the contract, he is finally convinced that Laurent Blanc, the PSG coach at the time, will not give him a chance. “We were not very far away. There were two clubs in the final – AS Monaco and PSG,” said Olivier Létang, then deputy sports director of the latter. “What was missing was the feeling he would get playing time. Because Kylian wanted to play and it was his feeling that he would have more opportunity to play at Monaco than PSG.”It was finally Campos, tasked by the Monaco’s owners to resolve the situation, who tipped the decision in their favour.On March 6 2016, it’s official: Mbappé signed his first professional contract and committed to Monaco until 2019, with a signing-on bonus of about €3m and an evolutionary monthly salary: €85,000 the first year, €100,000 the second and €120,000 the third. Considerable sums for a player of his age.Not everyone is so impressed, however. The coach of France’s under-17 team, Jean-Claude Giuntini, who did not respond to our requests for an interview, considered Mbappé to be an inconsistent talent. In 2015, he did not even summon the striker to compete in the European Championship in Bulgaria that was won by the Les Bleuets. He preferred Odsonne Édouard (now at Celtic), who was crowned top scorer of the competition. The following season, in the under‑18s, Giuntini still did not select the Monaco player. He did not believe in him and criticised Mbappé for a lack of defensive involvement and his attitude. Suddenly, Ludovic Batelli, the under‑19 coach, decided to gazump him.“At the time, I was an orphan of Ousmane Dembélé, who rose very quickly to the under-21 side,” says Batelli. “There was a missing link and I thought of Kylian. I inquired about him. I was told little things about his character, about his attitude. I was told that he had an inidualistic relationship on the pitch, sometimes showing small moods. I ignored all that. I just focused on what I saw when he came with us. And there, I saw a future prodigy, which, in addition, adhered to all our codes.”This was despite a considerable age gap. “In fact, he was two years younger,” says Batelli. “And when we see, at that age, the importance of the differences from a size, weight, maturity, intelligence point of view … it was fantastic. He had an ability to express and analyse that I have rarely seen in kids of this age.”His new teammates adopted him immediately. “When he arrived in the group, we had to play the elite qualifying round for the European Championship,” said Lucas Tousart, the Lyon midfielder. “We go to Serbia and we have three games to play. We must finish first and it is him who scored the goal that allowed us to win the last game and go to the finals.”A few weeks later, in the summer of 2016, Mbappé, still only 17, and his team are crowned European Under-19 champions. He scored five goals in five games during the competition, including two in the semi-final.This is an extract from France Football’s article that was published in September 2017"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/25ed5ae1562826162829a13acf9e60607cb2b372/0_830_3451_2071/master/3451.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=17930a1f3e853e9808d45f76f9206189","title":"manchester united women squad unveiled england liverpool casey stoney","story":"• Manager Casey Stoney poaches seven players from Liverpool • Club are preparing for first season in women’s ChampionshipEngland’s left-back Alex Greenwood and goalkeeper Siobhan Chamberlain have been unveiled as two of the 21 players signed by Manchester United as they prepare to embark on their first season in the women’s Championship.The manager, Casey Stoney, played with both in the Lionesses defence and at Liverpool until her retirement in February and they are two of seven defensive players poached from her former club.Stoney, who had expressed her surprise at the ease of recruitment to the new side, said: “We’ve gone young, we’ve gone exciting, we’ve gone entertaining. I’m more than aware that we’re bringing 21 strangers together but I’m really excited about the squad and the future of this team.”Seven of the squad – Fran Bentley, Kirsty Hanson, Naomi Hartley, Emily Ramsey, Ella Toone, Millie Turner, Katie Zelem – are back at the club having spent all or part of their youth careers at Manchester United’s highly regarded centre of excellence.The midfielder Zelem has left Juventus after one season, having won the Serie A title, to return to Manchester. Leah Galton had announced she would be taking a break from football – cutting short a spell at Bayern Munich in which she played only one game – but has been enticed back.The assistant manager Willie Kirk’s influence is evident, with Aimee Palmer and Millie Turner picked up from his former club Bristol City. Kirsty Smith and Lizzie Arnot – who finished as the third highest goalscorer in the Scottish Women’s Premier League – have been brought in from Kirk’s former employers Hibernian.For firepower, Stoney has raided the tier-two champions Doncaster Rovers Belles, who have been forced to join Sheffield FC in withdrawing from the Championship because they cannot compete financially. Jess Sigsworth and Kirsty Hanson got 25 goals between them in all competitions last season and finished second and forth in the league’s scoring charts, sandwiching the 17-year-old Ebony Salmon, who has joined from Aston Villa.After a whirlwind recruitment period Stoney’s side began their pre-season preparations on 8 July but the manager will lose up to four players from her squad because Charlie Devlin, Aimee Palmer, Toone and the goalkeeper Ramsey (the youngest under-20 squad member) are on Mo Marley’s long list for the three-week under-20 Women’s World Cup in France in August.The first test of how quickly Manchester United have been able to gel is on Sunday when they play Liverpool in a behind-closed-doors friendly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9502181f990c17fd0f7893cc1698d33c6fd9ac26/0_8_2995_1797/master/2995.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97b40360cdb2e2bd681bdc1af5025543","title":"world cup best all time","story":"Before things kicked off in Russia we asked you to reminisce about your favourite World Cups. You did not disappointThe Miracle of Bern. Germany weren’t meant to get very far. German players were all still technically amateurs. Hungary were the Goliaths of world football, having gone undefeated for four years, including beating England – the self-ascribed “inventors of football” – 6-3 the year before and 7–1 just before the World Cup. Hungary beat Germany 8-3 in the round robin, so no one expected Germany to have a chance in the final. Removable cleats were used for the first time, which may have helped in a torrential downpour durijng the final. They made a movie of it. It was Germany’s first World Cup win and it revived the nation after the second world war. It also launched German football on a successful path for the years to come. A Germany fan The Swedish spectators applauded Brazil’s team as much as the home team during the final. Pelé had become a world star and the sportsmanship from the fans is something we will never see again in a World Cup final. Per ZettergrenI was caught up in the excitement of a home tournament as an 11-year-old from Ipswich. Alf Ramsey had taken the England job after working miracles with the Town so, of all places, we knew England were capable of going all the way. My first sticker album introduced unknown names and mysterious countries. North Korea? Did they even play football. The realisation took hold that we had created a game that the whole world embraced. South Americans were spoken of in awe. As the tournament progressed my parents informed me our cousin had arranged to get married on the afternoon of the final. Devastation. I would be fated to miss watching our greatest achievement. I’m thankful for the BBC radio commentary, which I listened to outside the wedding reception in our car. I’ve been waiting ever since for the opportunity to see us repeat the feat. The only other time we have come close is with a former Ipswich manager so, in eight years’ time, I expect Paul Hurst’s boys to lift the trophy. You read it here first. Andrew DobsonThe drama of football fell out of the sky when the BBC brought its black and white pictures of so many games into our living rooms at a time when matches were rarely broadcast. Having the tournament in England and the building excitement caused by the home team’s progress combined to make this World Cup a parting-of-the-clouds “hallelujah” moment that changed the rest of my life. From Pelé limping off to the South Koreans’ spirit from Antonio Rattín’s red card to Eusébio’s goals, from Bobby Charlton’s Mexico rocket to Geoff Hurst’s controversial goal in extra time, it had a hook to capture every emotion and enough brilliance to draw an impressionable child to football’s flame forever. John DaykinI’m 61, English and I remember 1966, but Mexico 70 was simply the best. Why? Brazil, of course. Pelé, Tostão, Jairzinho, Rivellino, Gerson, Carlos Alberto, Felix, Edu even now I can remember their names. When we went out to re-enact the games in the street, we were always Brazil, never England. (I was Tostão). In retrospect I wish I’d paid more attention to England. I didn’t know it would be our last appearance in a World Cup until 1982! The Brazil v England game gave us three iconic moments: Banks’s save, Moore’s tackle and the picture of Moore and Pelé swapping shirts afterwards. It was the best World Cup of all time won by the best team of all time. Sigh. Tim VinceI was on holiday in Italy and my dad took me, then aged seven, to a hotel bar in Rome to watch England v Brazil on a back-and-white TV. I stood on a chair, surrounded by Italians who were supporting Brazil, with just a sole Canadian supporting England with us. We were back home for the quarter-final against Brazil. At 2-0, the tension got too much and I had to go to my bedroom. My sister brought me the bad news. It is still the last time I cried due to a football result. Then Brazil in the final: magnificent! No longer Moore or Charlton, the whole of my primary school wanted to be Jairzinho or Pelé in the playground – not bad for Essex in 1970. An England fanEven though 1982 had my favourite ever match – the Brazil v Italy shocker – I always remember 1974 for the total football played by the sophisticated Dutch. What a team! Johan Neeskens, Ruud Krol, Rob Rensenbrink, Johnny Rep and the majestic Johan Cruyff. I still remember being awestruck when witnessing the famous Cruyff turn, an act that, if it had occurred in medieval England, would have had him burned as a witch. After a diet of English Division One football, watching this Holland team was like going to eat at a Michelin-starred restaurant after a year eating at a Little Chef. Naturally, Germany spoiled the party by beating them in the final, but the reality is that everyone remembers the Dutch. Nick GoodeyThe 1974 World Cup is absolutely my favourite. We saw two top European teams reaching the peak of their powers: West Germany and, of course, Holland. Their trajectories were opposite. Holland played effortless, beautiful total football in the early stages but lost their way in that famous final where they scored before the Germans had even touched the ball. But the legacy of total football is still alive and kicking. We saw Europe’s greatest player of all time, Johan Cruyff, showing his magic. And Germany had two world-class players: Franz Beckenbauer leading the team as the libero and the devastating Der Bomber, Gerd Müller, scoring the goals – including the winner in the final. Germany started the tournament poorly but they were alert when the moment of truth came. Both teams set the standards that still haunt modern football. They understood both how to defend as one and strike in unity. And they gave a 14-year-old schoolboy great memories. A fan from Finland My first, but everything about it was magical: the Argentinian welcome, the long-range shooting, Kempes, Rensenbrink, Boniek, the classic Italy v Argentina game and, of course, Archie Gemill’s wondergoal amid the tragicomic Ally’s Army campaign. Players weren’t as ubiquitous then you didn’t see the best players every week in the Premier League or Europe. It all felt a bit more exotic, unpredictable and exciting. I loved that Argentina side too. RoryI was 17, the perfect age. All the games were in the evening, which made for easy viewing. And South America was still somewhat exotic in those days. The football was great and every game seemed to be important and well contested. Even though I’m English, I supported Scotland because they had King Kenny, but it became historically funny when Ally and his army imploded – although their game against Holland was such a great one. Leopoldo Luque and Mario Kempes were superb and there were countless great goals from at least 40 yards. It has never been equaled. Alan NorrisI was 10 years old and a World Cup newbie. Goodness me, that tournament did not disappoint: Gerry Armstrong against Spain, Paolo Rossi throughout, David Narey against Brazil, Bryan Robson’s 27-second goal against France, the last great Poland team, the French midfield of Tigana, Giresse and Platini, the wonderful Brazil team featuring Zico, Socrates, Eder and Falcao – still the best side to grace a World Cup – and perhaps the best two World Cup games in Italy v Brazil and West Germany v France. It had it all and it also instilled in me early on that it’s not always the most entertaining or best team that finishes on top of the pile – and that England never win anything. Paul StoddartSpain 82 is the first I really remember and every World Cup since has failed to live up to it. Coming home from school for the tea-time games and staying up late to watch evening games seeing my Italian father’s emotions change from disgust to elation within three weeks the magic of that Brazil team England not losing a game but still somehow underwhelming the resurrection of Italy the stink of Germany v Austria Schumacher v Battiston Narey’s goal against Brazil Robson’s effort against France a group containing Brazil, Argentina and Italy Hungary winning 10-1 Gaspar Gentile’s balletic hatchet job on Maradona the epic West Germany v France semi-final Kuwaiti walking off the pitch and, of course, Marco Tardelli and the scream that never ends. A fan from the UKAs an eight-year-old, it was my first foray into football. Every goal was a belter: Negrete, Josimar, Maradona to name but a few. The theme music from ITV, apart from Nessun Dorma in 1990, is the only World Cup music I remember. Things just stick out: a Titanic battle between France and Brazil, Graeme Souness almost falling over in the heat, Jimmy Hill yelling during Gary Lineker’s hat-trick, Maradona’s genius and Hand of God, Denmark’s free-flowing football. Watching the final on a black-and-white portable TV in a caravan in Scarborough through a thick snowy screen while covered up suffering from sunstroke. It’s the memories that make it and I have more from that World Cup than any other. DaffelMexico 1986 caught me at just the right age. That World Cup was filled with iconic teams and players, and this was before the expansion of Uefa club competitions brought them all into your home every year. Teams played with the desire to attack and win before were outlawed in favour of cagey don’t-lose tactics in 1990. Players such as Laudrup, Elkjaer, Maradona, Littbarski and Platini made your mouth water at the prospect of their outrageous technical ability and the vision to make special moments happen.The magnificent TV title sequences, the magical Azteca ball and the exotic surroundings in Mexico added to the glamour of the tournament. As a kid I had never seen such a vast and colourful stadium as Mexico City. Factor in the last generation of great Scottish footballers in the original group of death and Mexico 86 will always have special memories for me: my first full international kits (Scotland and Denmark), my first fully competed Panini album, and the glory of Maradona leading his team to a deserved win against England, Belgium and Germany. JakeIn the run-up to 1986, there was a lot of press coverage about stadiums not being fit for purpose and organisational chaos behind the scenes, but all of that stopped when the football began. I can’t recall a World Cup with so many high-drama, epic matches. In the group stages, we had the astounding performances of Denmark, particularly the 6-1 annihilation of Uruguay. There was also the high-energy attacking football of Valeriy Lobanovskyi’s USSR team and the silky brilliance of France, but the excitement levels really began to rise in the knockout rounds. Belgium exposed the defensive flaws of the USSR in a wild last-16 game where Igor Belanov scored a hat-trick but still ended up on the losing side Spain demolished the fancied Danes 5-1 and Argentina beat Uruguay in a tense match that was played during an electrical thunderstorm. In the last eight, France and Brazil squared off in the blistering heat and produced a World Cup classic that went all the way to penalties.The star was, of course, Maradona. In every game, the little Argentinian produced wonderful, world-class football. He scored a terrific inidual effort against Italy and played brilliantly in the downpour against the Uruguayans, but it was in the quarter-final against England where he took charge, both of the tournament and his own destiny, and reinforced his claim to be considered one of the all-time greats. A similar outstanding performance and two more Maradona goals eliminated the Belgians in the semi-finals and, although he was a touch more subdued in the final, he still managed to produce the brilliant killer pass for Burruchaga’s late winner against West Germany. Charlie MaguireI was 15 years old, had just completed my GCSEs and, coming from an Anglo-Irish background, saw the whole family fully up for the Cup for the first time. We were swept along on a wave of Gazza’s tears, Big Jack putting ‘em under pressure, David O’Leary’s winning penalty and Platt scoring past the Belgium goalkeeper. Cameroon were great to watch, Schillaci was on fire for the hosts, Baggio bagged a beauty against the Czechs, and Matthäus scored one of the best ever World Cup goals against Yugoslavia in the group stages. 1990 also had the best tunes: the great anthem World in Motion and even Touched by the Hand of Cicciolina by Pop Will Eat Itself. Joe MeaneyI don’t remember Italia 90 as being dull and dreary. As a nine-year-old watching my first World Cup, everything about the tournament was exciting. Countries from far away lands such as Cameroon futuristic match graphics that have never been bettered Roger Milla and Toto Schillaci watching parts of Scotland v Brazil in a classroom when off-stage during a performance of the end-of-year school musical and hiding in the hall of my gran’s house when West Germany scored in the final because I couldn’t watch the penalty as I was too excited. Chris McLarenI’m from Italian descent so, as a nine-year-old, I was curious about anything Italian. For some reason our teacher ran a project about the World Cup at school. I went from a child who didn’t really care for football to becoming increasingly obsessed. I still remember staying up to watch Italy beat Uruguay, as well as Schillaci’s six goals and Baggio scoring against Czechoslovakia. It also was the first time I had experienced crushing disappointment. I remember my mum having to console me to sleep after we were robbed in the semi-final – something all my other friends would experience the next day when England met the same fate. It also had the joyous Cameroon, a wonderful Germany team and some iconic England moments. I’m not sure there has ever been a more complete World Cup. It was also the first time I owned a Panini sticker album. Isaac OcchipintiIt is the first one I remember, so there is obviously nostalgia there. However, there are so many wonderful memories: the high-scoring Romania, Bulgaria and Sweden teams, the team ethic from USA in their home tournament, and the tense final won by Brazil. Special mention to Ireland’s victory against Italy, Saeed Al-Owairan’s wondergoal and Diana Ross’s penalty miss. Luke WebbThis tournament this still evokes a magical shimmer in the minds of a certain generation of Swedes. I was nine, the summer was long and warm, and a goal-happy Sweden managed to win a quite unlikely bronze medal and return home to a heroes’ welcome. The names, the music, even the end-of-the-year TV review of the tournament are all still legendary in Sweden. On top of that, it had plenty of goals and interesting storylines: Maradona’s fall from grace, Italy’s narrow road to the final, the Bulgarian upstarts and so on. The final was dull, but that does not overshadow the rest of the tournament. David Spain 82, Mexico 86 and Brazil 14 were all great, but France 98 is the one that stands out. Not only because my own country, the Netherlands, played their best tournament since 1974 – and they haven’t played as well since, not even when they reached the final in 2010 – but also because the whole tournament was just perfect: the atmosphere, the football, the weather (a World Cup needs to be in a warm country), the final, the winner. Johan van SlootenFrance 98 is the first World Cup I properly remember: the build-up, the Panini sticker album and the brilliant tournament itself. It ended in typically lacklustre fashion for England, but there were some incredible moments to treasure. Rushing home from school to watch Scotland open the tournament drenched in the late-afternoon shade of the Stade de France and almost take a point off mighty Brazil. Michael Owen’s goal against Argentina, David Beckham’s red card. Great players and great stadia all enjoyed with the advantage of ideal kick-off times. And then there’s the final. A football match for the ages. What had happened to Ronaldo: was he ill, would he play? Ultimately it didn’t matter because the mesmerising Zinedine Zidane gave one of the great inidual performances. I loved football before this tournament and was utterly besotted with it by the end. Sean Ranson It had the perfect mix of underdog triumphs (Turkey and South Korea making the semis), glaring omissions (the Netherlands failing to qualify), shock implosions (reigning champions France getting absolutely leathered from all corners), improbable successes (Germany side making the final), heartbreak (the best England side in a generation going out fighting), and redemption (Ronaldo exorcising his demons and putting in the greatest shift in one tournament since Maradona). The planning and execution of what was at the time an incredibly bold decision to hold a World Cup across two countries separated by hundreds of miles of sea also deserves a thousand plaudits. 1998 had been my first World Cup, but this was the one where I truly fell in love. Philip Kent2002 was the first time I had total World Cup fever. I was the perfect age to still believe England could win it, as I hadn’t been worn down by that point yet. The locations were great, with the Japanese and South Koreans putting on such a good show it had that beautiful ball and it came at a time just before we knew everything about every player and teams could come along and totally surprise us. My school had big screens so we could come and watch the early kick-offs, so we hung out with our friends for the games then went and recreated what we had seen at lunchtime on the field. It was also a tournament of genuine upsets Brazil were back to their best and the whole Senegal squad seemed to be bought by European clubs – can’t remember how that all turned out. AdamI was 13 at the time, so in that beautiful sweet spot in my football supporting life when I was old enough to understand what was going on but not so old to be cynical and depressed by it all. It was also probably the last ever World Cup in which international football was the pinnacle of the game. The summer of 2006 was impossibly hot games were on at sociable hours in the UK and everyone was drunk, all hours of the day, sunburnt and draped in St George’s flags. I also measure football by the other sporting contexts at the time. I distinctly remember watching England v Trinidad and Tobago (where is that dad?) before watching England v Sri Lanka in a T20 and watching some young tennis player called Andy Murray beat Andy Roddick at Wimbledon after the crushing disappointment of the Portugal loss. Finally, 2006 had the crucial ingredient: glorious, unjust England failure. After Ronaldo’s wink to Rooney, I printed a photo of him and put in on my dart board. An incredibly pointless and petty move but it made feel better. George Potter I was a second year undergraduate student during the summer of 2006 so was entirely free to watch the entire thing free of responsibility, but with plenty of drink. The opening game, Germany 4-2 Costa Rica, got thing off to a flyer and included screamers from Philip Lahm and Torsten Frings. There was the last-16 Battle of Nuremburg between the Netherlands and Portugal, which included four red cards and 16 yellows let’s be honest, those are scenes we do want to see. It had Zidane’s Panenka and headbutt, Joe Cole’s volley against Sweden and it was the last time England won a knockout game – until 2018! The atmosphere was excellent and the ball didn’t behave like a penny floater. Paul Brown My extended family are from South Africa and the World Cup wasn’t shown on TV during the apartheid days of the 1980s, so my dad recorded some matches of the 1986 tournament and sent them over to my family in Johannesburg. I was seven at the time and still remember watching the final with my siblings, shouting out “YESSSS” when Jorge Burruchaga scored the winner. Fast forward 24 years and me and my brother ended up going to South Africa for the 2010 World Cup and re-watching those same recorded 1986 matches. 2010 was pretty poor from a footballing sense, but being there among people from all over the world was special. We were fortunate enough to watch 13 matches, from the boring Algeria v Slovenia in Polokwane, to seeing Lionel Messi up close against Nigeria and experiencing the sub-zero temperatures of Brazil v North Korea in Johannesburg. Topping them all, however, was the thrilling quarter-final between Uruguay and Ghana in Soccer City. Ishmail Chicktay2010 has a bad reputation, but so many inidual moments are ingrained in my memory. I will never forget the sheer elation of Serbia, the country where I was born, beating Germany. I had a GCSE exam at the same time as that game. I arrived home and asked my dad the score. “Serbia one, Germany nil.” I let out a blood-curdling scream. I’ve never jumped higher.There are all the other little moments that make up my mosaic of memories: Siphiwe Tshabalala’s orgasmic opening goal English commentators never failing to mention that Diego Forlán had “struggled at Manchester United” as he took on all-comers the sheer hilarity of watching England flail against USA, bore everyone to death against Slovenia and Algeria, then get utterly demolished by Germany (I live in Wales). People forget that great Slovakia v Italy game, New Zealand’s undefeated status and that ridiculous run of penalties in Spain v Paraguay. There was Germany’s demolition of Argentina, Felipe Melo’s stupid stamp against the Netherlands, and Luis Suárez’s handball.In fact, the more I remember it, the more I realise most of my defining memories of 2010 are of cack-handedness, stupidity and incompetency. And in a way, that’s beautiful. Football is just as much about Phil Babb running nuts-first into a goalpost as it is about Lionel Messi ghosting past five defenders. And 2010 had plenty of comical mishaps and moments of stupidity to make it worth it. Fedor TotRecency bias be damned, 2014 is my favourite World Cup. I could try to build my case on the basis of objective data – the most goals per match of any of the last five World Cups – or by making a token reference to the historic levels of enthusiasm the tournament inspired in the US. But if I’m being honest, my preference is a mere side effect of personal circumstance. In the summer of 2014 I was single and unemployed. Now I can see the obvious connection between those two conditions, but at the time all I knew was that together they meant I had nothing better to do than drink and watch soccer. Of course, I’ll always remember the conventionally unforgettable moments – the 7-1, the dolphin e headers, the ejections for biting and so on – but, more than any of these, I cherish the memory of Bosnia 3-1 Iran, a weekday match played at 11:00am Los Angeles time. As I sat in a shadowy bar off Sunset Boulevard, drinking pre-mixed bloody marys and watching an entirely meaningless match between two teams that were eliminated from the competition, I felt immensely grateful for every questionable decision that had led me there. Charlie2014 was completely unpredictable. Spain had bulldozed every team for the previous six years then suddenly found themselves crashing out in the group stages. Costa Rica topped a group containing Uruguay, England and Italy. The worst Holland team in my lifetime reached the semi-finals. The cherry on the cake of course was Germany 7-1 Brazil. That’s a game I’ll be telling my grandkids about 50 years from now.

Will Smith with a zinger about Neymar’s World Cup. “Sometimes you make Pursuit of Happiness, sometimes you make Wild Wild West. Everyone has good and bad days.”Back in Blighty, Manchester United have cherry-picked a blend of players from Bayern Munich, Doncaster, Hibernian and Juventus ahead of their maiden season in the women’s Championship:England news: asked if the decision not to have a parade upon their return once they have got Saturday out of the way is correct, Southgate nods. “It’s not actually my decision but I agree with the decision. If we make the final, maybe it’s different. If we’d had a parade, that would have been one part of the country, and we represent the whole country.”England news: Gareth Southgate insists there will not be wholesale changes for the Belgium game, but it will be a different team to the one that was defeated on Wednesday, with some players suffering from fatigue and illness. “Emotionally it’s been a very difficult few days,” he says. Asked if he is worried that his team have peaked, and that this World Cup will be as good as it gets, he replies: “I’m not scared of anything. Not even the big bad wolf!”Tunisia news: Nabil Maaloul, the man who led Tunisia to their first World Cup finals since 2006 has stepped from his role as coach to take charge of Qatari league champions Al Duhail. The 55-year-old takes over from Djamel Belmadi, who quit and is widely expected to be appointed coach of the Algerian national team.England news: Southgate and Fabian Delph will speak to the media shortly. They will finish third at the World Cup – their best since 1966 – if they can beat Belgium in St Petersburg tomorrow.Sunday will be a big occasion for Paul Pogba, and another chance to for the real Paul Pogba to stand up, so to speak. The Manchester United midfielder’s influence seems to have grown with each game for France in Russia, which begs the question:No regrets: an England fan who rushed to the tattoo parlour after watching Gareth Southgate’s side dismantle Panama insists he does not regret getting the words ‘England 2018, World Cup winners’ inked on his torso. “We had just gone 4-0 up, just before half-time and it just hit me,” said Jamie Richardson from Allerton Bywater, near Leeds, presumably after watching the Volkswagen ad on loop. “Get that tattoo done, and we will bring it home. I will never, ever get rid of this tattoo, no matter what.”There is some talk that Milan Badelj, the fourth substitute for Croatia in extra-time against England, may get the nod in Moscow on Sunday. The 29-year-old is a free agent after leaving Fiorentina and has been linked with Zenit, among others. Wouldn’t it be brilliant if a free agent, a la Hal Robson-Kanu at Euro 2016, did the business in the World Cup final. Or, has that happened before? Time to raid The Knowledge archive, perhaps:We asked you to reminisce about your favourite World Cups – and you did not disappoint, with tales of 1966 and much more:You’d better believe it, for Kieran Trippier has been awarded the freedom of Bury, his home-town, after successfully marauding down England’s right flank on countless occasions. The 27-year-old will be in esteemed company, with the film director Danny Boyle and rock band Elbow previously receiving the pleasure. The council leader, Rishi Shori, said: “Hopefully he can inspire the next generation of footballers in Bury.”There are two games left to play and, unless Danny Welbeck runs in seven goals in St Petersburg, there’s a good chance that his England team-mate, Harry Kane, will wrap up the Golden Boot. Lukaku has four and Griezmann has three goals, so he may not even need to play to take home the trophy – not that he’s bothered. “If I get the Golden Boot, I get the Golden Boot, but that wasn’t the trophy I was looking for,” he said. “We know we have done everybody proud but we wanted to go on.”Good news! Ben has already chomped his way through a bowl of cous cous and sundries, so he will once again be tasked with providing you with hot World Cup content.Infantino went on to say that the Thai football team rescued from a cave this week will be invited to the Fifa Awards in September, which is nice.How seriously do we all want England to take the third-place playoff? I want it to be Nick Pope upfront challenging Dedryck Boyata for second balls and a penalty shootout where Fabian Delph tries to rabona one in, but I can see the merits of taking it seriously.Ben mentioned it earlier, but here are the full quotes from man of the people and self-publicist Gianni Infantino.For a couple of years I have been saying this will be the best World Cup ever and today I can say that with conviction - it is the best World Cup ever.I would like to thank everyone. The main actors are on the pitch - the players, referees and coaches - but, of course, there are also all those who have worked to make sure everything has worked smoothly, the Russians.A big thank you to the Russian government and the Russian President Vladimir Putin, the local organising committee, the Russian Football Union, the volunteers, the heart and smile of the World Cup, all those people, more than 100,000, who helped in one capacity or another.Thank you Lord Gianni for making this the greatest World Cup ever (it isn’t, but thank you anyway). And, obviously, thank you Vlad!As Ben departs to see what he can scavenge to add to his daily dose of cous cous and plain chicken, I will provide some light-hearted lunchtime relief. For plenty more barbs from Griezmann and co, Will Unwin will keep you abreast of all the squabbles while I run off for a bite to eat:Oof! Antoine Griezmann has been gladly stoking the fire before the big one in Moscow on Sunday. Asked to comment on Thibaut Courtois’s dig that France have been a little anti-football this summer, the Atlético Madrid forward replied: “Does Thibaut Courtois think that at Chelsea he plays Barcelona football? I don’t care how, I want a second star to be on this shirt. That is all.” Asked if he still hopes to snatch the Golden Boot off Harry Kane, who has scored six goals so far, twice as many as Griezmann, the Frenchman said: “I was the top scorer at Euro 2016 and we lost, so I tried to score as little as possible to see if we win this time.”To pass the time in Russia, Ousmane Dembélé has been sat on Football Manager on inter-city flights, coach journeys and the like. He has been in Kylian Mbappé’s shadow for much of the tournament but when it comes to his personal, and simulated achievements, there is only one winner. The 21-year-old Barcelona forward has guided Winchester FC, a club he created himself, to the brink of the promised land. “I am already in the Championship, third,” he said. “Premier League, I am coming.”Who could be next in line? One name not below is Lewis Cook, who, after a stop-start introduction to life at Bournemouth, has made huge strides under manager Eddie Howe. The 21-year-old keeps things ticking over nicely he has an eye for a killer pass and added some much-needed bite to their midfield last term. Cook, formerly of Leeds United, captained England Under-20s to World Cup glory last year:Ivan Perisic pulled Croatia level on Wednesday, and may yet have a say in Sunday’s final. The 29-year-old has been at Internazionale since 2015 but nine years ago it was Club Brugge that plumped for him, gambling on a €250,000 winger from Sochaux, who had just spent time on loan at Belgian outfit Roeselare. Croatia’s No 4 has done OK since:Transfer nugget: confirmation of that £18m signing for Southampton, with Denmark defender Jannik Vestergaard signing a four-year deal from Mönchengladbach. That takes Mark Hughes’s summer spending north of the £50m mark, after tying up his fourth signing. “When you look at everyone else, there’s not a lot of people doing any business and, in a World Cup year, we’re ahead of the game because it starts to churn a little bit when everyone starts to come back,” he says.Reasons to be cheerful, via not Ian Dury but our resident cartoonist:Philipp Lahm, the former Germany captain, has been speaking about his country’s dismal showing in Russia this summer. The 34-year-old lifted the trophy in 2014 but Joachim Löw’s side fell short this time around:Bringing together and building a team that can become European and world champions is an ongoing process and a minor miracle,” he says. “While what we saw from Germany was by no means a work of art, I’m sure that they have the power to come back stronger and develop a new generation who can live up to Gary Lineker’s famous assertion that ‘football is a simple game. Twenty-two men chase a ball for 90 minutes and at the end the Germans win.’England’s final training session in Russia is over, and everyone seems to have come through it unscathed. They’ll head back to their team hotel in Repino shortly, before tomorrow’s third-place play-off v Belgium.Well then, what’s the answer?Amid the World Cup euphoria in Moscow, a low-key but no less vital competition was played out in the shadow of the Kremlin:France v Croatia: Nestor Pitana, of Argentina, will be the man in the middle in Sunday’s final. The referee will be flanked by a couple of his countrymen, while the Dutchman, Bjorn Kuipers, who took charge of England’s win over Sweden, will be the fourth official. The Iranian referee, Alireza Faghani, will oversee Belgium v England, part II.Some confirmation of what we already knew: Chelsea have finally announced they have sacked Antonio Conte, giving the Italian a rousing send-off, with a curt three-line, 61-word statement. No mention of Sarri just yet, but the former Napoli coach is on his way:Gianni Infantino, who is paid around $1.61m-a-year, rocks up at Fifa’s closing press conference in a volunteer’s hoodie. How fitting. Infantino, the governing body’s president, declares Russia 2018 as “the best World Cup ever” before adding that the perception of the country has been changed, and that it now has football running through its veins. “Football’s part of its DNA now.”Back in Blighty, it has been a bit of a circus at Cobham this week, with Antonio Conte taking training on Thursday before getting the boot by Chelsea a few hours later. He departs awaiting compensation for his £9m-a-year contract, which had 12 months to run. With Conte sent packing, Mr Sarri will enter Stamford Bridge:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/11a355952a7696d8c7643461b531c5c6d7bf6533/203_129_2752_1651/master/2752.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b301effa4fc7110d7637ecf897f5b2ba","title":"charlotte church and katie price to guest edit womans hour","story":"Singer to discuss failings of UK schools on Radio 4 show, while Price wants trolling to be a crimeThe TV personality Katie Price and the singer-songwriter Charlotte Church will be among the next guest editors of BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour. The pair join the ranks of women including JK Rowling, Angelina Jolie, Mary Berry and the Paralympics champion Ellie Simmonds, who have all previously been guest editors of the long-running show, on air since 1946. The tradition of bringing in famous women to take the helm of Woman’s Hour began in 2014, with each guest editor adding an their own voice to the programme. Jolie focused on sexual violence in conflict and women’s health, while Berry discussed issues such as gardening as therapy and beekeeping.Other women who will take over as guest editors of Woman’s Hour in 2018 include Arianna Huffington, the co-founder of the Huffington Post, who will look at subjects including stress and burnout, Lady Helena Kennedy QC, and the Rev Rose Hudson-Wilkin, chaplain to the Queen and to the Speaker of the House of Commons, who will discuss knife and gun crime.Each will share their perspective on topics important to them and join regular presenters Jenni Murray and Jane Garvey.The ex-glamour model Price, 39, implored MPs earlier this year to make trolling a criminal offence. Giving evidence to parliament’s petitions committee, after starting a petition that attracted more than 220,000 signatures, she told how her son Harvey, who has multiple disabilities, has been a repeated victim of “horrific” online abuse.Price will raise issues including making online abuse a criminal offence and a lack of wheelchair-friendly rides in theme parks on Woman’s Hour. She said: “I would like to create awareness for people who can relate to my topics if it helps just one person out there to know they are not alone or address issues which can make small changes to people’s lives then I have done my job.”The former child singer Church, 31, said: “My edition of Woman’s Hour will look at what a school could look like if we focused on what children need and put creativity at the heart of all learning and teaching. My children are fast approaching secondary school age, and in my opinion the current school system is not fit for purpose. I want to ask what effect it’s having on our young adults as well as what we can do to change it.”Arianna Huffington said: “We’re living at a time of a global epidemic of stress and burnout, which is being amplified by technology and our ‘always-on’culture. And women pay the highest price when long hours and the macho culture of always being ’on’ is taken as a proxy for commitment and dedication. So I’m thrilled to be able to talk with BBC Radio 4’s Woman’s Hour about how women can reject the delusion that burnout is the price they have to pay for success.”Woman’s Hour takeover week 2018 starts on Monday 16 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/242af7b00841aa9ff4a7494e127b3bea017a4435/133_1681_5007_3004/master/5007.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=336b87b3b04cc765e7c9d18c7466d097","title":"nadiya hussain nigel slater ice cream french toast","story":"The TV cook on how the writer and presenter became her kitchen heroI first saw Nigel Slater on telly in about 1995 – the year my brother was born. I realised I already had one of his cookbooks, The 30-Minute Cook – I just didn’t know who he was.He had a recipe – his cooking has definitely evolved since then – for French toast using melted ice-cream. And I thought: “That’s AMAZING.” It was exactly the kind of cooking I wanted to do. Clever, waste-conscious, always useful … I’ve been following him ever since. On my shelf I now have Eat: The Little Book of Fast Food, Real Fast Food, Real Fast Puddings and last year’s The Christmas Chronicles. The latter is my favourite. I particularly love his fruit cake recipe – it is perfectly rich and fruity, and the only one I ever make now. Why use a different recipe when the one in his book works so well?Nigel’s cooking feels nostalgic. His recipes vary from super-simple and delicious to fancy and decadent. And I love that he can do it all. He uses ingredients he grows in his own garden, too, which has encouraged me to do the same.Apart from Delia Smith, Nigel Slater is the ultimate TV cook. There’s something about the way he comes across – he makes being at home look so effortless. I love to think I glide through my house the way he does through his.Of course, the reality is that it’s nothing like that in my home. We’ve got three kids (11, 10 and seven) and four chickens there’s always someone who’s sick, always something that needs doing – a plant you’ve forgotten to water, laundry to fold. It’s mayhem. I look at Nigel and think: “That’s what I want my life to be like.” And sometimes it is: there are moments when everything at home is where it should be, and I’ll think: “I totally did a Nigel Slater just then.” It doesn’t happen often, though.What is special about Nigel’s voice is his ability to evoke emotion. Even if he’s just writing about a baked potato, he can tell stories and make it personal. Whether or not the food is relevant to me, his writing makes me understand how it is relevant to him, which in turn makes me feel I know him that bit better. I can identify with him. I think it’s really important to feel some sort of connection to whomever you’re watching or reading. To my mind, no other food writer can do that.I don’t know how much Nigel still melts his ice-cream and makes French toast any more, but I do, all the time – I have three kids, so of course I do! You know when there’s a little bit of ice-cream at the bottom of the tub and it’s too hard to scrape out? I just leave it out to melt, then dip the bread in that (it already has cream and eggs in it, which is what you need) and fry it in butter. Any flavour of ice-cream goes. And my kids load it up with all sorts of other things on top."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d87a449d4b2537bcc243dd917f8606bbf0f3d4fc/42_16_3145_1888/master/3145.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=721c27be1c1a566d27b5bf89ceef1d31","title":"russia 2018 world cup england guardian support","story":"Our senior sports writer Barney Ronay explains how you can help keep the ’s football coverage in playHere we are then.

From minute-by-minute commentary sent directly to you from the vast pulsing brain of some insomniac footballing obsessive powered only by nicotine, chocolate and a haystack of empty energy drink cans. To on-the-scene reports and news from a band of reporters who write and travel and file and follow stories every day, returning to their families five weeks later hunched, unrecognisable figures unable to communicate on any subject beyond wifi quality, mixed zone ticket allocations and how to get to Salvador protea at 3am with a fair-to-decent chance of not being abducted. At the end of which comes the daily web presence and the pristine design and set of the paper itself. All of this arrives with you updated to the second, cobbled together from the corners of some sock-stinking press room, polished by endlessly patient whip-smart subs and made to look lovely by some sleep-deprived awkward genius of a layout designer. It’s no secret our industry is looking to find ways of continuing to do all this. The old way of selling bits of paper doesn’t seem to work. Advertising is a capricious business.

Perhaps it lights up your enjoyment via the frankly brilliant reporting of our football hacks, led of course (damn him) by annual award hoover Danny Taylor, and backed up by the likes of Dominic Fifield, Martha Kelner, Dave Hytner, Stuart James and, with the long range heavy artillery, the mind bogglingly good Marina Hyde.

When Simon and Garfunkel’s 1964 debut sank without a trace, the 24-year-old travelled to England, miserable and dejected, and shrugged out this solo album. Several tracks – including Kathy’s Song and I Am a Rock – now rank among his best-loved songs.Although there are overwrought moments on the duo’s third album (7 O’Clock NewsSilent Night is eerily pointed, but barely listenable) there are others of stark, dismal beauty – particularly the yearning ballad Homeward Bound, also written during Simon’s time in England.“Hope and dread,” Simon once said, “that’s the way I see the world.” The two states of mind clash fervently on his fourth solo album, a premature reflection on his regrets – he was only 34. Fifty Ways to Leave Your Lover, though, is deliciously silly.Although he must have the muscle memory to churn out a half-decent album without much effort, Simon has never done things by halves. On his lively 13th solo LP, he uses custom-made instruments, collaborates with Italian electronic artist Clap! Clap! and ruminates on the virtues of the word “motherfucker”.Kodachrome was banned from UK radio for its reference to a brand of film – a shame, because it is a brilliant, shiny pop song with bite. And there is plenty more to admire on Simon’s third solo album, particularly American Tune and St Judy’s Comet. “That may be my favourite album of the 70s,” he said. “It’s joyful.”After the failure of their 1964 debut, Wednesday Morning, 3am, Simon and Garfunkel’s career was shocked back to life by a new, electric version of that album’s The Sound of Silence. While the follow-up was hastily compiled, it was more assured than their debut, embracing a heftier folk-rock sound and showcasing Simon’s ability to dart between wit and desolation.There are a few intriguingly scruffy moments on Simon’s first post-Garfunkel album. On Everything Put Together Falls Apart, he turns from the microphone halfway through a line to scratch his beard, as if so deep in thought he has forgotten he is recording. It is fitting for an album of such candid introspection – although there are lighter moments, such as the samba-influenced Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard.Flitting from gentle guitars to brash, experimental Moog, Bookends is Simon and Garfunkel at their poppiest (Mrs Robinson, written for The Graduate), weirdest (Punky’s Dilemma) and most agitated (Fakin’ It). The standout, though, is America, a wistful, fruitless search for the land of the free.From the chaos of Simon and Garfunkel’s imploding relationship came the best album of their career. The gospel-influenced title track is now rightly ubiquitous, and The Only Living Boy in New York – written after Garfunkel flew off to star in a film from which Simon had been dumped – is the most beautiful display of passive aggression ever committed to music.Although initially mired in controversy – Simon worked on the album with local musicians in South Africa during apartheid, ignoring the UN’s boycott – this culturally collaborative masterpiece served as its own rebuttal. Inspired by a bootleg cassette of Mbaqanga music, Simon incorporated his own melodic style and storytelling skill into the sounds he had fallen in love with, recruiting Ladysmith Black Mambazo and the Gaza Sisters to realise his ambitious ideas. After the success of its lead single, the wonderfully peculiar You Can Call Me Al, the album took Simon’s career from its lowest point to its pinnacle."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a5132f699a17a1bcddcd51984b6e631e4f0c6bd/36_487_4776_2865/master/4776.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8b6a9b87c04353def64f2e96cdfa9e3","title":"nevis how the worlds most secretive offshore haven refuses to clean up","story":"The years since 2008 have seen a global crackdown on offshore finance. Yet a few places have doubled down on offering secrecy to the super-rich. Among these, one tiny Caribbean island might be the worst offender. By  Oliver BulloughTax havens hate attention. Places such as Jersey, Switzerland and the British Virgin Islands made a handsome living from helping their clients break other countries’ laws for decades, without anyone really noticing. And they liked it that way. Then came the 2007-8 financial crisis, and the good times ended. Rich nations, angry over the loss to their budgets caused by tax dodging, put diplomatic pressure on the havens. Activists, furious over the theft of hundreds of billions of pounds from poor countries, exposed them in the press. The release of vast troves of confidential information – SwissLeaks, the HSBC files, the Panama Papers, the Paradise Papers – cemented a public perception that offshore financial centres exist to help the powerful dodge their obligations to the rest of us, and governments have queued up to punish them. In May, when Britain’s parliament voted to force transparency on its Caribbean islands, it was just the latest blow to the offshore havens.Although cooperating with outsiders in this way has proven expensive, the havens clearly concluded there was little choice. If denied access to the global financial system, or sanctioned by Brussels or Washington, an offshore centre could be put out of business altogether.This is good. Tax havens have helped the world’s wealthiest and most powerful keep a disproportionate share of the benefits of globalisation, by preventing the rest of us from seeing how much they own. This, in turn, has eroded trust in democracy and capitalism all over the world. Restricting the operations of tax havens, and enforcing true transparency on the ownership of property, is crucial if citizens are truly to take back control of their countries’ destinies.Yet, at the heart of this increasingly encouraging picture, there remain a few holdouts – places that have stuck to the old habit of keeping the secrets of the powerful. Foremost among them is Nevis, a solitary volcano in the Caribbean with a population of just 11,000, which has been implicated in some of the most sordid financial scams of modern times, from Britain’s biggest-ever tax fraud to the fleecing of 620,000 vulnerable Americans in a $220m payday loan scam. The story of Nevis reveals the difficulties the world faces in trying to put an end to tax evasion, fraud and kleptocracy.While Nevis’s rivals have lost business by opening up, Nevis has doubled down on secrecy. Not long ago, I spoke to a lawyer with extensive experience of the island, who asked not to be identified because he still needs to work with Nevisian officials. “The only good thing that Donald Trump could do, if he was ever so inclined,” he said, “is take a battleship and roll it up to Nevis, and literally train the guns and say: ‘Get rid of these bullshit laws or I’ll blow you to kingdom come.’”In short, he said, “A bright light needs to be shone on this cockroach.”Tax havens are often lumped together as if they all do the same job. In reality, they are distinctive and highly specialised predators in the financial shark tank. At the top of the food chain – as far as the western world goes, anyway – are places such as London, Switzerland and New York. These apex predators are surrounded by clouds of pilot fish that snap up the scraps: places such as Monaco, Jersey and the Cayman Islands.These smaller centres all play different aspects of the offshore game: Jersey specialises in trusts, the BVI in incorporation, Liechtenstein in foundations. They also differ in their tolerance for criminality. Among the British territories: Gibraltar is dodgier than Guernsey, but cleaner than Anguilla. And they serve different geographical regions: Mauritius for Africa and India Cyprus for the former Soviet Union the Bahamas for the US.In the world of offshore, Nevis is a bottom-feeder. It specialises in letting its clients create corporations with greater anonymity than almost anywhere else on earth. Last year, information on 70,000 Nevisian companies was leaked as part of the Paradise Papers investigation, but that didn’t help us find out who owns them: ownership information is so secret there that even the island’s own corporate registry doesn’t know. In other words, there was nothing substantial to leak.“We feel very strongly that people are entitled to some semblance of financial privacy,” the Nevis premier, Mark Brantley, himself an offshore lawyer, told me when we met in his office in January. “Why shouldn’t you be entitled to a secret?”The secrets don’t belong to residents of Nevis, of course: it would be hard to keep anything quiet for long on an island this size. The secrets belong to foreigners and are being kept from other foreigners, with Nevis getting paid to protect them.We can see that these secrets exist thanks to the UK’s Land Registry, which releases spreadsheets listing all offshore-owned property in the country, along with the registered address of the company that owns it. Some of the secrets are mundane and could be entirely innocent. For instance, who is behind Shi Li Gao Trustees Ltd, the Nevis-incorporated company that owns 13 Brunswick Gardens, a handsome terrace a short walk from Kensington Palace? Some of them are intriguing: for what reason would a Catholic primary school in Liverpool be held via this little Caribbean volcano? And some are decidedly weird: who on earth decided to structure their ownership of a room in a hotel on Llandudno’s North Parade through Caribbean Establishment LLC?But all of these questions are impossible to answer since the secrets are sealed away in Nevis. If these properties were owned via a British company, the true owner of that company would have to be declared to Companies House, and would be visible to anyone with access to the internet. If they were owned via a BVI company, that information would be available to the British police. But a Nevisian company is a closed book, and some people really like it that way.While the BVI has seen the number of companies created there each year collapse, the number created in Nevis has stayed stable. Since 2012, the island’s financial services sector has grown by more than a quarter, as people with secrets have moved to a place that still keeps them. That is a pretty good argument for Brantley’s government not to follow the BVI in opening up its corporate registries to foreigners. Secrecy pays.“The numbers are relatively small, compared to other financial services industries around, but bear in mind the size of Nevis,” Brantley said. “We get direct revenues of $5m-$5.5m, simply from renewal fees.” Renewal fees are what you pay to maintain your company’s registration the more companies there are, the more fees you get. “When that is extrapolated outwards – in terms of rental of office space, employment – we recognise that it does have a multiplier effect on the economy.”It is this provision of secrecy that makes Nevis such an obstacle to law-enforcement investigators. If police can’t prove who owns something, they can’t prove it was criminally acquired, say, or that tax was avoided on the profits from it. This is what crooks are looking for when they send their business offshore. Around 300 British properties are owned in Nevis, and Brantley was unrepentant in defending the secrecy his island provides to those properties’ owners.“Why should a bureaucrat in London, or wherever, curious about his neighbour’s financial situation, pick up the phone and say, ‘You know what, I need to know if Mr John Smith, who’s my neighbour down the road, has an account or a company in Nevis.’ Why’s that his business?” Brantley asked. “Why are Mr John Smith’s financial affairs any business of a bureaucrat in London, unless there’s an allegation against Mr John Smith that he’s somehow contravening some law somewhere?”It is an interesting philosophical question, but it is also a major problem. Countries recognise and respect each other’s laws and sovereignty, so Nevis corporations have as much international validity as anyone’s. So, as long as Nevis persists in denying foreigners access to the ownership information of its companies – no matter how hard other places work to open up – scoundrels can keep routing their business via Nevis, breaking the chain of traceable ownership, and hiding themselves and their crimes from discovery. That means crooked politicians, tax dodgers and fraudsters in Ukraine, Nigeria, Malaysia, the US or anywhere else get to mismanage their country’s finances for their own benefit.And, thanks to Nevis’s curious constitutional situation – it is neither an independent country nor can it be controlled by any other country – there doesn’t appear to be anything we can do about it.From the sea, Nevis (pronounced “knee-vis”) resembles a green nipple. It is elegantly symmetrical, a tropical volcano ringed with golden beaches. By surface area, it is roughly the same size as Bristol, yet its peak is taller than any mountain in England, so the whole island slopes upwards, starting gently where the beach bars shelter among the palm trees, then steadily steepening, while the tree cover gets denser. If you hike up the peak, you are in true rainforest, and will find yourself scrutinised by monkeys in the overhanging greenery.It is a gorgeous place, much frequented by famous people. Earlier this week, John Cleese told Newsnight he was so fed up with how Britain is run that he is moving to Nevis for good. “It’s one of the nicest islands I’ve ever been to,” he said. “The children and adults are extraordinarily well-educated, the weather’s good the whole time, I’m very lucky.”The island was once a major centre for Britain’s sugar growers and slave traders, but it slipped into obscurity in the 18th century, when it was out-competed by larger and more fertile rivals. In the 19th century, Britain added it to neighbouring St Kitts for administrative purposes, and it was as the junior half of the Federation of St Kitts and Nevis that it became independent in 1983.The 80s were a bonanza period for Caribbean islands, as the global economy opened up and law enforcement was caught flat-footed. Tax evaders and drug dealers from North and South America flew planeloads of dollar bills into places such as Cayman and Anguilla, stashed them in bank accounts owned by untraceable shell companies, then invested them in property in Florida, the south of France or New York.In 1984, Bill Barnard, an American lawyer who had taken to vacationing on Nevis, asked the island’s premier if he would be interested in getting into the offshore game. Thanks to the almost complete autonomy Nevis enjoys under the federal constitution of St Kitts and Nevis, its first premier, Simeon Daniel, was free to do what he liked. He approved Barnard’s suggestion, passed the incorporation and secrecy laws the American lawyer drafted and awarded Barnard’s company, Morning Star Holdings, the right to act as exclusive agent for creating the companies. It was a win for both of them. (Neither Morning Star Holdings nor Barnard wished to comment for this piece.)At first, Nevis struggled to compete with already-established rivals, partly because it had no particular advantage of its own. Barnard and his team of American lawyers had borrowed their legislation from Delaware, which acts as a sort of tax haven within the US by offering laxer regulations and lower taxes than the other states, so there wasn’t much reason to look to a remote island for products you could already buy elsewhere. “It was certainly successful,” says David Neufeld, a New Jersey lawyer and an expert on company structuring and international tax. “But it was never at the level of BVI or Cayman.”When Barnard’s monopoly expired in 1994, Nevis took the opportunity to reboot. Neufeld already worked with Barnard, and was asked to help Nevis ersify its offering. Tax havens are always borrowing ideas from each other, seeking to improve on laws that are proving popular – and this process has led to progressively greater secrecy, fewer taxes and lighter regulations. Neufeld looked to the USnited States for inspiration, and specifically to Wyoming, which had invented the limited liability company (LLC), a useful hybrid structure that allowed people to avoid identification and taxes at the same time, as well as offering other benefits.LLCs make it hard for your creditors to find your assets, which also helps rich people avoid paying damages if they lose a lawsuit. Your creditors may have a court judgment against you, but if they can’t find your stuff, they will settle for perhaps 50 cents on the dollar to get the legal wrangling over with. Lawyers call this asset protection.But in the US, it is hard to hide property, since courts can order disclosure of information. Handily, those courts have no jurisdiction in Nevis, which made the idea of a Caribbean version of the LLC very attractive. “In my mind, I was trying to create an LLC for the 51st state,” Neufeld told me. “If you see yourself as someone who could be exposed to some kind of predatory lawsuit where people feel you have assets that are exposed, this gives you an opportunity to protect that.”In simple terms, Nevis’s laws allow rich people to put ramparts around their property, to protect it from someone who might want to use the courts to take it away, whether that be a business partner, a spouse, an estranged child, or indeed anyone. All tax havens do this, but Nevis turned the ratchet many clicks further than its rivals, in its efforts to tempt business away from its rivals.To bring legal proceedings on Nevis, you have to file a bond of $100,000 with the court as proof that your case isn’t frivolous. If you win, that is only the beginning of your quest for the assets. Nevis’s regulator holds no information on either the ownership of the company or its assets. Nevis’s LLCs – Neufeld’s innovation – can’t be wound up, meaning you won’t be able to confiscate any assets they own, and you would have to seek redress elsewhere. If you seek to challenge the legality of a property being put in a Nevis-registered trust – for example, if you thought the property actually belonged to you – you have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the trust’s creation was fraudulent, and you would have to begin that legal challenge within a year of its creation. This is tricky, since Nevis law requires all information on the trust to be confidential, so you would be unlikely to know it even existed.These ludicrously formidable defences are not really intended to be used, but instead – like the bright colouring of a poisonous tree frog – they exist to warn you off attacking in the first place. If they can persuade a plaintiff to settle out of court for less than is owed, then, for a rich person with vulnerable assets, they are well worth paying for.“I don’t like the word ‘hidden’,” says Laurie Lawrence, who retired a couple of years ago after two decades as permanent secretary to the Nevis government. “It’s protected, not hidden. There’s nothing to hide. Look at it from the other way: a lot of females are gold-diggers. You are married to a man you don’t really love him, but he has money. People find ways and means to protect their assets.”This is perhaps why a wealthy person might want to own a Kensington house (or, indeed, a Llandudno hotel room) via a Nevisian company or other structure: it prevents a orced spouse, or any other creditor, from accessing that property, without a tortuous legal process. “Nevis structures started coming up about 12 years ago, and they’re coming around with increasing prevalence,” Jeffrey Fisher, one of America’s leading orce lawyers, told me by telephone from West Palm Beach in Florida.“I’m a former prosecutor, and I know about the ways people hide money, and what they’ll do,” said Fisher. “My approach to getting assets that are in asset protection entities like a Nevis LLC, is that you don’t go to Nevis and try to get the money out – that is a foolhardy enterprise. They passed laws and they set up structures to stop us and to make it expensive and to make it take years and years and years. What we do here is we use some more creative approaches to, for lack of a better term, make them cough up the dough.”Fisher’s approach is to target property and bank accounts in the US, to make his opponents’ lives so onerous that they eventually beg to settle – and he’s extremely good at it. The trouble is that anyone who cannot afford to employ highly expensive specialists such as Fisher has no prospect of even finding where their spouse has put their property, let alone wrestling a fair share away from them. They have to accept what they’re given – there’s no court that can help them.“You’ve got to realise that the asset protection industry is trillions of dollars, not billions of dollars, it’s trillions of dollars,” said Fisher. “Essentially, it’s: we’re going to find a way to screw legitimate creditors out of collecting a legitimate debt. That’s the business these people are in.”Brantley, the Nevis premier, is fluent and passionate in his defence of the ramparts that Nevis builds for rich people looking to protect their assets from creditors. “All it does is say that you’re creating a locked box, so to speak, if you want to protect assets,” Brantley said, when we met in his office up the hill from Charlestown, Nevis’s capital village. “And people protect assets for a variety of reasons. It’s not always to get away from a pending orce.”The trouble is that when you cast your eye beyond the orce cases, Nevis’s business model begins to looks even worse. The Nevis financial system is rudimentary compared to the large tax havens – places such as Jersey, or the Cayman Islands, which have major accountancy firms, fund managers, large banks and other global behemoths. In Nevis, there’s precious little money for anyone to avoid tax on. But then, it isn’t really a haven from taxes at all, so much as a haven from scrutiny of any kind. The same laws that appeal to the kind of nervous and wealthy men who want to hide their assets from their wives, have been regularly exploited by crooks from all over the world.Britain’s biggest-ever tax fraud – for which five men were jailed in November, after attempting to scam the Treasury out of £107m in tax – involved Nevis-registered companies, which were helping to hide the identity of the fraudsters. The family of a former president of Taiwan used a Nevis trust to help to hide its ownership of corruptly acquired US property. Ukraine’s deposed president, Viktor Yanukovych, used Nevis structures to hide his stolen assets, as did corrupt Russian officials who stole $230m from the budget in 2007. (When the accountant Sergei Magnitsky uncovered the scam, they arrested him and left him to die in jail.) British trader Navinder Sarao, who pleaded guilty to fraud for helping cause 2010’s flash crash, erted some of his profits to a Nevis structure called the NAV Sarao Milking Markets Fund.According to the independent advocacy group Tax Justice Network, Nevis out-obscures all the traditional offshore centres: BVI, Switzerland, Guernsey, the Isle of Man, Luxembourg, and even fellow bottom-feeders such as Belize and the Cook Islands. And its enthusiasm for secrets impedes other countries’ efforts to enforce transparency.But a search of the Companies House website reveals how Nevis is able to defang Britain’s attack on secrecy. For instance, I recently came across three LLPs, all of which are owned by the same two Nevis companies: Tallberg and Uniwell. According to data gathered by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, one of these LLPs controlled a Latvian bank account used in a money-laundering scheme the other two have not been implicated in any wrongdoing (and neither have Tallberg and Uniwell). According to Companies House, the three LLPs have the same ownership structure, which means that their person or persons with significant control should be the same. Mysteriously, however, each of the LLPs is listed as having a different PSC. This is technically possible, but highly unlikely. But we have no way of finding out the truth, since Nevis does not cooperate with the UK in allowing law enforcement officers to see who really owns Nevisian companies such as Tallberg and Uniwell. These three LLPs are not isolated examples – Tallberg and Uniwell alone have owned dozens of British companies, and there are many more Nevisian corporations like them.The new UK law requiring disclosure of true owners is useless if that ownership can just be hidden in Nevis. And this is why Nevis-controlled but British-registered companies, whose ownership is unclear, have been involved in many of the massive eastern European money-laundering scams collectively known as the “laundromats”, which have moved tens of billions of dollars out of the former Soviet Union. Nevis ownership can transform a supposedly transparent British company into a secrecy vehicle as iniquitous as anything on earth.Charlestown is a handsome place, consisting of a long street of two-storey buildings parallel to the shore, many with first-floor balconies for catching the sea breeze. Its most striking feature, however, is the truly remarkable number of signs advertising lawyers, accountants and administrators. The Devon town of Ilfracombe, with its 11,000 inhabitants, has two lawyers’ offices, an insurance company and two sets of accountants, as well as a branch of Lloyds and a Nationwide. The 11,000 Nevisians, by contrast, host six domestic banks, one international bank, 18 insurance managers, seven international insurance entities, four money service businesses and 58 registered agents, many of them law firms. Nevis may be the most over-lawyered place on earth.When you get off the ferry, almost the first house you see is the Henville building, nominal home to the Azerbaijan first family’s business empire. If you then turn right at the T-junction, you see the Edith Solomon building (although it has lost two of the letters from its name), which hosted an Idaho payday loan company that was shut down by the state government in 2012, for operating without a license. Barely 100 metres in the opposite direction on Main Street, meanwhile, is the office of Morning Star Holdings, pioneers of the Nevis offshore industry.I was keen to find the registered address of Tallberg and Uniwell, the two Nevisian companies that had so successfully outmanoeuvred UK company law, in the – admittedly, rather forlorn – hope that I could find someone who would give me information about them. Their registered address was the same as that of the Nevis International Trust Company (NITC), which, according to its website, will supply you not only with a shell company, but also with nominee directors and shareholders, which will further obscure your involvement in it, as well as a bank account, a credit card and a stock trading account. “Nevis is an excellent location for: privacy, estate planning, asset protection, tax reduction planning, holding investments, royalty and licensing ownership,” the website states.I had an address for the NITC’s office, but no one on the island was able to tell me where it was. I spent a frustrating, hot and thirsty morning searching for it and, when I finally got through on the phone, was brushed off. “I’m not a robber,” I told the woman who answered the phone, after she had refused to help me. “I don’t know that, do I?” she replied.In fairness, she had a good reason not to talk. According to a 1985 law, anyone on Nevis disclosing financial information without a court order is liable to a prison term of up to a year, as well as a fine of $10,000. (This is another area where Nevis is resisting the trend towards openness. Cayman previously had a similar law against breaching confidentiality, but decriminalised the offence in 2016.) When I tried phoning the registered office of Tallberg and Uniwell, the receptionist refused to even tell me where the office was, so I couldn’t visit. When I emailed the NITC, there was no reply. Eventually I had to accept that it was not going to be possible to make contact with them, which meant the true ownership information for the three LLPs was undiscoverable.And it is not just journalists who are unable to check the reliability of Nevis’ financial information for themselves foreign police can’t either. That means we are all reliant on the Nevis financial services regulatory commission to do it for us. The commission is based in an office in the centre of Charlestown, and is run by Heidi-Lynn Sutton, its chief regulator, who works in an office on the first floor.Sutton started off unfriendly, and became less friendly as our 45-minute chat progressed, her manner becoming increasingly exasperated. She flatly dismissed the US state department’s description of Nevis as “a desirable location for criminals to conceal proceeds”. It was simply untrue, she said, that Nevis had anonymous bank accounts, bank secrecy and an opaque corporate register.This was odd, since her regulator’s own website states that bank account holders on the island have no obligation to provide any “statement, return or information (to) … the regulator or the minister”. However, Sutton defended Nevis against all allegations, no matter how serious. The heavy cost of bringing proceedings in Nevis court, for example, was simply to protect the justice system from being “bombarded with frivolous lawsuits”, rather than to protect the wealthy. “That is our weeding-out mechanism,” she said. “Some countries are very litigious. If you get a little burn on your hand because you spill a McDonald’s coffee, somebody will sue you.”When I explained the difficulty I had faced in even finding NITC, Sutton laughed, asking why I was looking for it. I explained that I had hoped to discover who actually owned the limited partnerships on the British registry. When I asked about whether the regulator she runs might have failed to notice a number of serious money-laundering schemes, she simply said: “I can’t speak to that, I really cannot speak to that.”What about the fact that the former ruling families of Taiwan and Ukraine, as well as lower-profile crooks from all over the world, had used Nevis vehicles to obscure the ownership of their stolen assets? Sutton laughed again. “I can’t accept that there has been multiple usage of our structures to facilitate whatever. I can’t accept hearing it from you. I won’t be able to speak to that.”If the island is so clean, why did online trolls looking to smear Emmanuel Macron before the 2017 French presidential election create fake documents supposedly showing he had a shell company in Nevis? Isn’t that a sign that the industry Sutton oversees has an image problem? “People make things up all the time,” she replied. “Once you are an international financial centre, and provide certain services, you will always be a target, it doesn’t mean that it’s true.”I have spent most of the last four years researching financial crimes, and have spoken to dozens of regulators and investigators in multiple jurisdictions, but never before had I met one who responded in such a way to allegations of grand corruption, money laundering and fraud that I was making against their jurisdiction.Like any financial centre, Nevis must choose between turning away dirty money, or attracting as much business as it can. I did not find my visit to Nevis reassuring.Since Nevisian officials appear happy with the current situation, it is up to outsiders to force change on the island, and sadly – thanks to the constitutional peculiarities of the federation – this is all but impossible. We know this because it has been tried.In 1995, in federation-wide elections, the St Kitts and Nevis Labour party swept to power with seven of the 11 federal seats, and its leader, Denzil Douglas, became prime minister. He had no seats on Nevis, but did not need any to pass laws for the whole federation. Among his priorities was restricting Nevis’ sordid financial sector. “We were aware that the international community had begun to frown upon Nevis, and on the international financial services that were poorly regulated, not supervised, etc,” said Douglas when we met in his office in Basseterre, the federal capital, which is on St Kitts. “And we sought to bring in new legislation. So they had their referendum.”In 2000, the Financial Action Task Force – a Paris-based group created by the G7 to develop policies against money-laundering – blacklisted the whole of St Kitts and Nevis, as one of 15 countries deemed to be non-cooperative. That forced Nevis to agree to federal legislation, but did not change the basic dynamic that it has significantly more autonomy than Scotland has within the UK, and in some ways more than inidual US states. One financial professional in Basseterre described the relationship between Nevis and St Kitts as like that of a teenager with access to his big brother’s credit card.None of the tools that large countries have used against tax havens such as Switzerland or Jersey – diplomatic pressure, legal proceedings against banks, and so on – are applicable to Nevis. It is part of a fully independent country (unlike the BVI or Gibraltar) and the companies providing its services (unlike the Swiss banks targeted by the US Department of Justice) are not large enough to fear losing their offices in the US.Major western countries will have to make their criticism of Nevis via diplomatic channels, if they want it to change its ways. Brantley got his retaliation in first, however, accusing the British government of hypocrisy.“It is no secret that the UK, and London in particular, has a disproportionate number of wealthy Russians, for example, and wealthy oligarchs from all around the world, and the question is: why? It can’t be for the weather. So, why are people flocking to London? So, if the United Kingdom can do that, then what is the issue with other countries, not as endowed as the UK, trying to stand on their own two feet?”The issue is that if every jurisdiction thinks only of how to stand on its own two feet – whether that’s post-Brexit Britain, Nevis or Wyoming – we will all be pushed over separately by the world’s crooks and thieves. Brantley is right that we all need to do more to fight kleptocrats and fraudsters, but by keeping their secrets and making money from it, Nevis is stopping the rest of us from moving forward.• This article was amended on 12 July 2018 to correct an error. An earlier version stated that it was impossible for the three LLPs mentioned in the text to have three different persons with significant control. It is, in fact, technically possible. • Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/70290d2b68b0cb2c9ea48b7730024d4453c10ded/0_0_2680_1816/master/2680.jpg?w=720\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d40f9d5bd0ec0b10ba9a9c8cc273b3d1 720w","title":"tory mp apologises for tweet of sadiq khan image with pig balloon","story":"London mayor calls for Conservatives to take action over Michael Fabricant tweetThe Conservative MP Michael Fabricant has apologised for tweeting a cartoon image of Sadiq Khan being mounted by an inflatable pig, after he was accused of Islamophobia.Khan, the mayor of London, called on the Tories to take action against the backbencher, and the Labour MP Wes Streeting said he had written to the Conservative chief whip, Julian Smith, asking what would be done. Lady Sayeeda Warsi, a Conservatives former chair, said Fabricant’s actions showed the extent of Islamophobia within the party.The tweet, quickly deleted by Fabricant, referred to the “Trump baby” protest balloon being flown over Westminster, which Khan authorised and the Lichfield MP has criticised. The images showed a grinning Donald Trump, and in the background a balloon pig mounting a balloon with Khan’s face on it, with the words: “Breaking news: Trump defeats Sadiq Khan in balloon wars”. In a letter to Smith, Streeting said the use of a pig in connection with Khan, who is Muslim, was “grossly offensive, highly inappropriate and racist”, saying it echoed the anti-Islam mayoral campaign fought by the Tory candidate Zac Goldsmith.Khan told LBC: “I would expect that if a member of a mainstream party who is an MP to have tweeted what he tweeted, his party would take action against him.”Warsi said there should be an inquiry into Islamophobia within the Conservatives: “The problem in my party is too widespread for there not to be.”In a tweeted apology Fabricant said he “accidentally tweeted a vile picture” sent to him by someone he had trusted. “Because I was distracted in a meeting and saw it on a small iPhone, I didn’t spot what it really was,” he said.“When I saw the picture, I thought it was just a funny cartoon of a flying pig doing something to the baby Trump blimp. This followed on from my remarks on TV about the hypocrisy of the anti-Trump demos and the ridiculous blimp.“Instead, it was something quite different and very nasty.

Within a second of the particle being spotted, IceCube issued an automatic alert, prompting an international race to find the neutrino’s origin.Because scientists on the IceCube experiment had worked out the path the particle took through their subterranean ice instrument, astronomers knew where in the sky to look for the particle’s source. A string of early observations came up blank, but days later Nasa’s Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope spotted the likely source: a flaring “blazar”.Most galaxies are thought to have spinning supermassive black holes at their centres. But some of these black holes appear to pull in material at ferocious rates, a process that simultaneously sends streams of highly energetic particles out into space. Such galaxies are called blazars, although the term only applies when one of these streams is directed straight at Earth.The blazar that appears to have sent the neutrino our way lies 3.7bn light years from Earth, just off the left shoulder of the constellation of Orion. While a single detection is not strong evidence, the IceCube scientists went back through their records and found a flurry of neutrinos coming from the same spot over 150 days in 2014 and 2015. Details are published in two separate papers in the journal Science.By discovering the neutrino’s origins, astronomers may also have solved the 100-year-old puzzle of what kinds of objects can create high-energy cosmic rays that occasionally hit the planet. Cosmic rays are made up of protons and other charged particles and are almost impossible to trace to their origins because the particles are deflected by magnetic fields as they travel through space. But high-energy cosmic rays also form neutrinos, which travel in straight lines so are easier to trace back to their source.“We know that there are these very high-energy cosmic rays being accelerated out there somewhere and it’s a century-old mystery where they are coming from,” said Erik Blaufuss, who works on IceCube at the University of Maryland. “The problem with cosmic rays is that they go out into space and get scrambled.”In tracing the neutrino back to its origin, scientists have launched a new era of astronomy, one in which the heavens can be observed not only with traditional telescopes, and even gravitational wave observatories, but with neutrino detectors too. “How much we are just starting to scratch the surface is the big question we are grappling with now,” said Blaufuss.Neutrinos are extraordinary particles. So light that they were once thought to be massless, they stream continuously out from the sun in vast quantities. Most of the time they pass through objects in their path: about 100bn pass unnoticed through the area of a fingertip every second. Collisions with other particles such as that detected in Antarctica happen very rarely.Julian Osborne at the University of Leicester was part of a team that used Nasa’s Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory to confirm the flaring blazar. “This is literally a new way of seeing the universe,” he said. “This really is the dawn of a new type of astronomy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f989bb6580cf9515dbd532de4a52f5edfa2eeded/0_28_3496_2097/master/3496.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91d53bbf07d4dc1b94093f72ae920943","title":"talking horses gossamer wings can swoop to victory at newmarket horse racing tips","story":"Ryan Moore can also claim first spot aboard Ripp Orf (5.20) in the closing one-mile handicap on the cardSo there’s a race on Friday at Newmarket which Aidan O’Brien has won for the last two years and it looks like he may very well win it again but his runner isn’t even favourite. How often does that happen?The betting market generally loves an obvious O’Brien sort but Gossamer Wings (2.25) has evidently not caught our collective attention because she’s available at 11-2 for the nine-runner Duchess Of Cambridge Stakes, formerly known as the Cherry Hinton. Punters prefer Main Edition and La Pelosa, who fought out the finish of the Albany at Royal Ascot.In their favour is the fact that that race was run over the same distance as today’s, six furlongs, whereas Gossamer Wings ran in a shorter race at Ascot, the Queen Mary. But pedigree and run style suggest there’s scope for this progressive filly to take a step forward, with this extra furlong to tackle, and there’s nothing wrong with the form of her Ascot race, in which she was beaten a short-head.Her stablemate So Perfect, close behind in fourth, has since won the Balanchine Stakes on Irish Derby weekend. O’Brien had got in the habit of bringing his Balanchine winners to Newmarket for today’s race but, when asked if he would do the same with So Perfect right after she won, he nominated Gossamer Wings as his likely Newmarket candidate.Ryan Moore rides her for the first time and your average British punter would surely see that as a positive. But such is the growing reputation of Donnacha O’Brien, there will now be quite a few who will wish he was aboard this filly once more and I reckon that might be the majority opinion in Ireland. Personally, I’m happy to see either man on a horse I fancy.Moore is also aboard the other one I plan to back at Newmarket, Ripp Orf (5.20) in the closing handicap. It’s easy to put a line through his Epsom defeat last month, when he clipped heels coming down the hill and was brave to run on as well as he did.David Elsworth has given this lightly raced horse a bit of time since then and I think we can now hope for a resumption of the progress he showed when winning the Victoria Cup in May. Hayley Turner has gone to Ascot but there’s nothing wrong with Moore as a substitute. You can get 6-1 because there are some useful types in the race.In my usual way, I tried to find something to beat Alpha Centauri in the Falmouth, because who wants to bet at odds of 2-5? I couldn’t do it in the end, partly because I’m still kicking myself over getting on the wrong side of her at Royal Ascot.There are things that can go wrong for her. She sparkled in the Coronation Stakes but, for all the appearance of ease, an effort like that will have taken something out of her and it was only three weeks ago. That race was run around a bend, whereas here she faces a straight mile. Perhaps some dangerous rival will get an uncontested lead, like Nyaleti. I’m staying out of it, much as I hate to do that with a Group One.At Ascot, Phantasmic (4.00) appeals at 7-2, being the one with most obvious potential to improve in a small field of fillies. She’s a Frankel half-sister to an Abbaye winner and comes from the Sir Michael Stoute yard that is flying along just now.I seem to remember saying “next time” after tipping Five Helmets (7.25) in this space recently, when he got his act together late on and ran on into fourth on his handicap debut. Well, next time is this time because he goes at Chester tonight, with an annoying extra 3lb but facing a helpful extra furlong. He’s only 15-8, so it’s not like I’m the only one who’s noticed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afdc33da9d11b46af3e437891471840b3d1c3a45/20_739_8420_5052/master/8420.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6ed66ece3e130b363fe30270612c89b","title":"england v new zealand third womens odi international live","story":"9th over: England 40-0 (Jones 14, Beaumont 22) Jones plays a nice cover drive, but doesn’t quite time it and can only collect a single for her troubles. 8th over: England 38-0 (Jones 13, Beaumont 21) Devine sends down a good over until the last ball, a marginal legside wide that sounded like it might have brushed a pad. That’s the only run from the over though, and New Zealand have reined England in over the last couple. 7th over: England 37-0 (Jones 13, Beaumont 21) Strong ‘Oval in the long hot summers of the 1970s before they’d really figured out watering’ vibes from this outfield. This absurd and relentless heat has taken its toll on grass of a light, strawy brown colour, and the ball skates across it like it’s glass. Just a single from that over, mind. 6th over: England 36-0 (Jones 12, Beaumont 21) Beaumont batters a straight drive that wasn’t quite as technically correct as her previous efforts but no less effective: four more runs. A single for Jones after a leg-bye makes the England batters’ scores pleasingly palindromic. 5th over: England 30-0 (Jones 11, Beaumont 17) Change of bowling, as Hayley Jensen comes on, and keeps it pretty quiet. Two singles from the over, one from another lovely Beaumont cover drive stopped by the judiciously placed cover fence sweeper. 4th over: England 28-0 (Jones 10, Beaumont 16) Sometimes the most enjoyable shots in cricket are the ones that go in the exact opposite direction to where they were intended. To whit, Jones goes for a lusty whip through mid-wicket, it takes a leading edge and flies just to the right of third man, and they get two runs. Was actually a really good ball from Devine: a bit of extra juice, with a little away movement and would have clattered off stump if Jones had missed it entirely. A couple of balls later Beaumont picks up four with her third glorious cover drive of the afternoon, this one quite probably the best shot of them all. 3rd over: England 19-0 (Jones 7, Beaumont 10) Don’t see this that often these days: Huddleston is called for overstepping from the first two balls of the over, the second of which looked particularly harsh - in fact, entirely incorrect, because her heel was behind the line, not even on it. That ball is creamed to the boundary with another terrific Beaumont cover drive, then two more singles come from a long over. 2nd over: England 11-0 (Jones 6, Beaumont 5) Four runs quietly accumulated off Devine, two from a nice Jones clip in front of square and two other singles. 1st over: England 7-0 (Jones 3, Beaumont 4) Jones gets things started with what looks like a gentle push off the back foot that fair dashes off a very firm outfield and is eventually hauled in. From the last ball of the over Beaumont plays a shot to a similar area, but much more emphatically, a full-blooded off drive bringing the first boundary of the day. The players are out on the field. Jones and Beaumont to open for England, Holly Huddleston has the ball for New Zealand. Honestly I’m not sure. But if you were second in line to Sarah Taylor, you’d be forgiven for burning your gloves in a solemn ceremony surrounded by a small circle of loved ones.Two changes for England: Sarah Taylor is rested so Lauren Winfield comes back and Amy Jones gets a go with the gloves, while Kate Cross replaces Katie George. New Zealand have also made a couple of personnel changes, but interestingly captain Suzie Bates said Jess Watkin will move up to open - she had batted eight in the previous two games - with Bates dropping down, possibly to five. Full teams to follow. ...and will bat.The main question ahead of this third and final ODI of this series is: will it be a contest? Because the previous two haven’t really. A win by 142 runs in Leeds at the weekend was followed by a 123 run win in Derby, England superior in every department over the two games that far. The structure of the ICC Women’s Championship, that this series is part of, means it’s not really a dead rubber as such, for victory would put England at the top of the table (admittedly having played three more games than Australia), which ultimately decides the first four qualifiers for the next World Cup. So will England go for the old ‘foot on throat’ approach and play the full strength team again, or will they experiment a little? Might Alex Hartley get a game? Will Anya Shrubsole come back, having missed the previous two games with a side strain? Will they get funky, reverse the batting order and call Claire Taylor out of retirement to really make things interesting?New Zealand’s big problem has obviously been two batting collapses, and arguably that exposed their reliance on the top of the order. Recently when Suzie Bates and Sophie Devine have scored runs, New Zealand have been fine. But they’ve managed a total of 99 runs between them in this series, and the rest of the batting line-up hasn’t picked up the slack. Of course, a broader question might be: are New Zealand even bothered? As hosts of the World Cup they’re qualified already, so even though they started this nominal qualification process well, it ultimately doesn’t matter. Will they try some stuff out and make some changes? Stay tuned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e6d35da7c8a31ddbc0dcc206ce4c992caf50953/0_344_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9d31f4303b4f8d458f7bcd1fd1a4b29","title":"tour de france 2018 stage seven live","story":"Offredo is first over the peak and pockets a King of the Mountains point, the first of his career. Some small consolation there for the pain he’s going to feel after his futile breakaway. “Maybe as well as the ‘most attacking rider’, they need a daily classification for ‘poorest sod’?” suggests David Hindle. A fine idea. Maybe there should even be a jersey for the overall winner. Doesn’t matter the colour so long as it smells and is full of holes.Offredo has just had a consultation with his team car and complained about the senseless of his breakaway, which he evidently made against his better instincts. He’s basically been told the purpose was to get publicity for his team and he’ll have to just suck it up. He’ll probably suffer over the next few days because of the effort of riding 100km on his tod, but that’s the sacrifice he’s been ordered to make. According to Eurosport, today’s “racing” is so far running 25 minutes behind the slowest predictions. It sure feels that way.“I’ve done quite a lot of cycling over the years,” announces David Hindle. “I’ve done time trials, the odd bunch race, and trained in many groups. The speed in the peloton, I can understand to a point, because I’ve seen what it’s like and that you go much faster than you’d have imagined possible due to having all the other riders around you. But the one thing I have never been able to get my head around is a breakaway (even as an ex-time triallist). Especially a solo or 2 man escape. The idea of riding those distances at speeds \u0026gt40kph, sometimes even \u0026gt45kph. The wind. The endless little hills and gradients that kill you. Can any of the multitude of better cyclists than me out there, explain how you get your head around that? I can fully appreciate the poor sod Offredo, out there on his own now, admitting to his DS that he didn’t really fancy leading a break. Because let’s face it. Who in their right mind would?” The sort of atypical person who gets a kick out of competing in the Tour de France?Offredo’s is now only five and half a minutes clear, with 124km left. If he happens to have any political or personal message he wants to promote, this would be the time to do it. He’s going to be swallowed up soon. There’s a monsieur by the roadside playing tunes on an accordion for the riders as they hurtle by. Not one of them threw him any change. Told him he should have taken a guitar instead. Still 128km to go but a semblance of order is starting to appear in the peloton, with team members beginning to cluster together and plot their moves. Offredo’s lead is just over six minutes.After 93km of riding, the saddlemen pass through Saint-Leonard-des-Bois, an area with the perhaps-suitably-named Valley of Misery. Although, in fairness, there’s little clue now as to why it got that name - that’s because of the local authorities have grown trees and greenery here over the years - but still amid the distinctive quartzite (or Grès Amoricain) formations.Apparently a few drops of rain are beginning to fall - that’s what the lads on the TV are saying, anyway, but they’re not yet big enough to be visible. But the forecast suggests there may be a small downpour. The riders might welcome a cool shower but, on the other hand, it could make for a slippery surface. It’s been easy cycling so far but maybe that’s going to change. “Love the updates, especially the WW2 plane stuff!” hurrahs Tom Overbury, merely to butter us up before delivering his criticism. “As a farmerarchitect I do object to the caption of French fans standing on straw - not ‘hay’, obviously. Too yellow to be hay which is made from dried grass. Straw is cereal crop stalks (wheat or barley).” I didn’t write that caption but I’ll be sure to take up your grievance with the ignoramus who did. If we let this slide, he’ll be mistaking scarecrows for real people next.With 150km to go, Offredo remains just over seven minutes in front. There’s no really concerted attempt to devour him, they’re just nibbling away at his lead. He might be trying to summon a second wind, but that would surely only be for the purposes of annoying the peloton rather than preventing the inevitable capture. The peloton are beginning to take bits out of Offredo’s lead. “Who was the P-51 pilot and did he survive?” asks Andre Benton. “This is one of the great TdF things - lots of local ‘illuminations’ as they zoom around France.” It seems that the two people on board - a Lt Overfield and a Flight Sgt Matthews - landed safely and were rescued by Resistance fighters. Offredo is nine minutes in front, the biggest lead anyone has had in the Tour so far. The peloton seem to have decided that’s enough and haven’t allowed him to increase it over the last couple of kilometres. It remains to be seen how long they’ll let him hang out there before dragging him in. The riders are approaching the commune of La Chapelle-au-Riboul, marking 62.4km into the face. Back in 1944 an US Air Force P-51Mustang crash landed here after being shot by a Messerschimtt Me 109. The P-51 played a relatively large role in the victory in the air because of its ability to penetrate deeper into German air space. All of which is a roundabout way of saying that there’s not much afoot in the race, Offredo being allowed to keep on pedalling on his lonesome up front, his lead approaching nine minutes. Offredo’s has been allowed to extend his lead to over seven minutes. He’s more than 11 minutes behind the top of the general classification so the peloton will give him some slack yet. I’ll say one thing about the riders in this Tour: they’re lucky the World Cup is on. Otherwise the yellow jersey would be N’golo Kanté’s for the taking. Offredo’s has stretched his lead out to two and a half minutes, zipping along at a cool 48km per hour, fully 15kmph faster than the peloton.Possibly motivated by sheer boredom, Yoann Offredo has decided to launch an attack. He opens up a 30 second lead, without anyone behind him seeming bothered. We have reached a significant milestone: 200kms to go. So something significant may start happening soon. Or not. This has been a peculiar first 25kms, which is not to say a total non-event. Several teams are represented in the breakaway posse, but BMC, the team with the yellow jersey are not. The lead is only 13 seconds and falling.Degand has been taken back into the warm bosom of the peloton. Fleetingly he tried to incite some enthusiasm for a race, but the 169 other riders just weren’t interested. There’s a long, long way to go. But hold on, what’s this? A spurt of action at the front! A group of 10 riders are beginning a proper breakaway. Degand’s lead is down to 40 seconds. He’s almost begging to rejoin the comfort of the peloton. With 222km to go, Thomas Degand remains in front, almost despite himself. His heart’s not really in this breakaway, and the fact that no one seems bothered to chase him down is only increasing his doubts. He’s cycling along like a boy sent out to buy some milk rather than a man on mission for glory. Thomas Degand has had enough of this tedium and decided to make a break for it! And everyone lets the poor fool go. Just the 226km to hold on. Well, the first four kilometres have sure made for gripping TV. Nothing has happened. No one has fancied making a breakaway just yet, which isn’t all that surprising: 230km is a long way to hold off a chasing pack. So everyone is trundling along merrily for now, albeit at a far quicker trundle than you or I could manage.And they’re off! The longest stage of the 2018 tour has begun. Since there have been only six withdrawals so far, there are 170 riders at the starting point today. They’ll all be confident of making it through this stage, which is a flat affair, except for a category 4 bump around the 120km mark. Hello and welcome to coverage of stage seven, during which the riders will make their way from Fougères to Chartres, a trifling 231km away.

Spanning 150 years and running three and a half hours, Stefano Massini’s play traces the trajectory of western capitalism by following the fortunes of a single family. But where previous European stagings have deployed a vast cast, Sam Mendes’s production of Ben Power’s adaptation uses just three actors: Simon Russell Beale, Ben Miles and Adam Godley. The result is an intimate epic that becomes a masterly study of acting as well as of the intricacies of high finance. For most of us, the name Lehman Brothers stirs memories of the financial crash of 2008, when this Wall Street institution filed for bankruptcy: an event with global consequences. But Massini’s play traces the family’s progress from the arrival of three brothers from Bavaria in the America of the 1840s. Starting modestly with the opening of a general store in Montgomery, Alabama, they move into buying and reselling raw cotton and expand into banking, coffee and the burgeoning railway business. Power passes from one generation to the next, but there is a decisive shift in the late 1960s with the creation of a trading ision run by non-family members. Eventually it leads to the firm’s demise with the collapse of the mortgage bond market. You can see the story in many ways: as a dynastic drama, as a study of the decline and fall of an immigrant Jewish family, as a parable about the dangers of market deregulation. But, although Power’s adaptation studiously avoids giving us any lectures, it is hard not to see the play as an account of the shifting definition of the American dream. To the original Lehman brothers, arriving in what one of them dubs “that magical music box called America”, it meant that enterprise and hard work would be rewarded by success. By 2008, it had dwindled into delusions of infinite riches based on financial services. The joy of Mendes’s impeccable production lies in watching the actors at work as they switch genders and ages to evoke multiple characters. Beale starts out as the solid, senior Henry Lehman but, at different times, turns into a sprightly tightrope-walker, a decrepit rabbi, a flirty orcee. As Henry’s nephew, he assesses potential brides on a points system, in a scene that brilliantly demonstrates the limitations of the business ethos. It reveals a versatility we have not seen in Beale before.  Godley is no less extraordinary. He starts as Mayer, the patronised youngest of the Lehman siblings, and later transmogrifies, by donning dark glasses, into the ferociously entrepreneurial Bobbie. In the interim, he plays everything from blushing brides to recalcitrant toddlers. Miles, meanwhile, exudes an authoritative calm as the middle brother, Emanuel, but goes on to reveal the rebelliousness of later members of the Lehman clan and the rage of piratical traders. Es Devlin’s set is beautiful to look at: a rotating glass box backed by Luke Halls’ stunning video designs, which provide a black-and-white panorama of a changing American landscape. The final stages of the firm’s collapse are rather hastily handled. I feel it would be fascinating to know more about the subprime mortgage scandal, and the way the firm removed liabilities from its balance sheet to create a misleading impression of its stability. Otherwise, this is an engrossing evening. Not the least of its virtues is that it shows how, even at the height of Lehman Brothers’ success, the key players all had terrifying nightmares prophesying doom. But Mendes and Power are not offering a wise-after-the-event hindsight saga. As in all the best plays about finance – such as Caryl Churchill’s Serious Money and Lucy Prebble’s Enron – they capture the dubious excitement as well as the danger of high-risk capitalism. It makes for a remarkable evening, which offers a kaleidoscopic social and political metaphor while reminding us that one of the reasons we go to the theatre is to watch superb acting.•The Lehman Trilogy is at the Lyttelton at the National Theatre, London, until 22 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ad72697990b6e1fba24d4e23effed8e40c180df/258_261_674_405/master/674.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d2bc7263b9d3b6ff4431129616e5aed6","title":"albania kala festival new younger holidaymakers beaches","story":"A new arrival on the festival circuit, Albania is tempting younger holidaymakers to dance on its beaches and explore beyond its pristine shoresJust how seriously the Albanian ministry of tourism was taking Kala festival – the first international event of its kind in the country – became clear the moment we stepped off the boat at Saranda to find a police escort waiting to accompany our coaches on the winding, mountainous transfer. That and the arrival of prime minister Edi Rama the following day, for an impromptu poolside press conference with the organisers at our hotel.“Albania has always been beautiful,” he mused, as an inflatable pink flamingo drifted across the pool behind him. “But people think of it as a place where you get robbed or killed … But the stigma has helped us. When someone visits and gets out alive, they realise it’s paradise! It’s like the forbidden apple: don’t bite it or you’ll want it all the time.”As for his thoughts on Kala? “I have to admit, I don’t know anything about the festival but, in principle, it’s fantastic,” he said, offering one night of free Albanian beer before disappearing. Dry Balkan wit and free beer aside, Albania isn’t high on the list of Europe’s most-visited countries. It sees around 80,000 UK visitors a year – a tiny number compared with the 3 million who travel annually to neighbouring Greece, or the 765,000 who visit nearby Croatia. But that could be set to change. In 2014, the New York Times included the Albanian coast among its best new destinations (“This is Europe when it was fresh and cheap,” it wrote), while Lonely Planet ranked its capital, Tirana, among the best places to visit in Europe this year.Kala – a week-long festival held in June at the upmarket resort town of Dhërmi – could cement Albania’s reputation as an exciting new beach and party destination, in the same way that Outlook and Dimensions put Croatia on the map for young Brits. At the moment, Dhërmi is a little tricky to get to: a flight to Corfu, then four hours by ferry and bus. However, with a new airport set to open in Vlora (just 50km from Dhërmi) in 2020, access is likely to improve dramatically.Kala took place last month across five sites in Dhërmi, with hotel beach bars as venues. Just 2,000 tickets were available, so there was plenty of space on the beach, crystal-clear water, as well as uncrowded, easy-going restaurants (seafood linguine at Luciano’s became a favourite). Festival tickets included accommodation packages, from beach huts to B\u0026ampBs to smart hotels, all close to the action. With a wellness programme (yoga and gong baths overlooking the Ionian sea) running alongside the music events, the festival was aimed equally at those interested in a laid-back beach break (a bit like summer-long boutique Croatian festival Obonjan), as at those wanting to party all night (there is music until 6am daily).The lineup was predominantly electronic music, using London’s underground collectives – Feelings, Secretsundaze, Phonica and Stamp the Wax – to build a crowd (many festivalgoers were from the UK), as well as the likes of Moodymann, Maurice Fulton and Tama Sumo and Lakuti. Headliners included Tom Misch and Todd Terje, while the lazy, sun-drenched soul of Roy Ayers had the crowd eating out of his hand.The team that founded Kala – Mainstage Travel – is behind one of Europe’s major winter festivals, Snowboxx. It had been trying to launch a summer event for three years. “We searched Portugal, Croatia, Italy, Spain, Malta, Morocco, but couldn’t find anything off the beaten track,” Alan Crofton, the festival director, told me. “In October last year, we visited Dhërmi for the first time and immediately saw the potential. The idea is that it’s a holiday, you come, you chill on the beach …”Most of the people I spoke to echoed this. “The best thing was going somewhere I’ve never been before,” said Rebecca, 27, from London. “I wanted to do a festival abroad. I found it on Resident Advisor and the pics just looked amazing.”With many people staying for the full week, the ministry of tourism was encouraging guests to explore other highlights of the Albanian riviera. These included Grama Bay, dubbed Albania’s answer to Alex Garland’s The Beach – a secluded bay accessible only by boat, with dazzling blue water and hundreds of rock inscriptions dating as far back as the 3rd century BC Blue Eye spring, a 45-metre-deep pool surrounded by hazelnut trees and Ksamil Beach, a coastal village from which four uninhabited islands can be explored by boat.For me, the most unforgettable element of Kala was the venue at Gjipe, a beach and eco-campground in the next bay, a six-minute speedboat ride from Dhërmi. Just beyond the beach, surrounded by lush trees and flanked by steep, red cliffs, was a small stage and sound system, where you could dance until the sun set and it was time to take the boat back.DJs including Bjørn Torske, Nick The Record and Jenifa Mayanja took turns to play to a crowd of sunkissed, beaming faces … music bouncing down the gorge, which changed colour every hour as the light faded. A walk into the canyon led to a secret waterfall – a hint of other secrets this stretch of coast might reveal.The prime minister wasn’t kidding about what a paradise this country is. Turns out he wasn’t kidding about the free beer either. With two days to go until the end of the festival, I ran into Crofton, who was grinning wildly. “I just got a text from the prime minister,” he said. “He’s sending over a pallet of beer ... I guess everyone at the festival gets a free one.”• The trip was provided by Kala festival. Dates for 2019 tbc.

America is not only about being proud but about being brave and standing for what we believe.”Moore, who was accused of sexual misconduct by nine women, also complained that Cohen was part of a string of “vicious false political attacks” and that his art is “trickery, deception, and dishonesty”.The conservative pundit and ex-congressman Joe Walsh has revealed on Twitter that he was also duped into an interview with Cohen for the show after being told that Steven Spielberg and Rupert Murdoch also took part.“Dressing up as a wounded veteran is absolutely stolen valor, his tactics are disgusting,” he tweeted. “I totally get @SachaBaronCohen’s gig. He’s a comedian, and he can be funny, but mocking a disabled veteran to spoof @SarahPalinUSA is a serious matter. I am just telling you what I encountered – it was much of the same she experienced.”In a previously released clip, Cohen had Dick Cheney sign a “waterboard kit” while a teaser suggested a variety of characters used in the upcoming series which has been in development for over a year.Who Is America? begins on Showtime in the US and Stan in Australia on Sunday, and on Channel 4 in the UK on Monday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/09299ca7e9a3d56d9c4236cf8129c4ac76feae4b/188_298_2716_1630/master/2716.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8b9b72f21f5bd0def202d520336e0044","title":"lancashire council bans non stunned halal meat from schools","story":"Move is Islamophobic, antisemitic and undemocratic, say Muslim leadersA council has banned meat from animals that have not been stunned from council-supplied school meals, prompting accusations of Islamophobia and antisemitism.Lancashire county council voted on Thursday to stop providing halal meat to council establishments unless animals are stunned before they are slaughtered.Nine out of 10 Muslims who responded were against the move, believing that stunning animals before they are killed is against Islam. The Board of Deputies of British Jews also opposed the proposal, saying that stunning could go wrong and lead to animals drowning, being gassed or electrocuted.The National Secular Society supported the ban. Stephen Evans, its chief executive, welcomed the result of Thursday’s vote, saying: “It’s reassuring to see Lancashire councillors voting to pursue the council’s ethical policy on the provision of halal meat in schools, and facing down orchestrated efforts to ensure school meals in the county comply with a hardline interpretation of Islam.“Under this policy, halal meat will still be supplied to meet the dietary preferences of pupils from Muslim backgrounds, but will be from animals slaughtered humanely, and in accordance with animal welfare standards. This is a compromise that should be acceptable to everyone.”Unstunned halal meat is provided in school meals for some of the 12,000 children in 27 Lancashire schools. This will now stop from September, despite the council admitting there is currently no demand for stunned halal meat from any school in the county. Lancashire Council of Mosques (LCM) described the decision as “undemocratic and hugely discriminatory”. It said it was considering legal action and a boycott of council-operated catering services – a move which the council estimates could cost £285,000 in lost revenue.“What we see is that the people have spoken, they have opposed the proposal and they have still made this decision, which is undemocratic and hugely discriminatory,” said Abdul Hamid Qureshi, LCM’s chief executive.“It could be categorised as Islamophobic, it could be categorised as a racist approach – not only Islamophobic but antisemitic as well … It’s not sensible action but offensive action to me,” he said. He said the decision showed the council was determined to bring in the ban “by hook or by crook”.Qureshi said he was worried that other councils would follow Lancashire’s lead, discriminating against Muslims around the UK.The four-week consultation exercise was carried out after LCM applied for a judicial review of the ban, which the council originally passed last year. Geoff Driver, the leader of Lancashire county council, said the decision was taken on the grounds of animal welfare: “I’m grateful to the many people who have taken the time to respond to the consultation. It has confirmed that people have strong views on this issue from a number of different perspectives, and provides a useful guide as to how people whose children receive halal school meals may respond to the decision which the cabinet has taken. “We accept that a small number of schools may choose to use different suppliers for halal meat. However, we hope that people understand how the council has arrived at this decision, which has been taken solely on the grounds of animal welfare with due consideration for the impacts outlined in the responses to the consultation. “We would like to work with the Lancashire Council of Mosques to ensure that the meals we supply to the affected schools in future provide a range of nutritious options which satisfy students’ dietary requirements and are acceptable to LCM, parents and governors.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/218b59b97f3dd1064e004067433de662cf363e44/315_362_2630_1578/master/2630.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=851fb35062315dc45e464bdce83ff360","title":"beirut baristas put coffee centre stage with a nod to the past","story":"Young Lebanese entrepreneurs put coffee centre stage with a nod to the pastIn the years before Beirut was struck by civil war, the city was known for its vibrant cafe culture that attracted intellectuals from across the Arab world.The tables that spilled out on to the pavements of Hamra Street were a hub for academics, students, writers and artists, who would sip thick Arabic coffee and argue into the night.“It was a magical time,” says Cesar Nammour, 81, who was an art collector in the 1960s and frequented them often. “It was mostly about the companionship. We used to meet there after going to the movies in the evening, to talk and discuss ideas.”Back then, the coffee they drank was almost incidental. But a new generation of baristas is looking to recapture a piece of that past, and this time they are putting coffee centre stage.A wave of speciality cafes have sprung up around the city, catering to young connoisseurs who know their arabica from their robusta.“It came from a personal need to have good coffee here,” says Dalia Jaffal, the 31-year-old co-owner of Kalei coffee, in Mar Mikhael, an arty neighbourhood in east Beirut.“We consume a lot of it, but for us it has never been about the quality of the coffee, it’s always been about the conversation. There’s no reason we can’t have both.”Lebanon consumes more coffee, or kahweh, per person than anywhere else in the Middle East – about 4.8kg per capita each year – according to the International Coffee Organization. In the UK consumption is 2.8kg per person.Most of it in Lebanon comes in the form of Arabic coffee, which is similar to Turkish – small cups of thick, black, sweet liquid boiled on a stove, spiced with cardamom. It is brought out to visiting guests on ornate trays in homes, or more informally in offices and garages. When it is finished, the fine grounds form a substance at the bottom of the cup that is gooey and granular, and which some say can tell your fortune.Lebanon has always been renowned for Arabic-style coffee. Cafe Younes, in Hamra, is a Beirut institution that has been doing business since 1935.While this kind of coffee has a special place in the hearts of most Lebanese, the roasting process involves burning the beans which robs it of some flavour, Jaffal says.“In Arabic coffee, the beans are much darker in colour, which means they were roasted a lot more. It’s like overcooking a meal.”The last major jolt to the old ways of doing things came about 20 years ago with the arrival of Dunkin’ Donuts. Starbucks and Costa soon followed.In recent years, an increasingly internationally mobile generation of young Lebanese have acquired a taste for speciality, high-quality espresso coffee and have been disappointed with the options back home.“I was living abroad and I would come back, spend a couple of weeks here, and just crave the good stuff,” says Jaffal.She went on the road – to London, Rome, and Copenhagen – to learn how to be a barista and to roast beans, and to teach others. Jaffal opened Kalei as a roastery in 2015 in a converted 1950s house, selling single origin beans to restaurants. A year later, it opened its doors to the public. Today, it is a chic, bustling spot populated by young, well-dressed clients tapping away on laptops while Tunisian Sufi jazz plays in the background.Many of the baristas in Beirut’s new breed of high-end coffee shops learned their craft at Kalei’s roastery.Sip, which opened last year, was set up by Omar Jheir, 39, who got a taste for speciality coffee during the 20 years he lived in Australia. He saw a gap in the Beirut market.Wanting to create something that put coffee first, he also wanted to reach back to the glory days of Beirut’s cafe culture. “I’m nostalgic for that traditional Lebanese coffee shop, where people from all kinds of backgrounds come together over a sip of coffee. I want to rebuild that culture.”But for Nammour, born in 1937, that past is long gone.“Today it is different. They go there to meet, and joke, and have fun. In the 60s it was not really about fun, it was about discussing things and making plans. We were political,” he says. “Now our cafes are like cafes all over the world.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2b793215c5c5050fe20f4ad655e3397153345a33/0_227_4596_2758/master/4596.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=11430c1fa2ab79d7b7c40c4cea721cde","title":"indonesian sprinter lalu muhammad zohri wins 100m gold iaaf championships","story":"Country celebrates after Lalu Muhammad Zohri’s victory at under-20 IAAF championshipsIndonesians are celebrating after an athlete from Lombok island who could barely afford running shoes last year beat off the favourites to win the world junior sprint crown.In an unexpected victory, Lalu Muhammad Zohri, 18, was first across the line in the men’s 100m at the IAAF world under-20 championships at Tampere in Finland on Wednesday evening.From lane eight, Zohri took gold in the world junior 100m title in 10.18sec, a personal best and national junior record, defeating Americans Anthony Schwartz and Eric Harrison, who both finished in 10.22sec. His victory, the first time an Indonesian has won any medals at the championships, prompted elation across the country.Congratulatory messages flooded in, with Zohri’s humble roots attracting attention. He is from a small village on the eastern island of Lombok, where he lives in a small house made of wood and woven bamboo. Even affording shoes has been difficult, with his older sister saying Zohri asked her for Rp400,000 (£21) to buy running trainers. Fazilah said her brother, the youngest of four, often trained barefoot. The Indonesian president, Joko Widodo, said Zohri had made the country proud and ordered two cabinet ministers to arrange for his home to be renovated. Both Zohri’s parents are dead but emotional scenes broadcast from his village showed relatives and neighbours crowded around a tablet to watch the race. Amid loud cheers, one viewer bursts into tears, burying her face in her headscarf. In a video posted on Twitter, Zohri thanked the president and his fellow Indonesians for their support and prayers.Earlier this year, Zohri won gold in the 100m at the Asian junior athletics championships in Japan with a time of 10.27sec.He is now preparing for the Asian Games, scheduled to open in Jakarta on 18 August."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/72068972c4666791842a7726c584e3833da923ed/0_549_3417_2050/master/3417.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76081a5be02fa339809487583c135d2e","title":"say cheese why italy wont ratify eu free trade deal with canada","story":"Deputy PM fears piracy of protected foods such as Parmigiano Reggiano Italy will not ratify the European Union’s free trade agreement with Canada, Deputy Prime Minister Luigi Di Maio said on Friday, potentially scuppering the EU’s biggest accord in years. “Soon CETA (the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement) will arrive in parliament and this majority will reject it and it will not ratify it,” Di Maio said at a farmers’ association gathering in Rome. “If so much as one Italian official ... continues to defend treaties like CETA, they will be removed,” added Di Maio, who leads the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which governs with the right-wing League. The CETA accord, the first major trade deal the European Union has signed since an agreement with South Korea was ratified in 2015, needs to be approved by all 28 EU member states to take full effect. The 5-Star League government, which took office on June 1, has pledged to take a hard line to defend Italian speciality foods. Agriculture minister Gian Marco Centinaio, from the League, attacked CETA in a newspaper interview last month.Of the 28 European Union countries, Italy has the most food products with PDO (Protected Designation of Origin) and PGI (Protected Geographical Indication) labels. These include Parmigiano Reggiano cheese and Prosciutto di Parma ham. Under CETA, Canada has recognised more than 40 Italian PDO and PGI labels out of a total of 292 for the food-obsessed country.The CETA treaty entered into force on a provisional basis in September 2017, sweeping away tariffs on a large number of goods and widening access to Canadian beef in Europe and EU cheese and wine in Canada. Some farm associations and critics in European states have expressed concerns about the threat of rapidly rising pork and beef imports from Canada.Coldiretti, the association of Italian agricultural companies Di Maio was addressing, has called CETA “wrong and risky” for Italy. It says Italian food exports, equal to €41bn last year, could triple with a serious fight against international food counterfeiting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ddeb04e2f2fcf4666287365ff9909b40bd8b31c1/64_217_3412_2047/master/3412.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b50fb0a82c5ef67d6a4dae696be23bb","title":"wakaliwood inside ugandas action movie studio","story":"When the trailer for Who Killed Captain Alex? went viral on YouTube, film-maker Isaac Nabwana’s mobile phone starting ringing with calls from around the world. One inidual went further. After seeing 40 seconds of the promo for Uganda’s first action movie, American Alan Hofmanis gave up his life in Manhattan to move to Wakaliga, Kampala, to help Nabwana, aka IGG, develop Ramon film studio – and Wakaliwood was born.The Ramon Film Studio, has produced more than 40 movies. Who Killed Captain Alex was produced in 2010 for just $200, while 2016’s Operation Kakongoliro! The Ugandan Expendables cost $2,000, the studio’s biggest production budget to date. To attract more viewers and break new ground, Nabwana wanted a female lead for Who Killed Captain Alex?Dozens of people work on Nabwana’s films, taking on all roles both in front and behind the camera: acting, doing stunts, designing props and costumes, technician duties and stage management. From the machinery to accessories and costumes, everything is homemade. Many of the actors live in the rehearsal rooms where costumes are kept.With little hope of pay for the moment, Wakaliwood members have side jobs. In a country where film piracy is common, Wakaliwood movies are mainly sold door-to-door and as quickly as possible, before pirated copies make it on to the market.That a film studio is able to flourish in a place where cinema has little history may surprise some. Yet, Wakaliwood has emerged despite what from the outside may appear to insurmountable obstacles.Wakaliwood is also lending credence to a Ugandan pop culture that some observers have linked to Quentin Tarantino for convenience. But it can only be understood by going beyond the violence that flows through the stories, the litres of food colouring that stains the fallen, and the archaic and mischievous special effects.For the bloody special effects, condoms are filled with food colouring and tied with a plastic ribbon around the chest of a stuntman. A metal ring is glued to the condom and fishing wire is attached to it, to be pulled by an assistant at the appropriate time. Cow blood was used in the past but some of crew members became ill after accidentally swallowed it.In a Wakaliwood movie, there are always tens of gangsters, hoodlums or bad guys whose main job is to be killed by the good guys. To attain the high body count, the bad guys wear balaclavas, or caps, or beards. This allows crew members to play numerous baddies destined for a bloody end.The film-maker’s half-brother Robert Kizito discovered kung fu 30 years ago through Bruce Lee’s films. Mimicking them to his brother, Kizito was bitten by the martial arts bug while inspiring Nabwana towards a love for the films. He scoured central market of Kampala for Chinese martial arts magazines to dissect the positions from the diagrams inside their pages. A kung fu master, Kizito and his followers where filmed by his brother for Wakaliwood’s first ever action scenes.Nabwana was child during the bloody rule of Idi Amin. The film-maker recalls the swollen corpses in a dumping ground near his home and the soldiers drumming at the doors of the houses, shouting: “Fungua mlango, panda gari” (“Open the door, get in the truck” in Swahili) Mixing memory and his love Bruce Lee films, Nabwana has emerged as unique film-maker.Eaten Alive is a movie inspired by a cannibalism case that happened a few years ago in western Uganda.Wakaliwood has captured the imagination of a nation, from the drivers of boda boda, (motorbike or bicycle taxi) to President Yoweri Museveni who did not hesitate to incorporate support for the industry as a campaign promise, during the 2016 presidential election.A VJ adds extra colour to a movie with their jokes, gamut of expressions,tone, rhythm, the turn of phrase and extra dialogue. Emmie is part of the Wakaliwood family. He comments on every movie and his commentary is part of the movie. Nabwana said he cannot shoot a movie without considering Emmie’s commentary. Audiences pay 500 Ugandan shillings (20p) a ticket for a US blockbuster and 1,000 shillings (42p) for a Wakaliga movie.I have been going to Wakaliwood for years, but I have not managed to unravel the mystery of Nabwana’s trajectory. It is the defiance of the impossible, like the life-size Bell Huey helicopter by the props crew in the yard of his family compound. Visitors describe him as a pop-culture prophet preaching from his slum the good word of cinema, communicating a certain idea of his country rather than basking the sun of international film festivals.All photography by Frédéric Noy."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3563795.1531474454!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new dublin water restrictions to be outlined today","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Maureen and Larry McDonnell (and Shadow the cat) of Dodder View cottages collect water from the Dodder River to keep their floral display fresh during the drought.

Highest temperatures will be between 23 and 25 degrees with cooler conditions in Atlantic coastal areas.Ms Gannon said even if there was two weeks of heavy rainfall it would be soaked up by the parched ground immediately and would not see water sources replenished.“We need to get the soilmoisture deficit to over 10ml to get water levels to begin to rise,” she said.Ms Gannon said there was a base amount of water that is used over a 24-hour period of time. Some of it is usage and some of it is leakage, reducing water pressure overnight helps to reduce both.She said the utility has contacted its top 20 commercial users to determine their commitment to reduce water consumption. Irish Water also has a register of sensitive customers and asked that if anyone is concerned about their supply to get in touch.If anyone suffers a cut in supply, they are also asked to contact the utility.Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy told the Dáil on Thursday water levels were at an all-time low in some parts of the country.He said of the 1,000 water supply systems controlled by Irish Water, nine schemes are currently experiencing severe drought, 51 are in drought condition and a further 77 in potential drought conditions."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3563936.1531487723!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"water restrictions nationwide the full list of areas affected","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHorses in the water on Rusheen beach during sunny weather in Co Galway.

Photograph: Getty ImagesA law curtailing the use of Electro-Convulsive Therapy (ECT) on involuntary mental health patients did not result in fewer people receiving the treatment.A total of 263 people underwent one or more courses of ECT during 2016, a slight increase on the 242 who received it in 2015, according to the figures.At the start of 2016 legislation was introduced stating ECT treatment can only be administrated to an involuntary patient without consent if the patient is unable to give their consent.The law essentially narrowed the number of situations in which the treatment could be administered in the absence of consent.Previously it could be carried out on an involuntary patient if they were merely unwilling to consent. Now it has to be shown they do not have the mental capacity to consent. The slight rise in treatments suggests few if any patients capable of consenting were refusing treatment before the law change.The Mental Health Commission (MHC) which monitors ECT usage noted the law change “has not led to any fall in the administration of ECT.”Of those who received ECT in 2016, 79 per cent received one programme (consisting of twelve treatments), 16 per cent received two programmes and five per cent received five or more. A total of 2,558 inidual treatments were administered.Eighty per cent of people who underwent ECT were voluntary in-patients when they started their treatments.Patients showed improvement in their conditions in 93 per cent of cases. The treatment was mostly used to treat severe depressive disorders which had shown a resistance to medication.The use of ECT has become rare in recent decades and its administration is highly regulated.It involves an electric current being passed briefly through the brain via electrodes applied to the scalp to induce generalised seizure activity. The person receiving treatment is placed under general anaesthetic and muscle relaxants are given to prevent body spasms. Of the in-patient mental health facilities in Ireland, only 23 per cent provide ECT. Another eight per cent refer residents to other centres for the treatment.Two thirds of ECT patients were female. They had an average age of 59 although patients as young as 18 and as old as 93 received it.Those with depression made up 74 per cent of patients followed by schizophrenia (12 per cent) and mania (eight per cent).Other diagnoses included neuroses, personality and behavioural disorders and organic disorders."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3563295.1531429659!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"israel s defence minister calls for closure of dublin embassy","story":"There was a standing ovation in the Seanad as the upper house voted in support of a Bill banning the importation to Ireland of Israeli goods produced in Palestine.

Ireland’s Ambassador to Israel, Alison Kelly, was yesterday summoned to the country’s foreign ministry to be told of its displeasure over the progress of the Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill 2018. Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon said, “The Irish Senate has lent a hand to a populist, dangerous and extreme anti-Israel boycott initiative, effectively undermining the dialogue between Israel and the Palestinians. “The boycott will affect the livelihood of many Palestinians who work in Israeli industrial zones, and they will be hurt by this initiative,” he added. “It will only cause damage to the diplomatic process in the Middle East.” However, defence minister Avigdor Lieberman said greater retaliation than inviting the Ambassador in “for a reprimand” was needed. “With Israel haters there is nothing to debate. Israel should immediately close the embassy in Dublin. We will not turn the other cheek to those who boycott us,” Mr Lieberman said.The Bill, proposed by Independent Senator Frances Black, would make it an offence to purchase goods and services from Israeli settlements which have been condemned by Ireland and the EU as illegal.It passed its first vote in the Seanad on Wednesday with the support of Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin, Labour and Independent Senators. It must pass through the Dáil before becoming law but if backed again by the same coalition of parties and Independents, it would have sufficient support.Ms Kelly had already been summoned to the foreign ministry twice this year. In January, when the Bill was first submitted, she told the Israelis that the legislation was not motivated by the BDS (Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions) movement. She was also summoned to the foreign ministry in April to be reprimanded over then lord mayor of Dublin Mícheál Mac Donncha’s participation in a symposium held in the West Bank city of Ramallah, and over two anti-Israel resolutions passed by Dublin City Council. Speaking yesterday, Ms Kelly said: “One of the points I always make to the Israelis is that I represent the Government and the Government opposed the Bill in January and it opposed it today.” She said he also raised other issues of concern for Ireland, such as the situation in Gaza and Israeli home demolitions in the West Bank.Senior Palestine Liberation Organisation official Saeb Erekat welcomed the vote. “This courageous step builds on the historic ties between Ireland and Palestine, as well as it shows the way forward for the rest of the European Union. ” Members of the Knesset, Israel’s parliament, from the predominantly Arab Joint List party also praised the development. “The settlements are a war crime and must be treated as such,” they said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3562944.1531409021!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"us midterm elections the stakes are high in swing state nevada","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Trump Tower Hotel \u0026 Casino, on the Las Vegas Strip. Photograph: Carmen Martínez TorrónGetty ImagesLeaving behind the hot desert landscape of Arizona and driving northwest towards Nevada, signs for the Hoover Dam begin to appear. The phenomenal feat of engineering, completed in 1935, was designed to control the flow of the Colorado river and supply electricity and water to the vast arid lands of the southwest of the United States.More than 80 years later, it acts as a man-made border between the neighbouring states of Arizona and Nevada.Just beyond the great concrete dam, deep in the valley, lies Las Vegas. Its distinctive skyline and glistening lights can be seen for kilometres. The city has drawn visitors for generations. While its liberal marriage and gambling laws continue to attract millions of tourists, it has also developed as an important commercial and residential city, growing rapidly over the past two decades.Nestled in the southern tip of Nevada, Las Vegas and the surrounding Clark County is by far the biggest urban centre in the state. About three-quarters of Nevada’s three million residents live in Clark County. The rest of the population mainly live in Reno and the nearby Carson City in the north, with the remainder scattered around the vast, mostly public, land that makes up the remainder of the US’s seventh-largest state.Las Vegas has had its fair share of problems. Eight months ago a gunman opened fire from the Mandalay Bay Hotel on its famous strip, killing 58 concert-goers and wounding hundreds more.The city, and Nevada generally, were among the worst-hit areas by the 2008 recession. Unemployment reached more than 13 per cent – the highest in the country in 2010 – while foreclosures hit the greater Las Vegas region hard, prompting a real-estate collapse.Today Nevada finds itself in the news for other reasons. The state, which borders California to its west and Utah to its east, is set to be one of the most closely watched states in the US this November, as voters go to the polls in the midterm elections.At state level, Nevadans are due to elect a new governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and representatives for its state legislature. Additionally, voters will decide which six representatives it will send to Washington. But it is the state’s Senate race that is particularly significant.Incumbent senator, Republican Dean Heller, faces one of the toughest races in the country he is one of the few Republican senators running in a state that Hillary Clinton won in 2016. Heller has struggled with the new Donald Trump brand of Republicanism.Mindful of the need to keep moderate voters in his state on board, he has publicly clashed with the president on several issues, although in Washington he has stayed onside with Trump in most Senate votes – a record his Democratic rivals are keen to highlight.Democrats believe the Senate race is theirs to win, with Jacky Rosen, a first-time Congresswoman and middle-ground politician, contesting the Senate election.Nevada has emerged as an important swing state in recent elections. Though it has not had a Democratic governor for almost 20 years, it narrowly voted for Clinton in 2016 and is increasingly leaning Democrat, not least because of its growing Latino population.The final presidential debate of the 2016 election between Clinton and Trump was held in Las Vegas, less than three weeks before the election – a sign of the crucial importance the state played in the national race.Now, 18 months later, both parties have Nevada in their sights again. Donald Trump flew to Las Vegas last week in an attempt to rally support for Heller at the Republican state national convention.While the president had threatened to back rival Danny Tarkanian as the Republican nominee because of his frustrations with Heller, he backed off in March, helping to persuade Tarkanian to run for the House of Representatives instead and leaving the Senate race wide open for the embattled incumbent.Trump may have put his past differences with Heller behind him, Republican Party activists are worried about Heller’s chances. In a fiery speech in Las Vegas last month, the president said he would be back in Nevada to campaign for Heller before November’s election, unveiling a new nickname for Heller’s Democratic opponent: Wacky Jacky.Democrats are also pouring money and resources into the state, sensing that 2018 could be their opportunity to turn this purple state a permanent blue.Part of this effort is an extensive grassroots campaign to get the vote out in November. Manuel Ayala works with NextGen, a nationwide organisation that aims to increase youth political engagement and ensure all those who are entitled to vote do so.On a stifling midweek afternoon, he and his colleague Danielle Fitzgerald are stationed outside a supermarket in suburban Vegas. Clipboards in hand, their aim is to sign people up to the electoral register.As they politely approach shoppers in this middle-class suburb a few kilometres west of the Las Vegas strip, the results are mixed. One woman says she has no time to talk another rants about Donald Trump as he waits for his wife.After a few failed attempts, Ayala successfully engages a young man called Isaac in conversation. Although he is already on the register, he agrees to sign up to NextGen’s email list. In addition to the official federal voting form, NextGen also offers a “pledge to vote” card, working to build a network of youth voters with whom it will continue to engage right up to the election.NextGen is one of a number of organisations around the country that is focusing on the youth vote ahead of November’s elections.It was established in 2013, and initially focused on climate-change issues, but it decided to broaden its remit after the 2016 election. Tyson Megown, state youth director for NexGen Nevada, believes 2016 prompted a new wave of political engagement.“Hands down, there has been a shift since 2016. Turnouts in the primaries in this state this month was double what it was the last time. For a primary election, that’s unheard of – most folk don’t wake up until the general election. But this time, people were coming out in droves,” he says.NextGen has identified 11 states where it believes progressives may make inroads – including Nevada. The state has a particular problem with youth turnout. According to a 2014 poll by Tufts University, just 17 per cent of 18- to 24-year-olds turned out to vote in the last midterm elections in 2014.Megown says it is not just about registering people to vote – it’s about maintaining that political engagement. “It’s always been a struggle to get young people engaged. There are a lot of moving pieces involved in turning someone into an informed voter and a regular voter. We begin at high-school age, as soon as they are eligible to vote, and build relationships, talking to them about the issues they care about.”While some of the issues affecting young voters remain the same – the cost of college tuition and healthcare, for example – there are also issues particular to Nevada.Tia Yap, regional organisational director for NextGen, says that gun control is high on the agenda for voters in the wake of the mass shooting last October. “It is definitely something that is coming up with voters. Regardless of their political affiliation, most people want action from the state and federal government on gun legislation,” she says.Although Las Vegas did not see the same level of young voter engagement that swept the country after the Parkland shooting in Florida in February – perhaps in part because the Florida shooting took place within a school setting – there was a knock-on effect after Parkland, with protests also taking place in Nevada.In the medium term, NextGen is hoping to target 250,000 voters in the state in the run-up to November through a combination of grass-roots campaigning in the community and on college campuses, digital advertising and direct mail.Ultimately, Megown believes it will pay off, and that 2018 could be a turning-vote for America’s youth voice. “In the short term I think you’re going to see record turnout in 2018. I think across the board you are going to see a more progressive slate of candidates who will start to hold elected office, a more erse set of candidates – both racial and gender,” he says.But he also believes that people are going to stay this fired-up in the long term. “Once they learn the process, learn the power and the impact they have in their democracy, that doesn’t go away. We’re not only encouraging them to participate in our democracy, we want them running for office,” he says, predicting that some of those he is working for now, he will be working for in 10 years when they run for elected office.“That’s incredibly exciting. We help light that spark, we fan the flame, and we see where it takes them.”Tomorrow: Suzanne Lynch reports from Carson City and Reno on the midterm elections campaign in Nevada"},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"digitalservices@telegraphHead of Digital Publishingdigitalservices@telegraphMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

Then it climbed again to continue to its destination, an incident that fuelled the concerns of safety experts.Chinese airlines have a good safety record in general, but passengers have, on occasion, accused pilots of smoking during flights. Few such incidents have been confirmed, however.In the preliminary investigation, the co-pilot was found to be smoking an e-cigarette, state-owned China News said, citing a news conference by the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) investigating Tuesday\u0027s incident.Smoke diffused into the passenger cabin and relevant air conditioning components were wrongly shut off, without notifying the captain, which resulted in insufficient oxygen, it quoted Qiao Yibin, an official of the regulator\u0027s aviation safety office, as saying.China News added that the co-pilot had shut off the air conditioning units.Qiao said the shut-off triggered an alarm, prompting the crew to peform an emergency pressure relief procedure, which then released the cabin\u0027s oxygen masks.The crew realised the problem after the descent and restored the air conditioning, allowing cabin pressure to return to normal, he added.The CAAC said it was continuing the investigation and was analysing the aircraft\u0027s flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder.Air China did not immediately respond to requests for comment. It vowed a zero tolerance approach towards wrongdoing by any crew, on its official account on China\u0027s Twitter-like Weibo on Wednesday.The incident featured heavily on Chinese social media on Friday, with some commentators demanding harsh punishment and revocation of the pilot\u0027s flight license.China\u0027s aviation regulations, which bar flight crew from smoking on all phases of operation, also banned passengers from using e-cigarettes on flights in 2006.Users of online airline forums have occasionally accused pilots of smoking during flights, however.In 2015, government-run China National Radio said four passengers on an Air China flight from Hong Kong to Beijing smelt strong smoke emitted from the cabin.In 2016, the United States prohibited the use of e-cigarettes on commercial flights.Please review our commenting policyDonald Trump UK visit: President claims he never criticised PM in \u0026#39fake news\u0026#39 article despite tearing into May\u0026#39s Chequers deal - live updatesFriday the 13th: How cyclones, asteroids and a Buckingham Palace bombing have fed the superstitionSeven endangered black rhinos die in Kenya in botched relocation attempted\u0026#39Trump Baby\u0026#39 blimp flies outside Parliament as protesters march through London Flooding fears as huge iceberg drifts close to Greenland village Small carrots expected to hit shelves after weather conditions shrink cropMelania Trump plays bowls in stilettos with Theresa May\u0026#39s husbandRichard Bacon \u0026#39in induced coma\u0026#39 suffering from respiratory conditionCanadian woman threatens to sue her nephew over shared lottery winDonald Trump UK visit: Everything you need to know about his schedule and itineraryTwo NASA launch towers demolished in Cape Canaveral, FloridaTheresa May\u0026#39s Love Actually moment: How the PM putting Donald Trump in his place might lookLeeds school uses spoons to help prevent forced marriage during summer holidays  Sadiq Khan defends Trump baby blimp as he suggests the president has singled him out over terrorism Why Friday the 13th creates peculiar bargains – and how to take advantageJohnson \u0026amp Johnson ordered to pay $4.7bn to 22 women over talc products linked to ovarian cancerDonald Trump and Theresa May briefly hold hands as she welcomes him to Blenheim PalaceWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/06/11/istock-487022313.jpg","title":"breastfeeding united nations us sanctions ecuador russia","story":"Created with Sketch.The US backed\u0026nbspthe resolution after Russia said it would\u0026nbspClick to followThe Independent OnlineThe US blocked a resolution at a UN world health meeting that would have protected breastfeedingDonald Trump’s administration has threatened Ecuador with trade sanctions if it\u0026nbspintroduces a United Nations resolution to encourage breastfeeding.The US had supposedly asked for language asking governments to “protect, promote, and support breastfeeding” to be removed.

Sir Simon Burns, a former transport minister, spoke on what he called a “controversial subject” in a debate in making Westminster more family-friendlyA Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) spokesperson, who also asked to remain anonymous, said:\u0026nbsp“The resolution as originally drafted placed unnecessary hurdles for mothers seeking to provide nutrition to their children. We recognise not all women are able to breastfeed for a variety of reasons. These women should have the choice and access to alternatives for the health of their babies, and not be stigmatized for the ways in which they are able to do so. HHS was not involved in the diplomatic negotiations.\u0026nbspThe move follows a trend of the Trump administration to play into considerations of private industry and eschew cooperation in multilateral organisations and treaties like the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), the global UN Paris Agreement on climate change, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato), and various trade agreements.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The problems are occurring across the world, according to the site Down Detector. While they are concentrated in Europe, it is likely that is the result of timezones that mean most active users are online there.The outage comes just a day after a new update to the Android version of the Facebook app appeared to break it and stop people getting online.Facebook Messenger also received a major update at the same time, but it is not clear that the outage is at all connected to that new software. But the issues did appear to be primarily affecting those using Messenger on Android phones.The site\u0027s platform status page – which is supposed to report any issues for developers – did not show any problems.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

With an estimated worth of $1bn, a trade body and a recognised marketing award, they have finally been tamedClick to followThe Independent OnlinePep talk: Kendall Jenner’s Pepsi advert was pulled shortly after it aired for appearing to trivialise demonstrations tackling social causesLast month, the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity –\u0026nbspthe biggest grouping of advertising and marketing people you could ever hope to avoid –\u0026nbspintroduced a new award: the Social and Influencer\u0026nbspcategory.Yes, those\u0026nbspgurning thumb-flexers forever punching #YOLO, #instacool and #nofilter into their smartphones as they plug products have come of age.\u0026nbspInfluencer-dom is now a fully-fledged industry. Yet only a year or two ago we were told by many (rather gleefully in some cases) that the influencer was dead or at least in crisis.Earlier this year, this seemed to be confirmed as the owner of the White Moose Cafe in Dublin turned the tables on\u0026nbsp22-year-old YouTube vlogger and influencer Elle Darby, by exposing her demand for five free hotel nights in return for exposure.His public burn spoke for many: “If I let you stay here in return for a feature in a video, who is going to pay the staff who look after you?” The twitter-mob turned on influencers. Who were they? How do they get away with it? Do they actually earn money?When the influencer marketing industry began (around 2008-10, attest the form’s historians) the notion took hold that like celebrity endorsement before it, aspirational people could become marketing tools, accessing the consumer mind as if a recommendation from a friend.YouTuber with 139,095 subscribers, was refused a free hotel stay (YouTubeElle Darby)As one observer put it:\u0026nbsp“They emerged almost overnight and in 10 years have gone from a small network to a worldwide community.” Some sources suggest that there is now a baseline of 1.1 million influencers worldwide.\u0026nbspMediakix estimated\u0026nbspthe industry was worth more than $1bn\u0026nbsp(£750m)\u0026nbspin 2017. Malcolm Gladwell’s coinage, “the tipping point”, was used a lot in meetings.\u0026nbspBy about 2014, a baffled world had started to understand influencer marketing, but the industry’s breakthrough year was probably 2016 when, as Hamda Issa-Salwe of Bravado, part of Universal Music Group, found when she did a research thesis called Investigating the Use of Influencer Marketing on Social Media.“It began to soar,” she says. “Google classified ‘influencer’ as a breakout keyword with a 5,000 per cent month by month increase in the number of times the search term ‘influencer marketing’ was typed.”Also in 2016, it was established that Kendall Jenner was paid an estimated $300,000 per social media post. Advertising agencies took more careful notice of influencers and Instagram –\u0026nbspfounded in 2010 – became the key station of the social media cross, along with other key platforms\u0026nbspsuch as YouTube, Snapchat and Pinterest.Even the fustiest legacy-media type can now see the point. The barrier to entry is low. All you need is a smartphone and a certain brio. And the research seems to add up. According to Nielsen, 84 per cent\u0026nbspof consumers trust opinions from people they know, while 70 per cent\u0026nbsptake action based on other consumer’s opinions online.vlogger Zoella reportedly has a net worth of £2.5m (InstagramZoella)The Association of National Advertisers found that 75 per cent\u0026nbspof members already work with influencers, and the growing industry will take 20 per cent\u0026nbspof the total global marketing budget by 2023.No wonder that 82 per cent\u0026nbspof millennials hope to become influencers at least, according to a survey by London-based dating app CLiKD.\u0026nbspSo the money’s talking, and influencers can do well.It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rentAs Anthony Svirskis, CEO\u0026nbspof TRIBE and a juror on the\u0026nbspSocial and Influencer award says:\u0026nbsp“On a post by post basis, brands should expect to pay £50 for someone with 3,000 followers and upwards of £300 if someone has more than 100,000 followers.” Small wonder the market is seething with aspirant influencers.\u0026nbspYet influencers are still derided as being without any particular skills: even that they’re the apotheosis of the entitled “Me” generation, spreading paid-for blandishments in vocal-fry vlogs on YouTube.While it’s hard to blame someone who travels the world in return for Instagram snaps, is there an influencer bubble waiting to burst? Paul Dyer, of marketing company Lippe Taylor, believes it will, as trust has disappeared from the sector in the sceptical Facebook-Cambridge Analytica era.“There is tremendous value in influencer marketing,” he said recently. “However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls out.”Indeed, there have been several influencer #epicfails, perhaps the most notable being\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspFestival, the ill-fated 2017 Bahamas musical festival that paid Kendall Jenner and Bella\u0026nbspHadid\u0026nbspto drum up support.\u0026nbspFyre\u0026nbspbombed and the repercussions are ongoing.There’s also an undergrowth of freebie-hunting influencers harassing hotels and providers. Some hotels – the\u0026nbspDusit\u0026nbspThani\u0026nbspresort in the Males among them – now use weeding out processes. “When they work hotels love them,” says one travel PR.\u0026nbspThe influencer economy … is a market irrationality. Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money“Influencers are uncritical and often share films and photographs that would otherwise be paid for. But there’s a trust problem.”There are other cracks in the influencer edifice as brands begin to ask questions about the business efficacy of influencers. As publicist Mark Borkowski says:\u0026nbsp“More brands are beginning to realise that influencer activity doesn’t necessarily drive ROI.”And the pain is on both sides, he adds. “It seems a great life but you don’t want to be that person with a fridgeful of isotonic drinks and unable to pay the rent.” Anti-influencers are coming of the woodwork –\u0026nbspand they’re not all crusty oldies with a grudge.“The influencer economy … is a market irrationality,” wrote Sam Biddle of Gawker in 2016. “Companies are self-correcting in the face of so much wasted money.” As for bots and fake followers, that’s a real problem.Fyre Festival attendees locked in airport ‘for their own safety’At Cannes, Unilever’s chief marketing officer Keith Weed called for industry action to clean out the influencer stable, and vowed never to use influencers found to be buying followers.So the sands are shifting. Hamda Issa-Salwe says that while influencer activity remains hard to define and audit, it’s still growing. Although trust and authenticity (the great influencer bon mot) are major factors, brands still spend a lot on influencers: after all,\u0026nbspInstagram has more 800 million monthly active users.And the influencers themselves are fighting back. It’s a new industry: of course legacy dinosaurs wouldn’t get it. It’s just another marketing tool. And what are –\u0026nbspsorry, were –\u0026nbspnewspapers half the time, but a vehicle of paid-for information?“Indeed, there’s a growing distrust of traditional media advertising,” says Harry Hugo, cofounder at The Goat Agency, Europe’s leading influencer agency, which claims to be growing at a rate of 600 per cent\u0026nbspa year.“Just look at the rise in ad blockers, investigations into media transparency and big networks like WPP struggling. Influencers can be one of the most trusted, and therefore highest converting, information sources for people.”\u0026nbspAlso, we jeremiahs just don’t get the craft and graft that goes into an influencer’s brand persona, adds Florencia Lujani, influencer marketing manager at agency We Are Social London.“People struggle to see why brands would pay money to partner with influencers for something which appears relatively simple,” she says. “But it takes time and effort, talent, passion and commitment.”\u0026nbspAnd even the thorny issue of disclosure –\u0026nbspthat is, whether you should know what someone is being paid to promote –\u0026nbspis a smaller issue than is often supposed, says Svirskis. “Influencers are very compliant of requirements to disclose and are often represented by an influencer agency.”There is tremendous value in influencer marketing. However, many current practices are only speeding us to the precipice where the bottom falls outMost importantly of all, influencers make money for clients. Currently, the average ROI of influencer marketing is £7 back for every £1 spent, says Amelia Neate of Influencer Champions.\u0026nbspSo,\u0026nbspdo you have to be pretty? “It’s definitely not reserved for those with looks,” says Svirskis. “The cheesy smiles are long gone.” It’s about style and tone, he says, and as the industry matures it’s moving beyond lifestyle products like travel, beauty and fashion to finance, automotive –\u0026nbspeven dog food.“There are new influencers emerging every day, in every single vertical,” says Lujani. They’re marshalling themselves into communities: mummy bloggers, healthy eaters, sports fans – why, possibly even news organisations.\u0026nbspWith the maturation of the influencer world comes a shakeout: Influencer 2.0, if you will. Sheer numbers don’t matter so much anymore.\u0026nbspThe smart talk is now about engagement and micro-influencers,\u0026nbspthose with fewer than 100,000 followers and possibly as low as 5,000, but with proper peer recognition.\u0026nbspYouTuber Alfie Deyes came under fire for his recent video, ‘How I lived off £1 for a day’ (YouTubePointlessBlogVlogs)“Data shows that influence by measure of engagement actually increases as the audience size reduces,” says Svirskis. In a hedge-betting strategy, brands now prefer to work with 50 micro-influencers rather than one mega-influencer, and brands are taking influencer management in-house as influencer marketing moves into the mainstream.If children are obese then blame food manufacturers, not ZoellaInvestigation promised into Trump campaign data firmThree arrested after Facebook group raid cannabis field – only to Sexist men who abuse women on Facebook and Twitter are compensating“Most new industries go through periods of turbulence as they form foundations,” says Svirskis, who thinks that many of today’s influencers will become tomorrow’s creative directors and entrepreneurs.He has a point. Beauty influencer Emily Weiss now has a cosmetic company, Glossier, and within the last couple of weeks M\u0026ampC Saatchi bought a stake in two influencer agencies. There’s even a new trade body, the Influencer Marketing Association.Circle the wagons and don’t be a #filterfaker\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspthe wild influencer west is being tamed.Cannes Lions International Festival of CreativityEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Of these, 1,014 were born in Jamaica, 207 in Barbados, 93 in India, 88 in Grenada, 85 in Trinidad and Tobago and 638 were from other countries.Some 584 people have so far been granted citizenship through the Windrush scheme.The department is only in touch with 14 people who were wrongly deported, and no details have been given about their nationalities or whether any of them had been allowed to return to the UK. Contact has not been made with the majority of those wrongly deported or removed, the Home Office has said.\u0026nbspLabour MP Yvette Cooper, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said she was disappointed there was still no clarity about the number of people wrongly detained, and that the Home Office had “still not managed to make contact with the majority of those who were wrongfully deported or removed”.“The committee is awaiting more information from the Home Office, which is expected by the end of this week, and will be asking further questions to follow up the information in the Home Secretary’s letter,” she said.Mr Javid said officials were also reviewing cases where the Home Office has ordered other departments to deny or revoke services, or taken action to penalise a third party for employing or housing an unlawful migrant.A final figure of those affected will not be available until the review is complete, he said.\u0026nbspThe news comes after a damning report by the Home Affairs Select Committee said unless the Home Office was overhauled, the scandal “will happen again, for another group of people”.The committee expressed concern for the children of EU citizens, saying the government should ensure they are not “locked out of living a lawful life, as we have seen happen to members of the Windrush generation”.The MPs also said recent attempts by the government to rebrand its “hostile environment” policy the “compliant environment”, were “meaningless”.A Home Office spokesperson said: “It is not acceptable that people of the Windrush generation have been negatively impacted by these measures. That is why we have put in place additional safeguards and put a temporary pause in the proactive sharing of Home Office data with other organisations, including banks and building societies, for the purpose of controlling access to services.\u0026nbsp“Data on people over 30 have been excluded from sharing to make absolutely sure that members of the Windrush generation are not inadvertently affected.

Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspand\u0026nbspMr Afwerki then travelled across the capital in a large motorcade as people wearing T-shirts with photos of the two leaders cheered. The leaders later met one-on-one, with a smiling Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspleaning towards\u0026nbspMr Afwerki under a wall hung with their portraits.The visit comes a month after Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspsurprised people by fully accepting a peace deal that ended a two-year border war between the two countries. Ethiopia and Eritrea have not had diplomatic ties since the war began in 1998, with Mr Ahmed\u0026nbsphimself fighting in a town that remains contested today, and the countries have skirmished since then in one of Africa’s longest-running conflicts.Mr Ahmed’s chief of staff, Fitsum Arega, said on Twitter that the visit aims to “further deepen efforts to bring about lasting peace.” He shared photos of the leaders’ meeting and said Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspwas “very warmly received” by Mr Afwerki.“Our two nations share a history and bond like no other,” he said. “We can now overcome two decades of mistrust and move in a new direction.”Ethiopia’s foreign ministry called the visit “part of efforts to normalise relations with Eritrea” and said Mr Ahmed\u0026nbspwas expected to talk with Eritrea’s leadership about “how to mend fences”.One Eritrean diplomat, its ambassador to Japan Estifanos Afeworki, said on Twitter that “no leader has received such a warm welcome like today in Asmara in the history of Eritrea”.Ethiopians expressed welcome shock at the meeting, which was shown live by Ethiopia’s state TV.“Historic ... the beginning of the end. The glass ceiling has been broken,” one resident, Shewit Wudassie, wrote on Facebook. Another Facebook user, Djphat Su, wrote: “Am I dreaming or what?”The decision to fully accept the peace deal was the biggest and most surprising reform yet announced by Ethiopia’s 42-year-old prime minister, who took office in April and quickly set off a wave of reforms, freeing journalists and opposition figures from prison, opening up the state-run economy and unblocking hundreds of websites after years of anti-government protests demanding more freedoms.World news in picturesUS President Donald Trump and Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg attend a bilateral breakfast ahead of the NATO Summit in BrusselsThe last four Thai Navy SEALs come out safely after completing the rescue mission inside a cave where 12 boys and their soccer coach have been trapped since June 23, in Mae Sai, Chiang Rai province, northern Thailand.

Frontex runs an operation off the coast of Italy that works closely with the local coast guard.The EU missions have helped rescue thousands of refugees\u0026nbspat sea, all of whom were disembarked in Italy. Spokespeople at Frontex and Sophia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Italy has so far refused to take back any migrants stopped at the German border.“Before receiving even one asylum seeker from another European country, we want to see a precise commitment – giving the timetable, costs, means, men and resources –\u0026nbspon how the EU plans to help us defend our external borders,” Mr Salvini said last week.Aid groups and United Nations’ agencies on Friday asked Italy open its ports to rescue ships because the policy could have a high human cost. More migrants could die at sea, or they could be trapped indefinitely in inhumane detention centres, they said.On Sunday, Mr Salvini said the previous government had agreed to welcome migrants rescued by ships participating in the EU sea missions.Mr Salvini said: “With our government, the music has changed and will change”.This comes after a rescue boat carrying 60 refugees arrived in Barcelona last week after being turned away by Italy and Malta.The mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, came to the ship’s rescue when she, with permission from the Spanish government, told the crew of the vessel that it could dock.\u0026nbspThe boat, which was said to have had five women, a nine-year-old and four teenagers on board, was turned away by Mr Salvini.He said the rescue boat “can forget about arriving in an Italian port” and then suggested the boat should dock in Malta which he claimed was the nearest port.Additional reporting by ReutersEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Legendary rapper Tupac Shakur died on Friday, September 13, 1996, six days after being shot in a Las Vegas drive-by.It was one of hip-hops biggest tragedies but the murder remains unsolved, leading to hundreds of different conspiracy theories, including arguments that the music producer isn’t actually dead.2. On Friday 13, 1976, a man was killed when the roof of his flat caved in.Spookily, Daz Pearson had chosen to stay home because he had a bad feeling something was going to happen to him.3. Experts at The Stress Management Center and Phobia Institute in North Carolina have previously estimated that over £700million is lost every year because people miss work over Friday 13th superstitions.But the biggest money crisis occurred in a mini crash on October 13, 1989.It was the Dow Jones Industrial Averages second largest crash to date.4. The life of a daredevil is always precarious, but the death of Sam Patch has left conspiracy theorists talking for centuries.In 1829, The Yankee Leaper attempted to jump from 125 feet into Niagara River, near the Falls.Over 8,000 onlookers gathered to watch the terrifying spectacle, but Sam never surfaced again.5. The world was shocked when Kitty Genovese was brutally stabbed and raped by a stranger on March 13, 1964.Horrifically, the attack lasted for over 30 minutes – during which time 38 witnesses walked past without phoning the police.Following the brutal murder, psychologists coined the term the bystander effect, which is now used to explain how people in crowds are less likely to help those in need.6. On Friday October 13, 1972, a plane crashed in the Andes killing 12 people.The 16 survivors were forced to eat the bodies of the dead victims in order to keep themselves alive until they were rescued.7. During World War II, the Nazis dropped five bombs on Buckingham Palace on September 13, 1940.One person died when bombs struck the London landmark, taking out the Royal Chapel and destroying the water main.Luckily, the now Queen Elizabeth II and King George VI weren’t present at the time of the attack.8. On July 13, 1877, the first Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, Nathan Bedford Forrest, was born.9. The Bhola cyclone struck Bangladesh and India, killing 500,000 people on Friday November 13 in 1970.10. The original Black Friday occurred in 1989 on Friday, October 13, when a failed buyout deal for United Airlines’ parent company fell through sending global markets plunging.11. In 2012, the Costa Concordia sank on Friday, January 13, causing the death of 32 people.The cruise liner was carrying more than 4,000 people when it hit a rock off the coast of Italy.12. On Friday, October 13, 1307, thousands of Crusader warriors were imprisoned and later tortured by officers of the French King Philip IV.13. Devastating bush fires tore through Victoria in Australia on January 13, 1939.The fire caused 36 fatalities in just one day with the flames destroying 75 per cent of the state.The phobia of the date has been translated into a hugely successful Hollywood horror film series called Friday the 13th.Since 1980 the franchise has spawned 12 slasher movies focusing on the fictional character of Jason Voorhees, whose hockey mask has become a recognisable symbol for the series.However the twelfth film, made in 2009, is just a remake of the original.Before the movies existed, the most famous cultural reference to the date was a book by Thomas Lawson, published in 1907.The Friday the Thirteenth novel centres around a stockbroker who attempts to crash the stock market on the unluckiest day of the year.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Or Donald Tusk gleefully speculating that the biggest democratic vote ever held in Britain could yet be over-ridden.Imagine the furore if a Tory Secretary of State publicly sneered at Brussels for its own disunity, the mass eurozone unemployment, the migration disaster and the rise of extremism.Yes, our Government’s dithering, and the loss of its majority, has contributed to the Brexit chaos.But the EU’s habitually abusive clowns have always been the biggest obstacles to a decent deal and cordial relations.THE word “heroes” is overused. But the divers who rescued 12 lads from a flooded Thai cave are the definition.For 18 days the world has watched this incredible story and prayed for the children. We can only now marvel at the rescuers’ grit, their expertise and the courage of the kids themselves.As for the Brits who spearheaded the operation to save the boys . . . they are why bravery medals and OBEs are minted.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in practice, how does that work given that most sexual encounters are one-on-one with no witnesses?She can still say yes at the time then later pretend she didn’t and falsely accuse him of rape.And equally, he could pretend she had consented when, in fact, she had screamed no.Perhaps we are moving to an era when all young people will feel compelled to temporarily stall a moment of passion so they can film the consenting “yes” on their mobile phones? Or failing that, perhaps have a solicitor present.ACTRESS Paula Williamson wed “Britain’s most violent prisoner” Charles Bronson last November and said she looked forward to him getting out so they could enjoy a normal marriage.Yet just two months later he allegedly attacked the deputy governor of HMP Wakefield and now, just before appearing via video link at Leeds magistrates court, he tried to take his guards hostage in his cell.Hmmmm. Something tells me that – after spending 42 years inside – 65-year-old Charlie boy has become institutionalised and doesn’t actually want to come out, hence the litany of violent episodes that keep him in trouble and constantly embarrass his trusting wife.It gives a whole new meaning to the term blushing bride.NEW research shows that the ability to ward off fear and unhappiness is a skill that improves markedly with age.An American neuroscientist says the reaction of the old and the young to, say, the imminent results of an election were significantly different.That’s because, when you’ve seen a few governments come and go, we of a certain age eventually realise they’re all as useless as each other and whatever we say or do to try to change that has no effect at all.But if it turns out to be a France v England final, I may be heading home sooner than expected.FORMER Radio 1 DJ “Diddy” David Hamilton has weighed in to the #MeToo debate with his recollection of his Seventies heyday, saying: “We didn’t go around forcing ourselves on women.“It sounds conceited to say it but we didn’t have to because a lot of women were forcing themselves on us.”Meanwhile, Kinks frontman Sir Ray Davies reveals: “A world-famous groupie once threw me out because I was too kind.”A reminder, if needed, that not all men are b******s and not all women are innocent victims.And if further proof is required, look no further than some of the predatory females stalking their male prey on Love Island each night.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Will we be able to sign our own trade deals? And will the UK be outside the jurisdiction of the European Court?I’m very pleased to say the answers are very simple: yes, yes and yes.First, it will mean a genuine end to freedom of movement.No longer will people be allowed to arrive here from across Europe on the off-chance that they might find a job.We will always welcome the skilled professionals who help our country thrive, from doctors and nurses to engineers and entrepreneurs but for the first time in decades, we will have full control of our borders.And it will be the UK, not Brussels, that decides who should be allowed to live and work here.Second, we will have our own completely independent trade policy, our own seat at the World Trade Organisation and the ability to set tariffs and strike trade deals with whoever we please.British goods and services are in huge demand internationally, so it’s no surprise that countries are queuing up to make trade deals with us after we leave the EU.We are having good discussions with countries we would aim to sign trade deals with, including the US, as I will discuss with President Trump when he arrives in the UK on Thursday.Third, our plan will take back control of our laws.We will no longer be subject to the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union, instead, British judges in British courts will rule on our laws.And while we will commit to have common rules with the EU on things like exhaust emissions and food safety, Parliament will have to agree these rules.Put simply, such EU rules will no longer automatically and directly apply in the UK — Parliament will have a say.It’s clear to me that this is the right Brexit deal for Britain, although there are, of course, some alternatives.The EU’s preferred option — a standard, off-the-shelf trade deal for Great Britain with Northern Ireland in the customs union and parts of the single market — would break up our country.The other option the EU suggests, a combination of EEA membership with continued membership of the customs union, would not be Brexit at all.We would have no control over immigration, no ability to strike our own trade deals, and would still be liable for vast annual payments to Brussels.And while we must prepare for the possibility of leaving without a deal, I’m clear that the best outcome — for both the UK and the EU — is a deal based on the ideas we are setting out on Thursday.As for Labour, they are opening the door to a second referendum — ignoring the decision taken by the country and making it harder to get a good deal.Only our Brexit deal for Britain truly respects the will of the British people.And, as Prime Minister, it is the Brexit I am determined to deliver.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Sometimes that’s the only way to sort stuff out.That’s what the US President Donald Trump is doing right now with his Nato allies. And it’s a mighty big sledgehammer.In the firing line is Angela Merkel, of Germany. And the other countries that are backsliding on their commitment to the civilised world’s safety and security.Trump thinks — and he’s right — that for far too long Europe and Canada have not been paying their share for our military defence. The Germans pay nowhere near enough. But even worse are the Belgians.Incredibly, Canada, led by that simpering idiot Justin Trudeau, spends scarcely more than one per cent of its GDP on defence. One of the richest countries on the world. The Spanish, as you might expect, pay four fifths of sod all. LESS than one per cent.Trump is telling them all they cannot depend on America any more. The US spends 3.5 per cent of its enormous GDP on the military. Much more than any other country in Nato.And as a consequence, Western Europe (and Canada) has been safe for decades. It was US military spending which led to the end of the Cold War and ultimately the break up of the “evil empire”, the Soviet Union.So where do we stand in all this? We spend more per head than our European partners, Estonia and Greece excepted. But still just the bare minimum of two per cent of GDP.And for years now we’ve been reducing our defence budgets. Cutting our armed services to the bone. Take the Royal Navy. In the 36 years since the Falklands War the number of warships we possess has reduced by a staggering 74 per cent.We now have a Navy which is 25 per cent smaller than it was in 1650 — when we had only a tenth of our current population. We were once a great maritime power. Today we’d do well to win a naval battle against Luxembourg — and that’s landlocked.Military spending does not create wars. It does the opposite. It makes them much, much less likely.The Falklands War against Argentina occurred because we had cut our spending on the Navy to the point where we no longer defended the far-flung islands. The Argies saw their chance and invaded.Luckily we still had a big enough Navy to respond and win back the freedom for the Falklanders. We couldn’t even dream of doing the same thing now.Meanwhile, the RAF has seen its number of combat aircraft cut by more than one third in less than ten years. We now have just 149. You probably saw them during the flypast on Tuesday, if you live in London. That was the lot. That’s it.The first duty of any government is to protect its citizens. The US does that and we should do so, too — never mind the backsliding Europeans.The world is no less of a dangerous place than it was 30 or 60 years ago. Trump has got this absolutely right.NAZ SHAH is a Labour MP. Not so long ago she was suspended from the party.She had agreed with the foul and offensive idea that Israel should be “relocated” to the USA.Shah also compared the Israeli government to Adolf Hitler. Now she’s back in the party – and guess what? She’s been given a front bench role. As shadow equalities minister!They certainly take anti-Semitism seriously in Corbyn’s Labour Party. Surely there cannot be any Jewish people left in the country who would vote for this racist rabble.I’VE seen many remarkable things in my life. I’ve watched my team, Millwall, play in an FA Cup Final.I’ve seen the sun set at lunchtime in the Arctic Circle. I’ve talked to Arab terrorists, American presidents and famous pop singers. But there’s one thing I’ve never done.I have never, ever, in my entire life, met anyone who liked Danny Dyer. I was at party last week with people from all walks of life, and Danny’s name came up.The reaction was immediate. “Oh Christ, not that d**k . . .I think one woman even went behind a bush to be sick. Anyway, just thought I’d mention that.Maybe one day I will meet someone who likes Danny Dyer. And my life will be complete.IMPORTANT news story. Emily Ratajkowski is on holiday.We know this because she has very kindly sent the world some photographs of her break.But I will make sure to send back to The Sun some snaps of me lying on a sunbed with my a*se in the air, or posing in something alluring by a pool with a big pout on my chops. Enjoy.The EUS chief negotiator, Michel barnier wit Jeane-Claude Juncker - and the Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel.And that, frankly, is all you need to knowBEST news of the week, maybe of the year, was the heroic rescue of those young Thai kids from a flooded cave complex.It was an enormous, dangerous and brilliantly executed plan to get them out.And now, guess what? Hollywood is going to make a film about it all.YOU know the score, I don’t.All of my Wednesday is spent in a state of mental torture.What if we don’t crock Modric early on? When’s Harry going to start scoring again?I know the World Cup has been great fun. But does anybody actually ENJOY watching England – unless they’re 3-0 up? It’s too terrifying.Anyway, apparently there is a sharp rise in the birth rate when England win important football matches.Blokes take to their beds filled with passion.Me too, as it happens. And I like to relive the match by providing a loud commentary, in the manner of Jonathan Pearce, while I’m on the job.“Oh, just look at Liddle! He’s found a way through – AND IT’S IN!”ITALY has just turned away another ship full of migrants. It had been chartered by one of the many leftie charities bobbing about in the Med.Isn’t it time these mor- ons were prosecuted for people trafficking? Migrants now set off expecting to be picked up.

Migration Watch chair Lord Green stormed: “This immigration chapter is in many respects close to what we suggested but there are some weasel words.“It’s vital that the UK should not be drawn into a negotiation over numbers.“Indeed it is not enough to ‘control the number of migrant workers from the EU. These numbers must be significantly reduced.”Tory Eurosceptic Iain Duncan Smith demanded to know why the Government had dropped any mention of work permits – let alone visas.He told the Sun: “My fear is that the detail on immigration is being held back so we can negotiate controls away in a sop to the European Union. That would be an unmitigated disaster.”Key elements of Mrs Mays proposals include: The Sun five years ago urged then-PM David Cameron to win back powers to halt unlimited EU immigration –warning voters could otherwise vote to cut ties with Brussels.Figures two months ago revealed net migration in the year to September was 244,000 –more than double the Government’s 100,000 target.New Home Secretary Sajid Javid this week signalled the target would be scrapped in the run up to the next Election in 2022.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Jordan seemed a decent lad, polite and well mannered, but we rarely saw him.He was shut away in the house and was never out on the streets messing around with the other kids.”The neighbour added: “You could often hear screaming and shouting and one of my mates who visited Dawn said the house was filthy, cram packed with junk and like a pig sty.”Jordan died of malnutrition, immobility and infection-riddled sores on June 30, 2016.Newly-released photos show the victim - who would have celebrated his 21st birthday last week - enjoying himself at home.In one image unveiled by West Yorkshire Police bespectacled Jordan, sporting a black beanie, appears like any other normal teen and is captured with a huge grin on his fourteenth birthday in his lounge.Another picture shows a relaxed and healthy looking Jordan, aged 16, engrossed in playing on Playstation Portable, while a third snap shows a chubby-faced Jordan, aged 14.But within several years of the images being taken Jordan had wasted away at the hands of his wicked family.In one of the last photographs taken of the teen and released by his dad Steven Burling - who is estranged from Dawn - he can be seen holding up his shirt - with his ribs clearly seen in his starved state.Another photograph reveals the squalid conditions the young man was forced to live in before his death, with the living room piled high with rubbish.But despite the young man desperately malnourished, the court was told the home had three refrigerators or freezers, all stocked with food.The family also revealed their shock at discovering Dawn Cranston had given birth to another baby boy who died - hiding his body in a rucksack at their Leeds home.Police had found the babys remains after searching the house, with Dawn admitting before the trial to concealing a birth by hiding her newborns remains in a bedroom cupboard.She told the court she was completely unaware she was pregnant until she began to feel something really heavy in her body.She gave birth within an hour and began to panic as nobody else knew she was expecting.Describing how she did not call for help despite other people being in the house, she tearfully said: If I remember rightly, I dont think its eyes were open. I heard no noise, nothing. There were no signs at all of life.She claimed that she had intended to bury the remains, but did not get round to it and was unable to as there were always other people around.She admitted a charge of endeavouring to conceal a birth at the start of her trial last month.Jordans sister Abigail Burling, 25, was cleared of manslaughter but guilty of causing or allowing the death of a vulnerable person and jailed for 18 months.During the four week trial, prosecutor Nicholas Lumley QC had told the jury: The fault lies with each of the accused.What met the eyes of the paramedics was a shocking and disturbing scene.Jordan was lying, utterly helpless, on an inflatable mattress in a cluttered living room.He was little more than skin and bones, he weighed 37kg, less than six stones.He wore a soiled nappy under some pyjamas.The expert dietitian said they had never seen such malnutrition in 26 years and likened the condition of the body to that found in WWII extermination camps.His heart stopped, his life could not be saved.He he expired in that living room.Dawn Cranston already admitted to concealing the birth of a child by secretly disposing of a body.Detective Chief Inspector Nicola Bryar, of West Yorkshire Police Homicide and Major Enquiry Team today said the teens death was completely unnecessary.She said: We are in no doubt that Jordan would still be alive today if those convicted of allowing him to literally waste away and die in front of them had sought the medical attention he so obviously needed.Why they chose to ignore the terrible state he was in has not been explained in any reasonable way and remains something only they know.It is almost beyond belief that his mother, grandmother and sister, who should have had his best interests at heart, would allow him to slowly decline towards a death that could so easily have been avoided.Today, dad Steven said he felt betrayed, having never known about the baby.The statement read: As a family, we feel we have been denied any knowledge of that baby boy’s existence.The family said they now wanted to be able to grieve in peace.In a final tribute to Jordan, his family said: Steven and the family will always remember Jordan having a bubbly and chatty personality.Jordans dad Steven had previously shared a statement in court, read out by his sister Susan Burling.In the devastating tribute, Steven told the court: I just cant understand why all these horrific things have happened to me and my family.I have lost all my children and I don’t know how I’m supposed to deal with all this trauma.I don’t know how I’m going to grieve for them or rebuild my life."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000419568628.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"government approves 21st century fox buy sky rupert murdoch","story":"The green light comes as bidding for the broadcaster hots up.On Wednesday evening, US cable group Comcast tabled a £14.75 bid for Sky, valuing it at £26 billion.Yesterday’s UK government clearance  after a 19 month wait eliminates a critical obstacle to Fox’s pursuit of Sky - and opens the door for it to potentially raise its proposal again.Jeremy Wright, the newly installed UK culture secretary, reiterated his predecessor’s view that Fox’s plans to divest Sky News remedied any concerns around the concentration of media ownership.Analysts at Jefferies said: “We suggest that Comcast’s new cash offer to all Sky shareholders is merely the opening shot in an endgame which will gather pace following the granted approval of Fox/ Sky.”The Sky auction has become a central battlefield in a larger contest between Comcast and Walt Disney for Fox’s entertainment assets.Disney has agreed to pay $71.3 billion for the assets - including Fox’s share of Sky - bettering a rival bid from Comcast.

They still had light. They looked in good health.“But of course when we departed all we could think of was how we were going to get them out.“So there was relief tempered with uncertainty.”Rick was joined at the news conference by other members of the British Cave Rescue Council who were at the “forefront of the rescue effort”.Asked about the difficulty of the mission, the experienced cave diver admitted that the extraction process was “too detailed” to explain at such short notice.However, Rick did admit that the rescue team did have doubts over whether the boys would survive the operation.He said: “This is completely uncharted unprecedented territory – nothing like this has been done. So of course there were doubts.“But I knew we had a good team with good support from the Thai authorities and the national caving community and rescue organisations.“So we had the best that we could do to make a plan work.”Rick found the youth football team along with fellow British cave diver John Volanthen, 47.The boys were soon joined by Australian doctor Richard Harris, known as Harry, who spent days with the youngsters checking them over and reassuring them before their dramatic evacuation.And John said that Dr Harris Aussie accent helped calm the children during the terrifying ordeal, reports the Adelaide Advertiser.He said: Dr Harry, the Australian doctor, hes very good, hes got a very good bedside manner, hes got a very bouncy Australian accent, and they seemed to find that quite relaxing and reassuring.The boys and their coach planned to explore the cavern complex for only about an hour before treacherous flood waters rose to trap them for more than two weeks, one of the boys fathers said.All 12 of the boys and their 25-year-old coach were brought to safety over the course of a three-day rescue.They had gone into the Tham Luang cave in the northern province of Chiang Rai on June 23, for a quick excursion after football practice, when a rainy season downpour flooded the tunnels.He told me that as soon as they finished practice they went to play at the cave. They thought theyd only be an hour, Banpot Korncam, father of the 13-year-old captain of the Wild Boars team, told media.While they were inside the cave it rained, water flowed in and everyone took off, Banpot said."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/nintchdbpict000367291191.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"boy taken out school north yorkshire peaky blinders hair style short","story":"Year 7 pupil Liam Head, 12, has to sit in a room alone for six hours a day and will miss a school trip, a choir concert, sports day and his end of term assembly.Teachers branded the short-back-and-sides extreme but mum Claire says he has had the same cut three times before and did not even get a warning.And she claims the headmaster told her the Cillian Murphy-style grade 1 clipper cut is just 1/16 of an inch — less than 2mm — under the minimum grade 1.5 length.He has been put in isolation, which his mum claims means being left in a hot and airless room without a teacher from 9am to 3.30pm.Mum-of-two Claire, 45, of Kirby Misperton, North Yorks, told The Sun Online: Its cruel what theyre doing. Hes not even allowed a ten minute break to get some fresh air and stretch his legs.Isolation is for naughty children.

Ive lost all faith in the school.She has complained to the schools board of governors and North Yorkshire County Council over his treatment.Lady Lumleys uniform policy states: Extraordinary hair styles and colouring are not allowed, for example braiding, unnatural colours, shaved sides and tramlines or similar.The school said Liam was allowed food and toilet breaks and the isolation room is well-ventilated with an open door.Headteacher Richard Bramley said: We have clear expectations about uniform and student appearance in our school which every student is required to follow.Students accept that if they do breach the requirements, which include that extreme haircuts are not allowed, students will be isolated from their peers during the school day until the issue is resolved.Our intention always is to ensure a good education in a safe environment for all the young people in our care.The council said: “We work closely with parents and our schools to ensure the safeguarding and welfare of students.“Policy on uniform is the decision and responsibility of our schools.”In November we told how schoolboy James Hiles, 12, was put in isolation for one day because his Peaker Blinders hairdo broke school rules in Stockport."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000420084215.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"can you find the pooch perfectly hidden among the flowers in its owners garden","story":"Staffordshire Bull Terrier Eddie almost disappeared entirely from view after getting spooked - but can you spot where he is?Owner Mike Simcox took the snap at his Birmingham home.He said: Although he is a Staffie, he can be quite nervous and most of the time he has a slightly scared look on his face.He has an extreme dislike of loud noises, especially fireworks and thunder.During storms in the past he has gone upstairs and hid in the shower cubicle.On close inspection the top of Eddie’s head and eyes can be seen in the centre of the pic surrounded by potted plants.Mike added: My mum and I were watering the garden when she spotted him peeping out from behind the flowers.She said you should take a photo and see if people could spot him, so I did.There was a really threatening-looking cloud above me at the time so its possible Eddie could hear thunder and decided to hide, although why he decided to hide outside and not in the house I couldnt say.It comes as a bizarre caterpillar with the head of a mouse was captured on camera.The eye-opening sight has quickly notched up over 317,000 views on YouTube after footage of the weird larva went viral.Alexander Emelyanov, from the port city of Odessa in south-western Ukraine, witnessed the strange creature and grabbed his mobile phone to record it.He said: The surface of its skin is smooth, but not entirely, to be honest it feels a bit like the body of a snake.

It’s about celebrities improving their image.”Oh, but what record-breaking names they’d assembled.Robbie, Adele, Elton, Ed Sheeran, Coldplay and Stormzy, were just a few of those who didn’t attend.Blue, Coleen Nolan, Amber Davies, from last year’s Love Island, UB40, Kimberley Walsh and Tony Hadley, on the other hand, were all involved, as was JLS’s Aston Merrygold, right, who said, on behalf of the NHS, he was: “Happy to clear my diary.”So we thank him and whoever covered the shift at Domino’s.Job demarcation, though, among the celebs, was a bit vague. A few just seemed to have backing track duties, like Kimberley Walsh who was given the line “What would you do if I sang out of tune?” (IF?)Some were enrolled for the full, record-breaking, Abbey Road finale, while others went on recruitment drives at UK hospitals, where Tony unearthed “the singing ambulanceman”, and Sara set her sights on Debbie “who’s pouring custard on a spotted Dick” — in the staff canteen, rather than the Infectious Diseases Unit.Eulogies to the great NHS god, though, were compulsory and delivered with a glassy-eyed, lip-quivering intensity that has become a very familiar sight these past few months.Good intentions, as we know, though, pave the road to hell. And so it proved with Wednesday’s Big Singalong Live, which kicked off with a parp of a klaxon, from Ashley, and Sara screaming: “Can we now please break that record.”Perhaps we can put what followed down to the swirling p***storm, in North London, or the lack of practice time — they only had six weeks — but, dear Lord in heaven — Russell Crowe didn’t unleash this much hell in Gladiator.Missed cues, frozen screens, flat voices, Tony Hadley giving it the big ’un, on the Abbey Road zebra crossing, with his “woh-oh ohhhs”.Seven thousand drunk Millwall fans chanting: “You’re going home in a London ambulance” could not have been much less unco-ordinated, but would undoubtedly have delivered an equally powerful message about the NHS.Salvation, though, was on hand in the form of Sara Cox.“The results are in and . . . (drum roll).“We almost made it, but it looks like the weather may have rained on our parade. We didn’t break the record.” A MASTERCLASS in scheduling, editing and continuity, from Channel 5, on Thursday night, that began with the very chirpy announcement: “We’ll find out What Happened to Josef Fritzl after brand new Nando’s, A PERi PERi Big Success . . . ”Which isn’t the first thing I associate Josef with, to be perfectly honest with you.

Started off at 5.47am and finished at 7.53pm, trying to make the absolute most of the new moon spring tides.I\u0027ll be doing two swims a day and slingshotting around Land\u0027s End. The sea was kind this morning with virtually no jellyfish (although support swimmer Nicola Johnson was stung on her arm).I will be going back out at around 6pm to catch the evening tide. Meanwhile, the team and I are motoring back into Newlyn harbour for the day to rest, refuel, stock up on food and fill up on water.:: Day one - 6 miles (9.8km) Today was a day of ironing out the swim procedures. This involved working out communication between me in the water and my team, adhering to the verification protocols, working out actual distance covered versus distance swum - it\u0027s difficult to swim in an exact straight line.In total I manage to cover 6 miles (9.8km) of my journey, although this is less than the actual distance I swam.This was the first day when all nine members of the campaign were on board, and over the next few days we will learn much about the teamwork and processes that will help us get through the entire expedition.Another first today was my first jellyfish sting. It got me right on the crotch.We ended the day by sitting at anchorage just off Mousehole, finishing up dinner and getting in an early sleep before we move back to the GPS point at 4.30 am for the next swim at 6.00am.:: The eve of the swimYou are either a pioneer or a follower you can\u0027t be both. And if you are a pioneer, you know all about worry.If something has been done before, you know it\u0027s possible. If you don\u0027t know something is possible, you worry about it.I have a plan to try and swim 10km per day. But when I swim into my first bloom of jellyfish, that plan will become flexible.I know that I\u0027m going to get sunburnt. I\u0027m going to be frozen, I\u0027m going to be stung, and I\u0027m going to become mentally and physically exhausted. Have I done too much preparation, or not enough?What if we get the tides wrong, get caught in a counter eddy and find ourselves going backwards? This is a notoriously dangerous coastline, with the shipwrecks to prove it.Did I mention that half my expedition team is new, and half has no sailing experience?In those waking worry hours I also remembered the Stockdale paradox. Admiral Stockdale was an American pilot who was shot down in Vietnam and spent eight years in a POW camp. He said that the people who survived had two important qualities.First, they always believed they would be freed. Second - and this is the paradox - they had no optimism. Because the people who did have optimism - the people who hoped they would be free by Easter, then by Thanksgiving, then by Christmas, and had those hopes dashed over and over again - those people didn\u0027t survive. The people who survived were the ones who confronted the brutal reality of their situation.I have to face some brutal facts when I look at the chart of our 560km swim route. This is the longest swim anyone has ever done, adhering to Channel Rules in water this low temperature. I honestly don\u0027t know how I\u0027m going to do this. But I do believe I\u0027ll see the white cliffs of Dover. So that\u0027s the paradox that\u0027s going through my mind.The swimming is only part of the challenge. We\u0027ve also had to co-ordinate with sponsors, raise funds for the expedition, recruit the right people for the team, and deal with the media... all the while juggling private lives with unexpected domestic crises. As if all that wasn\u0027t enough, after six months of campaign planning and preparation, we learned that Donald Trump is coming to London on the day I start swimming. We certainly hadn\u0027t planned on such a big media story distracting from our message.Because the message is the reason I am doing this swim. The truth is we are failing our oceans. And it\u0027s only through bold and courageous action that we\u0027re going to be able to protect them properly. \"Piecemeal\" protection is not going to safeguard our seas. We need an enormous shift in business and government and the public to be able to do this.There are challenges ahead.

The Prime Minister bristled as she and the President came face to face with the media at Chequers after Trump\u0027s explosive interview last night.  In comments released during a lavish black tie pro-trade dinner, Trump claimed Mrs May\u0027s softer Brexit plan would kill a US-UK trade pact because it keeps EU rules on goods.  Devastatingly, he added: I actually told Theresa May how to do it but she didn’t agree. But the Prime Minister made a face when a US journalist asked the President if he regretted his comments today.  President Trump also shrugged off the question, which had come after he answered another similar question, and gestured in disbelief to the reporter. Journalists were then quickly ushered out of the room at Mrs May\u0027s country retreat.  Despite throwing a hand-grenade into Brexit, the brazen President today insisted he and Theresa May had “probably never developed a better relationship” than during last night’s dinner at Blenheim Palace.   Asked about his relationship with May as he arrived at Chequers, Trump added: “it’s never been more united”. Mrs May said President Trump had done “a very good job” at Nato\u0027s Brussels summit in encouraging other member states to up their military spending.  Amid protests portraying him as an orange inflatable wailing baby, Trump faced calls to have his tea with the Queen cancelled after his remarks.

Mrs May was wearing the patch on the back of her left arm. On the other arm you can see a mark which looks like she was wearing one there previously, and there\u0027s a similar mark just above. The patch is actually a diabetic monitoring patch. The clever little piece, which is about the size of a \u0026pound2 coin, constantly monitors glucose levels meaning people with the condition don\u0027t have to keep pricking their finger to check.  The new technology was introduced back in 2016. Mrs May has been spotted wearing the patches on several different occasions.

The police watchdog is investigating claims Andre Moura was kneed in the head \u0027several times\u0027 by an officer before his death. Ten officers are on restricted duties and mobile phone footage of the incident has been seized as part of the probe. Mr Moura, 30, was detained on suspicion of breaching the peace following reports of a domestic disturbance at his home on Seventh Avenue in Oldham, Manchester.  Greater Manchester Police said officers used CS spray to restrain Mr Moura outside his house before he was taken to Ashton-under-Lyne police station. The force said that ‘on arrival’ at the station, Mr Moura was ‘found unresponsive in the back of the police van’, the Manchester Evening News reported. He was then taken to Tameside hospital, where he was declared dead at 1.30am. A post-mortem was ‘inconclusive’. Further tests will be carried out to determine the cause of Mr Moura’s death.  Police arrived at the scene at around 11.30pm last Friday (July 6). Footage of the arrest was captured by a resident. In it, Mr Moura can be heard screaming and telling officers they had ‘hurt’ him. One of Mr Moura’s neighbours, who shot the video, is heard asking police: “Is he alright? “You just kneed him about... several times [sic].”  An officer replies: “Yeah, I know pal.” The resident, Barry Lee Martin, is then heard saying: “It was a little excessive him kneeing him then.”  An officer replies: “Yeah, you stood here scrapping with him? No. Go back in your house, pal.” Earlier in the video, an officer can be heard shouting: “Put your hands behind your back. Stop resisting or you’re gonna get sprayed again.” Mr Moura is heard shouting ‘help me, help’.

Gone were the steelworks and factories which had seen the area thrive at the heart of the industrial revolution. The train station, which had once seen thousands of workers on its platform every day, was run down and dilapidated, and the high street was filled with rows of boarded up shops. Now, it is a very different place – almost every shop is open for business, colourful hanging baskets adorn each shop front and the railway station has a bustling cafe and function room which would look good on a picture postcard. So how have these once dead-on-their-feet towns on the outskirts of Salford managed to pick themselves up and buck the trend of the struggling British high street to thrive again?  Their success is thanks in part to local lad and wealthy businessman Neil McArthur who launched his firms in the area and wanted to give something back. But, he says, the community itself has been instrumental in stopping the rot and transforming its own fortunes. “It is restoration of pride – that is the key to regeneration, getting people in the area to believe in the area,” he says. “You have to have a plan, a drive. The community have to get themselves together and organise. We have officers at the council who help enormously, but we drive it as a community.”  When Neil was born in 1955, Irlam was booming. Slap in the middle of the rail network and the ship canal, it was the perfect location for the steelworks and factories making everything from soap, to rope and margarine. But in the early 70s the steelworks closed, and in the space of eight years the other factories went too. “We lost the lot,” Neil says. “About 10,000 jobs. It decimated the area – it went from a place where thousands of people travelled in to the station everyday from places like Wigan to work in the steelworks, to nothing going on. You lose all that industry and disposable income, and then our shops slowly lost their income.” Part of Salford, it had a lower crime rate and was wealthier than its neighbours so went unnoticed by the authorities who left Irlam and Cadishead out on a limb. “The problem was it was never poor enough or deprived enough to get attention” says Neil, 63.  He launched his telecoms business, Opal, in 1996 – based in Irlam – and by 2002 it was bought by Carphone Warehouse and became TalkTalk. He had made enough money to put his feet up, but chatting to him in the railway station he has spent \u0026pound1.1million revamping, you get the impression that just isn’t his style. He’s a do-er. So he turned his attention to his home town. He ploughed \u0026pound12million into his charity, the Hamilton Davies Trust, and a further \u0026pound11million into a regeneration company that bought empty properties – including almost the whole high street – and giving them a lease of life. “We realised we just weren’t going to get any money out of the Government so we started this process called community-led regeneration.” He explains: “You start thinking about what you have got, not what you haven’t got. You start to stop the rot. We did a bit of a stocktake on what we had and the challenges. The thing that jumped out was that the housing stock was quite good. But the shopfronts and the road really let the area down.  “There was still quite a good community spirit here, but the image was poor. “An outsider coming in saw a boarded-up derelict station with weeds growing out of it, shops boarded up, and other things that tell you you are in a tired area. It started getting a reputation that wasn’t right. People who lived here loved it, but people who didn’t couldn’t understand why people wanted to live here. The first thing we did was our regeneration business would buy a derelict shop, do it up. “If you buy a couple of them then your neighbours start looking at theirs because it looks a bit tatty. “When you have done 30 of them people start to notice. We got rid of all the derelict shops.”  There is a \u0026pound3million leisure centre built with \u0026pound1million from the McArthur Trust, plus funding from the council and Sport England. There are green spaces and huge tubs filled with flowers in the high street. Each shop that spruces itself up gets a plaque and a hanging basket from the trust and Rotary Club. The town is thriving – but not like a high street in the traditional sense of the word. To survive, Irlam and Cadishead had to diversify. There is a huge Tesco and a Lidl right in the town centre, so the high street itself is focused on the service industry with everything from tattoo parlours to dog grooming salons, accountants, sandwich shops and hairdressers. Florist Luana Saycell has had her shop, Green Orchid, for six years and says everyone in the town pulls together to foster pride and success.  “The Hamilton Davies Trust has tried to help Irlam in a big way,” she says. “But we are all trying to work together. It is a team effort. I sell the local honey that is made by a beekeeper who keeps his hives on local farmland. It is hard in business, you have to diversify to survive.” Louise English, 64, started outside catering business Festival of Food from her house in 1999 and then expanded to open a sandwich shop in Irlam. Business is booming. “The town is improving, there is a lot of money being put in. The Rotary Club provided hanging baskets for the shops. The industrial estate keeps us going – we get phone orders all day. The businesses thrive off each other.” The railway station which was once dingy and uninviting is now the hub of the community and within a year of its refurbishment it saw passenger numbers increase by 50,000.

Maria Young and her neighbours clubbed together and bought the 12ft pool and cover for \u0026pound64 during the heatwave last month.  Their children and grandkids have enjoyed cooling off in the sweltering 30C temperatures. But this week killjoy housing officials told them it must go — because it is not safe for intruders. Mrs Young, 47, said: They said if someone breaks in they might drown in the pool.  A team of them came and said initially we\u0027d have to get rid of it. They then changed their mind and said we had to put it down each night for health and safety issues. I don\u0027t understand. People in other places are allowed them in their community gardens. There\u0027s nothing in the tenancy agreement that says we can\u0027t. We\u0027ve even said we will sign a disclaimer to take responsibility for it. I don\u0027t know what the problem is, we have got a really nice block where everyone gets on and this is a nice way for everyone to enjoy the sunshine.  She added: We all get on really well. We sit out the back together and socialise. It\u0027s completely enclosed. There\u0027s no way I\u0027m taking it down. They\u0027ll have to carry me out laying in it. The residents of the six flats in Strood, Kent, bought the paddling pool to bring the community together. It takes around three hours to fill and holds up to 15,000 gallons of water. But mhs Homes, which manages the properties, said it had to be sure that everyone who has access to that land is safe. The problems arouse when a security gate to the shared garden broke recently, which meant people from outside could easily get inside the back area of the flats.

Around 49 million Brits are said to fearful of Friday 13th, bound by the belief that bad things will and do happen on this date. Tupac died on a Friday 13th in 1996 and on this date during the Blitz Buckingham Palace was bombed. Kitty Genovese was also murdered on this unlucky day as no one called for help, in a phenomenon that became known as the Bystander Effect. Fear of Friday 13th even has its own name - Paraskevidekatriaphobia - and it is estimated to cost businesses up to \u0026pound585m. But where did it come from? We look at how the fear of Friday 13th began, and the unlucky events taking place on this date that has led to millions of people throughout the world fearing it.  There are a number of theories about the origins of Friday 13th and its association with all things unlucky. One theory is that the superstition stems from early Christianity, as Jesus Christ was crucified on a Friday and Judas Iscariot was the 13th guest at the Last Supper. While another is that the date associated with such bad fortune began later with King Philip IV of France commanding hundreds of Templar Knights be arrested on the date in 1307, and then be tortured and burned alive. In Norse mythology, Frigga, the free-spirited goddess of love and fertility, was labelled a witch and banished when tribes converted to Christianity. Legend has it that every Friday, the malicious goddess assembled the devil and eleven other witches (13 in total) and plotted evil deeds for the coming week. For centuries in Scandinavia, Friday was therefore known as the Witches\u0027 Sabbath. Superstition around the date also stems from the negativity associated with number 13. Another story from Norse mythology also tells the tale of when a dinner party was once ruined by Loki, whose appearance plunged the world into darkness and led to the death of a God called Balder. Loki was the 13th guest at the gathering.  One of the oldest references is in ancient Babylonian history (1700s BC). In the Code of Hammurabi, an early law code, the laws are numbered and skip from 12 to 14. Possibly the Babylonians considered 13 to be unlucky because of the Song of Ishtar, an ancient Babylonian epic poem. The thirteenth line contains the name of the Goddess of the Dead. The number 13 has always been seen as a bit of an oddity while 12 has been seen as a number denoting \u0027completeness.\u0027 There were 12 Gods of Olympus and 12 hours of the clock. There are also 12 months in a year and the equivalent number of signs in the Zodiac, as well as 12 Apostles of Jesus. And, you apparently need 13 witches to form a coven. And Friday has also been a day some associate with bad luck. For example in Wales there was a belief that Friday was an unlucky day, with miners refusing to start new work at the end of the week. It is also possible that the association in part with the day and a bad run of fortune can be linked to Thomas W. Lawson\u0027s novel Friday, the Thirteenth, released in 1907. Fear of Friday 13th has continued as more unlucky events have happened on this date, both in history and modern times. This has seen some hotels refuse to have a room 13 and others, like the Carlton Hotel in London, refuse to have a floor 13 entirely. Some planes also do not have a row 13.  The Costa Concordia disaster, which saw 32 people drowned when it sank off the coast of Tuscany took place in January 2012 when the ship struck a rock. On Friday 13th October 1972 Air Force Flight 571 from Uruguay crashed in the Andes, while flying members of a rugby team. Out of 45 passengers, 29 died from impact injuries, frostbite, starvation and an avalanche, with the remaining 16 forced to preserve the dead passengers in the snow and eat their flesh. The story of Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 was made into a book and a film — Alive — narrated by actor and director John Malkovich and the survivors are national heroes. One young boy saw everything unlucky collide when he was left with burns after being struck by lightning at 13.13 on Friday 13th in 2010. He was 13 at the time.  An unlucky event on a Friday 13th led to a whole new psychological theory being developed. Kitty Genovese was murdered on 13th March 1964. The then 28-year-old was stabbed in Queens in New York as allegedly 38 neighbours did nothing. While there is dispute over whether people did come and help her, and call the police, the killing led to the development of the Bystander Theory. This finds that a single witness to a crime is more likely to do something than if they are part of a large group of people. Winston Moseley was jailed for life for the killing and died in prison last year. Four people were injured and one died when Buckingham Palace was bombed during the Blitz on Friday 13th September 1940. The Palace was hit by five German bombs and one member of the Royal staff was killed. On Friday 13th August, 1976, New York man Daz Baxter elected to stay in bed to ward off bad luck. But his choice was to be an unlucky one, as the floor of his apartment block collapsed and he fell six storeys to his death.  And on 13th May 1981 the Pope was shot at four times. Pope John Paul II, formerly Cardinal Karol Wojtyla of Poland came out of hospital two weeks later but was readmitted due to a lung infection. He later made a full recovery. The date is also associated with weather crisis. On Friday 13th October 13, 2006, 36 inches of snow fell on upstate New York. The ensuing chaos claimed three lives and incurred $130 million of damage. There have been a number of famous deaths on Friday 13th - including Tupac Shakur on 13th September 1996 six days after he had been targeted in a drive by shooting, wrestler Lance Cade on 13th August 2010 and the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Malik Meraj Khalid died on 13th June 2003. The stock market has also not escaped a brush with bad luck. On Friday 13th October, 1989, global markets plunged when a buyout for a United Airlines parent company failed. It later was referred to as Black Friday . Do people really fear it? Companies report that people are reluctant to book weddings on Friday 13th, with some venues even offering sizeable discounts for people who want to gamble on this date. Data from TheKnot found that 1,345 fewer couples wed on Friday 13th July 2012 compared to those who tied the knot the following Friday. Michael Chopra and Heather Swan married on Friday 13th in 2008 but the pair split up later after arguing throughout their honeymoon. And on this ominous date Bill Murray and Jennifer Butler finalised their divorce after 10 years of marriage.  Richard Riakporhe, Professional Boxer, worries about superstition when it comes down to his fights. He said: “I would feel slightly cautious because of so much stigma being attached to that date.” “Also growing up watching a vast amount of superstitious horror movies since youth has left that percentage of doubt in me that something could possibly go wrong on fight night.”  The good news For people who refuse to fear it, Friday 13th can have some benefits. According to Zoopla, properties that are number 13 are \u0026pound9,000 cheaper than neighbouring houses and flats. And Friday 13th is the cheapest day to fly in the UK, with many avoiding that day for fear something could go wrong.  As a number of people feel 13 is an unlucky number, you have a higher chance of winning if you pick it in the Lottery. Taylor Swift refuses to be governed by superstition. The pop star was born on 13th of December and turned 13 on Friday 13th. Her first album also went gold in just 13 weeks. And, back in 1940 the North Devon Club in Metherell - Britain\u0027s first nudist joint - was opened. When does Friday 13th take place?

Promising young footballer Michael, from Little Lever, Bolton, was on the academy books of both Manchester United and Manchester City as a child and went on to play semi-professionally and at a high amateur level. He was enjoying a holiday with friends when tragically on July 4, at around 11pm, he is belueved to have fallen to his death from Apartamentos Vina Del Mar hotel, just outside central Benidorm. Michael’s father Paul Jones, 50, shared his heartbreak and announced his son\u0027s death in a moving Facebook post this week, reports the Manchester Evening News . He said the family were ‘broken’ over Michael’s passing and revealed the friends he was with on holiday all returned home immediately afterwards.

We met with the boys and their parents to fill in the gaps of the last hours of Mikes last day, to get a better understanding of the events of the day leading up to his death, to search for a better understanding and help to get some sort of closure.  I thank the boys with all my heart for their time with us, they helped me enormously, I take solace in their words, they need each other now along with their families and must not blame themselves for something totally out of their control. My wife Janet, son Joseph, family, friends and colleagues have been a massive support over the nightmare of the past few days, thank you all for your kind words. I am broken and feel so alone, I can’t see the pain ending, a part of me died with Michael, never to be replaced or healed, no parent should have to bury their child, it’s just not right, it’s not fair. I told Mike I loved him with every opportunity I had and meant every word, I hope he understood just how much he meant to me. I cannot explain how much this hurts.

Christina Sturgess, then 17, logged on each night to connect to random strangers at a spin of the internet chatroom\u0027s wheel. That\u0027s how the London teenager came face-to-face via webcam with Marc Brauner in his native Austria and the pair knew they were destined to be together. They began talking every night and he flew to her home city two months later before proposing out of the blue on Christmas Day on only the third time they met. Christina beamed: On Christmas Day we were in my parents\u0027 front room and he just took the ring out and said \u0027will you marry me?\u0027  It was so surreal but also really happy. It still can\u0027t quite believe it now.  Chatroulette is an online chat website that allows users to have random webcam-based conversations with anyone in the world. At any point, either user can leave the chat by starting up another conversation with another random user. Explaining how she became hooked on the website, Christina explained: Just before the school summer holidays my younger sister showed me Chatroulette, which everyone was using. We started going on to cam to guys and just finding it funny and then I began to chat with a few guys and I had found something that made me feel happy.  I started exchanging MSNs with different boys across the world I remember going to school and just feeling excited to get home, so I could get straight on the computer and type to boys on the internet. Her parents urged her to ditch the Chatroulette binges, but she refused: I loved finding out different things about different people. My dad used to tell me to get off and come to watch a film with him, but I loved it.  Her life changed forever when she was randomly connected with teenage Marc, now 24, in summer 2010 during the school holidays. She said: We got on straight away and started talking on MSN. I used to rush home to school to speak to him every night. Sometimes we\u0027d talk for hours.  Besotted Marc flew to London in August 2010 and the pair met for the first time in the flesh. Christina said: My mum took me to meet him. I saw him and just fell in love with him there and then. The pair spent two weeks in each others arms before Marc returned home.  Then Christina flew to Austria two months later for a week. As the days went by, the pair\u0027s love grew. It just felt so right. We got on so well and I really fancied him, she explained. Marc returned to London for Christmas 2010 and spent two weeks with Christina\u0027s family. He proposed out the blue on Christmas Day in front of Christina\u0027s parents and she broke into tears of joy - the pair had known each other four months and had spent just over three weeks in the flesh together. Christina said: We had looked at rings together before earlier in the holiday. I knew he wanted to propose but I never knew when it would happen.  After the proposal, Christina, who had never had a long-term boyfriend before, finished her A-levels in business studies the following summer and then spent two years living with Marc in Austria, before the pair returned to England. She joked: You meet a lot of strange people on Chatroulette but I\u0027m so pleased I found Marc on there. They tied the knot in an idyllic Surrey village on August 22, 2015 in the presence of about 50 guests. Christina said: The wedding day was perfect and we were so lucky with the weather. Her parents supported the young couple throughout the whirlwind romance - Christina even said her very protective dad approved of Marc straight away.  The couple, who now work in online digital marketing, are planning to move out of their rented home in London and buy a house. Christina, who took Marc\u0027s surname, Brauner, is also keen to start a family: I want three or four children, but my husband would probably say one or two. But Christina\u0027s dream romance with Marc came after an unhappy adolescence. She lost contact with her high school best friend as the pair started A-levels and she began suffering regular panic attacks. My appetite wasn’t the same and I was losing weight unintentionally at the age of 16 years old and I was constantly feeling weak, she said.

Pupils at the Co-operative Academy in Leeds have been told to stash the cutlery in their underwear if they fear they are being taken overseas to be married. It is hoped the spoons could be used to trip metal detectors at airports, allowing would-be victims to raise the alarm with security staff. Harinder Kaur, the inner-city secondary school’s social, culture and ethos leader, believes the spoons can save lives.    She told the BBC : In the six-weeks holidays we know there is no contact between school and the family and families have that opportunity to go abroad, get their child married and come back.  It\u0027s a way of making our children aware there is a safety net there. The academy is working with the charity Karma Nirvana, which campaigns against “honour”-based abuse and forced marriage and educates students about the risks. Last year alone, the charity took nearly 9,000 calls on its forced marriage helpline. Almost 200 of those calls were made either by children aged 15 or under or on their behalf. A law making it a criminal offence to force people into marriage came into effect in June 2014. Parents who force their children to marry can be punished by up to seven years in prison.

Megan Bassett was travelling home from Weston-super-Mare\u0027 s beach with her family when she discovered a massive lump on her neck, the Bristol Post reports  Concerned by its size, the 26-year-old sought medical advice and after scans she was eventually diagnosed with Stage 4 Hodgkins Lymphoma which had spread to various parts of her body. It was only when Megan looked back at photos taken at the beach that she noticed a picture of her daughter Marnie, aged 22 months, holding her neck with an anxious expression on her face. Megan said: “This photo was taken only a couple of hours before I found the lump. I find it really strange how she was holding my neck exactly where the lump was with a slightly concerned look on her face, it’s as if she was trying to give me a little sign…”   In her own words on the JustGiving page , Megan said: “When the day arrived to discuss my results I was so scared we arrived at the hospital earlier than our appointment and we were called in straight away -never a good sign - and a doctor was sat waiting for me.  I felt like I was going to faint I can’t really remember what he first said but all I heard was I’m afraid to say that you have the Hodgkins lymphoma. It’s cancer and you will need chemo for your treatment.” “I broke down, it felt like my whole world around me was crashing and all I had in my head was my daughter Marnie, I need to be strong for her I need to get better for her. The journey home from the hospital was a blur I just went into some kind of strange daze and was hoping I would wake up soon and it all be a nightmare.  “I just kept thinking about how the hell am I supposed to look after a very energetic toddler whilst going through chemo, I want to be the best mum I can be to Marnie but how am I supposed to do that whilst trying to fight cancer? Another major concern of mine was how ugly I was going to look without my hair. I love my long hair and now that will be taken away from me as well. Megan had another devastating blow when she found out the cancer had spread to her neck, chest and liver. She said: I burst out in tears all I kept thinking was why me? I had so hoped in my head that it wouldn’t have gone to a stage 4 and then bang yet again more bad news. The reality of it all really sunk in then I was seen my one of the chemotherapy nurses and we had a long discussion. On the way out of the hospital I walked passed the chemotherapy suite and I just felt sick.  “I’m going to continue to blog throughout my chemotherapy treatment as I want to share my story and help raise awareness. when I was diagnosed I was constantly searching the internet to look at other people’s experience with going through chemo and fighting cancer in a way it gave me some hope and comfort that you are not alone so I want to do the same on my page. I want to document my battle so I can also look back on it and remember that I am a stronger person then I ever thought I could be.” "},{"url":null,"title":"tributes tragic new mum who","story":"NewsTributes to tragic new mum who died a week after giving birth to baby girlSamantha Mulcahy, 32, died at the William Harvey Hospital, where she welcomed daughter Thea just a week earlier\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByVictoria Chessum01:43, 13 JUL 2018NewsTributes have been paid to Samantha Mulcahy, 32, who died suddenly a week after giving birth to a baby girl\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTributes have been paid to a new mum who died just a week after giving birth a baby girl. Samantha Mulcahy, 32, from Folkestone, died suddenly earlier this month. Her family and friends say they have been overwhelmed by the support they have received over the past few weeks. Samantha lived in Hawkinge with her husband Ryan and died at the William Harvey Hospital on Wednesday, July 4. She had given birth to her daughter Thea just a week before.  Samantha worked at the Apples Nursery at the Saga Pavillion in Sandgate for around six years and had been much loved by her family, friends, colleagues and even the children she cared for at the nursery.  Close friend Thom McGarry, who spoke to Kent Live on behalf of the family, said: Sam was very well thought of.  Ryan will be an amazing dad and will really do Sam proud, and at the moment, everyone has been banding together. Everyone was shocked by Sam\u0027s death, but there is a real sense of support for Ryan to honour her memory.

But that does not mean we have to bow and scrape in his presence. The office of President of the United States deserves recognition, not the wayward personality who occupies it. Theresa May talked of shared values and mutual respect.  She should have reminded him that our values do not include retweeting posts by far-right groups, apologising for white supremacists and mocking the disabled.

But that doesn’t mean you can’t keep your motor sparkling\u0026nbspShareByHolly Thatcher14:27, 10 JUL 2018Updated16:00, 12 JUL 2018AdvertorialThere are ways to keep your car clean that don\u0027t involve using water (Image: Getty)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe first UK hosepipe ban of 2018 came into force on Friday, June 29, with residents of Northern Ireland now prohibited from using a hosepipe to water their garden, fill a paddling pool or wash their car (source: niwater).  While they can’t help with the first two, Halfords thankfully has a range of products to help keep your pride and joy gleaming in the sunshine. H2-No! Water is certainly a good way to wash a car. Hosepipe bans don\u0027t prevent you from filling a bucket but we also know that any frivolous water use is making the problem worse for everyone. According to Uswitch, washing a car with a hosepipe uses between 400 and 480 litres of water, whereas completing the same activity using a faithful bucket draws around 32 litres. But there are risks involved with using a bucket and sponge, too. Sponges can pick up harmful foreign objects which can damage the layers of laquer on the panels of the car. With that in mind, let\u0027s look at other options.  The ArmorAll Waterless Wash \u0026amp Spray, \u0026pound10, is designed to clean your car of light dirt and dust. Simply spray the sections of the car that you want to clean and then wipe them clean with a microfibre cloth. The spray helps lift the dirt from your bodywork and allows you to wipe it off without risking damage to the paintwork. It\u0027s a much more high-tech solution than using water and it\u0027s helping to save water during our heatwave too. You may need more than one bottle if your car is large, so bear that in mind before you start. Careful wiping    The first thing you\u0027ll need to remember is that dirt causes scratches if you\u0027re not careful. Make sure that you have a decent amount of microfibre cloths before you start. Halfords sell a five-pack for \u0026pound3, so you may want to pick up a couple. When you\u0027re wiping the spray off it\u0027s important to use a cloth only until it gets dirty. So fold your cloth in half and use it four times before putting it aside for washing later. It\u0027s also important to only wipe in one direction. This will help keep the dirt from scratching the paintwork. Take precautions  Once your car is clean it\u0027s a good idea to wax it. A coat of wax puts a barrier between the paint and the outside world to protect it from rainwater, spray and debris.

And he is eager to get going when the competitive games finally get under way this weekend away at Stirling Albion in the Betfred Cup.“It’s been good, I’m really enjoying it,” he added.“It’s a fantastic club, fantastic fanbase as well. Everyone has made me feel welcome, the boys are brilliant with me and the manager and staff are really good.“I’m enjoying it and just desperate to get back out on the park and get playing again.“The facility is brilliant, the hotel is nice, food and everything is good – it’s everything you want and it’s good to get the boys all together.“Being a new boy as well, it’s good to be able to get to know everybody that wee bit better and getting a better understanding with everybody, I’m really enjoying it.”Hamilton started Sunday’s game against Portimonense in Albufeira before being replaced halfway through by Elliott Parish with the score at 1-0.The final scoreline of 4-0 flattered the Portuguese side a little and Hamilton insists there was plenty of good work done to help their preparations for the coming campaign.“It wasn’t the result we wanted, it was disappointing in that way but it was good to get back on the park again.“It was difficult conditions, absolutely roasting, playing against a good side but I felt there were times we played well and are starting to look like a good team.“They were a good side, the effort from the boys was there, we lost a few bad goals but, other than that, the boys worked hard.“We’re all gearing up for Saturday.“It was good to get back playing two 45 minute halves, a full 90 minutes as well. It’s a game we’re looking forward to.”Former Hearts goalie Hamilton has a rival for the gloves at Dens Park, with last season’s No 1 Parish having done well in the Dundee goal following the departure of Scott Bain.The 28-year-old has already issued a challenge to his new pal Hamilton ahead of the campaign that he’ll have a battle on his hands.It’s not one the new man is likely to shirk away from, however.He added: “I don’t think there’s anywhere there isn’t a battle for the gloves but it’s a fight I’m really up for and I want to be playing.“I got a good run at Hearts, 60-odd games but I’m here now to further that and I’m desperate to get more games and make myself better.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee martial arts club hoping to kick on with teles community chest cash","story":"\t\t\t\t\tYoungsters at Team Extreme Kickboxing Club are busy getting ready to take part in an international competition, and they are hoping our own contest helps get them there.The group has signed up to take part in the Tele’s Community Chest, and are trying to collect at least 50 tokens before Saturday July 28 to be in with a chance of winning a share of £10,000.The group has been running for almost eight years, and is a family-run martial arts club and fitness gym based in Charleston.Jimmy Cavanagh, chief instructor at the club, said: “It’s for kids from primary one right through to adults.“I saw the competition in the paper.

However, it wasn’t to be as while he rummaged in his bag to find the ring, he was interrupted by a group of German tourists.With the mood killed, they went to the beach, but after sunbathing for just 10 minutes, Craig said they should go back to the hotel because he was too hot.He chose the balcony of their room which overlooked the lake to ask Aimee to become his wife.Aimee couldn’t even answer and instead simply burst into tears of happiness.After careful planning by the couple, the morning of the wedding arrived and the sun was shining.Aimee said: “When I woke up and saw the sun I was so happy that I was getting my outdoor wedding.“It made the photos taken by Burfly Photography from the day look really green and beautiful.“We had a flower wall created by Celebre which was stunning and it would have been a beautiful backdrop for the ceremony too.”The bride was accompanied down the aisle by stepdad Graham and the ceremony conducted by humanist Neil Anderson was the highlight of the day.“We made sure that the ceremony wasn’t boring and it was very personal,” said Aimee.“Neil was absolutely incredible and delivered our story in a fun way.“The night-time reception was brilliant but the day-time was our highlight.”The pair took to the floor to have their first dance as a married couple to The Verve’s hit song Lucky Man, which was performed by band Paper Tiger.Craig and Aimee would like to thank their wedding planners Katy and Fiona, videographers I Do, bridal shop Annarose and all their family and friends.Aimee added: “I wouldn’t change a thing about my wedding.

But these days the high street is packed full of ’90s throwbacks.“Celebrating Shout’s 25th year has given us all the chance to take that, often cringe-worthy, walk down memory lane. But it turns out we were all style icons of our time. It’s been amazing to see all the trends and reminisce about the music we were listening to and the programmes we were watching.”So just what were we all wearing back in 1993?All Saints, the girl band who formed that very year and are making their comeback in 2018, managed to make combat trousers look edgy yet girly by pairing them with crop tops and halternecks.Grunge was all the rage with tartan shirts – often worn tied around the waist – loose fit, ripped mom jeans and lots and lots of black proving popular.Doc Marten boots worn with oversized jumpers, denim shorts and tights, indie bucket hats as made iconic by the likes of The Stone Roses and Oasis, and the rise of chunky trainers – including the rather fabulous Reeboks Pumps where you could actually increase the cushioning around your ankles by inflating them yourself were also on people’s shopping lists.Now in 2018, it’s tough being a teenage girl – navigating social media and the pressure of perfection that comes with it, thinking about the future, juggling school work and friendships.But Shout has embraced this new digital age. Louise added: “Undoubtedly times have changed for teens but Shout has moved with those times and that’s why we’ve had such longevity.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"pharma company planning to close laboratory in dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tGlobal pharma company Eurofins has told workers it intends to close its Dundee laboratory in a blow to the city’s life science sector.The 29 Dundee-based employees were informed of the decision at the firm’s offices at Technology Park earlier this week.The lab is to close at the end of January as Eurofins plans to move its UK drug discovery business to France.Following the meeting, employees received a letter that stated: “As we advised in the meeting, the work will no longer be carried out from the Dundee premises (which will close) and instead be carried out from Poitiers, France.“As a result of this decision it is possible that the business may have to make redundancies, although (as you were informed) we will fully explore redeployment opportunities to avoid redundancies wherever possible.“We are therefore working with all employees of the company who are facing a potential transfer-redundancy situation.”Eurofins is an international group of laboratories headquartered in Brussels and is valued at about £7 billion.An insider said: “The proposal to close the Dundee office is being put out to consultation and the workers have been told that relocation is a possibility.“The staff’s reaction has ranged from anger to numbness.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b472a95edfd5-317x564.jpg ","title":"posties taken off delivery routes in dundee after being bombed by swooping gulls","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee posties have been forced off their rounds after being swooped on repeatedly by gulls.Several Royal Mail workers in Douglas have been temporarily removed from their routes because of the birds bombing towards them while they were making deliveries.While the aggressive animals, thought to be protecting their chicks, haven’t injured any employees, Royal Mail confirmed that some posties were temporarily replaced with other members of staff.A picture submitted to the Tele showed a gull heading towards the camera with small chicks seen on the rooftop of a house.One resident, who didn’t wish to be named, said: “I don’t have any axes to grind with the posties but a few of them have had to be taken off their rounds because of the gulls.“There have been some nesting on the roof of the houses in Douglas and that’s why they’re being bombed.“I don’t know if any of them were injured but I know that it was definitely causing them a bit of grief.”Balunie Drive resident Brian Harkins, 48, said: “I’ve actually noticed quite a few more of these gulls around this part of Douglas in the last few months.“It’s normally just the city centre where they’re always around you but there’s been a few more here. I’m not surprised if some of the posties were a bit concerned because they’re pretty menacing creatures at the best of times.”Royal Mail said deliveries were still being carried out as normal in the area, despite the change in personnel.Royal Mail spokeswoman Sally Hopkins said: “The safety of our people is paramount to Royal Mail.“Our postmen and women can experience difficulties out on delivery in some areas due to swooping attacks by gulls.“These kinds of attacks can occur at this time of year as the gulls are nesting and rearing their chicks.“Fortunately we have not had any instances of gulls attacking our people in the Douglas area of Dundee and mail deliveries have been taking place as usual.“We are monitoring the situation to ensure we can continue to deliver safely to customers in the area.”Gulls have proved to be a menace for people throughout the city in recent years.The Tele reported on Tuesday that wheelchair-bound Kim Ferguson, 36, had a burger stolen by a bird when it landed on her arm.Last month, 73-year-old Christine Kerr was taken to hospital after being smacked on the head by a gull in the city centre.Meanwhile, signs emblazoned with the words “beware the

He has also raised concerns at Westminster about such firms on several occasions.He said: \"People should not be charged inflated fees when they have paid for parking in good faith.\"The British Parking Association confirmed to me in person it is their view that people should not be charged if they have made an error inputting their registration.\"This guidance must be heeded by parking operators and, where it is not, there needs to be greater enforcement.\"He added: \"It is high time that operators like Smart Parking were removed from our city centres once and for all.\"The MP was responding to the case of Roger High, from Nottinghamshire, who failed to persuade Smart Parking to overturn a charge issued to him and will now have to cough up \u0026pound100.He said: \"In my appeal I explained that I had transposed two of the letters [in my registration number] and the fact that the registration number was so similar to my postcode that it was easy to make such a small slip.\"I was appalled and livid to receive an email rejecting my appeal, even though they acknowledged that I had purchased a car parking ticket, on the grounds that I had not purchased it for the correct registration number.\"Visiting the area frequently to see family, Mr High insisted Smart Parking\u0027s actions \"would not change\" his love of this part of the world.However, he revealed the experience had left him \"miserable and depressed as well as outraged\".Highland Council trading standards officer William Paul, who has been involved in long-running discussions with Smart Parking, said he was surprised to hear about Mr High\u0027s problems, believing there had been positive changes at the site.It is understood ticket machine key pads have been made bigger to reduce the chance of errors and new software aims to eliminate charges being issued when easily detectable genuine mistakes are made.\"We are encouraged by recent improvements in the operating procedures of the car park and to be fair to the company, these improvements do seem to be making a difference,\" he said.\"We are assured that these improvements are based on a firm commitment to resolve the previous reported issues, including incorrect vehicle registration mark (VRM) entries.\"He encouraged any drivers affected by charge notices to follow Smart Parking\u0027s appeals system and, if necessary, report the matter via the Citizens Advice Consumer Service on 03454 040506 or at www.citizensadvice.org.uk/scotland/consumerA spokesman for Smart Parking said: \"It is a contractual requirement for motorists to input their correct registration mark when parking at Strothers Lane Car park and failure to do so is a breach of the terms and conditions of parking there which can result in a Parking Charge Notice being issued.\"However Smart Parking acknowledges that motorists can make minor mistakes when entering their registration and as such working closely with Highland Trading Standards, has put in place measures to try to identify genuine mistakes against actual registration marks using the car park. Where the mistake is minor and the actual registration mark can be cross referenced Smart parking will endeavour to identify this and not issue the Parking Charge notice.\"Motorists are encouraged to double check their registration number before entering it and if those using the car park have entered a registration mark and subsequently received a Parking Charge Notice they are encouraged to engage with Smart Parking through our British Parking Association accredited appeals process.\"Friday 13 Jul 2018 2:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/03971000/03971780.jpg","title":"New air control system to be based at Inverness","story":"\u0026nbspThe board has also committed to undertaking a communities impact assessment as part of it Air Traffic Management 2030 project which will run all activities covering seven Scottish airports \u0026ndash Sumburgh, Dundee, Inverness, Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats, Kirkwall, Stornoway and Benbecula \u0026ndash from one centralised tower and surveillance centre.Hial managing director Inglis Lyon said: \"The scoping study identifies Inverness as having the most compelling case to support Hial\u0027 continued delivery of its core activities.\"We have also taken the views of our staff into account and Inverness was their preferred option should relocation be required.\"Inverness is best suited from a technical, operational and staffing perspective.

Peter Pan author JM Barrie was last seen at the Central Library in 1954.The book was spotted by a member of the public in a charity shop in London and was then posted back to stunned staff at the city centre library.Thankfully for the man or woman who found the book, they will not have to pay the late fees – estimated at around £1,500.JM Barrie’s book is one of a several he set around the fictional village of Thrums, which is believed to be loosely based on Kirriemuir in Angus, where he hailed from.Dallas King, events and programming officer at the library, said staff were shocked when the long-lost book dropped through the letterbox.He said: “We often get books returned to the library that are maybe a couple of days overdue but this particular book is 64 years, five months and 28 days overdue.“It was issued on January 13 1954 from this very library.“It wasn’t physically returned by the person who borrowed it.“It was actually found in a charity shop in London and a Good Samaritan has sent it up in the post with a note saying ‘I found this in a charity shop, thought you might want it back, it is slightly overdue’.“They found it and out of the goodness of their hearts had sent it back up.“It’s just great to have it back and it is a great story for the library as well.“The staff were in disbelief and excited that a book this old had been returned.“We have checked and it was taken out and issued and has been on a journey somewhere, who knows where, and has finally made its way back home.”The library is now considering displaying the book rather than returning it into circulation.The team is investigating how the book ended up more than 500 miles away over the last six decades.Dallas added: “Thankfully we cap our fines these days but I have worked out that, by going on the weekly rate, the fee would have been around £1,500.“Originally, we wondered whether the book was in too old a condition to put back on the shelves and we have thought we might put it on display as the book that travelled and came back.“I’m sure it is a novel itself working out where this book has been and finally it is coming home.”Operations convener at Aberdeen City Council John Wheeler said: “We are delighted to have this book returned.“It is astonishing that someone would hand it back after being issued it nearly 65 years ago.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"aberdeen

remove their boats from a historic Aberdeen harbour, following a long-running legal dispute.For the past four years fishermen have been embroiled in a turf war with landowner Pralhad Kolhe over a section of land where they store their fishing boats at Cove harbour.The fishermen claim that having the land open to park their boats is essential for their work and that visitors and tourists also use it.But Sheriff Andrew Miller has told the fishermen to remove their boats, along with their other goods and equipment from the land by the end of the month.In his judgment, he said the vessels occupied Mr Kolhe’s land “without any right or title to do so”.But he did take the view there is a pedestrian and vehicular right of access on to the pier and a right to park on the pier.Sheriff Miller also said pedestrians are entitled to access the foreshore but not to drive on to the foreshore.Fishermen Jim Adam branded the decision to remove the boats a “travesty” but said “some good” had come out of the dispute by gaining access for recreational groups to use the pier after it was blocked off with giant boulders.He added: “There’s been boats there for centuries and there’s an extensive fishing history.\u0026#8220The problem is there hasn’t been any mediation with Mr Kolhe, he won’t talk. He didn’t attend the hearing at all.”Mr Adam said the fishermen faced a “bit of a dilemma” in removing their vehicles.He said: “We need to get some lifting equipment in there but he’s got all these boulders in place.“He doesn’t own all the land, there’s a narrow strip of land which he doesn’t own. There are boats there already but we can maybe squeeze a couple of boats there.”The sheriff has indicated the boulder obstructing the pier should be removed.However, Mr Kolhe is entitled to keep boulders or other obstructions along the verges of the private road to prevent cars parking on his land.Sheriff Miller’s judgment said it appears boats have been kept on the land by fishermen “extending throughout and beyond living memory” until the present day and had been “generally a matter of informal local practice”.A letter issued to the fishermen from the landowner in 2014 said he wished to improve the land for “amenity use”.Mr Kolhe could not be reached for comment.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/07/5b4840f1917e4-940x552.jpg ","title":"hotel bidding to use the hamilton school site for major expansion","story":"\t\t\t\t\tNew plans have been lodged to extend an Aberdeen hotel by transforming a former private school.It was revealed in November last year that Graham and Gillian Wood, who own the Chester Hotel on Queen’s Road, had purchased the Hamilton School buildings, which have lain vacant for the past four years.The hotel has submitted an application to Aberdeen City Council to provide an additional 22 guest rooms on the site, in addition to its existing 50 bedrooms, and the hotel’s bar area will also double in size.At the time of buying the site, it had planning permission for an extension to provide 90 bedrooms in total but the new plans seek permission to build a smaller extension which the business believes to be more in keeping with the character of the Category B listed buildings.Stephen Gow, general manager at The Chester Hotel, said: “We’re seeking to replace what we considered to be a disproportionately sized extension for the footprint of the site with a minimal extension to the original building.“The plans are sympathetic to the stature and scale of buildings in Queen’s Road and will, with minimal intervention, knit the fabric of the existing Chester Hotel into the new properties.“We’re sympathetic to the architectural integrity of all of our Chester properties and have a track record of restoring listed buildings considerately, retaining their character and providing our guests, both here in Aberdeen and in Edinburgh, with a luxurious experience.“By removing some inappropriate building additions, which we believe are out of scale with the buildings at 55 – 57 Queen’s Road, we’ll hugely reduce what was the proposed developed area of the site.“Our new plans will remain sheltered in the existing footprint and will be in keeping with our West End location.“We have confidence in the market in Aberdeen and remain positive that our business will continue to grow.“This major investment cements our position as one of the city’s – and Scotland’s – leading independent hotels.”The owners previously said they were looking at a “number of options” for the West End site.The new plans will see the demolition of an existing large extension, which formerly housed the nursery of the Hamilton School, which will be replaced by a new addition with a footprint of 14m by 4m.This will form part of the new access link to the existing Chester Hotel and will also be used as part of an extended bar area.The design statement added: “This element will serve as part of a social hub for the new guest areas, and will use a similar architectural vocabulary to the formerly extended rear areas to the adjacent Chester Hotel – in particular The Granite Suite conference and wedding facility.“Smooth light-coloured render will be used for lower storey which shelters a small external terrace, with dark granite for the upper floor.“The part-glazed roof will admit light to the internal ‘terrace’ area.“This extension while deliberately modest in scale, will greatly improve the links between the existing villas and also provide a new sun-filled south-facing bar space.”Hamilton School was forced to shut its doors in 2014 when the Scottish Government and Care Inspectorate moved to shut it down amid safety concerns.In July last year Status Properties Limited submitted plans to convert the former B-listed school building into a hotel and restaurant complex, attracting objections from angry West End residents.The Queens Cross and Harlaw Community Council objected to the move, saying it would result in conflict with the amenity of the householders, but the application was later approved by councillors although not pursued.The hotel currently comprises a fine dining restaurant, lounge bar, spa and 50 bedrooms and the planned development would represent a significant expansion.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"one lane closed on busy aberdeen road for

Scotland played some great hockey and showed so much commitment and determination.“We’ve really improved as a team, and our opponents actually commented on this, which is a great accolade.“We play because we love it, but winning makes it extra-special. We’d like to think it encourages people of all ages to realise they can be involved with hockey, even on the international stage”The event saw them take on the Netherlands, England and Argentina.After being beaten by the Dutch in last year’s European Championships, the team were determined to get the upper hand this year. But, despite playing the better hockey and pressuring the defence, they couldn’t get past the goalkeeper and had to settle with a 0-0 draw in the initial game.The Scots had been beaten comprehensively by England in the Home Nations tournament, and played with determination against them in their second game in the World Cup, conceding just one goal in each of the first three quarters.However, a late effort by England made it 5-0 — a defeat but a big improvement on previous games for the Scots.This game also saw goalkeeper Sheila, of Aberdeen Grammar School FPs, who at 75 is the oldest on the team and of all the teams they play, awarded Scottish player of the match for an outstanding performance.Despite having the majority of the play against Argentina, Scotland lost 2-1. This meant they faced the Netherlands again to fight for bronze, rather than meeting England in the gold medal battle.Scotland started very strongly and, as in the first game against the Dutch, put their defence under a lot of pressure but could not convert their chances. As the clock was running down it looked likely the game would be decided on running penalties but with 20 seconds to go they were awarded a penalty corner.Following the push-out and initial shot saved by the keeper, another shot was made by Jill, of Bon Accord, which was partially saved, but pushed over the line for a goal by Janice.Janice said: “Everyone went wild including the crowd who had been supporting us. It couldn’t have been a more exciting ending as frustration turned to delight that we had won the bronze medal. I don’t think I have been more relieved to score a goal. Although it was me who scored, being in the right place at the right time, it was a team goal and deserved by the whole team.”Babs Buglass, also of Bon Accord, who played a major role in the creation of the Scottish Masters 10 years ago, also played her part in all the World Cup games, having been called up from the reserves just a week before the contest.And there could be further glory for the city’s senior players representing their country as a further eight female hockey players from Aberdeen will be playing for Scotland at the Exin Masters World Cup, which includes categories for those aged 40 and upwards, at Terrassa in Spain in the coming weeks.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"in pictures echt show through the decades","story":"\t\t\t\t\tTo coincide with this weekend’s Echt Show we’ve searched our archives for some of our favourite images of the event taken over the past few decades."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 27","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 10/06/18, 3:50 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.The last thing David MacInnes sees himself as is a hero.Be we believe differently.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"exciting shinty at the macaulay sixes","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 22/06/18, 8:15 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowNo fewer than 29 youth shinty teams travelled to Oban\u0026#8217s Mossfield Park for the annual Macaulay six-a-side competition.The winners of the main competition for P7 and under were Inverlochy, who defeated Taynuilt 1-0 in the final with Taynuilt taking the Oban Celtic Shield.The Alastair Campbell Shield for P5 and under was won by Braxi Boys from Inverlochy who defeated Bute in a very exciting final after extra time by one penalty to nil.The Macaulay Development trophy was won by Rockfield Rapids.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve.

Thanks also to everyone at MacPool, Argyll Cafe, Bargain Zone, Danny\u0026#8217s, Ferguson\u0026#8217s Butcher, The Archway, Crinan Cycles, Argyll Pharmacy, Square Peg, The Sweetie Jar, Dalriada Home Hardware, the Post Office and Maureen Roy for donating the great raffle prizes and Councillor Dougie Philand for being an excellent quiz master.And, of course, my appreciation to everyone who came along and took part.The event raised £120 which will help Lochgilphead Community Council put on this year\u0026#8217s festival on Saturday August 4 on Lochgilphead front green.Thank you everyone.Brian MacLennan, Lochgilphead Community Council.Sir,I have been working hard to address issues raised by my constituents. I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

The biggest cheer of the day was reserved for this year’s Queen Chloe Macdonald, who together with her Princesses Caitlyn Prentice and Cara Mackie were introduced to the crowd by Rev Robert Macleod and Councillor Anne Horn.Tarbert’s new Royal Family then led the famous festival parade where locals and visitors alike dressed up and joined in with this year’s Heroes and Villains theme.  Pirates and superheroes watched on as Cruella De Vil and her dogcatcher tried to capture more Dalmatian puppies. And the Batmobile was hot on the trail of the Joker who was seen heading through the village with Poison Ivy.One of the festival’s most eagerly anticipated events is the cookery demonstrations, once again led by Mike Leslie of Kilsyth’s Coachman Hotel. The market area was packed as cooks got some professional tips on how to prepare and cook seafood.While the adults tucked into some of Tarbert’s finest fish and shellfish, younger festival-goers were being wowed by the gravity defying Clan Stunt Bike Team, before learning new skills in the circus workshop.Highland dancing displays plus performances by festival regulars Mid Argyll Pipe Band ensured there was something for everyone, before Sunday’s Beer on the Pier, where party people of all ages packed Tarbert’s quay, ready to be entertained.Girl band Feeva promised and delivered ‘cheesy tunes’ and were closely followed by Scotland’s number one Take That cover band, Could It Be Take That, to keep the party atmosphere going. Local band The Democrats brought the curtain down on this year’s festival in style.With just three people in the festival committee it fell to organiser Margaret MacNeill to comment on this year’s event saying: \u0026#8216Thank you to everyone who came and joined in with this year\u0026#8217s Seafood Festival.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12468674.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_240218grant_07JPG.jpg","title":"maybole super school one step","story":"NewsMaybole super-school is one step closer to being builtCouncillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson15:27, 10 JUL 2018NewsNew Carrick Academy artist impression (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA \u0026pound42million super-school has taken a step closer to being built in Maybole. Councillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy. Plans will see Cairn and Gardenrose Primaries merge to become a new school located at the purpose-built campus. Nurseries for both schools would also merge to be ready for August 2021. St Cuthbert’s Primary – where parents responding to the consultation issued a rejection of the move – would also relocate but operate as a stand-alone school. A bid for funding will now be made to the Scottish Government. A total of 87 written responses were received during the council’s consultation that officials noted was “low considering the size of Maybole with a population of 4,700 people”.  Council schools spokesman William Grant said: “There is a general agreement of all schools to come together. “Where we had a more mixed response regarded the possible move of the swimming pool. “It is important as we progress the design that too much is not crammed in to this new campus. “It must be open and spacious.” Maybole Tory councillor Ian Campbell hailed the project as a “wonderful step forward”.

Nicola, 28-year-old classical singer married 30-year-old shipbuilding engineer John Hunter. The pair now live in Shawlands, Glasgow, but were both originally from Ayr. One Friday night back in 2009 John walked in to Harley’s Pub in Ayr to wish his cousin a happy birthday, and his sister told him to say hello to Nicola – her workmate at the time. “Nobody knows if it was the brown eyes, the sweet perfume or the six pints, three vodkas and the shot of Midori that caused him to steal my cardigan but steal it he did,” joked Nicola. She added: “A few days later, cardigan in hand, John returned it to H Samuel where I worked at the time. And that moment was the beginning of something special.” Since then both have enjoyed years of happiness and in October 2016 – seven years after meeting – John asked Nicola to marry him at Loch Lomond.  John and Nicola tied the knot on Thursday, June 7, at The Cruin at Loch Lomond. The couple said: “It was relaxing, elegant and absolutely perfect. “We can’t thank the staff enough. The weather, setting and scenery were breath-taking.” The bride wore a Vera Wang dress from David’s Bridal, Braehead, the bridesmaids also wearing gowns from David’s Bridal. The kilts were the Spirit of Lochearn tartan from Kilts 4 U. The wedding party consisted of Best man Mark Cosgrove, Groomsmen Niall Carney, Paddy McCurdie and Ryan Glass (nephew, aged 8), Maid of honour sister Jennifer Cassells, Bridesmaids Laura Dickson, Heather Armstrong and Aimee Trainer, Groom’s parents John Hunter and Hazel Hunter and the Bride’s parents Brian Cassells and Julie Cassells. The pair are currently celebrating being newlyweds in Bangkok, Thailand, and will be heading to Koh Samui, Thailand, then on to the Atlantis in Dubai.  3D Cakes created the couples wedding cake. The couple said: “We were inspired by the Scottish theme and used the same tartan ribbon that was on the kilts.” Kev Moulds Photography captured Nicola and John’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to look back on. The bouquets were arranged by Narcissus Flowers by Susan Hair and make-up was styled and created by Anna Wade (hair) and Lynn Brown (make-up). The couple added: “We would like to thank everyone who made the day possible, especially our parents Brian Cassells, Julie Cassells, John Hunter and Hazel Hunter. “And to our guests who contributed to an amazing day.” For more photos of the couple\u0027s big day, pick up your copy of this week\u0027s Ayrshire Post.

Bids of \u0026pound1.5million are being sought for Enterkine House, perched above Annbank. The luxury four-star retreat, which boasts 74 acres of land, employs around 50 staff. Kirk House and Steading, a six-bedroom farmhouse currently used as overspill accommodation for the hotel, is also included. Agents Christie \u0026amp Co and Galbraith said the plot offered “potential for development under a new owner”. It follows a long-running noise battle at the hotel which saw bosses spend \u0026pound80,000 soundproofing their wedding marquee. Council chiefs were told that slapping an 11pm curfew on party bands could put the hotel out of business.  But they finally got the all-clear earlier this year and revealed plans to build a permanent structure. However, the hotel is now being offered to the market. Bob Cherry, a partner with Galbraith, said: “The purchaser of Enterkine would find it relatively straightforward to continue the current business, which is well-established, and there are further opportunities for diversification or expansion of the tourism and events facilities on the estate, subject to the necessary consents. “This is a beautiful estate with a thriving hotel business and potential for further development.” Brian Sheldon, of Christie \u0026amp Co, added: “The market for country house hotels such as Enterkine House has vastly improved in recent years. “Its location in South Ayrshire and within such an enviable estate and countryside will attract local, regional and potentially international operators. “Whilst the business is trading well, there is certainly scope for further growth.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"royal troon golf club make","story":"NewsRoyal Troon golf club make generous donation to hospital unitIt follows a charity 18-hole golf event with Troon Portland and Troon Ladies, writes Charlene Bennie.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post15:39, 10 JUL 2018News\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRoyal Troon Golf Club has made the generous donation of \u0026pound1k to Crosshouse Hospital’s Acute Stroke Unit.

The word from them is that they got the best of care and were delighted we chose to donate to the unit” During the event, Stroke and TIA (Transient Ischaemic Attack) information packs were handed out, making it a great opportunity to spread awareness of how to act when someone is suffering from a stroke.  Andrew added: “We had a great day, great weather and we were glad we made a good amount for a good cause.

That’s the shock ultimatum delivered by warring SNP councillors to their embattled leader. Douglas Campbell has been ordered to regain control of his split ranks during the council’s summer break. It comes as rival camps “fight like rats” to wrestle the council’s power base back on track. A racism storm and failed coup on Councillor Campbell has plunged the SNP into crisis. And the Post understands another plot to oust the leader is now brewing. It follows all SNP group members signing a declaration of support for their under-fire boss just two weeks ago. But a party insider has revealed growing disquiet is threatening to tear the group apart.  Within hours of the public show of support, Cllr Campbell was being placed under increasing pressure to step down of his own accord, rather than face another bruising challenge from within, the Post has learned. A senior source said: “People agreed to fall in line and sign the declaration for the sake of the bigger picture. “But it’s widely accepted that a change is required and this can’t go on. “The group is in a position where people will fight like rats to get what they want. “However, the even bigger concern is trying to keep the administration intact.” Worries over a potential walkout from Labour colleagues has, until now, ensured enough SNP support behind Cllr Campbell. A potential change in the their leadership is thought that have strained relations with administration partners, who have indicated they are happier working with Cllr Campbell.  But the Post understands that Cllr Campbell’s Labour past is forming a big part of the problem for the SNP leader as he battles factions within his new party. And a new warning – issued as councillors left for their summer break – stressed that he must crack the whip among his troubled ranks. The source added: “It was made very clear that if he doesn’t, the matter will be taken out of his hands. “The party is being crucified every week and it cannot be allowed to continue. “Some see Douglas as being far too close to Labour and that is undoubtedly a big issue for him. “Either way, he’s been given the message in clear terms that he needs to get everyone behind him and on the same page.” When asked about the warning, the group’s depute leader, William Grant, insisted: “This is news to me.” Cllr Campbell added: “Cllr Grant responded to your enquiry that ‘This is news to me’ and I have nothing to add.” "},{"url":null,"title":"pool-at-hawicks-teviotdale-leisure-centre-to-reopen-after-co2-delivery","story":"HAWICK swimming pool will reopen later this afternoon (Thursday, July 5) following a delivery of CO2.\nA shortage of the gas, which is used to control PH levels of the water, forced Live Borders to close the facility at Teviotdale Leisure Centre this morning.\nBut, since the delivery, it is planned to open at 3.45pm this afternoon to cater for lessons.\nLive Borders are confident other pools won\u0027t have to close if scheduled deliveries of CO2 are made over the next week or so.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"travel-a68-cleared-after-lorry-sheds-load-of-hay-on-road","story":"THE A68 has reopened to traffic after a lorry shed a load of hay on the road this afternoon.\nThe accident covered\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspA68 in both directions at the A697, near Carfraemill at around 1.10pm.\nA cleanup operation swiftly launched to remove the hay from the road.\nTraffic Scotland\u0026nbspconfirmed at\u0026nbsp3.10pm today (Thursday, July 5) that the hay has since\u0026nbspbeen cleared off the carriageway.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch-see-inside-abandoned-galashiels-church","story":"A YOUTUBE video highlighting safety fears over an abandoned historic church in Galashiels is creating an online storm.\nThe video, filmed within the last fortnight, shows Galashiels resident Ian Macey jumping onto a flat roof and entering the 138-year-old St Aidan\u0026rsquos Church in Gala Park Road through an open window.\nIan highlights a lack of security at the building \u0026ndash which contains precious war memorials \u0026ndash vandalism, rotting floorboards and exposes its hidden health hazards such as asbestos.\nThe scenes have drawn criticism from some of the hundreds who have viewed the footage.\nIan told the \nBorder \n: \u0026ldquoThis is the second time I\u0026rsquove had a look around the church, after entering it earlier in the year.

Identity cards can be faked \u0026ndash phone the company to verify their identity.\n\u0026bull Some companies offer a password system. Ask your utility providers if this can be used and if you have a password with a company make sure the caller uses it.\n\u0026bull Never let people try to persuade you to let them into your home even if they are asking for help \u0026ndash they may not be genuine. If someone is persistent, ask them to call at another time and arrange for a friend or family member to be with you.\n\u0026bull Never agree to pay for goods or give money to strangers who arrive at your door.\n\u0026bull Don\u0026rsquot keep large amounts of money in your home.\n\u0026bull Remember, it\u0026rsquos your home. There\u0026rsquos no reason why anyone should ever enter your home against your wishes.\n\u0026bull If you\u0026rsquore not sure, don\u0026rsquot answer the door.\nFor more information, visit the Police Scotland website or contact your local community officer on 101.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"town-centre-building-set-for-facelift","story":"THE owners of a Bridge Street building in Kelso have applied to give their town centre property a makeover.\u0026nbsp\nDavid and Graeme Brechin, of Grant Avenue, Edinburgh, have applied to Scottish Borders Council for permission to renovate and repair the exterior of 6 Bridge Street.\u0026nbsp\nThe building is home to commercial properties, with a women\u0026rsquos clothes shop and charity shop occupying the ground floor, and the upper floors are divided into office accommodation.\u0026nbsp\nThe application outlined the aims of the proposal: \u0026ldquoRecently stonework had fallen off the building resulting in building standards involvement on public safety grounds and a scaffold has been erected.\n\u0026ldquoVarious options for repair have been considered, including renewing all the damaged stone with new natural stone indents but with 75 percent of the elevation delaminating it is prohibitively expensive and disproportionate to the capital value of the premises.\u0026nbsp\n\u0026ldquoRepairing individual stones in lithomix was also consider but is also not possible because of the large proportion of the fa\u0026ccedilade needing repaired.\n\u0026ldquoThe option the applicant wishes to pursue is for a more extensive render repair by cutting back virtually all of the facing stone, fixing an expanded metal base then expertly and uniformly stucco-rendering the fa\u0026ccedilade, scoring it to simulate ashlar stonework.\u0026nbsp\n\u0026ldquoCareful treatment around the window dressing, decorative eaves cornice and quoins will be carried out prior to the render coat application by a reputable, local stonemason, who will replace or repair the decorative stone to retain the character of the building.\u0026nbsp\nThe application will now be considered by Scottish Borders Council planning officers.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"noel-gallagher-tribute-band-to-play-galashiels-gig","story":"NOEL Gallagher fans in the Borders will be feeling supersonic as a tribute band rolls with it into the MacArts centre in Galashiels next week.\nThe band, named Acoustic Gallagher will be in town on Friday, July 13.\nThe gig will celebrate the songwriting talents of Oasis, as well as playing well-known classics and B-sides including Wonderwall, Champagne Supernova and of course, Don\u0026rsquot Look Back in Anger.\nDoors open at 7.30pm and music starts at 8pm.\nTickets\nare \u0026pound10, and are available by calling the box office on 01896 756852, or can be booked online at www.ticketsource/date/483994\nincluding \u0026lsquoWonderwall\u0026rsquo, \u0026lsquoChampagne Supernova\u0026rsquo, \u0026lsquoThe Masterplan\u0026rsquo, \u0026lsquoIf I Had a Gun\u0026rsquo, and of course, \u0026lsquoDon\u0026rsquot Look Back in Anger\u0026rsquo.\n\u0026lsquoSome might say\u0026rsquo that the Manchester band\u0026rsquos classics will receive an airing, along with work from Noel\u0026rsquos solo act, the High Flying Birds.\n\u0026lsquoWhat a life\u0026rsquo fans will also be in for a treat at the gig too.\u0026nbsp\nAdditionally, a licensed bar will be in operation on the night.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"galas-gareth-has-a-wicked-time-with-west-end-star","story":"AN aspiring performer from Galashiels has realised a lifelong dream by sharing the stage with one of musical theatre\u0026rsquos biggest stars.\nNineteen-year-old Gareth Williams, who is currently training for a BA (Hons) degree in Musical Theatre at The MGA Academy of Performing Arts in Edinburgh, was given the opportunity to provide backing vocals for West End and Broadway star Kerry Ellis during her 20th anniversary concert at The Queen\u0026rsquos Hall in Edinburgh.\nKerry is widely considered to be the one of musical theatre\u0026rsquos biggest stars and has previously starred in Wicked, We Will Rock You, My Fair Lady, Miss Saigon, Oliver!

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.  The film was given its first public screening in Swindon last month at the Swindon Arts Centre. Gilson, who spoke before and after the showing, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great pleasure to be able to finally show this in Swindon.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a film to be appreciated, and to spread a message.

Margaret and Keith Morris moved from a Dunedin Canmore property in Bathgate last September into the phase two of Mill House \u0026ndash an amenity housing development for residents aged 55 and over.  Mrs Morris said: \u0026ldquoThere is no privacy whatsoever.  \u0026ldquoPeople who park in the car park have been waving in.  \u0026ldquoThere were two young guys in a van and I was hanging out my washing and one was nudging the other.

They were sitting lined up in their cars looking to see what was going on.  \u0026ldquoI have sat outside with my breakfast some mornings and have had to lift my bowl of cereal and walk back in the house.  Mrs Morris said that although there were some trees along the boundary, they shed their leaves in the autumn, leaving the area bare.  She claimed that she and her husband had called on the housing association for permission to fill in the gaps in the fence to allow more privacy but claimed they had been told they couldn\u0026rsquot as another resident liked it that way.  \u0026ldquoWe wanted to get these slats which are only 94p. We would pay for them and fill in the spaces, she added.  She said they also called for a fence to be installed to stop people using an area past their flats as a shortcut to Tesco, claiming they were dumping rubbish including cans and bottles en route.  Neighbour Fiona Wilson said that motorists ate and slept in their vehicles and let their dogs out of cars.  \u0026ldquoWe are entitled to some sort of privacy, she added.  \u0026ldquoWe can\u0026rsquot go out \u0026ndash everybody\u0026rsquos looking at us.  \u0026ldquoMy bedroom is also to the front.  Another resident, who declined to be named agreed, saying: \u0026ldquoWe are getting no privacy and I can\u0026rsquot even sit out in the back garden for people looking in.  Alan Glasgow, Dunedin Canmore housing director, said: \u0026ldquoWe are aware there are a small number of residents at Eskmills Road who have concerns about the garden fence.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll continue to work with the community and local partners to see what can be done to help further increase privacy when people are using the nearby car park.

Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them.

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7994954.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"glory-days-of-golf-remembered","story":"  Musselburgh Museum on High Street is hosting an exhibition called \u0026lsquoMusselburgh \u0026ndash Cradle of Golf\u0026rsquo which is aimed at reasserting the Honest Toun\u0026rsquos importance in the sport\u0026rsquos rich heritage.  Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.  Organisers say the display shows Musselburgh\u0026rsquos leadership in developing golf and exporting it.  The museum is open on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 10.30am to 4pm each day."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8006789.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"coast-road-closed-after-car-overturns","story":"  Police said one person was trapped in a car which has overturned and they have closed the road while work to free them is carried out.

The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.  The site had long been earmarked for Sainsbury\u0026rsquos after it won a lengthy battle with Tesco to build on the site in 2013."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8009220.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dunbar-student-heading-off-to-the-olympics-of-tech","story":"  A games development team, made up of students from Abertay University, will take on the best in the world at the Microsoft Imagine Cup in Seattle.  The competition \u0026ndash dubbed the Olympics of Tech \u0026ndash seeks out the most innovative and potentially world-changing software solutions and comes with a first prize of $100,000.  Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey are sending the first and second place teams out to Seattle for the competition, which is in the last week in July.  \u0026ldquoIt is quite exciting, I\u0026rsquom just the artist on the team.  \u0026ldquoI do the models and particular effects and textures.  The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.  In April, the team from Abertay University took part in the UK finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup in London.  A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.  The Abertay team are focusing on making the simulator better before they head to Washington.

The young people would like to re-build the shelter with wider community involvement.  But Kathryn and Douglas Paul, who live at Glasclune Gardens, would prefer to see the shelter demolished.  Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.  The couple told the Courier they had experienced long-standing anti-social behaviour from youngsters who already gather at the shelter.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.

Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.

Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.

Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.

The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

In April, Police Scotland asked East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board to review the pub\u0026rsquos licence and that of its manager Christopher Darling.  However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.  James Hughes, who currently runs Dunbar Golf Club, asked the board to consider transferring the licence to him as he revealed ambitious plans to invest \u0026pound50,000 in the business with a view to eventually taking ownership of the property.  Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.  Mr Hughes, who has been at Dunbar Golf Club for several years, told the board he had more than 23 years of experience in the licensed trade and had worked in Edinburgh before moving to East Lothian.  He said that if given approval to go ahead the pub could re-open early next year.

About 14,000 primary and high school pupils in East Lothian have been visited at their schools as part of the trophies tour in the run-up to the Scottish Open, which takes place from next Thursday (July 12), and the Ladies\u0026rsquo Scottish Open which begins on Thursday, July 26.  Mr Martin said: \u0026ldquoThe trophies tour finale at Sanderson\u0026rsquos Wynd was an amazing day and these children not only got to see the trophies up close but also got to grill a brilliant professional athlete in Beth Allen.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.  However Mr McKinnie said alternatives would be looked at if it received a boost in its support.  He said: \"During the summer months orders can fall as low as 10 a week which is not sustainable. It really is a case of \"use it or lose it\".\"  A spokesperson for the Food Assembly said no public statement on the withdrawal was being made before the end of August.  She said: \"The announcement has been made to our network of hosts and producers, many of them will communicate to their members when they are ready, and we will do a public communication in August.\""},{"url":null,"title":"talented-teenage-drummer-clara-wilberforce-joins-national-youth-pipe-band-of-scotland","story":"  Clara Wilberforce, who has been playing the snare drum since she was in P6 at King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, has linked up with the National Youth Pipe Band of Scotland\u0026rsquos development band.  That came after a rigorous audition process, which saw the 15-year-old perform to a group of judges.  Proud mum Juliet told the Courier it had been an eventful period from the audition to finding out that Clara had been successful.  She said: \u0026ldquoShe went to the National Piping Centre in Glasgow and she did her audition and she came out and said \u0026lsquoI did so badly, I messed up\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe was so disappointed and I said to her that she was very young.  \u0026ldquoShe was terribly disappointed but I said \u0026lsquonever mind, you are young and will get another chance another year\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe had been in tears and she felt she let herself down.  \u0026ldquoWe forgot all about it and then suddenly emails were coming through to her and myself.  \u0026ldquoShe came tearing down the stairs screaming at the top of her voice that she got into the development band.  \u0026ldquoShe was running round the house, up and down the stairs screaming with joy.  Her first event will feature Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain at the Phil and Aly RSNO St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day Concert at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on November 25.  Music runs in the family, with older brother Ninian, playing the pipes, while Juliet plays the piano and dad Marcus is a member of Haddington\u0026rsquos Siancio Singers.  Clara, who is in S5 at Knox Academy and studying Higher maths, English, geography and human biology, is also a member of the school\u0026rsquos pipe band as well as Haddington Pipe Band, where she is a senior drummer.  Her mum, who praised the efforts of Davey Barnes, who runs Knox Academy Pipe Band, and Dave Henry, drum teacher, said Clara \u0026ldquoloves the drumming and she had made a number of good friends through music and boosted her confidence.  Alastair Bruce, chairman of Haddington Pipe Band, congratulated Clara, who lives in the town, on the achievement.  The youngster won the band\u0026rsquos Niall Fairgrieve Award in 2014 for most improved drummer and has continued to impress.

Now his son Kit, who lives in Belhaven, has released a new version of the tale which looks at Chris\u0026rsquo 30-year career with the company, its characters and ships.  The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.  Kit \u0026ndash who last year released The Triumph and Tragedy of the Bantams, which focused on a band of \u0026ldquobrave but largely forgotten soldiers \u0026ndash has added his own stories of being a \u0026lsquoMacBrayne Child\u0026rsquo.

The 51-year-old, whose nephew is Scotland rugby star Huw Jones, has driven a taxi for nine years to pay his way through university and has built his own film studio and edit suite at his home in Longniddry.  The dad-of-three said: \u0026ldquoThe TV course has been a brilliant journey.  \u0026ldquoColleagues often ask where I find my energy, and sometimes I have to ask myself the same thing, especially at 4am when I have forgotten to go to bed. Perhaps my endurance and resilience comes from my 12 years as a commando.  \u0026ldquoThere have been sacrifices, the biggest of them being to have had no social life throughout this time, but I am passionate about television and I am now talking to production companies and hoping to make my mark in the documentary genre.  While Matt admits it was \u0026ldquoeasy to feel envious of weekend revellers partying, he said driving taxis allowed him to refine his interview skills for his TV career ahead.  And among those to grace the back seat of his cab over the last nine years have been the likes of Angus Deayton, Ian Lavender, Paul Merton, Alexei Sayle, Ruth Madoc and Steven Berkoff.  Matt, who served with the Royal Marines in Northern Ireland, has already completed a music production with National Museums Scotland for a new exhibition on Scottish pop from the 1950s to present day.

Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history.

He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.

Five of those who lost weight suffered a \u0026ldquosignificant loss, according to the report by the Care Inspectorate officers who visited the home during an unannounced three-day inspection in May.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed it had suspended admission to the home following the report, which has now been fully revealed, after it emerged last month the home had been ordered to make urgent improvements after inspectors raised \u0026ldquoserious concerns.  HC-One, which operates the home, says it has introduced a new home manager and it pointed to some of the more \u0026ldquopositive comments in the report which acknowledged staff were praised for their approach to residents.  A spokesperson for HC-One said: \u0026ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our residents is our highest priority and we take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate extremely seriously. We are pleased their full report included some positive comments about the home, particularly noting our staff team are \u0026lsquokind and caring\u0026rsquo in their approach to residents.  \u0026ldquoWe also recognise we need to do better in some other areas. To do this, we have a new home manager in place who is being supported by the wider management team, and we continue to work closely with the Care Inspectorate and relevant authorities as we implement our improvement plan.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased significant positive progress has already been made, and are confident the home is in a better place than at the time of the original inspection.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue working hard each and every day so that we are consistently providing the standard of care that Residents deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Care Inspectorate have recently returned to the home to commence a new inspection, and we look forward to demonstrating the positive changes to them.  Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done. They will be supported in this by a multi-disciplinary team from the partnership."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8061096.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"bus-mounts-pavement-in-tranent","story":"  The 62-year-old, who was driving an empty Prentice coach at the time of the incident, is understood to have taken ill at the wheel as it pulled out from a bus stop.

WHAT do we remember of our childhood in our later days? Think for a moment of the key happy memories which have framed your childhood. They are often simple ones involving play outside. Sadly, research is showing that children are increasingly less able to explore and play in the outdoors.  There are various reasons for this and there is a horrible irony at the centre of it. We have become far more obsessed with material things, it\u0026rsquos all around us. We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.  But my melancholy did not last long. It was a day of joy and we thanked the wood as we left."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8065339.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"day-two-of-the-aberdeen-standard-investments-scottish-open-at-gullane-golf-club","story":"  Reed is 10-under-par overall and three-under for the day through the first six holes of his second round.\u0026nbsp  Tyrrell Hatton has led for much of the morning, and recently shared top spot on the leaderboard with Masters champion Patrick Reed and List.

The remaining nine per cent were don\u0026rsquot knows.  The findings increase the pressure on Ms Sturgeon as she considers her next move in the escalating constitutional fight with Westminster over Brexit.  The First Minister called a second referendum in March 2017, then \u0026ldquoreset her plan three months later after the SNP lost a third of its MPs in the general election.  She had promised to update MSPs on a \u0026ldquoprecise timescale on a second referendum this autumn, once the shape of the final Brexit deals becomes clear.  Earlier this week, her Brexit Secretary Michael Russell suggested a second EU referendum could double as an independence vote if the 2016 result was repeated and Scotland backed Remain and the UK voted Leave.  There is fight between the UK and Scottish governments at the Supreme Court between now and the autumn, which could end in Westminster trampling over Holyrood\u0026rsquos alternative Brexit Bill, a huge moment the SNP would add to their case for independence.  But the lack of popular support for a second plebiscite will be a concern for the First Minister.  Nevertheless, the poll also found support for independence slightly higher than in the 55-45 No vote of 2014, with 53 per cent opposed and 47 per cent in favour, excluding don\u0026rsquot knows.  The Scottish Parliament voted last year in favour of Westminster transferring the power to hold a referendum, but the request for a \u0027Section 30 order\u0027 was rebuffed by Theresa May.  If Ms Sturgeon pushed again for a referendum, the Prime Minister would almost certainly refuse again, but the SNP could cite the snub in the 2021 Holyrood election as evidence of Westminster arrogance, as they try to win a clear-cut mandate for a new vote.  Professor Sir John Curtice of Strathclyde University said the poll showed that, despite SNP hopes of a shift in opinion, Brexit was still having little impact on the independence question.  He said: \u0026ldquoAlthough the SNP have had somewhat the better of the argument in the row about the impact of Brexit Withdrawal Bill on the powers of the Scottish Parliament, there\u0026rsquos still no sign of any significant change in the level for support for independence \u0026ndash or much evidence of enthusiasm for an early ballot among the party\u0026rsquos supporters.  The Unionist parties said Ms Sturgeon should drop an idea the public didn\u0026rsquot clearly want.  Scottish Labour Leader Richard Leonard said: \"The people of Scotland want the government focused on jobs, schools and hospitals, not another referendum campaign that creates false divisions between working class people when the real divide is between the richest and the rest of us.  \"The chaos at the heart of the Tory government has focused people\u0026rsquos minds on the extreme challenges of leaving a political and economic union, and it is clear that there is not strong support for Nicola Sturgeon to try and force another referendum onto the agenda.\"  A Scottish Tory spokesman said: \u0026ldquoThis poll again shows the majority of people do not want a second referendum - and they overwhelmingly don\u0026rsquot want one any time soon.  \u0026ldquoNicola Sturgeon should use this research as motivation to take the threat of another divisive vote off the table.  The SNP highlighted the narrowing between the Yes and No sides on independence compared to 2014.  MSP Derek Mackay, the party\u0026rsquos business convener, said support for independence remained at historically high levels, \"with a Yes majority within the margin of error and well within touching distance\".  Dropping a hint that Ms Sturgeon was minded to push for a second vote, he said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore not - yet - in the heat of an independence campaign.  \u0026ldquoBut as Westminster moves from chaos to utter shambles, proving beyond doubt it is incapable of protecting our interests, the case for independence becomes ever stronger.  \u0026ldquoLittle wonder that since last year there has been a marked rise in the number of people who back giving the people of Scotland that choice over their future.  \u0026ldquoWith the full powers of independence we could make better choices in Scotland\u0026rsquos interests and avoid the damage of a Tory Brexit.  Scottish Green MSP Patrick Harvie added:\u0026nbsp\"It\u0026rsquos remarkable that support for independence remains so high given that the Yes movement hasn\u0026rsquot done a single bit of formal campaigning.  \"The status quo will no longer exist in March 2019 and I suspect that voters in Scotland will come to demand a say on whether we should be dragged along with this Brexit mess.\"  Survation interviewed 1002 Scots online between July 5 and 10."},{"url":null,"title":"sketch-new-boy-raab-caught-with-his-trousers-down-metaphorically","story":"  The well-scrubbed minister rose to deliver his first Commons dispatch box speech in a calm and considered manner when, after a minute or so, the chamber descended into uproar.  The only thing missing in this Whitehall farce was an MP in his pyjamas chasing a semi-naked woman through the chamber.  Labour MPs stood up, sat down and stood up again, pointing this way and that to complain they had not yet seen sight of the Government\u0026rsquos two-years-in-the-making White Paper on Brexit. Julian Smith, the wide-eyed Government Chief Whip, started mumbling in colleagues\u0026rsquo ears as a ripple of concern spread along the front bench.  The words \u0026ldquodisgrace and \u0026ldquoshame bounced around the chamber. Comrades Ben Bradshaw and Angela Eagle were looking up at the press gallery, gesticulating to members of the fourth estate to helpfully lob down their copies.  MPs\u0026rsquo indignation had been increased because HM Press had preferentially been given sight of the controversial document hours before MPs had.  As the tumult rose, so did the Speaker, crying: \u0026ldquoOrder. Order.  Referring to MPs\u0026rsquo \u0026ldquoconsiderable unhappiness, John Bercow, in his usual non-patronising way, asked if the minister would rather stop so MPs could get sight of the missing document. Mr R caused more uproar when he suggested it was on its way.  When the Speaker pointed out how some copies had been made available to \u0026ldquosome people, MPs began pointing furiously at the hacks up in the gallery.  Mr Bercow repeated his nudge-nudge, wink-wink suggestion to the minister but the penny still did not drop. MPs anger intensified when Mr R nonchalantly noted how the paper was available on the Government website.  Seething Labour MPs started to walk out while others began shouting \u0026ldquoPoint of Order, at which the Speaker finally gave in and suspended the sitting until MPs could get a copy of the document they were supposed to be debating.  Later, Mr Bradshaw and others returned with boxes, theatrically flinging copies of the document to colleagues.

He had gone to Barra to learn colloquial Gaelic and record local singers and he and Margaret were married in Glasgow in 1935 and settled on Barra.  In 1938, she and John moved to the Isle of Canna after he bought it and it is here she would live for the rest of her life.  He divided his day between cultivating the land, and transcribing the hundreds of Gaelic songs and stories he had recorded on Barra, South Uist and in Nova Scotia.  Margaret accompanied him and recorded it all for posterity by taking photographs and cine films to capture every moment that he met and recorded Gaelic communities.    American heiress Magret Fay Shaw outside the MacRae sisters house  One of the films is of Margaret returning to Glendale in 1955, bearing as a gift for the MacRae sisters her newly published Folksongs and Folklore of South Uist, which she had collected and would not have been possible without the encouragement and knowledge of the sisters.  But while some of the cine films have been seen and some of the pictures published, this is the first time the entire collection will be chronicled, labelled and produced in chronological order from 1929 to her death in 1996.  The National Trust for Scotland intend to make it available online for future generations to enjoy.

Everyone knew what needed to be done and all mucked in, no questions asked.  \"But they also capture how everyone had an individual role too and listening to the Gaelic tapes provides a fascinating soundtrack. There are songs to collect the kelp to, shear the sheep and to cut the peat, each with their own sounds and tempo.  \"This is a truly unique archive and chronicles a unique way of life. It is a fascinating task bringing it all together and I hope to be enjoyed by future generations\"."},{"url":null,"title":"firm-loses-legal-bid-to-keep-trams-documents-secret","story":"  Bilfinger UK had instructed lawyers to return back to the Court of Session in Edinburgh seeking a ruling from appeal judges over a decision made by their colleague Lord Tyre earlier this year.  The firm wanted judges Lord Carloway, Lord Menzies and Lord Malcolm to block moves to publish paperwork, saying the information contained was \u0026ldquocommercially sensitive and could help competitors.  Lord Tyre refused to allow the company permission to stop the inquiry publishing the documents, which includes monthly reports made during the tram project to the firm\u0026rsquos German HQ.  Lawyers acting for the company argued Lord Tyre had incorrectly nterpreted the law.  But in a judgment published yesterday, the appeal judges ruled Lord Tyre had acted correctly.  In a ruling written by Lord Carloway, Scotland\u0026rsquos most senior judge, the appeal judges concluded the documents didn\u0026rsquot contain sensitive information that could damage the business\u0026rsquos interests.  Lord Carloway wrote: \u0026ldquoThe Lord Ordinary had some sympathy for the view that the respondent\u0026rsquos reference to the information being available to individuals who were no longer employed by the petitioner\u0026rsquos group, was an irrelevant consideration\u0026nbspgiven that such employees\u0026nbspwould be the subject of contractual restraints.  \u0026ldquoHe held, however, it was not a material one. Whilst the court agrees with that reasoning, in fact the respondent was correct in its view, that the information would be available to those no longer employed by the petitioner\u0026rsquos group.  \u0026ldquoIt is not an unreasonable assumption that there will be many former group employees who will have been involved in many projects involving similar information and reports, who have moved on to work for other concerns.  \u0026ldquoWhatever the contractual restraints, historical information on the petitioner\u0026rsquos working estimates and margins of the type under consideration would likely to be held by many working elsewhere in the civil engineering field.  The Edinburgh trams project, which caused massive disruption to the capital, was delivered years late and more than \u0026pound400 million over budget.  The inquiry into what went\u0026nbspwrong has run for three years and cost \u0026pound7 million.  Bilfinger handed over the documents to the inquiry. But it didn\u0026rsquot want the documents to be made public.  The inquiry\u0026rsquos chairman Lord Hardie decided to publish the material because he thought it was in the public interest for it to be made available.  He ruled that Bilfinger hadn\u0026rsquot shown exactly why the information contained within the documents was commercially sensitive.  This prompted Bilfinger to go to the Court of Session. Lord Tyre concluded that the inquiry acted correctly.  The firm then appealed to the Inner House of the Court of Session. But their bid there has also been rejected.  In the judgement published on Thursday, Lord Carloway wrote: \u0026ldquoThe court will refuse the reclaiming motion and adhere to the interlocutor of the Lord Ordinary dated May 8 2018."},{"url":null,"title":"britain-to-keep-free-movement-in-eu-say-brexiters","story":"  The 98-page UK Government White Paper that expands on the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos compromise Chequers Plan is a confirmation of her softer approach to Brexit, which led to two Cabinet ministers resigning and has enraged the Brexiteer faction in her own party.  Also, the Government\u0026rsquos proposed customs solution \u0026ndash the facilitated customs arrangement - will have a \"phased\" implementation Whitehall sources have suggested this will not be completed until mid-2022, two years after the end of the transition period.  Jacob Rees-Mogg, who leads the 60-strong group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs, unleashed a fierce attack on the Government paper, saying: \"The overall consequence is that we will be a rule-taker, de-facto subject to the European Court of Justice and it\u0027s hard to believe that there is even a tinge of pink left in Mrs May\u0027s red line on this.  Suggesting the PM had broken her promises given in her earlier keynote speeches, he declared: \u0026ldquoWe have not known such vassalage to the continent since King John paid homage to the King of France in 1200.  The Somerset MP insisted his party leader\u0026rsquos policy on immigration meant nothing as it kept open the \u0026ldquooption of free movement by another name and added: \u0026ldquoThis White Paper has not needed age to turn yellow.  In a Commons statement, Dominic Raab, the new Brexit Secretary, said the paper set out a vision for \"a bold, ambitious and innovative new partnership with the EU, principled and practical, faithful to the referendum it delivers a deal that is good for the UK and good for our EU friends.  The Government, he explained, wanted to maintain parts of a \u0026ldquocommon rulebook for goods to maintain \"frictionless trade at the border\" after Brexit and so avoid a hard Irish border.  While the European Court will shape the trade rules, Mr Raab sought to reassure MPs, saying control of laws would be taken back by means of a \u0026ldquoparliamentary lock on the process and that MPs would have \u0026ldquoproper democratic oversight.  A new governing body would police the new institutional arrangements through which, the paper said, the UK Government \"will represent the interests of all parts of the UK in this forum, ensuring the interests of the devolved administrations are taken into account.  But Fiona Hyslop for the Scottish Government said the paper offered \u0026ldquolittle reassurance for those worried about the impact that leaving the EU will have on our economy quite simply, these plans fall short and will harm our economy.  The SNP administration\u0026rsquos External Affairs Secretary said it would \u0026ldquoargue for much greater engagement with the UK Government to ensure Scotland\u0027s interests are protected\".  In the Commons chamber, Mr Raab\u0026rsquos first appearance at the dispatch box in his new role descended into chaotic scenes as Labour MPs erupted in uproar, shouting \u0026ldquodisgrace, because they had not had prior sight of the paper when the Secretary of State rose to his feet.  To make the MPs\u0026rsquo sense of outrage worse, it was pointed out how journalists had been briefed by Whitehall officials and had had sight of the policy document before parliamentarians got to see it.  Such was the tumult on the green benches that John Bercow, the Speaker, had to suspend the sitting until MPs were able to get copies, which were handed out by their colleagues from boxes obtained from Westminster officials.  Labour\u0026rsquos Sir Keir Starmer, denounced the Government\u0026rsquos handling of the launch, telling MPs: \"The utter shambles of the last 20 minutes that led to the suspension of the House during a statement is clear evidence of why the Government is in such a mess.\"  The SNP\u0026rsquos Pete Wishart said the incident summed up the \u0026ldquowhole chaotic and clueless Brexit as prosecuted by this shambles of a Government.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe White Paper was supposed to deliver Cabinet unity, but all it has done, as we have seen, is demonstrate the divisions. Scotland did not vote for any of this, so can the Secretary of State perhaps suggest a way that Scotland might be spared this madness?  Mr Raab, to Conservative cheers, replied: \u0026ldquoWe voted in the referendum as one country and we need to respect it as one country.  Earlier, Donald Trump, who is in Britain for, among other things, a working lunch with Mrs May, when they will discuss Brexit, appeared to question the PM\u0026rsquos Brexit strategy.  He told reporters \"I would say Brexit is Brexit. The people voted to break it up so I would imagine that\u0027s what they would do but maybe they\u0027re taking a different route. I don\u0027t know if that is what they voted for.\"  In response, Mrs May said: \u0026ldquoWe have come to an agreement which absolutely delivers what people voted for."},{"url":null,"title":"sports-minister-calls-for-no-balls-games-no-more","story":"  Public health and sports minister Joe FitzPatrick included the idea - for which the Tories swiftly claimed credit - in the SNP government\u0026rsquos new Active Scotland Delivery Plan.  The plan, which also advocates more cycle and walking networks and helping children play outside safely, aims to cut physical inactivity in adults and teenagers by 15 per cent by 2030.  This equates to around 250,000 people becoming more active through sports, walking, cycling and informal physical activity such as gardening.  Other steps include more community sports hubs in the most deprived areas, more sport for pupils before and after school, doubling the budget for cycle and walking infrastructure to \u0026pound80m a year, and encouraging more women and girls to participate in physical activity.  The government also recommends getting rid of the warning notice beloved of park-keepers and council jobsworths down the ages.  \u0026ldquoWe will promote a supportive approach to physical activity, play and sport in public spaces, and encourage removal of signs which discourage this, e.g. \u0026lsquono ball games\u0026rsquo signs, it said.  Only eight per cent of Scots play football at least once a month.  Launching the plan at an Edinburgh school that is also a community sports hub, Mr Fitzpatrick said: \u0026ldquoBeing physically active is one of the best things we can do for our physical and mental health. It can also transform communities by helping people connect and come together in shared activities.  \u0026ldquoCutting the level of physical inactivity by 15 per cent by 2030 means addressing all of the factors involved. This includes relatively large action such as investing in our active travel infrastructure so people can easily walk and cycle, and supporting initiatives such as Health Walks for those who need help to become active, to small acts such as encouraging removal of \u0026lsquoNo Ball Games\u0026rsquo signs.  Professor Fiona Bull from the World Health Organisation said: \"Regular physical activity is one of the best things you can do for your health. It can contribute to a healthier and more sustainable future for our children.  Tory MSP Brian Whittle said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad the Scottish Government has adopted my idea of removing \u0026lsquono ball games\u0026rsquo signs. That will help create more open spaces, and just allow children to play again without fear of being told otherwise by authorities.  \u0026ldquoBut this in itself will not be enough. The SNP is far too piecemeal in its approach \u0026ndash ideas on physical activity need to be done in tandem with diet and education.  LibDem MSP Alex Cole-Hamilton said a \u0026ldquonational falls strategy was also needed, to persuade the elderly that walking activities would be safe.  He said: \u0026ldquoFear of falling vastly reduces the orbit of your social universe and for many older people having no confidence in the safety of pavements and footpaths can lead to the double whammy of isolation and inactivity.  Green MSP Alison Johnstone said an Active Nation Commissioner was needed to help fix \u0026ldquodecades of underinvestment in our walking and cycling routes.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe need urgent, stronger action if we really want to get people active, and address health conditions like obesity and diabetes.  \u0026ldquoWe clearly need better opportunities for young people to take part in sport in school, all too often pupils have a very limited choice of sports and activities."},{"url":null,"title":"women-should-avoid-using-talcum-powder-between-their-legs","story":"  Johnson\u0026ampnasbsp\u0026amp Johnson has been ordered to pay 4.7 billion US dollars (\u0026pound3.6 billion) to a group of 22 women who allege the company\u0026rsquos talcum powders caused their ovarian cancer.

To mark the project’s completion, Provost of Aberdeenshire Cllr Bill Howatson, Communities Committee chair Cllr Anne Stirling and representatives of Bancon Homes toured the site and met with tenants on Wednesday, July 4. Provost Howatson said: “We had the perfect day to visit the development and we are very grateful for the hospitality shown by the tenants. “I’m impressed with the quality of the properties, and it’s clear that the residents are very proud of their new homes. I wish them all many years of happiness at North Street.”Aberdeenshire Council is currently in its sixth phase of its affordable housing development programme, which will see 130 properties built across the area from 2017-2019.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Friday 13 Jul 2018 2:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Halkirk butcher hangs up his apron for the final time","story":"IT was the end of an era in Halkirk as local butcher Hugh John MacKay hung up his shop apron for the last time.Hugh, who ran MacKay\u0026rsquos of Halkirk as well as the Lifestyle Express grocery store, decided to retire after five decades of service.However, the Bridge Street butcher\u0026rsquos shop will still be run by a MacKay as Hugh\u0026rsquos son Matthew will take overHugh was the third in line of MacKays who owned and ran the butcher\u0026rsquos shop for the Halkirk community.Hugh grandfather, John, started the enterprise with a store in Lybster before setting up the shop in Halkirk then it passed on to Hugh\u0026rsquos dad \u0026ndash who was also named Hugh \u0026ndash with his uncle Angus taking over the Lybster shop before handing it over to his son, David.As for the Halkirk shop, Hugh, now 68, was only 16 his father died, \u0026shyleaving the family to take over the running of the shop.Hugh revealed it would not have been a success without the determined work of his mother, Belle.He said: \u0026ldquoI had just turned 16 when my father passed away.

The recruitment of three GPs is particularly remarkable considering a quarter of GP practices across Scotland have vacancies.\u0026ldquoThe recruitment of all the clinicians will improve the continuity of care provided by the practices while introducing access to a specialist primary care physio at the three sites.\u0026ldquoReducing the reliance on temporary locums will enable NHS Highland to save money while improving care.

The Scottish government has said this area could be an example for other places to follow.Sir Anthony says there is an expertise at Dounreay which \u0026ldquoa lot of places would give their eye teeth to have and it could be used to help the local economy.Caithness strengths are its people, their skills and the natural beauty of the place, but access to the area needs to be improved.Asked about any disappointments during his time as chairman of the partnership, he replied: \u0026ldquoI hoped MeyGen would have got the Contract for Difference \u0026ndash it covers an agreement on the price for the electricity generated \u0026ndash from the UK government, but they did not. That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor.

Pupils at Wick High could also miss out on extracurricular activities, it was stated.At present, Stagecoach runs a service to Gills Bay three times a day, Monday to Saturday, but from next month it will operate twice a day, Monday to Friday. There are additional journeys between Wick and John O\u0026rsquoGroats but they vary according to school hours.A Stagecoach spokeswoman said the company recognised the feedback from the community over its plans. \u0026ldquoThe revised proposals represent a significant investment by Stagecoach, and work will continue to promote these links to encourage a sustainable level of demand. A review will take place 12 months after the start of the new timetable in order to establish the long term future of the bus service to Gills Bay.Trudy Morris, who chairs the Caithness Transport Forum, said: \u0026ldquoWe are very pleased to see that Stagecoach has listened to the local community and agreed to secure the bus link to Gills Bay for a further 12 months. Not only will this bring benefit to local bus users, who would otherwise be isolated in their communities, but it also has potential to benefit the tourist market, providing services to link with the Gills Bay ferry.However, she is concerned about the review in 12 months time and said: \u0026ldquoWe will be working with Stagecoach and the local community to see what can be done to promote usage of the route, and will also be discussing with public sector partners such as Highland Council to see what might be done to secure the route on a non-commercial basis in future.Bill Mowat, the chairman of Gills Harbour Ltd, claimed public pressure had an impact on Stagecoach and pointed out there was strong opposition to the plan.Friday 13 Jul 2018 2:38 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July 12, 2018 at 4:28 pmNo roads surface dressing work is planned for Friday or Monday, July 13 and 16.

Last November, Loganair flew Teddy over 200 miles back to Kirkwall for a tearful homecoming with his young owner.Officially launched to mark Teddy Bear Picnic Day, this Tuesday, July 10, the furry keepsakes come with their very own Loganbear luggage tags as well as outfits mirroring the tartan look and feel of the airline’s own uniforms. Throughout the summer months, children will be able to pick between a Logie or Lotti bear once they come onboard a Loganair aircraft, distributed by the airline’s flight crew.The airline is running a number of social media competitions and promotional activity featuring the bears throughout July and August and will also be launching its Instagram channel to showcase the two toys.Kay Ryan, Commercial Director at Loganair said: “We’re very much looking forward to giving some of our youngest passengers a special memory of their trip with Loganair and what better day to unveil the two newest members of our crew than Teddy Bear Picnic day.“Logie and Lotti will be flying with us all summer and our crew can’t wait to introduce them onboard.“Last year the airline did everything it could to reunite a young girl with her lost teddy so this summer we thought we’d try and share some of that joy with children travelling with us.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This could run into millions of pounds and put at risk the future viability of the business.The company have also met with local Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur, to express their concerns about the delay.As the start of this month, as Mr Matheson stepped into the shoes of the previous minister for transport Humza Yousaf, it was announced that lack of agreement between the Scottish Government and Pentland Ferries had led to no discounted fares being introduced in Pentland Firth ferry routes, by the Government\u0026#8217s self-set deadline of the end of last month.Andrew Banks, Managing Director and Owner of Pentland Ferries said: “We want these passenger subsidies implemented as soon as possible but we need to be 100 per cent sure that the scheme complies with state aid rules.  We have never had any subsidy from the government and even though this scheme gives money to the passenger, not the operator, the minister has told us that we would be liable for any repayment if at a future date the scheme is deemed illegal. This could run into the millions and could finish us off.“We cannot take that risk and we have a responsibility to our staff, our community and family to make sure the scheme works for everyone. We want to work with the Minister and his team to discuss a way forward so that we can all benefit from reduced fares. This scheme will be fantastic for our business, attracting more visitors to the islands and making it cheaper to travel to the mainland for residents. So we want this unlocked as soon as possible. We welcome the Minister’s willingness to gain a full understanding of the detail and very much hope to be able to meet him in Orkney soon.”The minister, Mr Matheson, was asked for a response to the comments from Pentland Ferries and Mr Banks. At the time he replied, Transport Scotland said the invitation had not yet been received so the minister could not comment.However, Mr Matheson did say: “The Scottish Government remains committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles. I am conscious that there is a great deal of interest in this issue amongst users of the services. As I begin my new role as Transport Secretary, I want to ensure that I gain a full understanding of the detail — it is already very clear to me that planning to introduce reduced fares on the Northern Isles network has been a complex and challenging piece of work.“As a first step, we will cut fares on the Aberdeen-Lerwick and Kirkwall-Lerwick services from June 30. These reductions will be around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.“On routes to Orkney, it has been necessary to engage with commercial operators on the Pentland Firth. We set out a very fair and reasonable proposal that would maintain competition, enabling them to protect their existing market share. Unfortunately, not all the commercial operators have felt able to agree to our proposals. This means we cannot currently implement reduced fares on any of the routes to and from Orkney without the risk of legal challenge.“This is both disappointing and frustrating, but I am determined to work through the issue to see what more can be done. I have asked Transport Scotland to undertake some further work to see what measures, if any, we can take. As part of that, we are willing to reopen talks with commercial operators.  I will provide a further update to stakeholders and to Parliament as soon as I can, with a view to bringing the full benefits of the scheme to the people of Orkney and Shetland.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This will help reduce the initial barrier of connection for a defined period of time.Two events are planned at the St Magnus Centre in Kirkwall, from 6pm to 8pm on Wednesday July 11 then from 10am to 12pm on Thursday July 12 with a further event at the Doubletree by Hilton, Glasgow Central, from 10.30am to 12.30noon on Friday July 13 and finally, a webinar will take place on Tuesday July 17 from 10am to 12pm.Registration is required for the Alternative Approach consultations via the following link: https://www.ssen-transmission/news-views/articles/2018/6/solving-orkney-s-catch-22/Commenting on the Alternative Approach consultation events, Lauren Milligan, commercial policy manager, said: “As a customer-driven initiative, stakeholder engagement has shaped the Alternative Approach proposal to date.“We want to ensure that we develop a solution that not only works for network companies but also the wider industry and other connection customers and would therefore encourage anyone with an interest in our proposed Alternative Approach trial to register for one of our consultation events.”The final stage of consultation is planned to take place in Autumn on the various components of the transmission reinforcement project in advance of submitting planning applications to the relevant planning authorities, the Scottish Government, Marine Scotland and Orkney Islands Council.The progression of the project is subject to all necessary planning consents and securing regulatory approval from industry regulator Ofgem, with the Alternative Approach trial also subject to regulatory approval.For more information on the proposed Orkney transmission reinforcement, including links to both consultation documents, click here.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It\u0026rsquos not an easy decision.\"We\u0026rsquove listened to customers, colleagues, communities and elected representatives and we continue to do so.\"We\u0026rsquove committed to making no further changes to the size of our branch network in Scotland until at least 2020 \u0026ndash and not to remove or replace, at a suitable nearby location, the branch ATM if there\u0026rsquos no other free-to-use ATM within 1km of the closing branch.\"The way our customers are banking is changing and it is important that we respond to that change. Across Scotland, usage of our branches is down 42 per cent since 2014. Only one per cent of our customers in Scotland visit their branch on a regular weekly basis. Seven in 10 customers are using mobile or online banking.\"\"We recognise that every customer will have different banking needs and we are committed to ensuring all our customers receive the best possible service.\"We\u0026rsquove invested to provide more ways to bank with us now than ever before.\"He added: \"We\u0026rsquove committed to keeping 10 branches open until the end of 2018.\"Johnston Carmichael has been appointed to carry out an independent review into these 10 branches and are meeting with local customers, representatives, employees and stakeholders in all ten communities to understand the impact of each individual closure.\"We have committed to accepting the recommendations of this review in full.\"Friday 13 Jul 2018 2:39 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4768111.1531420726!/image/image.jpg","title":"jim duffy where is bono in the world s hour of need","story":"        Once the world had a superhero ready to jump on his private jet at a moment\u0026#8217s notice, writes Jim Duffy.                There was a time when all we needed to do was click our fingers and great things would happen. In times of world crises, when the politicians couldn’t quite manage to pull things off in a timely and seamless fashion, we could turn to one trusted soul to sort it all out.            From The Troubles in Ireland to the townships of Soweto, this man could make things happen. He had the ear of British Prime Ministers and US presidents. He had more super-human strength than Christopher Reeves and more cunning than Batman. But, he’s gone now. And we need him even more. Yes, it’s time to bring back Bono...            I recall in my early 20s listening to the U2 album, Live at Red Rocks. The frontman of this soon-to-be super group was Bono. At the time, he had all the makings of an Expendable and Incredible, all in one small package. But this super-hero could sing! He would knock out powerful tones with cogent lyrics designed to make us think. Supported by his fellow band members, Bono grew to international stardom. This was epitomised by his fabulous and haunting appearance at Bob Geldof’s Live Aid. Or was Midge Ure involved there also? Yes, I’m pretty sure that Midge played a key role there Bob. But, he seems to have been whitewashed from the credits. Not for us Scots though.Anyway, back to superheroes. Bono stole the show with his rendition of the U2 song, Bad. He came into the crowds, just like Jesus and the early prophets did. He hugged some wee lassie plucked from obscurity. He broke the risk management and crowd control rules to be “at one with people”. It was just brilliant to watch. And despite my nervousness about his prophetic actions, I do enjoy banging it on on YouTube every now and then. Yes, Bono was on his way to world saviour.READ MORE: U2 singer Bono says sorry over claims charity staff were bullied            He made damn sure that he used his superpowers well. He had the ear of the people and the they loved him and his music. A bit like Russell Crowe in the movie Gladiator, where he won the hearts and minds of those in the Coliseum, causing the young empower some angst. Winning hearts and minds always works well and Bono knew this.He had massive global reach and could sing about anything he wanted. If I’m not mistaken, it was Bono and Jim Kerr from Simple Minds who got Nelson Mandela freed right? Maybe not that simple, but I don’t know who else did. Do you? But, alas, after all his caped-crusader efforts to free us from tyranny and the forces of evil, Bono has going missing.At a time when one of the most decisive leaders of the Western world lands in Scotland and the UK, I have to ask the question. Where in God’s name is Bono when you need him? Only Bono could release us from the grip of this Western oligarch. Only Bono could be strong enough to stand up to President Trump and say: “No way!” Only Bono could have us – the proletariat – hanging on his every word as he tells, no demands, politicians do the right thing.            But, he is nowhere to be found and perhaps he does not want to be found. Has this superhero gone forever?In the USA, another live wire and actor superhero has had a go at President Trump. Robert De Niro has been vocal pre- and post-Trump’s election.De Niro has stood on platforms and denounced Trump, stating he would like to “punch him on the face”. Powerful words from one of the best-known (fictional) gangsters in the movie world. But, on this occasion, I do not see this particular “luvvie” making any real impact. It takes more than making an impassioned speech with the f-word thrown in to have an effect at red-carpet dinners. De Niro has failed, but he gets points for trying. This now makes the reappearance of Bono so much more of an issue.READ MORE: Paradise Papers: Bono and Mrs Brown’s Boys star in offshore tax have claims            Only Bono knows that a superhero has to get off his ass and on a plane, albeit a private jet, to make an impact.  After all, no point in Bono queuing at Stanstead airport waiting for a Ryanair flight that may be cancelled due to pilot industrial action this month. And Bono was willing to jet across the globe with the likes of Slick Willy Clinton to get that “money shot”.  When Bono hit the tarmac, he made it count. No politician was safe. Any God-fearing politico that refused an audience with Bono to discuss the s*** that was occurring in their country under their watch was doomed.Wee Bono would be giving speeches, hugging babies and sitting down with rival politicians to make you feel bad. So, why endure the Bono treatment when you should just meet him and acquiesce to him?  This world feels like it is in tatters right now. Never before have we needed a character like Bono to get behind. He was fearless and knew how to knit it all together to create some form of outcome. But I don’t think old Bono will be coming out of retirement all that soon. He has fought enough fights and has the scar tissue to prove it. So we need another superhero who can gel us together. And it can’t be Gareth Southgate – yet.  We need a new superhero to coalesce around as he or she or they hold Trump and others to account. The problem is right now, I cannot think of anyone suited to the role. Let’s keep praying in the meantime..."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4768117.1531420811!/image/image.jpg","title":"leader comment may s brexit plan is a bit like charge of light brigade","story":"        The Government\u0026#8217s Brexit White Paper has come under attack from all sides but at least provides hope of avoiding a disastrous \u0026#8216no-deal\u0026#8217 divorce from the EU.                “Cannon to right of them, Cannon to left of them, Cannon in front of them, Volleyed and thundered Stormed at with shot and shell, Boldly they rode and well, Into the jaws of Death, Into the mouth of hell, Rode the six hundred.”            The Charge of the Light Brigade was an infamous military mistake, but it is sometimes forgotten that the near-suicidal cavalry charge actually succeeded in taking the Russian guns during the Battle of Balaclava in 1854.            In finally spelling out the detail of what “Brexit means Brexit” actually means with the publication of a White Paper, Theresa May has sounded the charge.Tory backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg – along with assorted other hard Brexiteers – was quick to open fire from the right, declaring May’s plan to be the “greatest vassalage since King John paid homage to Phillip II at Le Goulet in 1200”. And, from the left, Labour said the Government was in “a mess”, Len McCluskey, of the Unite union, said the proposals were a “fudge which pleases no one”, and the SNP’s Fiona Hyslop warned May’s plan would “harm our economy”.Directly ahead lies the European Union, whose big guns have yet to start firing but may well do if they conclude the White Paper would undermine the principles that hold the EU together.READ MORE: Brexit White Paper plans ‘will harm Scotland’s economy’            With some politicians viewing May’s Brexit as too soft and others too hard, opinion further divided by party affiliations, and Labour looking for any chance to bring down the Government, it is difficult to see how the Prime Minister can win a vote in the Commons.And, if the UK cannot agree its position, it appears there will be a “no-deal” Brexit in March next year with severe economic consequences for Britan and the real risk of disaster – companies relocating or going bust, mass job losses and social unrest. That must not happen. Perhaps May and her supporters will manage to make it through their own metaphorical Valley of Death, but if they do not, there needs to be a plan for what happens next.Earlier this week, Sir Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, called for cross-party talks “with a view to establishing a government of national unity” and for a second referendum. If the UK is to avoid a no-deal Brexit, both suggestions – met with scorn in the Commons – may need to be seriously considered.

Susan Aitken, who leads an SNP minority administration, spoke out after an online petition calling for all Orange walks to be banned in the city attracted more than 70,000 signatures.            Police are investigating after Canon Tom White, who was speaking to parishioners outside St Alphonsus Church in the Calton district last Saturday, was spat on twice before being lunged at by a man with a baton.            The Grand Orange Lodge of Scotland said its members were not responsible and condemned “the bigoted actions of those involved”.The incident has once again called into question the number of Orange walks that take place in Glasgow each year and the agreed procession routes they follow.Ms Aitken said today she had “strong sympathy” with the petition but added the council “simply does not have the power to enact a blanket ban on parades by any organisation”.READ MORE: Church calls for Orange Walk rethink after Priest attackedShe added: “I have instructed officers to ensure that we use the powers we do have to their fullest extent and have asked Police Scotland colleagues to assist us in doing that - the council can’t legally act without grounds being given to us by the police.            “I’ve also asked for ways of objecting to planned parades to be made much more prominent on our website and made available through the My Glasgow app. We can only act on objections made in advance, on specific applications.“I will ensure Glasgow City Council does everything in our power to respond to the strength of feeling this petition demonstrates - but it would actually be better directed at MSPs, who have much more power than Councils here. They could strengthen the 2006 Act that governs us.“I would urge MSPs to consider their own powers and responsibilities.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless.

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve.

And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday.

Any avoidable delay in receiving essential treatment is unacceptable.\n\u0026#8220Many of these passengers have been waiting for their appointments for months if not years, and have no way to access the treatment and specialists they need at home.\n\u0026#8220Travelling out with the isles for medical treatment is already stressful for vulnerable isles residents without the added anxiety caused by cancellations.

Our website is up to date with the latest information.”\nUnite regional officer Wullie Wallace expected talks with Acas next week. The dispute is over pay for airport workers.

The workforce for several years now has received below inflation increases and the company’s idea of rewarding its hard working employees is by offering more real terms pay cuts.\n\u0026#8220Aberdeen Airport has been investing heavily into improving the airport facilities and amenities. It’s high time for the company to invest in its employees. Unite remains open to further discussions with a view to resolving the dispute.\u0026#8221\nAn unattributed quote from an Aberdeen spokesman stated: \u0026#8220We have been informed by Unite of their intention to take industrial action on Friday 20th July.\n\u0026#8220This follows the rejection of our proposed pay offer. We believe we have made an offer that is entirely fair and reasonable and we are committed to continuing discussions to reach a resolution acceptable to all parties.\n\u0026#8220We have made contact with Acas which has agreed to mediate between both parties. We are seeking a suitable date to continue our discussions in an attempt to reach a mutually agreeable position.\n\u0026#8220We will, as a matter of course, ensure contingency plans are in place in the event of any planned industrial action.”\nI am amazed that the Scottish Government will allow a union to hold hostage urgent healthcare for 45,000 citizens in Shetland and Orkney.

tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking snaps of the huge storms as they crossed Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Texas.\nScott told the Strathy: \"The four of us flew out to Tornado Valley in the hope to witness some of the planet\u0027s most extreme weather.\n\"We decided to put our meteorological skills together and chase the storms ourselves.\"\nThe group of Reading University graduates rented a car and travelled 7000 miles over the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nFriday 13 Jul 2018 2:40

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government will be free to make its own arrangements regarding the design and collection of any replacement tax\u0026rsquo, yet, as we have seen time and time again with this Government, the arrangements on offer, limits the ability of the Scottish Government to make changes to benefit the Scottish economy.\u0026nbsp\nIn his response to the Highland MP, Mr Jenrick confirmed that his department was willing to work closer with the Scottish Government to find a solution to the problem, recognising the commitment outlined in the Smith Commission.\nResponding after the debate, Mr Hendry said: \u0026ldquoI am glad that the UK Government recognises it has failed to hand over APD in a workable way, and that Airport Departure Tax cannot be implemented by the Scottish Government without a solution to this problem.\n\u0026ldquoI hope that the assurances from Mr Jenrick today, are followed up by meaningful action from the UK Government, to enable the Scottish Government to introduce its reduced Airport Departure Tax, while protecting the Highlands and Islands exemption.\"\nFriday 13 Jul 2018 2:40 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales.jpg","title":"former sabhal mor ostaig chairman","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nFormer Sabhal Mòr Ostaig chair Duncan MacQuarrie was celebrated this week with the first road in the new Kilbeg Village development, Rathad MhicGuaire (MacQuarrie Road) named in his honour during an official ceremony held on Monday.\nThe ceremony was carried out by Kate Forbes MSP and recognised the key role which Mr MacQuarrie has played in the college\u0026#8217s development over many years. Sabhal Mòr Ostaig principal Prof Boyd Robertson said, \u0026#8220This is a richly-deserved honour for Duncan which recognises the hugely important contribution he has made to the development of the college over many years and the vital contribution he has made to the development of the Gaelic language and culture and to the advancement of Gaelic and Gaelic-medium education, both as a teacher and as a former HM Inspector.”\n“Duncan\u0026#8217s critical input to Sabhal Mòr Ostaig’s development in its challenging formative years was marked by his steady stewardship, as a former chairman and his pioneering work, alongside that of his fellow trustees, demonstrated an exemplary vision and commitment without which what is now the National Centre for the Gaelic Language and Culture would not have existed.”\n“For that, all who have benefited from this wonderful and inspiring place, over the intervening years, owe him a great debt of gratitude and it is for that reason we celebrate with him here today.

The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve.
