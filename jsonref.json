The low number of positive tests means its estimates should be treated with caution.One of the Government\u0027s top scientific advisers said that, after reviewing the R rate study and ONS report, they think \u0027this is all probably trending upwards, very gently.\u0027 They warned more younger people were testing positive and suggested it was only a matter of time before they began to infect older citizens who are far more vulnerable to Covid-19\u0027s nasty symptoms.The ONS\u0027 daily infection predictions are much different to the Government\u0027s official daily count, released by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) every afternoon. Testing data is collected by the ONS from swab tests sent regularly to people\u0027s homes to test whether they are infected with the virus at the time. The people are chosen to be representative of the UK population.The households taking part in the survey were tested for Covid-19 regardless of whether they had symptoms or not.Thousands of people become infected but never request a test and so go unreported in the DHSC\u0027s statistics. Going by the official metric, 1,051 Britons are now testing positive for the life-threatening disease each day, on average - which is half of what the ONS predicts.For comparison, the rolling average on Thursday was 1,043 and it had been falling every day since August 15, when the figure reached a six-week high of 1,097."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91f29d61c10cc02ba03dfab64d8783edcc6a9971/0_393_5930_3560/master/5930.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7efad45dc4cb5fa856f2a4424be1a30","title":"loved and lost simon bray photo essay","story":"Photographer Simon Bray’s project Loved and Lost deals with the loss of loved ones. He asked each participant to find a photograph of themselves with their lost loved one, and they returned to the location to replicate the image. The project aims to provide a platform, allowing others to acknowledge their loss, and to celebrate the person they loveDeath has a stigma and the burden of grief can hold us captive if we let it. May this be a process through which a loved one can be remembered and through which memories can be relived. Even though the pain of the loss may remain, may this go some way in relieving the hurt and the stigma of death and act as a public declaration that death has lost its sting.I ask each participant to find a photograph of themselves with their lost loved one. We then return to the location of the original photograph to replicate the image.It is a chance to think back and remember, to tell the story of that day and of the person that they have lost. Imagery allows for expression beyond what we can speak of. I hope it is an experience that contributes to the restorative process in overcoming the painful impact of loss.We all have a different experience of loss that can reveal itself in many ways. Sometimes it’s a response that is quite clear for those around you to see. Perhaps there are lots of emotions that they just don’t know how to let out, they’re not sure how they should be feeling or whether it’s right to be having certain angry or complicated thoughts.It’s not about having the best photo, saying the right thing or having the answers, I just want to give people a chance to speak about their experience of loss.My aim was that the combination of the photos we took and the conversations we had, we would be able to portray a deep personal story. This allows other people who are struggling and going through similar experiences to look through and find strength and comfort in the story, knowing that other people have been through it and are confident enough to share their story.I lost my father to prostate cancer in December 2009. When my dad died, it wounded me in the deepest part of my being. The loss shaped the following few years of my life and will continue to do so, but I don’t have to let it define who I am. Through this time, it was really helpful to be able to talk about my dad. I wanted to share with others about the person he was, the emotions I was feeling as I processed the grief, and talk about the influence he had – and continues to have – on my life. Those conversations were often hard and few and far between, mainly because people just didn’t quite know how to respond.I’m Alistair, and my dad was James. The original picture was from the beach at Swanage in Dorset. I’m not sure how old I was there, but it was a family holiday. We loved to go down there and find a pitch for the day, Mum and Dad would soak up the sun and me and Tim, my brother, would build sandcastles and splash around, and repeat until we had to go home.He was a very loving father, he provided for his family, looked after us. He taught me a lot of principles about always doing the best, always trying to be the nicest person and to make sure that others were looked after and cared for. When you look back you realise you’ve been prepared by your parents to live your life. Dad always just wanted to treat others how he’d want to be treated.When we got the dementia diagnosis, several years ago, we had noticed over time that he was getting more forgetful. He wouldn’t use my name, he was losing his hearing, his vision wasn’t great and I lost him as a dad over those years. I still loved him as my dad, but I knew I wasn’t necessarily going to get that reciprocated, which was tough. He still offered to help when I mentioned to him about moving flat he’d say “well let me know if you need a hand”. I think that’s just his character through and through and I always just try to emulate that.I went to see him in the care home and I said to the staff that I’d like to volunteer in the garden if possible, even if he wasn’t aware of me being there, I could just help out and spend some time with him, but then we went into lockdown and that was the last time I saw him when he was awake and alert.When the Covid thing came along, it was like losing him for a second time, but this time, obviously, for the last time. It was difficult because I had kind of processed losing him in a mental sense, and now I was losing him in a physical sense.I did get to see him before he passed away and it was just a completely different experience because I had to wear all the PPE. In the past, I’d just always assumed he’d be there for years to come and you don’t think about it ever being the last time, whereas I went there, got dressed up and they said you’ve got 15 minutes. It was horrible having this countdown clock, where you have this time limit on how long you have left with someone. I just set it on my watch and it’s just counting down. I was thinking, I’ve got 30 seconds left with my dad, 20 seconds left, 10 seconds left. What do I do? What do I say? And I just panicked.It made me reflect on how many times I’ve seen or called my parents and thought that maybe I’m quite busy and I haven’t really got time for this, but I’ll see them next week. I’ve gone away thinking that it’s OK that I didn’t see them for very long today because I’ll see them in the future.It’s given me a real appreciation for just taking a second to appreciate that when you’re with family or a friend, that you don’t know necessarily when you might see them again and that’s why you have to make the most of the time you have with them. I’m trying to act on it in a positive way, rather than just thinking about why I feel that way because of Dad.It’s absolutely OK to cry and be a blubbering mess sometimes. If you try to stop it, you’ll feel a lot worse. I know that particularly for men there’s this societal pressure to be a strong support and a rock for people, but for your own sake, for men and women, to let your body do what it needs to do. You want to cry because your brain is telling you that you need to process this, to not fight it but to let it happen, then you’ll feel that pressure is unloaded.My name is Jonathan. The picture of myself and dad was taken on Christmas Eve 2019. We’d had Christmas together for the previous 54 years and it was a tradition we never broke. It was a fabulous event, we went out for a meal and then came back and exchanged gifts here.My dad was 88 and he was getting old, things were failing. As a son it’s really upsetting when parents get older. I would do anything to try and make his life easier. I saw that he was walking badly and he said that the flesh on his feet was getting thinner and thinner and it was painful to walk. He’d never been into a Nike store, but he hobbled in, and then pretty soon we were having him trying on lots of pairs and we fitted him up with a pair of Nike Air Max. He was virtually running around the store, which was really lovely, really heartening. I felt as though I’d knocked off 10 or 15 years!He was so busy, I couldn’t keep up with him. I’m half his age, but he was out every night of the week. He would attend choirs, he was in the Greater Manchester Police Choir, the church choir, he was in Probus. I just don’t think he liked being at home.He was the person I’d known longest in my life, he was always there. He was a bit like Switzerland, he never really offered a view, but he was always there to support me and catch me if I fell or tripped. It’s three months since he died and I’ve spent the last three months going to call him every day. So it’s been difficult.He was the 12th coronavirus victim in the UK, so it was right at the very start. The health service and society as a whole didn’t know what to do. They didn’t know how to process and deal with the virus at that stage. So that was really difficult, because we couldn’t go to see him. We were only allowed to see him at the very end with lots of protective equipment, but if he hadn’t have had the coronavirus he probably would have been here today, because they would have treated his underlying health issues. It’s really, really difficult.He died on Friday 13th, which I just couldn’t believe. The last time I saw him, we’d had a chat and I’d said what a cool dad he was, that he’d done a really good job, and he said, “No, I don’t think I was that good”, which I thought was really sweet. I said goodbye to him and went into the anteroom, where I had to take off all the protective equipment. I was halfway through taking it off and he called me back, but I couldn’t go back because the room had a positive air pressure, so I’ll never know what he wanted me for. That went with him to the grave.It sounds really strange, but it’ll be very odd when the pandemic ends, because it has felt like a very intimate time, in that we went into shutdown and I could think about my dad’s experience, but it was like a shared experience with the whole of the world. I dread to think of other families going through the same thing that we went through. When someone dies of cancer or a heart attack, it’s dreadful, but that’s the moment. Whereas my dad died on the 13 March and from that point on, coronavirus has been on the news every minute of every hour of every day. It was like someone sticking a knife into the wound all the time, there was no escaping from it. As a family we felt properly battered.Normally if you suffer a bereavement you have the support of family and friends, and we couldn’t go and see anyone. We were in lockdown before the country, in our own lockdown, so it’s been a very lonely time. Every step along the way was difficult, it felt as though we were unfortunate pioneers. The first funeral director that we went to wouldn’t deal with us. It’s been unusual.At his funeral, we only had 10 people there and I liked it because it was nice and quiet. I’d discovered tapes of him singing so we actually played him singing a song on the way out and it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. That was really magical.My name is Philip and the photograph is of me and my parents. We bought this caravan in 2016, and they were very much part of our lives, so they would come for a weekend. We are in the very north of Anglesey. If you think of the island as a clock, then we’re at 1 o’clock, overlooking the most northerly lighthouse, Point Lynas.My dad was a travelling salesman for James Stewart and Co in Ardwick, opposite Manchester Apollo. His turf was Moss Side. He used to sell from a catalogue going door to door and he was well known in the area. He did that for 30-odd years.My mum brought us up, two boys who liked to fight and liked to be boys. She was also the bursar at the Ryleys school in Alderley Edge, and was very into amateur dramatics, so was part of the Wilmslow Green Room Society. She was in a lot of plays, then did a lot of backstage and in her older years did a lot of wardrobe, so there’s a team of six that meet every Tuesday to talk and sort the wardrobes out.Mum had coughs, she definitely had Covid.She was fit and healthy, walking a mile a day, in the drama group. Dad was playing golf and doing the garden, but he died of a broken heart, basically. Even though he did test positive, he never had a cough or any real symptoms. I lost both parents in 48 hours. My family is my world, so the only reassurance is that we were telling them to stay in, eat and have the paracetamol and do what the doctor says, that they’d get through it and to be strong.My brother still lived with my parents and had to give CPR to both of them. They were in lockdown, so even after both parents dying, Peter had to stay in the house for another five days and we weren’t allowed to visit. It’s all that stuff that you don’t hear about and have no idea what people are going through. To this day, he has not had any symptoms. He’s never been tested, nobody approached him, but he’s never had a day of illness. We were only allowed 10 people at the funeral when we could have had 200. We printed 100 orders of service and posted them out to different people, just so there was something for them to share on the day. We did a video, so we can share that with people, but obviously nobody got the funeral that they wanted.For the first three weeks after my parents died, I became a bit of a counsellor. People would ring me up and I’d have to explain everything and say well, we have to look for the silver lining in it all, we have to find something every day that helps and is a positive. We’ve done that, we have managed to find that glimmer, even little quirky things, memories of them, thoughts of them.I suppose the only comfort is that there isn’t an answer. There isn’t something that we could or should have done to make the result anything different than what it was, because nobody had that knowledge. Everybody was scared and there are still friends of my mum and dad that haven’t gone out.We summed it up quite nicely in that if somebody else came into the room, that person became the most important person. So it was never about them, they were the host and hostess. Drop everything, someone’s come in, what can I do for you, get you a drink, something to eat, oven on, and we’ll look after you, tell us what’s going on in your life, is there something we can help with?I used to sit and watch every United game with my dad, we were avid football fans and we’d chat away, so the first time I watched United I put a glass of white wine next to me. That’s what makes it tough sometimes, those chats, those little bits that fill in your week. It’s good to talk it out, you have to do that.I’m just so pleased that they saw both my daughters get firsts, graduate and be in the jobs they want to be in. They burst with pride about my girls. I’ve tried to do the best to acknowledge them and pay them tribute, and if we can be half the people they were, then we’re doing a good job."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d7e0bf020385a47d51b259f390f24c6b68ddad6/419_222_2721_1632/master/2721.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4632d1b8d55753fa79efb627847a603","title":"picture essay america 1930s post office murals","story":"Photographer Justin Hamel stumbled on a Great Depression-era mural one day in a New York post office, and was intrigued to learn there are 1,200 of them across the countryThe instinct to try to boost morale during a time of hardship and suffering resonates today as we face the pandemic and economic recession.Modeled on the 1933 Public Works Art Project, the federal government created the Treasury Section of Painting and Sculpture a year later (the name was subsequently changed to the Section of Fine Arts).These programs were designed to employ artists.The mission of the post office murals was multifaceted – to boost morale in communities, employ artists by the thousands and create world-class art that was accessible to everyone. The murals revolved around local folklore, landscapes, industry and, unsurprisingly, mail delivery. They told the story of life across the United States.The first mural I photographed occurred by happenstance – I stumbled upon a mural depicting the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. From there the project slowly grew, as I traveled around the country seeking out the unique art of the post office mural.I’ve now photographed about 325 inidual murals though I don’t have an actual tally.From the magnificent depiction of steam engines being built in the post office in Willard, Ohio, to a serene pondside landscape hanging in the sheriff’s office in Dale county, Alabama, or covered wagons crossing a stream in Crawford, Nebraska, each new mural I discovered offered an engaging view into the local histories of the world around us.In small towns everywhere, history was painted by people who arrived in America seeking a better life. Many of the artists employed by the Section were immigrants. José Aceves, a Mexican-American artist, painted the classic western scene Big City News in Borger, Texas.New and Old Methods of Transportation, showing how the rapid pace at which technology was changing rural towns, was painted by the Polish-American Bernard Zakheim in Mineola, Texas. In a Virginia post office lobby, you’ll find a factory valley landscape entitled Appalachia by Lucienne Bloch, a Swiss-born immigrant.As today’s national discussion in the US has shifted towards institutional racism and the place of art and statues commemorating the United States’ racist history, many post office murals are coming under scrutiny for the way they portray the colonization and slavery. Hollis Holbrook’s John Elliot Speaks to the Natick Indians depicts Native Americans enslaved by Puritans while John Elliot preaches Christianity to them.The city of Natick was founded as the first of many “praying towns” by the Massachusetts Bay Colony, where Native Americans would be forced to learn Christianity.However, the controversy surrounding post office murals is arguably nothing new. In the 1950s, a handful of artists were made to testify under the House committee on un-American activities for their celebration of labor and political undertones.Victor Arnautoff’s historic 10-panel The Life of Washington mural at the George Washington high school in San Francisco is in the midst of a fierce fight to be preserved, hidden or destroyed due to its depictions of George Washington as a slave owner and the dead Native Americans the country was founded upon. Hundreds of murals created under the Section of Fine Arts and the broader Works Progress Administration have been lost or purposely destroyed over the years.The Section of Fine Arts created roughly 1,400 murals and sculptures in federal buildings, not entirely post offices. The PWAP, Treasury Relief Art and Federal Art Project commissioned thousands of other paintings, posters, general art classes, etc, including post office murals.All wrapped into one, it is undoubtedly the largest public art project in the US. The most recent politicization of the post office has brought renewed focus to the ways the postal service is crucial to everyday life. Perhaps an unexpected consequence, scaling back hours and funding will also put this unparalleled collection of public art at risk.• Justin Hamel is a documentary and editorial photographer in El Paso, Texas, working at the intersections of climate, labor and migration."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/262bd47df0273479ce12d1d4acff1b965c4f27a8/98_0_2805_1684/master/2805.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=afd758df1e35b1129e4b16cea55a4e28","title":"matt herron chronicler of the us civil rights movement in pictures","story":"The photographer, who covered protesters and volunteers across the south, has died at 89.

But as infection rates have risen again in parts of the region, some earlier curbs have been reinstated.The latest data, which was published on Friday and focused on the services and manufacturing sectors, is likely to concern policymakers and diminish hopes for a V-shaped recovery, signalling slowing growth. IHS Markit’s flash composite purchasing managers’ index (PMI) fell from 54.9 in July to 51.6. Any number above 50 signals growth.“The fallback in the eurozone composite PMI in August suggests the initial V-shaped rebound following the lifting of the lockdowns is already fizzling out,” said Jessica Hinds at Capital Economics.The flow of new business for firms slowed and once again some of August’s activity was derived by companies completing work backlogs. Germany and France, the bloc’s two biggest economies, also lost economic momentum this month, driven by a services slowdown.Apart from those economies, activity decreased marginally in August, IHS Markit said.Growth in the eurozone’s dominant service sector stalled, with the its PMI index falling to 50.1 from 54.7.With demand waning, the bloc’s services firms cut headcount for a sixth month in a row, and more sharply than in July. Economists noted the employment components of the PMIs suggested more gloom ahead in the jobs market.“Those numbers indicate that the worst is yet to be seen in the euro area labour market and clearly points to a gradual recovery path,” said Tuuli Koivu at Nordea Markets.Factory activity – which did not experience quite as sharp a decline as the service industry during the height of the pandemic – expanded for a second month.But in a sign that factory purchasing managers do not expect a big pick up in activity, they again bought fewer raw materials than in the previous month.EU leaders agreed last month a €750bn (£674bn) pandemic recovery fund, but the relief does not kick in until next year. For its part, the European Central Bank is expected to keep monetary policy ultra-loose for a long time.A full bounceback from the eurozone’s deepest recession on record will take two years or more, according to a recent Reuters poll of economists."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7b5800a570370eb6a4dbf095a2696104bab8d9a/0_379_5758_3456/master/5758.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=138856ccdc90414b0c143483737751c0","title":"five factors behind the us stock markets miraculous turnaround","story":"Despite looking anything but fearless as Covid-19 first struck, US markets have regained lost ground and reached new highs. We list the reasons whyNothing like the recovery in the US stock market has ever been seen before. After the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the time it took for shares to regain their previous peak was measured in decades. After the global financial crisis of 2008, it was measured in years. This time it has taken less than five months – from a low on 23 March – for the S\u0026ampP 500 to regain all its lost ground and hit a new high. At the time, not even the most bullish trader would have been bet on such a rapid recovery, but five factors explain the remarkable turnaround.Even while the market was crashing in early March, America’s central bank was acting to reassure investors that it would go to any lengths to support the world’s biggest economy and prevent a financial crisis.As in the aftermath of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, the Fed moved swiftly: it cut interest rates to zero it promised to pump $5 trillion into the troubled money markets it created lending programmes to help the cash flow of US businesses big and small it bought corporate bonds and it has given the impression that it may buy stocks as well.Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global, says the rally on Wall Street and the recent fall in the US dollar are “being driven primarily by central bank policies of adding unprecedented liquidity to markets through renewed quantitative easing and ultra-low rates.”The lockdown has been disastrous for some sectors, notably hospitality and airlines, but people stuck at home have been spending more time online, shopping, watching, socialising and working. That has been good news for the five big US tech giants – Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Netflix.Dhaval Joshi, analyst at BCA research, says the S\u0026ampP 500 should be renamed the S\u0026ampP 5 because it is now so dominated by a handful of companies. Likewise, about 10 stocks – mostly in finance and energy – drive the UK’s FTSE 100.Traditionally, Wall Street looks beyond the short term and anticipates that a company’s earnings – on which its stock market valuation ultimately depends – will recover.However, some investors, including Norway’s massive sovereign wealth fund, say this is risky at a time when Covid-19 is not beaten. Trond Grande, the fund’s deputy chief executive, said markets did not reflect the real economic impact of the virus, which was not under control “in any shape or form”.The devastating economic impact of Covid-19 has meant a worldwide race to find a vaccine. Normally this takes years, but there are hopeful signs – including from researchers at Oxford University – that the process could be speeded up.Wall Street has proved highly sensitive to reports of a possible breakthrough, from either US biotech companies such as Gilead or foreign rivals. But even on the most optimistic assumption, a vaccine will not be widely available until 2021 at the earliest, and the chances of failure are high. But for the past few months, vaccine optimism has helped boost not just pharma shares but Wall Street stocks generally.In the early stages of the pandemic, investors dumped shares and parked their money in traditional safe havens such as cash and US treasury bonds. But the actions of the Fed and other central banks have made these options less attractive.Interest rates for savers are barely above zero, and in some countries the interest rates (yields) on government bonds have turned negative, which means investors have to pay the state for the privilege of putting their money in a safe asset.For investors who believe shares are overvalued, there is gold, whose price has risen by almost $400 an ounce in the past six months."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e36fc8a16ec54184a96153f7a0e37ef4c4970409/0_0_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9be4b09847330ba050eb22001140ede6","title":"journeys end last of englands open cast mines begins final push","story":"Hartington site in Derbyshire will be allowed to eke out last of its coal over rest of year owing to pandemicFew in the small town of Staveley, near Chesterfield, could have predicted that an overlooked industrial site on its outskirts would play host to the end of thousands of years of coal mining in England.The Hartington site stands unassumingly within the green hills of Derbyshire where it produces a small handful of coal, in industry terms, alongside gravel and construction grit. It is also, by chance, England’s last open-cast coal mine in a history that dates back to Roman times.The Hartington site can trace its roots in the mining industry back more than 140 years to when it first began producing coal for the Staveley Coal and Iron Company in 1875. Then, the company’s 3,000 workers produced 1m tonnes of coal a year. Today, Hartington is a minnow within the fast-draining coal industry and aims to produce a total of 87,000 tonnes.Government officials had expected Hartington to reach its modest target by the start of August, but delays caused by the coronavirus has meant the mine will be allowed to continue to eke out the last of its coal for the rest of the year.By sheer chance Hartington will outlive England’s far larger surface mines, including Bradley in County Durham which shut on Monday  after extracting 340,000 of 500,000 tonnes of coal earmarked when it opened in 2018.John Wilson, a local businessman, owns Hartington alongside interests in local hotels and a recycling company.The last open-cast mine in England will continue to produce coal alongside a handful of mines still operating in Wales and Scotland, and a few small underground mines in Cumbria and the Forest of Dean.These mines may tap the same rich coal seams that helped power the Industrial Revolution, but they are a dusty shadow of one of the country’s most enduring industry. At its peak in 1913, Britain produced 292m tonnes of coal a year. Last year, a record low of 2.2m tonnes was produced after 35 years of accelerating mine closures.It has been almost five years since 60 miners emerged for the final time from Britain’s last deep mine at Kellingley in North Yorkshire. The closure of the mine, which survived the Thatcher years and countless union strikes, marked yet another blow to the communities of former mining towns in the north of England.The Hartington mine was one of the earliest casualties of the terminal decline in heavy industry after the first world war, shutting in 1921 after a miner strike before taking up a new life as a tip for other local mines and steel foundries.At the centre of Staveley’s market square stands a clocktower monument to the town’s industrial past, but few are here to see it today. Since the collapse of industry in Staveley the town has emptied. The woes of its remaining small businesses have been compounded by recession, years of austerity, and the collapse of the British high street.The owner of the nearby cobbler, who gave his name as Bobbo, said the exodus from the town centre had accelerated as young people left Staveley to find work. “The politicians say they understand that things are difficult in former industrial towns, but they keep putting money in the pockets of foreign workers by importing everything. So, isn’t that hypocritical?” he said.Today, the UK imports of 6m tonnes of coal a year, mostly from Russian mines, despite the collapse in demand for coal in the production of steel and energy in power plants. It is a fact seized upon by those hoping to spur a coal mining renaissance in the UK despite the government’s climate targets.Government ministers are considering plans for new open-cast mines, and caused dismay among environmental groups late last year by waiving through plans – still fiercely opposed – for the first new deep cast mine in a generation at the Woodhouse colliery in Cumbria.A government spokesman told the  that although Britain’s transition towards a low carbon future had “inevitably reduced the country’s dependence on coal extraction and use”, the government was “supporting the creation of new, sustainable employment opportunities in the green economy, which is predicted to support 2 million jobs by 2030”.For Britain’s former mining towns, a green industrial boom cannot come soon enough."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18d9b0761a5eb7aec45ae16e4a09d2d347d9bde3/0_33_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=ca7285731abfae18c19468bff0af9027","title":"i dont want to go abroad why am i seething mass of envy","story":"Just the thought of sitting on a plane makes my hypochondriac heart beat triple time. But I don’t want to hear about anyone’s fabulous time in PatmosUnlike Gore Vidal, I do not need my friends to fail so that I can enjoy my successes. But it is the law that if I am doing nothing, then my friends must be equally bored, too. For those of us who suffer from acute Fomo, AKA fear of missing out (to paraphrase Will Ferrell on sex addiction, it’s a real disease, with doctors and medicine and everything!), lockdown was, well, I don’t want to say it was good, because obviously it was terrible. But it was also, on the most base and selfish level possible, a bit of a relief.No longer was I plagued with the constant tinnitus-like buzzing in my brain telling me that something better was happening elsewhere, that everyone was having fun without me. It’s a terrible affliction, one that once propelled me from a wedding in Sussex at midnight to a 40th birthday in Suffolk, and to a 50th birthday party in Ipswich the day before I gave birth. Insane? Possibly. But I didn’t miss out.Not even having kids and skating past my own 40th birthday knocked that neurotic teenage mentality out of me. Instead, it took a global pandemic.At last, I could feel the peace of not constantly wondering where the fun was, because I knew the answer: the fun was nowhere. I couldn’t do anything and nor could anyone else, and while of course I’d prefer everyone to be having a good time, no one having one was an acceptable alternative. I’m basically the fun communist, in that no one is allowed to have more of it than me. And, going by my memories of studying Animal Farm for GCSE, that’s how communism works.So that, I assumed, was how the rest of 2020 would be. It’s the year of Covid, right? Everyone would just stay home – we’re all in this together. Or, as it turned out, not. I’m like the dorky kid in a movie who excitedly thinks everyone’s coming to her slumber party, only to realise that all the cool kids have gone to an all-night rave or, in my case, to holidays in Portugal, Greece and Mallorca.It was just one or two at first. Friends telling me they hadn’t downgraded that week in Andalucia to a weekend in Aberystwyth. “Oh, those crazy daredevils,” I’d think, regarding them the way I used to regard people who train for marathons or go camping by choice. “I guess there have to be exceptions that prove the rule.” Except, I’m the exception. Last weekend, I couldn’t find a single person to carpe diem with me by spending another Saturday in the local playground, because every single one of them was having a fabulous time in Patmos or Portobloodyfino.“Just about to go for lunch on the beach! I’ll call when I’m back!” trilled my text messages. “Yeah, well, I bet they don’t have Magnums in Greece,” I thought, sulkily sucking on an ice-cream while watching my kids in the sandpit. And then I dropped my Magnum in the sandpit. (It turns out they do have Magnums in Greece.)I don’t even want to go abroad – I really don’t. Just the thought of sitting on a plane makes my hypochondriac heart beat triple time in panic. So maybe I’m not the Ms Fun Town I always thought I was. Maybe I’m Little Miss Anxious. This thought does not improve my mood. Maybe it’s because a close relative is still suffering the long-term effects from Covid, so, for once, the risk feels more real than theoretical.Or maybe I just can’t handle illogicality: if I still can’t have friends over for dinner, why would it be fine for me to be packed on a flight with 180 strangers? I get that expecting consistency from a government led by Boris Johnson – a man who isn’t even consistent about how many children he has – is a fool’s errand, but aren’t we supposed to be helping to suppress this virus, not giving it lifts around the continent on planes? The whole thing makes me want to mock up a protest sign: “If your local beautician still has to wear a hazmat suit to give you a bikini wax, then you probably shouldn’t be going on a beach holiday. And not because of body hair issues, just to be clear. I’m a feminist, y’know.” (Note to self: find a big sign.)Looking at social media this summer has become even more of an exercise in masochism than it already was. I’m a seething mass of jealousy and judgment, and the judgment is really just jealousy felt from the moral high ground. Like I said, I don’t want to go away. I just want everyone else to be as neurotic as me.So here I am, still sitting in my kitchen, furiously liking everyone’s holiday photos on Instagram because I’m a supportive friend, but really not liking them at all, because I’m a bitter person. “Isn’t it lovely when the city is all quiet and empty?” I think, truly the last gasp of the desperate. And just then the drilling starts, because of course my neighbours timed their building work to coincide with their holiday. At least they’ll all have to be quarantined for two weeks when they come back, I tell myself, and then they’ll be stuck inside their homes, just like, er, me. And then all will be right with the world again.

Failure to do so will only lead to rising anger and anxietyThe difference between a revolt and a revolution is that the latter seeks to build a new order while the former knows only destruction. This government has proved its talent for popular revolt. Within a year, Boris Johnson has stormed Labour’s red wall, wrestled Brexit from a reluctant parliament, abolished the Department for International Development and Public Health England and threatened the future of the BBC. However, as yet, there is no plan in evidence for completing the revolution.Of course, it is much harder to erect institutions than to tear them down. Just consider Whitehall’s construction of an entirely new state architecture to manage coronavirus in the past six months, which even ministers admit has been a struggle. The recurring dysfunction of the national contact tracing system, the failure of the NHS volunteering regime, the lack of remote teaching for every child – these are all testament to the difficulty of building new systems from scratch. This is why Conservatives since Edmund Burke have favoured organic reform over jarring revolution. In ministers’ defence, the pandemic has made statecraft considerably harder, stretching the bandwidth and resources of government as never before. But the autumn carries considerably more risk than the summer. Schools, universities and workplaces are about to fill up in earnest, the jobs nightmare will crystallise when 6.8 million people come off furlough, while care homes and hospitals will shortly brace themselves for the flu. Britain urgently needs a functional contact-tracing regime, an operational youth employment scheme and a plan for social care – and these must be in place well before winter arrives.Over the past decade, Conservative ministers established the Office for Budget Responsibility to entrench fiscal conservatism, they created metro mayors to ingrain regional leadership and founded free schools to seed autonomy in education. Like all powerful institutions, they have not only endured but proved formative, shaping the ideas and organisations around them. More to the point, the government’s own agenda depends on institution-building. The prime minister’s plans to “level up” opportunity stand little chance until Britain’s regions have institutions that can compete with London for capital and talent. The UK is the most regionally imbalanced country in the industrialised world precisely because our top-down, space-blind, centralised governance has no tools to rebalance it. Every part of Britain needs a powerful mayor and access to regional economic institutions to attract investment and fund infrastructure. The same is true of efforts to increase the popularity of vocational education, which will only happen when it has the cultural and economic prestige afforded by a degree. In the wake of the exam debacle, which will see greater numbers going to university than usual, there is a strong case for endowing a new generation of institutions to deliver high-level technical courses. Like previous epidemics, coronavirus presents an opportunity to rebuild our institutions on a grand scale, redrawing the social contract and remoulding the state in a way that leaves us more resilient and dynamic. But to do that policymakers need to start being clear about what they are for – not just what they are against. If they cannot, they will leave a vacuum into which political anger and social anxieties can only fester and where problems will just accumulate at their door.• Will Tanner is former deputy head of the Downing Street policy unit"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9badd696cf7250b942409a58df622affc1797640/0_289_4335_2601/master/4335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=602a2b8c1e724b8e0c625a814c0ebe58","title":"teachers and parents across the uk share your thoughts on the reopening of schools","story":"We’d like to hear from people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland about returning to schools, and those in Scotland about how it has beenWith just weeks to go until children return to school in England and Wales, and less than a week until the first cohort of students in Northern Ireland return for the start of the new academic year, protective measures in schools remain fiercely contested.Many teachers have criticised the government’s ‘bubble’ group scheme and social distancing measures, while some unions have called for teachers to be able to choose to use face coverings, against government advice.

Instead, computer modelling was used to assign grades. But when results were unveiled, there was shock and anger at what looked like clear injustices After all end-of-year exams were scrapped, students in England with offers of university places were awaiting their A-level results with more trepidation than usual. Rather than being judged by their exam performance, their grades had been assigned by a computer model that took into account their previous achievements and that of their school.  As Laura McInerney tells Mythili Rao, while at first glance the results last week looked in line with a normal school year, glaring anomalies and what looked to be huge injustices emerged. As pressure built on the government to explain itself, ministers went silent before the education secretary emerged on Monday to announce a major U-turn.  Students who had been downgraded could now use the grades their schools had predicted. But as university places fill up, some are finding it is too little too late.

(Its jellyfish webcam, meanwhile, was highlighted on Reddit as one of “the best links to click while you’re stoned”.)With 1 million followers on Facebook and now 100,000 subscribers on YouTube, social media has long been central to the aquarium’s mission to inspire ocean conservation. Its first webcams were installed in 2001.But with no date set for reopening, Monterey Bay’s only presence during the pandemic is online, and at a time of great financial need. “It’s a lot of pressure right now to be the public face of the aquarium,” said Allen-Greil.The institution is facing a $45m (£34m) shortfall this year and 174 staff have already lost their jobs: “We have needed more than ever this summer to use these tools for fundraising and to make clear our need.”Monterey Bay’s call for its followers to appeal for emergency congressional funding for aquariums yielded 10,000 responses, as well as $27,000 in direct giving.The aquarium has been exploring new potential sources of revenue, such as educational talks held in the world of the game Animal Crossing, live-streamed over Twitch and YouTube tours behind the scenes of the jellyfish and cephalopod exhibits.“We’ve got a ton of requests like, ‘Can you just Zoom my grandmother on her birthday and feed a penguin? I’ll pay’,” said Allen-Greil. “We’re thinking a lot about what that means for us.”Though online initiatives alone would not save the aquarium, she said, “once we’re ready to open, we’re confident that we’ll have people wanting to come.”Until then: “it’s about bringing the ocean to people in their daily lives.”The National aquarium has three webcams: Blacktip reef sharks, Jellies invasion and Pacific coral reef.Spot more than 50 species of fish in this 100ft tunnel.Choose from 10 live webcams and tune in at the listed times for narrated feedings.Explore.org is the largest live nature cam network, with 21 underwater streams.The Aquarium of the Pacific, Long Beach, CaliforniaBoasts round-the-clock surveillance of its penguin exhibit – above and below water.• This article was amended on 21 August 2020 to correct the caption of the main image.

I have been singing the praises of cauliflowers, tomatoes, lemons and the mighty aubergine for years. But while it’s my mission to present vegetables in new and exciting ways, I must confess to a niggling doubt: how many more ways are there to roast a cauliflower, slice a tomato, squeeze a lemon or fry an aubergine?The answer, I’m delighted to report, is many, and in my latest foray, I have been joined by my brilliant colleague and co-writer Ixta Belfrage. Our journey of discovery into the world of vegetables has focused on understanding what makes each one distinct, so they can be tasted afresh. It’s about creating flavour bombs, and it’s done in these three ways.One way to ramp up flavour in a vegetable is to subject it to a process before or during cooking. Three recipes in our new book involve cooking celeriac whole for more than two hours, then dressing and serving it in different ways. During the initial cooking, something magical happens. Much of the water in the celeriac evaporates it turns golden brown, and becomes sweeter and richer. This caramelising is key. Whatever you choose to do – if anything – after this is less important the browning process is such a flavour bomb that the celeriac is heavenly eaten at this stage, cut into wedges and served with a squeeze of lemon or a dollop of creme fraiche. Other processes that elevate vegetables to great heights include charring, ageing and infusing.It’s not so much what you do to an ingredient (“process”) or the ingredient itself (“produce”), but the combination of ingredients in the four most important pairings.Acidity Acidic substances can act as preservatives, improve texture (causing vegetables to cook more slowly and toughen up) and, best of all, balance flavours. A favourite sandwich of ours – a mix of olive oil-roasted vegetables and chillies, piled on toasted sourdough with pecorino shavings or crumbled feta on top – wouldn’t hit the spot without the acidic element counteracting the sweetness and chilli heat.Chilli heat Fresh, pickled, dried, flaked, in pastes, oils, butters and spice mixes: our kitchen is crowded with varities of chilli because the question, “What’s needed?” in a dish is so often answered with “chilli heat”. Chillies’ great gift is their ability to marry together a range of flavours to create a singular harmony.Sweetness All ingredients are a mix of things – sweet and salty, sweet and savoury – and these tastes need each other in order to shine. What would bitter cocoa powder be without sweet sugar? Satisfaction is about the combination, the layering, the contrast of tastes. With sweetness in particular, without the complexity, you run the risk of turning your dish into a dessert. Fat Take a simple salad – tomato and basil, say – and it’s one thing: sweet, refreshing and lovely. Add mozzarella, though, or tangy feta, and it becomes something entirely different. It’s no longer just the picture: it’s the entire summer holiday. Add another layer of fat in the form of olive oil and the dish is complete.In some cases, there’s so much going on within the ingredient that it can pretty much do all the work on its own, its deliciousness teased out by baking or toasting or frying.Such ingredients are often intensely savoury, and rich in the fifth flavour, umami (the others are sweet, sour, salty and bitter), the result of flavour compounds called glutamates. Unlike monosodium glutamate (chemically manufactured and liberally sprinkled over takeaways), there are many natural sources: parmesan, anchovies, mushrooms, tomatoes, soy sauce, seaweed, Marmite and ketchup.After years of cooking vegetables, I never cease to be surprised by their chameleon-like ability to take on flavour and metamorphose from one dish to the next. A simple cauliflower can reinvent itself, showing up as a seductive Levantine fritter, then grilled with saffron and raisins, disguised as bulgur in a modern take on tabbouleh, followed by a glamorous savoury cake, a meaty steak, dressed as (coronation) chicken or simply served whole, grilled yet unadorned. This is how wide the range and how wondrous the potential of every single vegetable. Magical, to borrow a term favoured by my five-year-old son.Preparing vegetables hasselback involves slicing them thinly, but not all the way down, so the slices remain held together at the base, like a fan: they not only look great but have deliciously crispy edges all over.To offset the extra work, start with shop-bought ready-cooked beetroots (plain, not in vinegar). If you do end up using raw beets, try to get bunches and use the stems and leaves to make our tempura stems, leaves and herbs.Serves 4 as a side8-10 medium-large beetroots (that’s about 2 bunches), skin on (1.2kg) or 8-10 ready-cooked beetroots (1kg)Flaked sea saltFor the lime leaf butter90g unsalted butter40ml olive oil5 fresh kaffir lime leaves, chopped10g fresh ginger, peeled and chopped1 garlic clove, crushed1 tbsp lime juice, plus 2 tsp to serveFor the lime leaf salsa10 fresh kaffir lime leaves, stalks removed and very finely chopped½ tsp fresh ginger, peeled and very finely chopped½ garlic clove, crushed½ green chilli, very finely chopped (deseeded for less heat)1 tbsp coriander leaves, chopped3 tbsp olive oilFor the yoghurt cream80ml double cream90g Greek-style yoghurtHeat the oven to 220C (200C fan) 425Fgas 7. Place the beets in a baking dish in a single layer. Fill with water to 2cm up the sides, sprinkle on one tablespoon of salt, cover tightly with foil and bake for one hour and 20 minutes, or until a knife goes through easily. Discard water and, when cool enough, peel off the skin under cold running water (wear gloves to avoid staining). Halve larger beetroots lengthways. Reduce oven temperature to 190C.While the beetroots are cooking, put the butter, oil, lime leaves, ginger and garlic into a small pan on a medium-high heat. Gently cook until the butter begins to bubble, about four minutes, then set aside to infuse for at least 40 minutes. Discard the aromatics, then stir in one tablespoon of lime juice and one teaspoon of flaked salt.For the salsa, mix all the ingredients in a small bowl with a quarter-teaspoon of flaked salt, and set aside.In a medium bowl, whip the cream, yoghurt and a pinch of flaked salt until light and fluffy, with medium-stiff peaks, about three minutes. Refrigerate until ready to use.Cut slits in the peeled beetroots at 4mm intervals, stopping about 1cm from the bottom. Place on a small parchment-lined baking tray and fan the slices out. Spoon the melted butter evenly over, especially between the slices. Roast for one and a quarter hours, basting very well every 20 minutes or so, until the edges are crisp and caramelised. Set aside to cool for 15 minutes.Spread the yoghurt cream on a platter, then arrange the beets on top, spooning the butter over. Drizzle over the salsa, finish with remaining lime juice and serve at once.Huge quantities of beets are roasted across the Ottolenghi restaurants, so we’re always on the lookout for clever ways of using the stems and leaves. If you don’t have any, use basil, parsley, sage or chard. Just make sure the leaves are not limp and wet, or hard and dry. The batter will be enough for 100g of leaves and herbs.Make sure your prep is done before the oil gets too hot and have a slotted spoon and a rack lined with kitchen paper at the ready. Tempura doesn’t sit too well, so try to eat it right away.Serves 6 as a snack or a little starter70g beetroot leaves and stems (cut to 8cm lengths), washed and patted dry20g dill, patted dry, in 8cm fronds10g mint, patted dry, leaves picked½ tbsp Szechuan peppercorns, crushed with a pestle and mortarFlaked sea saltFor the tangerine dipping sauce50ml tangerine juice, with bits (from 2-3 tangerines)3 tbsp lime juice1½ tsp maple syrup ½ small garlic clove, finely chopped4 fresh kaffir lime leaves, stalks discarded and leaves finely chopped½ red chilli, deseeded and choppedFor the batter80g self-raising flour80g cornflour, plus 50g for dipping210ml ice-cold sparkling water (small bits of ice welcome)1½ tbsp black sesame seeds700ml sunflower oil, for deep-fryingIn a small serving bowl, stir together all the dipping sauce ingredients with an eighth of a teaspoon of flaked salt, and set aside.For the batter, put the flour, 80g of cornflour, water, one teaspoon of flaked salt and the seeds into a large bowl. Whisk gently until the mixture just comes together.Pour the oil into a medium high-sided saute pan and place on a high heat. Once very hot, lower to medium and test by dropping in a little batter it should sizzle but not brown straight away. In batches, toss stems, leaves and herbs in the 50g of cornflour, shake to remove any excess, then dip in the batter. Lift, shake the excess over the bowl, then place as many pieces in the oil as can comfortably fit without touching. Fry for 30-60 seconds on each side, until crisp and pale golden, then use a slotted spoon to transfer to a kitchen paper-lined rack. Continue with the rest, then sprinkle the lot with the pepper and salt. Transfer to a platter and serve hot with the dipping sauce alongside.In 2016, the German minister for agriculture wanted to ban naming vegetable-based foods after their meaty counterparts, claiming terms such as “vegetarian schnitzel” were unsettling and misleading. Ours aren’t vegetarian schnitzels, they are vegetable ones – a semantic difference but a big one. In any case, we hope our choice of title does not offend.The sauce is a take on the classic Marie Rose but turbocharged. It’s also great in sandwiches and will keep in the fridge for up to a week. Serves 4 as a starter8 red Romano peppers (850g)Salt, flaked sea salt and black pepper100g plain flour4 eggs, beaten100g panko breadcrumbs60g sesame seeds, white andor black16 fresh kaffir lime leaves, stalks discarded and leaves finely chopped1 tbsp nori sprinkles (or blitz a sheet of nori in a spice grinder and use 1 tbsp)600ml sunflower oil, for deep-frying2 limes: finely grate the zest to get 2 tsp, then cut into wedges to serveFor the Marie Rose sauce 1 whole head of garlic, top fifth cut off to expose the clovesSalt and black pepper180g cherry tomatoes4 large red chillies (75g)1 tbsp maple syrup2 tsp Worcestershire sauce½ tsp chipotle flakes60g mayonnaiseHeat the oven to 250C (230C fan)480Fgas 9½. To make the sauce, sprinkle the garlic with salt and pepper, wrap in foil and place on a parchment-lined baking tray with the tomatoes and chillies. Roast for 30 minutes, until they begin to blacken and blister. Remove from oven and, when cool, squeeze the garlic into the small bowl of a food processor, discarding the skins. Add the chillies (deseeded for less heat), tomatoes, maple syrup, Worcestershire sauce, chipotle flakes and a quarter-teaspoon of salt blitz to a coarse paste. Leave to cool, then mix in the mayonnaise and refrigerate until you’re ready to serve.Meanwhile, cut a 5cm slit vertically in the base of each pepper, then place on a large parchment-lined baking tray (you can roast them at the same time as the garlic, near the bottom of the oven). Roast for 16 minutes, turning over halfway, until cooked through and beginning to blacken. Transfer to a sieve, cut side down, to drain any liquid, taking care to keep the stalks intact. Once cool, carefully peel away as much skin as possible without puncturing the flesh, then sprinkle with salt and set aside.Prepare three shallow containers long enough to fit the peppers. In the first, mix flour with one teaspoon of flaked salt and plenty of black pepper put the eggs in the second in the last mix breadcrumbs, sesame seeds, lime leaves, nori, two teaspoons of flaked salt and a generous grind of pepper.Set a large metal rack over one tray and line another with plenty of kitchen paper. Dip each pepper first into the flour, then the egg and finally the panko mixture, shaking off any excess as you go lie it on the rack and repeat with the rest of the peppers.Pour the oil into a large, high-sided saute pan or wok on a medium-high heat. Once very hot, fry the peppers two at a time so you don’t overcrowd them. Lower in carefully and fry for one and a half to two minutes on each side, until golden brown and crisp, then transfer to the paper-lined tray.Serve at once, with lime zest and sea salt sprinkled on top, and lime wedges and Marie Rose sauce alongside.Lime, chilli and garlic are the key flavours here, coming through the oil and the crispy sprinkle at the end. If using dried beans, soak a day ahead with tinned or jarred, add to the cooked shallots with 60ml of water and cook just until heated through.Serves 4 as a side2 banana shallots, finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, crushed4 fresh kaffir lime leaves1 ancho chilli, torn in halfSalt350g black turtle beans, soaked all night in cold water with 1 tsp bicarb of soda (or 800g cooked beans)3 tbsp lime juice½ small coconut, roughly grated (50g)For the fried aromatics 90ml olive oil 2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced2 red chillies, thinly sliced in rounds10 fresh kaffir lime leaves2 tsp black mustard seedsStart with the aromatics. Heat oil in a small pan on a medium-high heat. Once hot, reduce heat to medium, add garlic, chillies and lime leaves, and fry for two minutes, stirring. Add mustard seeds and fry for another 30 seconds, until the garlic starts to turn golden brown. Strain over a bowl. Set aromatics and oil aside separately.For the beans, put three tablespoons of reserved oil into a medium pan on a medium-high heat add shallots, garlic, lime leaves, ancho chilli and one and a quarter teaspoons of salt. Reduce heat to medium and fry for six minutes, stirring often, until the shallots are soft and golden. Rinse beans, then add to pan with 700ml water. Bring to a simmer, lower heat to medium and cook for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until cooked but still holding their shape. Remove from heat, cover and leave for 10 minutes.Transfer to a lipped platter or large, shallow bowl. Discard lime leaves and ancho chilli. Drizzle over lime juice and remaining oil, top with coconut and fried aromatics, and serve.We urge you to try our version of rasam, a South Indian broth, despite the longish ingredient list, to discover a whole range of new flavours.Use tamarind pulp, not paste (available in any Indian supermarket), to get the sweet acid kick you’re after.You’ll need to soak the rice for an hour in water. The balls can be made ahead and kept refrigerated in a sealed container return to room temperature before pouring over the hot broth.Serves 4 as a main50g block of tamarind pulp30g ginger, skin on, thinly sliced15g turmeric, skin on, thinly sliced1 large green chilli, roughly slicedSalt250g cherry tomatoes2½ tbsp sunflower oil½ lemon, halved lengthways, cut into ¼cm-thick half-moons (pips removed)1½ tsp cumin seeds, finely crushed1 tsp black mustard seeds2 whole dried red chillies20 fresh curry leaves (optional)3 garlic cloves, crushed3-4 plum tomatoes (300g), coarsely grated and skins discarded (250g)2 tsp caster sugarFor the rice balls200g Thai sticky rice, soaked for 1 hour in cold water, then drained well2 tbsp sunflower oil, plus extra for shaping1 onion, peeled and finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, crushed15g fresh ginger, peeled and grated10g coriander, roughly chopped, plus extra picked leaves and stalks2 spring onions, thinly sliced (30g)For the rasam, add the first four ingredients, 1.2 litres of water and one teaspoon of salt to a medium pan on a medium-high heat. Bring to the boil, then simmer gently for 20 minutes, stirring to break apart the pulp. Push through a sieve into a bowl, then discard the aromatics.Meanwhile, put rice in a medium pan with 220ml water and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt. Bring to the boil on medium-high heat, then lower heat and cover loosely, leaving a small gap for steam to escape. Cook for 20 minutes, then remove from heat and let sit, uncovered, until cool.Toss cherry tomatoes in one and a half teaspoons of oil. Place a large saute pan on a high heat. Once smoking, add tomatoes and cook, tossing occasionally, until charred and blistered, about four minutes. Set aside. Add lemons and cook until charred, 30-50 seconds a side. Set aside. Turn heat down to medium-high, add remaining oil, cumin and mustard seeds, dried chillies, curry leaves and garlic, and cook for 90 seconds, until fragrant. Add grated plum tomatoes cook for five minutes more, then add sugar, tamarind liquid, charred tomatoes and half a teaspoon of salt. Bring back to the boil and simmer for eight minutes. Set aside while you prepare the rice balls.Put the oil into a saute pan on a medium-high heat. Add onion and cook for seven minutes, until soft and browned. Add garlic and ginger, and cook for 90 seconds. Remove from heat and transfer to a bowl with the cooked rice, coriander and spring onion. Mix well. With lightly oiled hands, form into 12 balls (30-35g each).To serve, heat through the rasam, then add charred lemon slices. Divide rice balls between four bowls, pour over the rasam and top with coriander.These onions are a revelation, and the very definition of low efforthigh impact. Two things are vital, though: the roasting tray must be big enough to fit 16 onion halves (if not, roast fewer, decreasing other ingredients proportionally) and these must be basted well, so they remain moist. Serve spooned over toast, mashed potatoes or rice, or with roast chicken.Serves 6 as a sideHeat the oven to 260C (240C fan)500Fgas 10. Halve the onions lengthways, trim tops and a little off the bottom (you want the halves held together at the base).Whisk butter, miso and one litre of warm water until fully combined.Space apart the onion halves, cut side down, in a 40cm x 28cm high-sided baking tray or dish. Pour over the miso water, cover tightly with foil, bake for 35 minutes, then remove foil and turn onions cut side up. Baste well and cook, uncovered, for 45 minutes, basting every 10 minutes, until very soft and deep brown.Carefully transfer to a platter, pouring sauce over. Serve at once.This is as fresh as a potato salad will get, thanks to the large quantities of lime, garlic, chilli and Thai basil poured over it. It will make a good light supper with broccoli and will also partner well with salmon or roast chicken.If you can’t get hold of Thai basil, use an equal combination of coriander and ordinary basil. The salsa won’t stay bright green for long, so make it just before you’re ready to serve.When jerusalem artichokes are in season, we like to roast them and add to this salad. If you’re not a fan, substitute them with the same amount of potatoes (in which case they’ll all be boiled, so no need to turn on the oven).Serves 4 as a side600g small to medium salad potatoes (or 1.1kg, if you’re not using jerusalem artichokes), peeled and cut into 3-4cm pieces Salt and flaked sea salt 600g jerusalem artichokes, peeled and cut into 3cm pieces (500g)  75ml olive oil 50g breakfast radishes, thinly sliced 3 limes: finely grate the zest to get 1¼ tbsp, then juice to get 3 tbsp 1 small garlic clove, roughly chopped 15g fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped 28g Thai basil, 20g roughly chopped, the rest picked leaves to serve 1 large green chilli, finely sliced into rounds 30g smoked, ready-roasted and salted almonds, roughly chopped (or ordinary ready-roasted almonds) Membership Event: Flavour, with Yotam Ottolenghi and Ixta Belfrage Heat the oven to 230C (210C fan)450Fgas 8 (if roasting artichokes). Put the potatoes into a large pan, cover with cold, salted water, bring to a simmer, then cook for around 10 minutes, or untilcooked through but still holding their shape. Drain and set aside to cool for 15 minutes.Meanwhile, mix artichokes (if using) with one tablespoon of oil and half a teaspoon of flaked salt, and spread out on a parchment-lined baking tray. Bake for 18-20 minutes, tossing halfway through, until golden brown and cooked through. Leave to cool for a few minutes, then put into a large bowl with the cooled potatoes.While the artichokes are roasting, mix the radishes with one tablespoon of the lime juice and a quarter-teaspoon of flaked salt, and set aside.In a spice grinder or the small bowl of a food processor, blitz the lime zest, garlic, ginger and the 20g of Thai basil with one teaspoon of flaked salt and the remaining 60ml of oil to get a bright green paste. Scrape into the bowl of potatoes, with the remaining two tablespoons of lime juice. Gently stir through the radishes (including the liquid) and the picked Thai basil leaves.Finish with the chilli and almonds, and serve.On paper it may not sound as if it would work, but the combination of figs, Chinese rice wine and ricotta is marvellous. This dish is a fine balance of sweet and savoury, so it’s important your figs are ripe and sweet. If they aren’t, increase the amount of maple syrup a little.The infused oil and cooked figs need time to marinate, so make them a day ahead if you like. The figs can be cooked up to three days before and kept in the fridge (just bring back to room temperature before you assemble the salad). You can even leave them in the fridge for up to three weeks to ferment (or at least become a little funky) they make a great addition to a cheese board.Serves 4 as a starter8 ripe purple figs, halved (320g) 1 tbsp soy sauce 2½ tbsp maple syrup 2 tbsp Shaoxing rice wine (or pale dry sherry) 2½ tsp Chinkiang vinegar (or half the amount of balsamic vinegar) 60ml olive oil 2 red chillies, finely sliced into rounds (20g) 1 lemon: finely shave the skin to get 5 strips 60g rocket 140g ricottaHeat the oven to its highest grill setting. Toss the figs with the soy sauce and one and a half tablespoons of maple syrup, then arrange, cut side up and spaced apart, on a medium, parchment-lined baking tray. Make sure there is no overhanging parchment that could burn under the grill. Roast for 12 minutes on the top shelf of the oven, until they are soft and caramelised, but still holding their shape. Return figs and cooking juices to the bowl, with the rice wine, vinegar and remaining tablespoon of maple syrup. Gently mix, then set aside for at least one hour (or overnight) for the flavours to come together.Meanwhile, heat the oil in a small pan on a medium heat and, once hot, fry the chillies for three minutes, stirring to separate the slices. Add the lemon strips and fry for 30 seconds until fragrant, then immediately pour into a heatproof bowl and set aside to infuse for at least 30 minutes (or overnight).Arrange the rocket on a platter and top with the figs and dressing. Dot with spoonfuls of the ricotta, finish with the infused oil, chillies and lemon strips, and serve.• Extracted from Ottolenghi Flavour, by Yotam Ottolenghi and Ixta Belfrage, published by Ebury on 3 September at £27.

Argentina led Belgium 1-0 in their 2014 World Cup quarter‑final. They were in control, playing well. The forward line, as usual, felt a mismatch of extremely talented but not particularly complementary players, but with a solid and well-balanced midfield, it didn’t really seem to matter. Then Ángel Di María pulled his hamstring.Di María had a vital role in Alejandro Sabella’s side. Javier Mascherano mopped up in front of the back four. Lucas Biglia scuttled around alongside him. And to the left of the three Di María shuttled to the forward line, the vital link between two otherwise disparate units. His role wasn’t glamorous. He was easily overlooked. But once he was gone, his importance became obvious. Enzo Pérez, a far more defensive presence, replaced him. Argentina won the game and went on to reach the final, but in the five hours of football they played at that World Cup after Di María’s injury, they didn’t score another goal.In football’s modern world of glitz and glamour, when it feels as though the super-clubs prefer to sign celebrities rather than submit to the rigours of following a coherent tactical plan, there is an irony in Di María finally beginning to be appreciated at the club that, for so long, was the market leader in placing star quality over structure – and the reverse of that is also true: Di María’s increasing prominence is evidence of PSG’s growing maturity. If they are to win the Champions League, it will almost certainly require Di María to keep Joshua Kimmich quiet and to exploit Bayern Munich’s aggressively high line.For years, it seems, Di María has been underappreciated. Perhaps it’s because he doesn’t look much like a footballer (although he does, from certain angles, bear a striking resemblance to Franz Kafka). He does not have the eye-catching footwork or goals return of many of his teammates. But he does have a remarkable capacity to link one line of a team to another, starting either as a forward or in midfield, and functioning as a bridge from one to the other.In Tuesday’s 3-0 semi-final victory over RB Leipzig, he set up two goals with impeccable crosses and scored the other. But more than that was what he ensured didn’t happen. Against Atalanta, when he had been suspended, a gulf had opened between the front three and the other seven outfielders. Against RB Leipzig, PSG pressed more and the team was far more compact.But this wasn’t even the first Champions League semi-final Di María has dominated. In the second leg in 2014, it was, as much as anything else, his countering ability, his intuition of when to carry the ball and when to offload it, that allowed Real Madrid to unpick Bayern as they won 4-0 at the Allianz.He was the Uefa man of the match in the victory over Atlético in the final as well. Di María had made decisive contributions to the last two games as Madrid clinched la décima, and yet that summer he left. The club has always claimed it was because of the excessive demands of his agent – but that agent is Jorge Mendes, which made Di María’s continued presence at Madrid problematic after the departure the previous summer of José Mourinho, who had lobbied hard for his signing in 2010. Before the final, Madrid asked him not to risk his hamstring as they wanted to sell him to make way for the more obviously marketable James Rodríguez, who bears no resemblance to any gloomy Bohemian modernist.So, having few options, Di María ended up at Manchester United, where he had never really wanted to go. The tendency is to remember Di María’s loss of form and the acrimony that surrounded his departure. But he started the season well and, in 20 league starts, registered three goals and a remarkable 10 assists. The downturn was perhaps in part caused by his frustration at the restrictions placed on him by Louis van Gaal, followed by a break-in at his home that left him fearing for the safety of his family. Di María is naturally introspective and that, combined with struggles with the language, contributed to a general loss of confidence and morale.With Argentina, the situation is more complicated. Di María has won more than 100 caps, some achievement given the wealth of attacking options available to them, but he has undoubtedly been tainted by the years of failure, and the strangely stodgy football a concatenation of brilliant attacking talent habitually produces. There’s no obvious reason that the front three of Lionel Messi, Sergio Agüero and Di María that won Olympic gold in 2008 shouldn’t have brought similar success in the senior game, but it never quite has.While manager after manager has seen Di María and his versatility as part of the solution, there’s a constituency of fans and journalists who have begun to wonder if he’s actually part of the problem. And perhaps he is, but it’s also the case that his unflashy style makes it harder instantly to recall a goal or a run or a pass that could be entered as evidence for the defence.And so to France, where PSG’s resources so dwarf everybody else’s that statistics become so distorted as to be meaningless. Di María’s goals return has shot up from one every seven games in the rest of his career to one in every three – but so it should. But far more significant is his less conspicuous contribution.Di María is one of the very few to have played with Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar. He has thrived with each of them. He is unselfish, makes covering runs, creates space and compensates for their sporadic approach to pressing. It is easy to see why coaches, other than Van Gaal, appreciate an industrious player who naturally balances a side. Then, every now and again, he has a game like he did against Leipzig, and offers a reminder that he’s also an exceptional talent in his own right. To borrow from John Milton, they also serve, who only run about lots in tactically intelligent and selfless patterns."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ab834b02ffd8f95f3bd2158dadb9e40c36e0a68/0_1124_4480_2688/master/4480.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=d1d411e3335d70f031da61c081677894","title":"the perfect setting for a jewellery designer couples home","story":"Rome’s ‘enclave of cool’ provides the ideal location for this light and airy house with an artistic edgeThere’s no place like Rome, but if you talk to designer couple Paolo Giacomelli and Roberta Paolucci, the lesser-known neighbourhood of Pigneto is where the creative spirit of the Italian capital is currently flourishing.The Italian-born founders and designers behind the jewellery brand Iosselliani discovered Pigneto, 5km east of the centre and outside the ancient city walls, in the early 1990s when it was still a sleepy suburb. This was well after the late film director Pier Paolo Pasolini, whose work includes The Gospel According to St Matthew, made it the setting for some of his seminal pieces –but long before the trendy restaurants moved in and the New York Times coined it “an enclave of cool”.Roberta, 54, and Paolo, 57, chose to invest in a location that would provide them with creative headspace. Three decades later, it has more than paid its dues, not least during the months of Covid-19 lockdown.“We feel like it is an island in the city and we have felt so lucky to be here,” says Paolo. “It really is so special and attracts a lot of people – designers, artists and people in fashion – looking for peaceful tranquillity. It isn’t as expensive as other areas around either. We were probably among the first people who moved here and we found it perfect for our lifestyle.”Looking around the home the couple share with their teenage son Rocco, it’s easy to see why. Spacious and airy, the gallery-like space they designed and renovated with architect Adriano Pingaro 12 years ago affords them ample yet intimate room. The exterior is, says Paolo, typical of the kind of single-storey houses that you find locally. The interior, on the other hand, mirrors the aesthetic of their jewellery brand, which is celebrated for mingling old-world craft with modernist charm.A mixture of high-end furniture – including a set of Vittorio Nobili’s sought-after 1955 Medea chairs and Gio Ponti’s more prevalent 646 Leggera chair – sits alongside more quirky personal items, such as treasured vintage glass ceiling lamps and rustic wooden tables. Books that have been carefully collected from outdoor flea markets in downtown Rome abound. The look, says Paolo, is “more Italian baroque” than bohemian.Concrete floors and walls are offset by sumptuous velvets, slinky satins, lightweight linens and an extensive art collection. A piece by photographer Nan Goldin – a 40th-birthday gift to Roberta from Paolo – hangs above the bath, while a cosy glow emits from the bedside lamps, which the pair designed for the Iosselliani Design branch of their brand for GiustiniStagetti – an international contemporary design gallery in Rome.It is, however, the exterior element of this interior that really brings their home to life. Outside space was non-negotiable for the couple, and their home is sandwiched between two gardens. The polished concrete walls and floors that are found throughout the house extend into the outside area, which features a cuboid bath of the same material. Floor-to-ceiling glass doors, meanwhile, form invisible barriers between the two terrains.“In a big city like Rome or Paris or London, it’s not easy to find outside space, but it’s so important for your lifestyle,” explains Paolo, who notes that the weather tends to be good year-round in Rome, so they get to enjoy it all the time.“We love the connection between the inside and the outside,” he continues, “and that’s why we specifically surrounded ourselves by glass – so that the outside and inside feel like the same place.”The stainless-steel kitchen and stripped-back bathroom also nod to the exterior spaces, which helps to further dissolve the boundaries between exterior and interior. “One side is tropical with bamboo and banana trees, because we had a strong connection with tropical places after travelling, and the other is classic Mediterranean with more colour,” says Paolo, admitting that both the thriving gardens are the result of Roberta’s hard work.A stone’s throw away from their home in Pigneto is the couple’s atelier, where they design their collections and have a base for their staff, in addition to their flagship in central Rome. They bought the three-storey structure five years ago and worked 24 hours a day to make it the kind of inspiring place in which they could run their company.Much like their home, the atelier is also open-plan. The double-height space with its navy-blue curtains and a TechnoD70 sofa by Osvaldo Borsani contrasts with neutral upholstery courtesy of Marco Zanuso’s Lady armchair. Jaunty abstraction is introduced by a carpet from Allegra Hicks, while huge fern clippings from Roberta’s garden once again bring the outside in.Art continues on the staircase with portraits and graphic lettering by the contemporary artists Luca Donnini, Pietro Bologna and Tommaso Modugno. It’s an extension of their home a mixture of materials and media that fuels the couple’s day-to-day work and wider existence in the city.“We’re partners in business and life,” says Paolo, before going on to reveal their plan to exercise the Italian tradition-cum-rite of decamping to the seaside, coronavirus restrictions permitting. Which does beg the question: who would want to leave a place like this?

What keeps me coming back is hopeMy daughter is here. Curled up in a hedgehog ball, but softer than anything in the universe. She is born with a quiff of thick black hair and an expression that says she’s been here before. A knowing, testing look. She is early, and small. I begin assessing my baby as if she’s one of my intensive-care patients. I check her reflexes, pupil reaction, respiratory rate and capillary refill time. Mary, the maternity support worker, watches me and laughs. “Nurses and doctors – always the worst patients.”I try not to think of all the babies, children and adults I’ve cared for who were seriously ill, but I can’t stop. I realise that when my daughter hurts, I will hurt more. And she is not hurting. She is fine. But something in me shifts. I think of all the faces of the mothers and fathers and aunts and uncles and grandparents of my patients through all my years of paediatric nursing. I try to imagine their primal pain. How could I not have appreciated the extent of it? In the most desperate of unimaginable horrors, in the face of disability, or serious illness, or pain, or loss, how do patients’ families stand upright? How do they find the courage to care?I pull my daughter closer and kiss her. She smells of honeysuckle and salt, and Plasticine when the packet is first opened, and warm bread, and blood. She is perfect. How could I imagine a love like this?“Crash call for the neonatal, adult and obstetric teams. I repeat: crash call for the neonatal, adult and obstetric teams. Accident and Emergency. Ground floor, Cavell Wing.”There’s only one explanation for why you would need three crash teams at once: a heavily pregnant woman is in trouble. The adult team is to resuscitate her the obstetrics team is to get the baby out (within five minutes, if either of them is to have any chance of survival) and the neonatal team is to try to resuscitate the newborn. Like all the other resuscitation nurses, I am on all the crash teams – adult, paediatric, neonatal, obstetric and trauma – but this crash call will also bring specialist doctors: an obstetrician, a neonatologist, an anaesthetist.Suzanne is wearing a necklace that reads Mama-To-Be. A leopard-print headscarf is holding her ombre hair back from her face. The rest of her is blood and gore and flesh and insides.There are so many people that it’s hard to know where to start, but the person in charge is a nurse with a military background: Amanda. She is one of the best nurses I have ever worked with, a reservist who has worked in field hospitals in Iraq and Afghanistan. She is always calm, efficient and friendly. “Just because it’s an emergency doesn’t mean you can’t find out the names of the team, and be nice. In fact, it’s even more important in an emergency.”Amanda glances over, so that she knows I’m here whenever she needs. I start tidying up, working on the periphery.I do not see how Suzanne or her baby can survive. I focus on the drops of sweat on Amanda’s face, her eyes wildly searching for control, a plan – a way to save this woman and her baby. Or at least one of them. I try to imagine the things she has seen and experienced in her military role. I can’t think of anyone better to lead such a horrific emergency. “She needs to be in theatre as soon as we have this baby out. Like yesterday!” A doctor is on the phone, asking for flying-squad bloods. I watch the defibrillator. Amanda asks a member of the team to put the pads on Suzanne’s chest in advance of a surely imminent cardiac arrest. The obstetrician pulls the baby from her, lifts it out, wipes off the goo vigorously and places it on the Resuscitaire, for another doctor waiting there with a miniature bag-valve-mask and a stethoscope, straight to the baby’s chest. The obstetrician leaves Suzanne split open: it’s impossible to see where the blood is coming from. Large gauze squares do nothing to mop up anything. Anyone can see it’s a devastating amount to lose.There are too many people around Suzanne’s trolley. Despite the lack of room, everyone moves at speed without bumping into one another, each person perfectly choreographed by Amanda.Suzanne’s husband, Simon, is standing outside the room. I go out and stand next to him. His bottom lip is bleeding a little, where he’s bitten it. I tell him I’ll wait with him while they are helping her. But he doesn’t hear me, not really.“She’s ordered a Bugaboo pushchair and is spending her pregnancy ordering everything possible from the Boden catalogue,” he says. “I never imagined we’d end up as this couple.” He laughs a too-thin laugh. “We met in a squat.” He makes a loud noise as he exhales, as if he has no control of his breath.His face is creased with pain. “After 10 failed IVF attempts and two miscarriages, we finally felt as if this one would stick around.” He looks at me, unblinking. “She’ll lose the baby, won’t she? We’ll lose the baby. It’s too early. She was on the phone to me from the car. She was hands-free but still, she’d have been distracted.” He sobs. Covers his mouth with his hand.I don’t say anything. I don’t know yet what he’s been told, but it’s clear that I’m not the right person, and this is not the right time to give significant bad news. I’m terrified that if I open my mouth, the truth will fall out. The terrible truth is that they will probably both die. Not all babies live. Not all mothers live.We stand in silence for a while, before finally I overcome the urge to cry or say nothing at all. “Is there anyone I can call for you?”He shakes his head. Nods at the door. “She’s my everyone.”I nod. “I’ll pop back in and see how things are going.”As I go through the door again, I have to swallow down sick. I look at the scene in front of me. The staff are covered in blood, as is the floor.I focus on the baby on the Resuscitaire, grey and small, and stretched out rather than curled over, as is normal. But the neonatologist looks up at the team: he gives us the thumbs up. This baby lives. I exhale.I rush out to tell Simon.“They are working on Suzanne and she’s still critical. Everyone is doing all they can.” I pause. I don’t want him to underestimate how sick she is. But I can see that he needs something to hold on to. “Your baby is alive.”He looks at me in a kind of trance. “I’m a dad?” he asks.He is clearly so full of love. He doesn’t ask whether the baby is a boy or a girl, and nor do I. When things go this wrong, nobody gives a shit.Suzanne is somehow stable. She is placed in the high-dependency ward and her baby is on special care.I bump into Simon in the corridor two days later, rushing between the two. He is carrying a soft toy hippo. He looks like the happiest man in the world.“Suzanne slept with the hippo against her skin. The midwife said our daughter can smell her, and it’s the closest Suzanne will get to skin-to-skin for now.”“Daughter?” I am smiling.He’s crying. Happy tears. “I’m a wreck,” he says. “She’s so beautiful. Like her mum.” He holds the hippo as if it’s his baby. “I’ve turned into one of those baby bores who gets excited every time she moves.” He laughs. Then he bursts into huge, fat tears, a mixture of pain, trauma and relief. He tells me about Suzanne: how she didn’t wake up for a long time, and it was the scariest moment of his life.“We’re thinking of calling her Amanda, after the doctor who saved her mum’s life.”The adoption process is hard, as it must be. In the early stages, we were asked to list the things that led us to adopt. Miscarriage, I write. Hyperemesis gravidarum, extreme morning sickness. Advised by GP not to get pregnant again. Wanting three-year-old daughter to have a sibling as close to her as my brother is to me. Hoping to do some good? The social worker tells us that children who need to be adopted have extra special needs and there are many uncertainties, so many unknowns. But nursing has allowed me to understand that all parenting is full of uncertainties and unknowns. I have seen close up the most extreme suffering and the most extreme love.The day I bring my son home, it is my birthday. When my social worker asked if I’d like to change days, I laughed out loud. I am desperate to hold him. One night I dream about an umbilical cord that stretches the length of the country and awake with pains in my abdomen.But we are warned about a honeymoon period and things do get very hard, very quickly. He begins to get frightened. He almost seems to see things that aren’t there and hear loud noises in his head. After the initial few days, my son spends the first six months clinging to me, his fingers digging into my flesh so hard that he once draws blood.My mum visits. “What if I’m wrong for him?” I whisper, looking at my son.“Do you love him?” she asks.“So much,” I say. I lean my head on her shoulder. “I can’t even describe it.”She kisses the top of my head as if I am a child. “Then it will all fall into place. I promise.”The following week I take my daughter to her swimming lesson and the noise of the leisure centre freaks my son out so much that he bites me, hard. I yelp. A woman I recognise from the local cafe shouts across the swimming pool viewing area: “Is that the adopted one?” My son turns and listens, and I absolutely know in my bones that he understands what she has said. His face fills with tears. He does not belong. My son and I look at each other. Something shifts. “Is that the adopted one?” she shouts over again. “I see you are struggling.”And I look at my son, this virtual stranger. And he looks at me, this virtual stranger. I stand up and hold him to my body. I walk to the exit, past her, and she touches him. I feel him flinch. I flinch.I hold him closer still, with my arm around his head, away from her. And I feel his fear through my skin. I lift my head high and stare at her.“Oh, fuck off, Janet,” I say. And we go. And he relaxes. For the first time he puts his head down gently on my shoulder. He rests it so gently I can barely breathe. I kiss his head. And he lets me. In that single moment, whatever happens, he somehow knows he is OK. We both are. I am reminded so clearly of the day my daughter was born and the enormity of love that I felt. How could I feel a love like that again? Yet here it is. We are so lucky.“Michael is a 23-weeker in bed six, bay two. His dad’s in prison and his mum is in a facility needing round-the-clock care following a traumatic brain injury. Michael has had a grade-four intraventricular haemorrhage overnight and has been unstable on dopamine, and his gases are impressive. We need to put him back on the oscillator this morning. We’ve been trying to organise for his dad, Danny, to get day-release to visit.” She pauses. “He kicked the pregnant mum in the stomach, then threw her down the stairs. She landed on concrete.”Like the other nurses and student nurses sitting in the staffroom for handover, I shake my head a fraction, but carry on scribbling down the vital information. The nurse in charge pauses a beat, then carries on. She’s seen it all before. “Christie, can you look after him, please? If they agree to the visit, the dad will be accompanied by a prison officer, so we’ll need to make some room around the bed space and be conscious of the other parents.”I nod, but my knees shake. The oscillator machine, which delivers ventilation to the sickest of all babies, is a scary thing, as is caring for a premature baby with a severe bleed in his brain. But it is not those things that worry me.Kicked in the stomach and thrown down the stairs.What kind of monster does that?I pray to any god I can think of that they won’t let the man out to see his son and that I can simply concentrate on caring for Michael. He is hooked up to every machine imaginable – all big, chugging technology with him in the middle: like a full stop in the centre of a chemistry textbook. He has all the trappings of prematurity: lungs that do not yet produce enough surfactant, a gut that does not yet absorb food properly, poor reflexes, a lack of temperature control. He has suffered the worst kind of bleed to his brain. He also has retinopathy of prematurity, the eye condition that caused Stevie Wonder’s blindness. But these conditions don’t paint the picture of him. When I first meet Michael, I notice the downy hair that I recognise from caring for teenagers suffering from anorexia. His skin is almost entirely see-through, and his entire foot is the size of my thumbnail. He has a permanent frown, which makes him look like a grumpy old man, and he smells of yoghurt.“He’s the size of half a bag of sugar, but he is oh-so-mighty and has dodged death so many times that we call him ‘the mouse with nine lives’.” One of the nurses, Grainne, is giving a handover at the bedside. She has written Mighty Mouse on his whiteboard. “We shouldn’t have favourites,” she says, as if she’s talking about her own children, “but he’s mine.”She tells me his history in his short three days of life. Born addicted to crack cocaine and heroin, even in his tiny state he shows signs of foetal alcohol syndrome: characteristic facial features and a small head circumference known as microcephaly. Some children are born with the odds stacked so high against them, it’s impossible to comprehend any meaningful recovery, yet nursing has taught me that it is always a possibility. There is always hope.Michael’s “Mighty Mouse” nickname hints that he might have the will to survive. “I’ve been singing to him all night,” Grainne says. “I think my voice made him frown.” She laughs. But it’s these things that nurses do, which supposedly make no sense, that make the most sense to me.Danny is handcuffed to a prison officer and is next to Michael’s incubator when I return from breakfast at 4pm, my first break of the day. Being non-judgmental towards abusers is difficult and I’ve learned to hate and judge while keeping a poker face. I smile at him and explain the tubes and wires. “Michael’s had a very rough few days.” I tell Danny about the cardiac arrests, the bleed in his brain, the fight in him.Danny laughs at the Mighty Mouse written on the side of Michael’s chart, but he rubs it off and writes Mike Tyson instead. “Little fighter, like me,” he says.“I was born early, too.” Danny is stroking Michael’s head in the softest way possible. “A small bag of sugar.” He looks up at me. “Six foot two now.” “It’s a strange phenomenon that ex-premmies often end up so tall,” I say. We both look at Michael. He is extremely unlikely to survive.I encourage Danny to touch Michael, to talk to him and sing to him. He cracks up laughing at the suggestion of singing, but puts his hand gently underneath Michael’s miniature body and lifts him slightly as I pull the corner of his special sheet to make sure there are no creases. There is a moment, between the two of them. Michael is curled into the palm of his dad’s hand. Danny’s eyes change. It’s one of those extreme moments of love that shock us out of who we are and remind us of who we could be.I take a photo with one of the instant cameras that are always kept in the neonatal intensive care unit, for when a picture urgently needs to be taken. Usually when a baby is close to dying, I take two photos. I take one of Danny’s face, and then a closeup of Michael, curled up in Danny’s hand.It’s a short visit and when it’s time to go, I give Danny the photos. He looks at the one of Michael and he is crying. “I’ll treasure this, nurse.”And I see that he will. It does not allow me to feel pity for him, but he is no longer a monster to me. Just a weak man.“Wait,” I tell him. I disappear and come back with the camera. “Can you hold him carefully again.” Danny picks Michael up and I get the photo – almost exactly the same as the first one. Michael’s heart rate, which was much too high, falls at the touch of Danny’s hand. His father leans towards him and sings, off-key, a few lines of Danny Boy.I wonder if a man ever sang that song to Danny. If that’s how he got his name. And what kind of man he was.Like teachers, nurses can’t influence who a person becomes as much as their parents can. We cannot change the cards they are dealt. Even so, after Danny leaves, I wipe the words Mike Tyson from Michael’s whiteboard. I stick the extra photo to the top of his incubator and write at the top: Important. Please Keep, along with the date and Danny’s name. I write on the whiteboard:Michael, son of Danny and Hannah.Spring 2020. I am walking across Westminster bridge. Behind me, the Houses of Parliament are empty. In front of me, the hospital is full of people seriously ill and dying from Covid-19. The bridge is empty of cars and people, even rough sleepers. I wonder where they have gone.I walk slowly at first. I am so worried for my mum, on her own. And for my nan, shielding and in her 90s. I stop for a moment and text my children. They have grown up overnight. I am a single parent and my 15-year-old daughter, instead of going out to parties and falling in love for the first time, is offering to stay on top of her home schooling and keeping an eye on her younger brother, so I can work long days in nursing. She is planning to cook, so there is a meal waiting when I get home. I tell her she doesn’t need to do that because her adult sister – her dad’s eldest – has offered to stay to help, but she is already writing a menu. Pesto pasta features heavily.“I feel bad about not focusing on you. We ought to be together during this time,” I say at home.“Will you help people?” my daughter asks. I nod and tell them I’m rusty but that, with training and support, I’ll help the nurses, and the patients and their families. I’m planning to help for the first peak, though I have no idea how long that will last. “Do it,” she says.I stand back and look at her grinning, remembering her newly born, curled up in a hedgehog ball. How astonishing she turned out to be. I may not be feeling brave, but my children are. It is always from them that I find the courage to care. My son nods and puts on his determined expression. “You must.”Back on the bridge, I am almost running now. I think of the nurses I have worked with, these expert and compassionate people, and what they have taught me. I get to stand next to them, for a while at least. This pull of my feet and my heart and my head is older and deeper than I can describe in language. Perhaps, for me at least, this is a calling.I slow down at the entrance to the hospital and walk in, catching my breath. My colleague, Sandra, is waiting for me, wearing scrubs and carrying a spare pair for me. We haven’t seen each other for a few years, but there is no time for small talk. She hands the scrubs over and nods. “Welcome home.”• Some names and details have been changed.

But all was not well. Burna Boy was losing his lunch.“I remember when I couldn’t level up,” the singer intones on Level Up, the album opener, “cause the Grammys had me feeling sick as fuck Throwing up and shit Asking questions like, ‘Why it wasn’t us?’”The last time Burna Boy – real name Damini Ogulu – made a record, July 2019’s African Giant, it was a cultural landmark. At last count, this bold Afro-fusion album – a cocktail of Jamaican dancehall, hip-hop, R\u0026ampB, traditional sources such as Fela Kuti-style Afrobeat and more contemporary pan-African party music – has had more than 1bn global streams. Ogulu, who comes from Nigeria but spent significant chunks of his late youth in the UK, sold out Wembley Arena last November. Stormzy, Dave and fellow Nigerian superstar Wizkid were guests.North America was also alive to Burna Boy. Drake, naturally, sampled him as early as 2017. More recently, Ogulu’s work was featured on executive producer Beyoncé’s Lion King companion album, The Gift. Such was Burna Boy’s profile, African Giant was the favourite for the best world music Grammy, a problematic award in itself and one not usually accompanied by hype. Such was the album’s groundbreaking buzz, however, it could have been a contender in the main categories.While all that was true, the slights still rankled. If African Giant confirmed a series of major trends in global music – that “music of black origin” was hybridising rapidly, that the citizens of the wider African diaspora were embracing the music of the continent with fresh ears and that a notionally pop audience was also listening – Twice As Tall finds Burna Boy considering where to go from that puddle of reflux.Spoiler: he does it all again, with bells on. First, though, Ogulu mischievously raises an eyebrow. Level Up opens up with a snippet of a breezy retro song – from the 1959 film Journey to the Centre of the Earth. “I’d have to be twice as tall at least to feel better than I do,” it goes. “Oh I’d have to be thrice as wide at least to feel better, you’ll agree.” Burna Boy’s awards disappointment is played for mirth. No one expects this Pat Boone anachronism. On another level, though, the ditty points up the perennial problem of black insufficiency in the eyes of white gatekeepers.So yes, of course Burna Boy doubles down here. Twice As Tall takes many of the compelling constituent parts of African Giant – the matter-of-fact Yoruba and Pidgin verses, the innovative yet commercial sounds from his Nigerian producers, some high-profile collaborations, his political awakening – and runs them harder. The catchy Wonderful, the first single, goes all out on the theme of Africa as humanity’s motherland the visuals broadcast the sort of riotous tribal maximalism that Beyoncé has now made mainstream.By contrast, the equally arresting Alarm Clock is a wake-up call that features an expressive horn line, a vintage African shuffle and the unexpected spectacle of Sean “Diddy” Combs preaching black unity.For all its fire, this remains an album with good times in its sights. Way Too Big digests Burna Boy’s disappointment and regurgitates it as a bittersweet party tune that grandstands in one breath, and considers the distance he has travelled in the next.Because if Burna Boy wasn’t short of endorsements before, he’s well behind the velvet rope now. Combs is the co-producer here, calling in Anderson .Paak for some beats and Timbaland to add special sauce to Wetin Dey Sup. Stormzy drops by, crooning about peace of mind on Real Life, returning a favour (Burna Boy guested on Stormzy’s Own It).Monsters You Made is, of all things, an anti-colonial hip-hop track that hugs the cadences of Michael Jackson’s Dirty Diana wherever you stand on Chris Martin, he lends his tones here too. Burna Boy’s theme is the “monstering” of black Africans, specifically by the colonial powers, and how the outrage of the brutalised is then condemned afresh. The leap to Black Lives Matter and the actions of certain US police forces is not hard to make. The parallel with Fela Kuti, Nigeria’s poet-warrior, is one that hovers just out of shot. The Ghanaian writer, academic and stateswoman Ama Ata Aidoo is sampled at the end. “Is it over?” she asks, rhetorically.More excellent incursions come from Senegal’s own African giant, Youssou N’Dour, on Level Up, and the veteran hip-hop outfit Naughty By Nature, who Burna Boy loved growing up.Ogulu first made his name in 2012 as a vibes-bringer he surfed a wave of youthful Nigerian confidence that aped US bling, but refashioned it for a new generation of young Africans. Experience has deepened and broadened him. It is a mark of Burna Boy’s distinctiveness that not even the more overweening of the egos on board really staunch his flow.

Workplaces, childcare facilities and businesses, including restaurants and pubs, will remain open, however, leading to questions about how the new restrictions will be policed.Other areas in the north-west including six parts of Greater Manchester are on the government’s “watch list” of places where the number of coronavirus cases is a cause for concern.The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, told Sky News the government’s test-and-trace system was failing and this was the reason for the recent rise in cases.Citing a report that shows the test-and-trace system is reaching only half of the people who have been in contact with somebody who has been infected with coronavirus in the 20 most-affected areas of the country, he said: “The question you have to ask is: Why is it so low in the places where we need it to be highest?”Burnham added that it was “not fair for the government to threaten these places with a lockdown, when they aren’t doing some of the basic things that could be done to help those communities manage the spread of this virus”.On Saturday, Greater Manchester police tweeted: “Please do not call 101 or 999 for clarification on ovid-19 regulations.”The police force also issued several social media posts about parties and gatherings that officers had to break up on Friday evening.These include a wedding party with more than 30 people at a private address in Rochdale, a house party in Oldham attended by more than 30 teenagers, a gathering of more than 50 people in Middleton and a children’s birthday party in a garden in Swinton which was attended by people from three different families.Officers also attended a property in Blackley where 12 people gathered in a private garden were dispersed and issued a fixed penalty notice. The group told officers they were unsure of current restrictions in the north-west as they were not local to Greater Manchester, according to the tweet.The Labour leader of Pendle council, Mohammed Iqbal, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme his borough had in effect been split into two by the new restrictions, which had caused confusion.He said: “The government has announced these tightening restrictions for local people in my area, yet they have not issued any detailed guidance as to how it will operate, who will police it. So local people are actually more confused than they were on Thursday evening.”He said the restrictions, which the council argued against, had been imposed to “punish people who have been testing flat out”.Meanwhile, the Oldham council leader, Sean Fielding, said the local authority had more enforcement capacity to take action against people breaking the rules. He told BBC Breakfast that at least one pub had been closed in the past 24 hours.He said: “Part of our discussions with government which helped us to avert the kind of economic lockdown of the kind in Leicester was a pledge around increasing the capacity in our enforcement teams so that we could take action where we had reports of businesses or premises or households not following the rules.“So when we receive those reports we now have additional capacity around enforcement and compliance to take action, whether it’s fines, whether it’s closure orders or whatever. We have closed at least one pub in the last 24 hours.”He added that the local authority was enlisting the help of celebrities to get the new coronavirus restriction messages across. Fielding said it had recruited Azhar Ali, the Pakistan cricket captain, and the actor James Buckley, who played Jay in the TV series The Inbetweeners.Cases in Oldham reached 103.1 per 100,000 people during the week ending 13 August, with Blackburn and Pendle reaching 95.3 and 75.5 cases per 100,000 people respectively."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f538f1aafbcd74e3499879f35908de43ec759e85/0_100_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=fffb9f9b85e2ef0e71e6709eabdeb231","title":"pick up basketball bounces back after covid cancellation photo essay","story":"With courts locked and hoops removed in lockdown the sense of community was missed as much as the sport. Now it’s ‘such a relief’ to be back • See more of Nick Lawrence’s photographyby  Kieran Pender, photography by Nick Lawrence and video by  Carly EarlJacinta Govind has had a lifelong love affair with the sport of basketball. She first picked up a ball at age eight, attended Sydney Kings games with her family and watched footage of the era-defining Chicago Bulls alongside her NBA-obsessed older brother. Govind’s ability saw her rise through high-school ranks to the heights of the WNBL, Australia’s professional league, spending a year with the Canberra Capitals. “I probably didn’t stop playing basketball from the time I was eight until I was 22,” she recalls.After a hiatus while she trained as an occupational therapist, Govind was lured back to the courts of Terrigal on the NSW Central Coast by the sport’s purest form: pick-up basketball. “It was the first-time I could play just for fun,” she says.Pick-up is unstructured, free-flowing basketball, organised on an ad hoc basis at thousands of indoor and outdoor courts across Australia. There are no referees, no scoreboards and few rules. “Playing pick-up helped me find my passion for basketball again,” Govind says. “If I made a mistake, no one would care. If I missed all the shots, no one would care. If I played like Kobe, everyone would cheer. It’s just fun.”Covid-19 changed all that. When community sport was restricted in March and then ultimately prohibited, these informal basketball games were among the casualties. Courts were locked, hoops were removed from outdoor facilities and police patrolled popular shoot-around locations. For hundreds of pick-up communities, the impact was immense.“It was a real struggle,” says Fadzayi Chambati. Zai, as the 19-year-old Zimbabwe-born Chambati is known to his pick-up opponents, had dropped out of university to focus on training at the beginning of 2020. He had hoped to secure a basketball scholarship at an American college, with aspirations of a professional career. “Everyone went through a rough time,” he says. “But I also found it brought me closer to people. Some guys I knew through pick-up – one gave me a hoop, another gave me a ball, to enable me to keep training.”Govind, who was midway through rehabilitation from an ankle injury, also found herself alone on one of the few outdoor courts that were still accessible. “Sometimes I would shoot by myself, but it just wasn’t the same,” she says. “I felt really lost.”For many pick-up enthusiasts, the loss of community was felt just as keenly as the absence of the actual basketball. Nick Jackson missed pick-up more acutely than most. From Perth originally, Jackson had lived in Europe for much of the past decade – playing basketball wherever he went. In February, he moved to Sydney and initially found himself immersed in the pick-up scene in Redfern. “It was a great way to get to know people,” says Jackson. “Then lockdown happened. They literally locked the courts.”In NSW, community sport was permitted to return in early July. Pick-up games were quickly back in full flow. “I didn’t realise how much I missed it until I went back again – seeing all those familiar faces,” says Govind. For Jackson, after a long stint alone, the social aspect was particularly important. “It has been good just to chat with people again – talk about basketball and what is going on in the NBA. Everyone missed it.”Throughout lockdown, Chambati was determined not to let Covid-19 derail his international basketball ambitions. “I was itching to get back on the court,” he tells  Australia from the United States, having just arrived in Kentucky after finally securing a college sporting scholarship. “Basketball was the only thing on my mind.” Having trained alone during April, May and June, Chambati found his game had actually improved. “Covid-19 gave me an opportunity to practice,” he continues. “In the first game back, no one was expecting anyone to be good – but I was lighting it up! It was such a relief to be back.”Photographer Nick Lawrence’s Pick Up People project explores stories from the basketball court.

And it’s not hard to see why.A film-set perfect 25-mile ribbon of mountainous coastline, its colourful villages, fragrant lemon groves and deep blue sea form a Unesco world heritage site.And as with all Italian regions, the local food and drink is inextricably tied to the culture which means that even if you can’t actually strut your stuff in Positano, you can cook up a bit of Italian sunshine in your kitchen.Alessandro Savelli is CEO and founder of UK-based Pasta Evangelists, which makes premium fresh pasta and sauces for home cooking – with next day delivery across the UK – in addition to its coveted concession in Harrods, now back open for business following the easing of lockdown restrictions.He learned to make pasta with his grandmother. Step one, he says, is to understand the culture. “I am Italian. I love food. I love pasta. I love cooking. Meals in Italy are when the family comes together to talk and enjoy delicious food. It is the highlight of our day. Food is not just seen as a necessity.”He celebrates the regional roots of Italian cuisine, sharing culture and stories to support local speciality pasta dishes. The food of the southern Italian Amalfi coast is different to that of his native Genoa, in the north, but it is close to his heart.“We go every year. My wife is from Naples and we married in Capri. I love it. The people are friendly, funny and loud, and the cuisine has everything – from amazing fish and seafood, fruits and vegetables to wonderful pizza and pasta. I discovered dishes that only really exist in that area.”His personal favourite is spaghetti alla nerano, with fried courgette and provolone cheese. While scialatielli – somewhere between linguine and tagliatelle in shape – with Amalfi lemon, ‘nduja sausage and mascarpone, features on the Pasta Evangelists’ Amalfi week menu.“Pasta dishes are about simplicity, freshness and few ingredients. We can bring that to your home,” he says. Although he admits he can’t deliver the full experience. “In Italy, we do tend to take the sunshine for granted.”Carla Bollati, a retired doctor from Turin, was introduced to the area around Amalfi by her late partner Gennaro, a Neapolitan. “I have a deep sentimental attachment,” she says. “And the tastes are a lovely way to travel to happy memories.”She was struck by the area’s scenery from her first visit. “It is a crowded landscape that cannot be changed. But there is also such special light and colour, the perfume of lemons, so many wonderful flavours. All the senses are covered.”The people and cuisine of the south are, she says, another huge draw. “They cook with what the area has to offer. Try a mozzarella there and you will understand what it is supposed to be.”Culinary roots and rules are revered, she adds. “If I cooked Neapolitan pasta e fagioli – with beans – for Gennaro, it had to be with broken odds and ends of pasta. Shells just wouldn’t be right. We Italians are so tied to the history of our food and the habit of coming together to eat it.”Italian food expert and cook, Paola Maggiulli, who runs the Tiny Italian supper clubs and cookery courses, agrees. But she insists it is a very inclusive tradition. To create an authentic Italian dinner, she says, the starting point is confidence.“Anyone can make Italian food. It is about flavour, not technique. With a few quality ingredients you can make incredible dishes.”Having spent much of her childhood in her father’s south London Italian deli, she recommends taking time to shop for good ingredients and learn the stories behind them.“In normal times, what is special about Italian food is the connection and time with other people. That might be planning the menu with friends or helping your grandmother prepare Sunday lunch for the extended family. Community and family are everything. Sharing the experience of eating with people you care about just makes you feel better.”So what would Maggiulli serve for a feelgood dinner inspired by the Amalfi coast?“I would want those incredible lemons,” she says, suggesting simple spaghetti with lemon, parmesan, olive oil and basil as a first course.“Amalfi seafood is beautiful, too. So perhaps a main of braised octopus, mussels cooked in white wine, or a frittura mista platter of fried squid and prawns,” she says. A chocolate and almond cake – a torta caprese after the island of Capri – would end the meal nicely.When you host your party, build the convivial atmosphere by serving the food on large dishes in the middle of the table, for guests to help themselves, and make sure the conversation, as well as the drinks, are flowing.For the latter, Daniele Umoette, former bar manager and drinks brand ambassador from Carpi in the northern region of Emilia-Romagna, suggests a gin spritz aperitif to kickstart the evening.“Mix blood orange flavoured Malfy Gin Con Arancia with Fever Tree Sicilian Lemon Tonic and a splash of prosecco over lots of ice in a nice glass, and garnish with some fruit such as blackberries, pink grapefruit slice and some aromatic herbs such as sage,” he says.Admittedly, your after-dinner stroll will probably be a little less glamorous than the nightly passeggiata in Positano. Maybe next year. Meanwhile, buon appetito.Malfy Gin is available to purchase in selected Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, Asda, M\u0026ampS, Waitrose and Co-op stores, as well as Ocado and the Malfy Gin Amazon brand storePlease drink Malfy Gin responsibly.

In the early days it formed the basis of many a #quarantini – made from whatever we might have left in the cupboard. Since then, the hashtag has clocked up more than 87,000 posts and the term has passed into the popular lexicon. Now, take it a notch higher for the ultimate cocktail moment. With Malfy Gin, you can create the most authentic Italian style aperitivo hour. Try a Malfy Gin Rosa G\u0026ampT by mixing a measure of Malfy Gin Rosa with Mediterranean tonic in a copa glass over ice and garnishing with a pink grapefruit wheel. Or, for an added touch of sophistication, mix a measure of Malfy Gin Rosa with 50ml prosecco and 50ml San Pellegrino Arraciata Rossa over ice in a wine glass, and garnish with an orange wheel, strawberry slice and sprig of thyme to create a Amalfi Sunset Spritz.Front-room festivalsIf you missed glamping it up at Glasto or living it up at Latitude this summer, there’s nothing to stop you recreating that festival feeling right in your front room. This year, with staycations booming, boutique bell tents are all the rage, and whether you’re a Hyde Park regular, or head to the Isle of Wight every summer, you don’t have to miss out. Pitch your tent in the garden – or indoors if it’s raining – swing open the patio doors, pour yourself a Malfy Gin and tonic, and cue up your festival playlist. Designer wellies optional.UpcyclingNesting has taken on new meaning as we’re spending more time than ever at home, meaning that we are looking to make our personal spaces as cosy and reassuring as possible. With major home improvement projects put on hold, we’re looking at subtler ways to spruce up our living spaces, often going hand-in-hand with the crafts we’ve taken up to help while away our extended free time. Repurposing old units and reupholstering much-loved chairs are at the top of many DIY lists – and when it comes to themes and patterns, rainbows and bright, uplifting shades are the order of the day.Micro garden partiesWith our close friends and family having been out of bounds for so long, we’re getting to know the neighbours. WhatsApp groups for inidual streets and blocks of flats are springing up across the country as we look closer to home for friendship, support and entertainment.Scaled-down garden parties comprising small groups of neighbours dressing up and bringing over their own food and drinks – nibbled and sipped at a respectful distance – make for eclectic gatherings and unexpected new friendships being forged.Staying ‘in-in’Now we can no longer go “out-out” – and with loungewear fatigue firmly setting in – summer is about dressing up for virtual socialising. Many of us are seeing more of our friends than ever as we plan regular catch-ups via online video calling, from family quizzes to propping up a virtual bar with friends, while Royal Ascot 2020 saw thousands of us donning fascinators in front of the TV in aid of frontline charities. So as the weather warms up, it’s time to cast off your lockdown look and raise a glass of Malfy Gin in style.Locally sourced picnicsWith public transport still only used for essential travel and some of our favourite parks and gardens closed, we’re exploring the green spaces closer to home for a suitable patch of grass on which to spread our blankets.The best-dressed picnic baskets are filled with treats that support local producers, from honey collected by local beekeepers and veg from the farmer’s market, to unique small-batch cheeses and British charcuterie sliced on to artisanal sourdough. Explore your local high street to see what gems you can unearth.Home cooking with a little helpOnce we realised how much mess keeping a sourdough starter alive entails, the appeal of devoting ourselves to becoming expert home chefs faded fairly fast. With more food businesses pivoting to offer meal kits designed to be finished off at home for that personal touch, there’s no better time to start enjoying gourmet food delivered to your door (without worrying about it getting cold). For a taste of Italy, Pasta Evangelists offer artisan pasta and sauces via next-day delivery across the UK, which can be whipped up at home in minutes. With dishes inspired by culinary traditions found across Italy, from Venice to Sicily, you can be taken on a foodie journey with all the taste and minimum effort.Growing lupinsSince lockdown began, gardening has shot up in popularity, with garden centres opening some time before other non-essential businesses. From window sills to flower beds, this summer is about attempting to turn green spaces into a riot of colour to rival the rainbows pinned in people’s windows, and the West Country Lupin has been particularly popular. Packed with uplifting colour, lupins are easy to grow and soothing to look at, making them the ideal flower to plant this summer.Virtual destination toursGrounded globetrotters are fulfilling their wanderlust by taking virtual tours of some of the world’s most stunning spots. Choose from tours offering 360-degree views of popular destinations such as Tokyo or Machu Picchu, or watch a live stream from San Diego Zoo or California’s Monterey Bay Aquarium.You can even take a treadmill walk through the Colosseum – made even more authentic by concocting a refreshing gin spritz with Malfy Gin Rosa to take with you on your virtual tour.CottagecoreAnyone not ensconced in a countryside pad with an acre or two of garden attached is currently looking enviously towards the idyllic-looking lockdowns of those who are. As even the most ardent city-dweller wrests with sourdough starters and homemade crumpets, we’re being calmed by a trend that has been dubbed “cottagecore” – an aesthetic oozing with images of perfect-looking pies, vases filled with wildflowers and verdant countryside.

In fresh guidelines developed in cooperation with UNICEF it said children should wear “a mask under the same conditions as adults, in particular when they cannot guarantee at least a one-metre distance from others and there is widespread transmission in the area”.The advice came as South Korea reported 332 new cases on Saturday, including 315 local infections. The figure is the highest since 8 March, when it recorded 367 infections.All of the country’s 17 major cities and provinces reported cases for the first time since January, Yonhap reported. It said stricter social distancing rules would be imposed outside the greater Seoul area, from Sunday. The government had previously raised social distancing rules in Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi province to level two in the three-tier system.Karaoke bars, clubs and computer cafes were ordered to close and Sunday church services have been banned.South Africa’s Covid-19 infections passed 600,000 on Friday, although the number of new cases has been declining since a peak in July. Despite imposing one of the world’s toughest lockdowns at the end of March, when the country had only a few hundred cases, South Africa saw a surge in coronavirus infections that has left it the hardest hit on the continent.The government eased lockdown restrictions this week to allow most of the economy to re-open. But President Cyril Ramaphosa cautioned that cases could surge if people failed to maintain vigilance.Brazil reported 30,355 new cases of the coronavirus and 1,054 deaths, the health ministry said on Friday. Despite this, the WHO’s emergencies director Michael Ryan told a virtual press conference that there was a “clear downward trend in many parts of Brazil”.The country has recorded nearly 6,900 deaths and more than 290,000 cases in the last seven days, according to the UN health agency: “The acceleration of cases has stabilised but there’s still a very high number of cases and a large number of deaths,” Ryan said.“Credit to the health workers and the communities in Brazil for taking the necessary actions to stabilise the situation,” he said.“We’re in that difficult period in Brazil where it looks like things could be getting better. The question is: is this a lull, can this be continued and can we see that downward trend?”Brazil has more than 3.5m cases of Covid-19 since the pandemic began, while the official death toll is more than 113,00.In Europe Germany, France, Spain and Italy, all saw infection levels rise to rates not seen in months, sparking fears over a second wave on the continent.In Spain’s capital Madrid, officials recommended people in the most affected areas stay at home to help curb the spread as the country registered more than 8,000 new cases in 24 hours. The figure was a 1,000-case jump on the previous day.France reported 4,500 new cases on Friday, the second consecutive day of more than 4,000 new infections –numbers not seen since May – with metropolitan areas accounting for most of those infections.Germany reported 2,034 cases on Saturday, its highest daily cases since 25 April.

Follow the latestIn Australia, the Covid-19 death toll has topped 500, with many new fatalities again coming from the aged care sector in virus-hit Victoria, Australian Associated Press reported.A further 11 deaths in Victorian aged care facilities were reported on Sunday out of a total of 17. It takes the state’s toll to 415 and the national total to 502.Federal Labor on Monday will keep the heat on the Morrison government over its handling of the aged care sector during the coronavirus pandemic when parliament sits for the first time for 10 weeks.Opposition health spokesman Chris Bowen says the number of deaths in aged care homes during the crisis has been heartbreaking. “At every test for the federal government they’ve failed when it comes to aged care,” Mr Bowen told Sky News’ Sunday Agenda program.Defending the government’s approach to the crisis, Finance Minister Mathias Cormann said aged care was a vulnerable sector in the pandemic.“If you have got a jurisdiction like Victoria where there is a massive outbreak ... the aged care sector inevitably is particularly exposed,” Senator Cormann told reporters on Sunday.He said the government had put more than $1 billion in place to support the sector during the pandemic.“But in the end, in the face of this sort of pandemic, there is a practical limit to how effective that sadly can be in the context of a virus like this,” Senator Cormann said.Victoria also reported 208 new infections on Sunday, the first time above the 200 mark in three days. Victorian chief health officer Brett Sutton said although the daily case numbers were “jumping around”, he expected they were on a downward trajectory. Associated Press has some further details on the situation in India, where authorities are using cheaper, faster but less accurate tests to scale up testing. It is feared that cases are going undetected, contributing to the spread of the virus.The use of these rapid tests boosted India’s testing levels nearly five-fold within two months. But government numbers suggest some parts of the country might have become over reliant on the faster tests, which can miss infections. Experts warn that safely using them requires frequent retesting, something that isnt always happening.Cases surged faster than labs could scale up testing once India’s harsh lockdown was relaxed. So far authorities have rationed the use of the more precise molecular tests that detect the genetic code of the virus. But on June 14, India decided to bolster these with faster tests that screen for antigens, or viral proteins.Albeit less accurate, these tests are cheap and yield results in minutes. Most don’t require a lab for processing or any specialized equipment or trained personnel. The plan was to rapidly increase testing to identify infected people and prevent them from spreading the virus. Samples tested using both tests increased from 5.6 million in mid-June to 26 million two months later, and nearly a third of all tests conducted daily are now antigen tests, health officials say.But India’s experience also highlights the inherent pitfalls of relying too heavily on antigen tests, at the expense of more accurate tests. The danger is that the tests may falsely clear many who are infected with Covid-19, contributing to new spread of the virus in hard-hit areas.India’s coronavirus caseload has topped 3 million, as the virus spreads in the country’s southern states.India has the third-highest caseload in the world after the US and Brazil, Associated Press has reported. But with the rate of infection growing in recent weeks, experts fear India could soon surpass those countries.The rise in new infections has since leveled off in India’s two largest cities, New Delhi and Mumbai, with serological surveys showing widespread prevalence among populations. New hotspots have emerged in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh.The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 782 to 232,864, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Sunday. The reported death toll rose by two to 9,269, the tally showed. Irish premier Micheal Martin announced Sunday he would recall parliament following a scandal over politicians breaching coronavirus rules, Agence France-Presse has reported.Martin and his coalition government partners, deputy prime minister Leo Varadkar and cabinet minister Eamon Ryan, “have agreed that the Dail (parliament) should be recalled”, a spokesman said. The news came after two days of political turmoil following revelations that swathes of lawmakers and senior politicians attended a parliamentary golf society dinner in breach of coronavirus guidelines. The Irish Examiner newspaper revealed 82 high profile figures - including EU trade commissioner Phil Hogan - attended the Oireachtas (parliament) Golf Society dinner on Wednesday night. The event was held just 24 hours after the government announced fresh COVID-19 restrictions to curb a new surge in cases, including no “formal or informal events or parties” to be held at hotel restaurants. It was reported that attendees at the dinner sat at tables of 10 in breach of coronavirus guidelines, and organisers erected a room ider in a bid to skirt legislation banning gatherings of more than 50. But police on Friday said they had opened an investigation into the event for alleged breaches of that same legislation. New Zealand has recorded one new coronavirus case, a household contact of a someone linked to the recent cluster in South Auckland. A further three cases are under investigation. In addition, two new infections have been identified in official quarantine facilities.The Australian state of Western Australia has recorded one new case of Covid-19 overnight, taking the state’s total to 652. There are nine active cases.The new case is an interstate traveller who has returned from overseas and is currently in hotel quarantine.Agence France-Presse has the following update on the global spread of the coronavirus, which has now led to more than 800,000 deaths worldwide:Western Europe, particularly Spain, Italy, Germany and France, has been hit with infection levels not seen in many months, sparking fears of a fully-fledged second wave.And in Asia, South Korea became the latest country to announce it would boost restrictions to try to stem a new outbreak, after largely bringing the virus under control.Across the world, the number of deaths has doubled to just over 800,000 since June 6, with 100,000 fatalities in the last 17 days alone, while more than 23 million cases have been reported. Latin America is the region the most affected, while more than half the global fatalities have been reported in the hardest-hit US, Brazil, Mexico and India. South Korea reported its highest daily rise in novel coronavirus cases since early March on Sunday, as outbreaks continued to spread from a Seoul church and from political demonstrations its members had attended, Reuters reported. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) confirmed 397 new infections as of midnight Saturday, up from the previous day’s 332 and marking more than a week of daily three-digit rises.  That brings South Korea’s total to 17,399 infections of the new coronavirus with 309 COVID-19 deaths, it said.  From Sunday, the government imposed second-tier social-distancing rules in areas outside Seoul, banning in-person church meetings and closing nightclubs, buffets and cyber cafes.  Health authorities say they may eventually deploy the toughest stage 3 social-distancing rules, where schools and business are urged to close, if the rate of increase in new infections does not slow soon. In England, fines of up to 10,000 for those organising illegal raves will come into force ahead of the bank holiday as authorities clamp down on unlawful gatherings, PA Media reports.Officers have responded to a surge in unlicensed music events in recent weeks amid warm weather and an easing of lockdown restrictions. Tougher measures targeting those breaching coronavirus regulations on large gatherings will come into effect on Friday, ahead of an August bank holiday weekend. Prime minister Boris Johnson said that new fines were to be introduced for those hosting raves when he announced a further easing of England’s lockdown last week. People facilitating or organising illegal raves, unlicensed music events or any other unlawful gathering of 30 people or more may face a 10,000 fine. Participants can continue to be issued with fines of 100, while those who have already been fined will see the amount double on each offence, up to a maximum of 3,200. The moves come on another busy weekend for police in regard to unlawful gatherings. Birmingham Police said they attended more than 70 unlicensed street and house parties on Saturday night, while police in Huddersfield broke up an illegal rave involving some 300 people. The politan Police received information on more than 200 events across London in a single weekend, responding to more than 1,000 illegal events in the capital since the end of June. Police in the Australian state of Victoria have fined 199 people for breaching coronavirus restrictions, according to Australian Associated Press.Of the people fined in the 24 hours to Sunday, 73 were in breach of the 8pm to 5am curfew in metropolitan Melbourne, 20 were pinged for failing to wear a mask when leaving home and 14 were picked up at vehicle checkpoints.Five men found inside a vehicle in Airport West told police they were “just out chilling”. A man was also seen leaving a petrol station in Glen Eira after curfew. He told police he had been buying chocolate for a friend with diabetes who had low blood sugar. “When asked to produce chocolate he admitted to lying and produced cigarettes he had just purchased,” police said in a statement on Sunday.Police conducted 3,869 spot checks on people at homes, businesses and public places across the state. Some 316,136 spot checks have been conducted since 21 March.The Australian Capital Territory has recorded no new Covid-19 cases over the past 24 hours, meaning the tally of infections remains at 113. Of these infections, 110 have recovered. There are no Covid-19 patients in Canberra hospitals. In total, three deaths have been recorded. South Africa’s retail industry is feeling the pain from the coronavirus pandemic on two fronts - store closures during lockdown and the sharply reduced purchasing power of households, reports Agence France-Presse.South Africa, the continent’s most industrialised economy, went into strict lockdown at the end of March, with people only allowed to shop for essential items such as food, medicine and winter clothing. It is also the African country that has been hardest hit by Covid-19, with more than 600,000 cases and at least 2,500 deaths. Restrictions have been gradually rolled back since June. Alcohol and tobacco sales were allowed to resume this week and, generally, business is now almost back to normal. Nevertheless, retailers are reeling from the economic effects of months of suffocating restrictions. Massmart was already in dire straits before the pandemic and closed a 23-store electronic retail chain and 11 wholesale outlets shortly before the lockdown came into effect. “Retailers that were already taking the strain” in an economy that was contracting even before the outbreak have found themselves vulnerable to the virus fallout, said Casperus Treurnicht, portfolio manager at Gryphon Asset Management. The 17 deaths from Covid-19 in Australia’s state of Victoria  announced on Sunday included 11 people who had been in aged care facilities and took the state’s death toll beyond 400, to 415.The state declared 208 new cases, and chief health officer Dr Brett Sutton said the trajectory of the outbreak was decreasing. He said: “We are not going to see three-hundreds or four-hundreds again – not under my watch.”The latest deaths were one man and one woman in their 60s, three men in their 70s, four women and six men in their 80s and two men in their 90s. Some 585 Victorians were in hospital with 32 in intensive care, including 21 on ventilators. Victoria is now halfway through a six-week period of hard lockdowns. The premier Daniel Andrews said if the state was to open up early, the freedom enjoyed by people would be short-lived and a third wave would be inevitable.He said: “There’s going to be a massive job of repair but we are up to that.”"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"One Change: We need to rethink the value we place on the natural environmentActivist says ongoing denial about scale of crisis contrasts with urgency of Covid fightEvaluation suggests using ecosystem thresholds to develop policies is not best approach"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"The by-the-wind sailor\u0026rsquos sworn foe, the violet sea snail, floats upside-down alongside itMichael Viney: North Atlantic\u0026rsquos top predator now shares island with 13 other speciesMichael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillClaire Twomey’s coronavirus journey started mildly enough – and hasn’t stopped.“Initially, it was only a headache, and sinus pain last March, and I lost the sense of taste and smell. Then I spent four or five days in bed with a ferocious fever, a cough and migraines.”She attempted to go back to work, but her fever and cough worsened and she spent another four weeks in bed with a high temperature.Despite periods of apparent improvement, months later, she’s still coughing. “A trip up the stairs aggravates the cough. I go to the shops and I suffer a loss of breath.Ms Twomey is one of a large and increasing cohort of coronavirus patients who are experiencing longer-term effects of the disease. In Ireland and across the world, doctors are linking the virus to a bewildering variety of symptoms and, as time goes on, they are finding many of these are slow to resolve.Dublin GP Nuala O’Farrell describes the virus as “the imitator of all known diseases”.“Headache, dry cough and fever, we all know about. Diarrhoea, blistery lesions that look vaguely like shingles on the trunk, chilblains, chest pain, tachycardia, arrhythmias, pericarditis (swelling of heart tissue) and of course elderly people who are just ‘not themselves’, can all be symptoms of Covid.”Rollercoaster rideA number of her patients have been on a rollercoaster ride of symptoms since contracting the disease. “One woman went from doing spinning classes four times a week to, two weeks after testing positive, being hardly able to walk up the stairs. Her head was splitting, she had no sense of taste or smell and every bone in her body was aching. Eight weeks on, she is only beginning to recover.”Ms Twomey, too, has found that being fit provided little protection against the disease. “I did yoga, I ran. Now if I try to do anything, I have to take to the bed for four or five hours. I have aches in my arms and legs. I’ve gastro issues, and tingling sensations on my skin.”“When we say that the vast majority of people have a mild illness and recover that is true,” says Dr Mike Ryan, the World Health Organisation’s head of emergencies. “But what we cannot say at the moment is what are the potential long-term impacts of having had that infection.“We hope that everybody who recovers from Covid-19 will make a full and permanent recovery but there are enough people out there having difficulties with their exercise tolerance, having difficulties with their breathing and potentially having long-term impacts on their cardiovascular system.”International findings dovetail with the experiences of some Irish patients. One international study suggested 10 to 15 per cent of people, including some mild cases, do not enjoy a quick recovery. In Italy, 87 per cent of one group of patients who had been hospitalised were still struggling two months later.It remains too early in this novel pandemic to say how long patients’ symptoms will endure, and whether the virus will give rise to chronic disease.The ergence in patients’ symptoms is driven by the varying way the virus attacks the body, often leading to inflammation and blood clotting as well as respiratory ailments.Notable too is the number of patients who say they were previously fit and healthy but are now having lasting problems, as well as “up and down” nature of many patients’ recoveries.SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is proving remarkably adept at disrupting many areas of activity in the body. It uses a spike protein to attach itself onto cells’ ACE2 receptors, found in the lungs, heart, gut, kidneys, blood vessels and nervous system. Often, the damage is done as much by the overweening inflammatory reaction of the body as to the original infection.“We still don’t know what we’re grappling with in terms of the long-term cardiac manifestations,” says consultant cardiologist Dr Crochan O’Sullivan. “The interaction between the virus and the ACE2 enzyme triggers its entry into cells in the body.”Stroke is a particular risk linked to coronavirus given the role of the virus in making patients more susceptible to blood clotting.Ms Twomey says what really exhausts her is having to deal with three or four issues at the same time. “The fatigue is like nothing I’ve ever experienced in my life. It’s like a crash.”Her yo-yo experience of the disease prompts her to remark that “my recovery is worse than the initial experience”.Along with her parents, who also tested positive for the virus, she attends the Mater post-coronavirus clinic in Dublin. “They’ve been great,” she says, “but there’s only so much they can do. They still don’t know the answers”.Dr Killian Hurley is a respiratory consultant at Beaumont Hospital, where he heads up a post-coronavirus clinic, and the RSCI. Over the last six months the clinic, which takes referrals only from patients who were hospitalised, has seen more than 100 patients.Severe fatigueThe clinic provides patients with access to specialists from a variety of disciplines including respiratory medicine, intensive care, infectious diseases, psychology and psychiatry.Dr Hurley says patients come with a wide variety of lasting symptoms, including continuous shortness of breath, cough, severe fatigue, anxiety and other mental health issues.Some of those who spent periods in intensive care are suffering a form of post-traumatic stress disorder, he says.Many have lung problems months after their disease experience. “They still have abnormalities on their chest X-rays there’s scarring there, particularly among those who were in intensive care.”For a small group, even walking a short distance after six months causes them difficulties. Generally Dr Hurley finds that the more severe their illness was, the more severe are their continuing after-effects.“This is a totally new disease. We don’t have 40 years of research into this. My sense is, though, that it will be a mild disease for many, with a good chance of eventual recovery.”However, many patients are “terrified”, he acknowledges, and “frightened about what the future might hold”.Stressing the need to identify problems early, he says the health service needs to be proactive in following through with patients in a standardised way.This is difficult when only 50 to 75 per cent of health service capacity is available due to coronavirus restrictions, and while the system is continuing to battle new infections.He says his “hope” is that the residual problems of most patients will resolve over the space of a year, as happened with other respiratory syndromes.Ms Twomey has set up an online support group for coronavirus survivors, which now has more than 400 members.The Facebook group is providing a forum for discussion, sharing of experiences and guidance.Suffering“People feel they don’t have answers to their questions. They’re frustrated because there isn’t one place for them to go to seek those answers,” she says.Many people suffering symptoms, including those who were never tested because their symptoms didn’t meet the criteria in place at the time, and those whose tests came back negative, are not eligible to attend the clinics and so have to plot inidual recovery journeys.But in mid-April she developed fatigue and nausea. One day she “couldn’t get out of bed”.Because she had only one of the symptoms required at the time to be sent for testing, she never got a diagnosis.She says her condition worsened, as she developed shortness of breath and heart palpitations, “brain fog” and loss of memory.“It came that I couldn’t remember the right word to use in a situation. Or I would be looking at words and not recognising them, or saying the wrong word,” she says.Eventually she got a test, but to her distress it came back negative.Still her condition did not improve. “I used to run or walk 15km a day, but now I couldn’t leave the house. I’d have a couple of good days, and think things were fabulous for a week. And then the next day, it would hit me like a train again.”Still suffering from a “rollercoaster of symptoms” after 16 weeks, she had to stop working and tending her garden. “I’ve had relapse after relapse. It’s the uncertainty and the not knowing that is so hard to take, not being able to live a normal life and the impact on your mental health.”She realises others have it worse but wonders how long her symptoms will persist.“I don’t think I can cope with another six months of this. People don’t understand how long term this can be, and the damage that can be done.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Woman is first prisoner to test positive for coronavirus in the RepublicHundreds attend event which passes off largely peacefullyDublin-Belfast service \u0026lsquohad higher than anticipated demand\u0026rsquo, company saysOne third of people surveyed say they gained weight, as one fifth worry about food suppliesCompletion from test referral to contact tracing now taking 2.1 days \u0026ndash HSEPolice across district self-isolating and will be tested, says senior commanderBelfast court told that MI5 were involved in PSNI investigationBid underway to replace 175-year-old monkey puzzle tree which fell in Cork during stormAccused ordered to surrender his passport, sign on daily and keep a curfew while on bailEstimated 25,000 Hindus living in Ireland, says director of Vedic Hindu Cultural CentreShannon Heritage had warned heritage sites would close in less than two weeksMartin says new Covid-19 law will target businesses \u0026lsquoendangering public health\u0026rsquo rather than house partiesAs patients report longer-term effects, it remains too early to say how long symptoms will lastPoliticians would be unwise to underestimate level of public anger about revelationsHandling of crisis has transformed view, from \u0026lsquopale, male and stale\u0026rsquoJohn Mullan (49), children Tom\u0026aacutes (14) and Amelia (6) die but mother Geraldine survivesInternal study for first time details force\u0026rsquos relationship with ethnic minoritiesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4336818.1598129691!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"d%C3%A1il to be recalled early in wake of golf dinner controversy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Micheál Martin and Tánaiste have asked Phil Hogan to consider his position. Photograph: MaxwellsThe Coalition parties have agreed to recall the Dáil amid calls for accountability in the wake of the Oireachtas Golf Society dinner which breached Covid-19 regulations.In a statement, the Government said: “The Taoiseach, Tánaiste, and Minister Eamon Ryan have agreed that the Dáil should be recalled following the reopening of schools. The Taoiseach will make this request to the Ceann Comhairle on Monday.”The Dáil had been due to complete a six-week recess, returning on September 15th. Schools are due to re-open from the end of next week, meaning the Dáil is likely to return at least a week early.The Taoiseach had on Friday rebuffed opposition demands to recall the Dáil, saying the Government’s priority was to ensure a safe reopening of schools at the start of September.Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald said the golf dinner was “the last straw” and the Government had “descended into new levels of chaos”.Labour leader Alan Kelly said on Friday the Dáil had to be recalled. “I’ve never seen such public anger on an issue so quickly,” he said.Since June 29th indoor gatherings have been restricted to 50 people under the Government’s public health controls.Further restrictions announced this week identified only weddings and artistic and cultural events as being allowed to have groups of up to 50.Moreover, the latest regulations say tables in restaurants should not exceed six people, from no more than three households.“The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste did speak with the Commissioner today and asked him to consider his position,” a Government spokesperson said in a statement on Saturday.“They both believe that the event should never have been held, that the Commissioner’s apology came late and that he still needs to give a full account and explanations of his action.”The move puts Mr Hogan’s future as European Commissioner for Trade in doubt and is also likely to increase pressure on Supreme Court judge Séamus Woulfe, who was also in attendance.Mr Martin and Mr Varadkar have not spoken to European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, who would have the power to remove Mr Hogan from office.

File image: Dara Mac DónaillThe Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Tánaiste Leo Varadkar have asked Phil Hogan to “consider his position” as EU Commissioner after attending this week’s controversial Oireachtas Golf Society dinner which breached Covid-19 regulations.“The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste did speak with the Commissioner today and asked him to consider his position,” a Government spokesperson said in a statement.“They both believe that the event should never have been held, that the Commissioner’s apology came late and that he still needs to give a full account and explanations of his action.”The move puts Mr Hogan’s future as European Commissioner for Trade in doubt and is also likely to increase pressure on Supreme Court judge Séamus Woulfe, who was also in attendance.Mr Martin and Mr Varadkar have not spoken to European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, who would have the power to remove Mr Hogan from office. Mr Hogan’s appointment as Commissioner was ratified by the European Parliament after being nominated by the previous government.Event durationMeanwhile, the Oireachtas Golf Society also came under further pressure on Saturday to disclose the length of time more than 80 people were gathered at the dinner.Under Covid-19 restrictions announced by Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Tánaiste Leo Varadkar two weeks ago, restaurants were required to close at 11pm, with diners allowed only an hour and 45 minutes for their meals.Revised restrictions announced last Tuesday – the night before the now infamous golf dinner – extended the closing time until 11.30pm, with table numbers capped at six people.One of those in attendance at Wednesday night’s dinner at the Station House Hotel in Clifden, Co Galway, said it started shortly after 9pm.There were a choice of three starters, including soup, pate and “some vegetarian or salady thing”, followed by a choice of three main courses, including salmon and lamb, and a choice of three desserts.After the meal there were four separate speeches. Society captain and Independent TD Noel Grealish addressed attendees, who included Supreme Court judge Séamus Woulfe, EU Commissioner Phil Hogan, several senators and councillors.The society’s president and former Fianna Fáil TD and senator Donie Cassidy also made a speech, followed by Fianna Fáil councillor Donagh Killilea, who spoke on behalf of his family, who shared a table at the event.The dinner was organised to pay tribute to his late father, the former Fianna Fáil MEP and TD Mark Killilea, as well as mark the society’s 50th anniversary.The now resigned minister for agriculture Dara Calleary also made a speech commemorating the late Mr Killilea.There was also a prize-giving, and according to one person present, families of winners took time to take photos.It is understood former Fine Gael minister Mr Hogan won one of the prizes, a George Foreman grill.One attendee couldn’t recall what time people left the function room, saying some stayed on to talk afterwards before everyone “scattered”.“It’s impossible to say, I wasn’t conscious of time,” said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity.‘Multiple breaches’ Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald told The  she was concerned “to hear reports of multiple breaches of public health guidelines” at the event.“We know the number of attendees exceeded the limit, but it has now been alleged that the event also lasted far longer than the time limit permitted,” she said.“The public needs to know if multiple breaches of the guidelines occurred.“I would ask those present at the dinner to clarify whether the length of time was compliant with the regulations and to be clear about how many regulation breaches took place. The attendees must be up-front about what happened and how the rules were breached. ”Ms McDonald said the Irish public was “understandably concerned about what happened and this drip feed of information and allegations risks undermining confidence in the public health guidelines at this critical time in the fight against Covid-19”.Some attendees stayed at rooms in the hotel where the dinner took place and others stayed in at least two other hotels in the town. Some remained on at the hotel lounge in the lobby afterwards.“We were assured everything was in order,” one said.“It was a cock up anyway, with the benefit of hindsight. The dinner shouldn’t have taken place.”As well as the more than 80 attendees, there was “a pile” of staff, with one or two waiters assigned to each table, according to one of the diners.Restrictions state staff should be included when calculating maximum numbers, meaning the gathering was several multiples of the latest allowed number of six for indoor gatherings, and comfortably more than the previous cap of 50.Mr Cassidy has said he will fully cooperate with a Garda investigation into the affair.Under Covid-19 regulations it is a criminal offence to organise an event with a larger number of people than is permitted by the regulations.All-expenses trip The scandal is not the first time the Oireachtas Golf Society has courted controversy.In the summer of 2010, the society went on an all-expenses paid trip to Turkey for official celebrations of the 90th anniversary of the Turkish parliament, which had organised a golf tournament for parliamentarians from around the globe.Among those travelling were Mr Cassidy, Mr Grealish and then Carlow Kilkenny TD Mr Hogan.Then leader of the Seanad Mr Cassidy was forced to deny claims on his return that he had refused to reopen the Upper House alongside the Dáil the same week because he and his golfing colleagues were staying at the five star Sueno Hotels Golf Belek resort in the popular coastal resort Antalya.“I gave up my whole bloody weekend in the name of Ireland,” he said of his trip to Turkey at the time."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Health condition \u0026lsquovery worrying\u0026rsquo after drinking tea that allies believe was laced with poisonDecision to transfer Kremlin critic ill with suspected poisoning after day of lobbyingProtests over last two months most serious threat yet to prime minister\u0026rsquos administrationLack of foreign visitors has facilitated increase in poaching and loss of revenueReport by US intelligence agencies sheds light on actions \u0026ndash and inactions \u0026ndash that created global crisisTens of thousands evacuated as record-breaking rains hit country\u0026rsquos southwestCountry entering dangerous new phase of rising infections in small towns and villagesUS president \u0026lsquopatently wrong\u0026rsquo when telling Minnesota crowd New Zealand situation \u0026lsquoterrible\u0026rsquoPolling put back by four weeks as 49 Covid-19 cases recorded in AucklandStudent-led demonstrations gain momentum testing laws protecting royal familyCovid-19 outbreak spreads to more than 30 people and extends beyond capitalJacinda Ardern sounds warning as number of cases in locked-down Auckland rises to 17Hundreds of police had raided Apple Daily in move decried as assault on press freedom\u0026lsquoGoing hard, going early with lockdown is still the best response,\u0026rsquo Jacinda Ardern saysReturn to nationwide restrictions announced by PM Jacinda Ardern in surprise press conferenceReaders queue from 2am to buy pro-democracy tabloid after owner Jimmy Lai\u0026rsquos arrestFair Work Commission\u0026rsquos decision that man made \u0026lsquooffensive\u0026rsquo video overturned on appealMaria Ressa\u0026rsquos news organisation Rappler is a buffer against dictatorship in PhilippinesLai has been a prominent democracy activist and an ardent critic of BeijingAuthorities warn against complacency as other countries battle a resurgenceStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4335701.1598013937!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit uk time wasting makes deal unlikely says barnier","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit negotiator Michel Barnier: “Frankly I am disappointed and I am worried.”  Photograph: Yves HermanPOOLAFP via Getty ImagesThe EU’s Brexit negotiator has warned that valuable time is being wasted in trade talks with the UK as he accused his British counterparts of failing to make progress on topics of key interest to Europe during the latest round of trade negotiations. Michel Barnier said he was disappointed, concerned and surprised by the lack of progress displayed in discussions that took place in Brussels this week, reiterating that at this stage an agreement between the two sides still looked unlikely and that there was a risk the two sides would fail to ratify a deal by the end of the year. “Too often this week it felt as if we were going backwards more than forwards,” Mr Barnier said at a press conference following the conclusion of the latest negotiations. “I simply do not understand why we are wasting valuable time.” The failure to advance the discussions that began on Tuesday evening leaves only a narrow window in which to agree the text of a trade agreement, translate it into multiple European languages and obtain ratification before the post-Brexit transition period ends on December 31st. While both the UK and EU insist they want a deal, EU officials decried a lack of momentum on the British side in the wake of Thursday’s session, with one describing it as “puzzling”. David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, acknowledged in a separate statement that there had been “little progress” during the week’s talks, but he also insisted that a deal remained possible even if it would not be easy to achieve.State aid and fisheriesThe EU wants the two sides to push towards a common understanding on the topics of state aid and fisheries, rather than leaving these highly sensitive topics until later in the talks, but British negotiators are seeking to advance to a legal text in other areas where the two sides are closer together.Lord Frost criticised the EU’s approach on Friday. “The EU is still insisting not only that we must accept continuity with EU state aid and fisheries policy, but also that this must be agreed before any further substantive work can be done in any other area of the negotiation, including on legal texts,” he said. “This makes it unnecessarily difficult to make progress.”Mr Barnier complained that he was not seeing any willingness on the UK side to take on board the EU’s priorities, adding that the need for a “level playing field” that ensures fair competition in areas including state aid would not go away and was a non-negotiable precondition to any trade deal.“No international agreement was ever reached without the parties agreeing to common rules,” he said. The notion of a zero-tariff, zero-quota agreement without level playing field provisions and a balanced deal on fisheries was a “non-starter” for the EU, and the absence of progress in these areas was blocking everything, he warned.British negotiating officials said the talks were stalling due to the problematic issues of fishing and state aid, over which they accused the EU of seeking to maintain the status quo.“What is frustrating is that Barnier wants to see us continuing arrangements very like those we had as members of the EU. The principle of ‘Brexit means Brexit’ is a good one and should be applied across the board,” the official said.“The process block now is that we must accept their position on state aid and fisheries before we can talk about anything else. We’re obviously not going to do that, so we’re frozen.”Key concernsMr Barnier confirmed that the UK had presented a draft legal text for the trade deal during the round of talks, but he added that this had not addressed the EU’s key concerns, serving instead as a reminder of the UK’s existing positions.Lord Frost added that the UK was seeking a relationship that ensures Britain regains “sovereign control of our own laws, borders, and waters” and is similar to other agreements struck by the EU elsewhere. “When the EU accepts this reality in all areas of the negotiation, it will be much easier to make progress.” A dinner between Mr Barnier and Lord Frost was held on Thursday evening after negotiations concluded, which officials suggested was tense following the lack of progress. “It was a very nice dinner, we had courteous and friendly discussions but we didn’t hide the difficulties between us,” one inidual said. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

EPARonald WittekCoronavirus cases have been reported by at least 41 schools in Berlin, barely two weeks after the German capital’s 825 schools reopened.Cases are rising across Europe, including in Spain, which registered 66,905 in the past two weeks, resulting in the continent’s highest 14-day infection rate and warnings over the risk of a new wave of deaths.The Berlin experience echoes that in some states in the US, including Georgia, and in Israel, which have recorded clusters tied to schools. According to reports in Berlin, all age groups have been affected, including in elementary schools, high schools and trade schools.Berlin was one of the first places in Germany to reopen its schools after the summer holidays. Children are obliged to wear face coverings in the hallways, during breaks and when they enter the classroom, but they can take them off once they sit in their places and classes begin.Some critics say the measures in Berlin are too relaxed and both students and teachers should be wearing face coverings during lessons.The situation in Spain has drawn a grim warning from the country’s health emergency chief, Fernando Simón, who told reporters: “There should be no confusion: things are not going well. If we continue to allow transmission to rise, even if most cases are mild, we will end up with many in hospital, many in intensive care and many deaths.”More than a quarter of these new infections have been in Madrid, which was at the centre of the country’s crisis in March and April.“We can’t say that the epidemic is out of control at a national level, but there are some specific places where it is,” Mr Simón added, without giving further details.Deaths have also increased across Spain, with 131 dead in the last seven days compared with 12 one month ago. About 1,400 Covid-19 patients were admitted to hospital in the last week, nearly double the figure a week earlier.The rise in cases has prompted officials across Spain to roll out a series of measures, including asking regions to order the closure of brothels, a week after the government shut most nightlife establishments and imposed various other restrictions.France, meanwhile, has recorded another large jump in new coronavirus cases, by far the highest increase since the end of the lockdown in May, leading authorities to order schoolchildren above the age of 11 to wear face coverings when they return to school in just over a week in an attempt to halt the spread of the virus.The new policy marks a toughening of measures as coronavirus infections pick up pace in France, with 4,700 new cases reported on Thursday, a post-lockdown record.“Use of masks will be systematic inside from middle school and not only where there is no social distancing. But outdoors, it’s a local decision,” the education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, said in a TV interview late on Thursday.The French health ministry reported 23 additional deaths and 4,586 new infections over the past 24 hours on Friday. There are currently 266 clusters under investigation, and 31 French departments are deemed to be in a situation of “moderate or significant risk”.Health experts say the increase in the number of new cases cannot be explained by the widespread testing being carried out as the rise in new cases is significantly higher than the rise in the number of tests.

Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"covid 19 can survive frozen meat fish three weeks study finds","story":"Covid-19 can survive on frozen meat and fish for up to three weeks, a study has found, as scientists warn that contaminated food may cause outbreaks.Inidual pieces of salmon, chicken and pork from supermarkets in Singapore were sliced into cubes then a sample of the virus was added to them.The meat and fish was stored in conditions which simulate those used to transport food between countries - 4C (standard refrigeration temperature) and minus 20C (standard freezing temperature). Scientists found that infectious Covid-19 was still present on the samples after 21 days.Importation of contaminated food and food packaging is a feasible source for such outbreaks and a source of clusters within existing outbreaks.While it can be confidently argued that transmission via contaminated food is not a major infection route, the potential for movement of contaminated items to a region with no Covid-19 and initiate an outbreak is an important hypothesis.An infected food handler has the potential to become an index case of a new outbreak. The international food market is massive and even a very unlikely event could be expected to occur from time to time.Frequent hand washing and thorough cleaning of equipment at food processing sites is recommended by the researchers to reduce the chance of Covid-19 spreading this way.Prof James Wood, head of the Veterinary Medicine department at the University of Cambridge, told The Sunday : “The authors discuss, very sensibly, how it is important that factory workers must be incentivised not to go to work when symptomatic or in contact with Covid-19 cases.”  The study, which is yet to be peer reviewed, was published on the bioRxiv website here.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"new zealands lust lockdown latest example vapid political virtue","story":"Progressive mythology always demands a socialist valhalla a nation to be idealised and held as up an inspiration. For years, Scandinavia, and particularly Sweden, played this role. The stereotype was never entirely accurate Scandinavian social democracy is a far cry from full-throated socialism, yet it remained influential.In the face of the pandemic, however, the tables have turned now it is the libertarian Right who are lining up to applaud Swedish exceptionalism, while progressives liken their controversial strategy to a form of eugenics. With Sweden consigned to the naughty step, the Left needs a new country to fetishise, and they have alighted on New Zealand.This was underway long before the virus arrived, thanks to NZ’s intoxicating combination of centre-left politics and a charismatic, young and importantly, female, leader: Jacinda Ardern. Her decisive leadership following the mass shooting in Christchurch propelled the New Zealand PM to global prominence, and she has since enjoyed fawning media coverage surpassing even the high water-mark of Trudeau-mania.The Left applauded NZ’s “wellbeing budget”, emphasising citizens’ happiness over GDP growth, and cheered when Ardern brought her baby into the UN assembly hall. Their zero-tolerance approach to Covid-19 has been especially influential. A group of weak-minded MPs and peers are currently urging our own Government to pursue a similar aim of total eradication.We should be under no illusion - this is no model for New Zealand to follow, let alone a sophisticated global economy like ours. NZ may have contained the virus, for now at least, registering the lowest mortality rates in the OECD, but it has taken genuinely draconian policies and great economic pain to get there. The Ardern administration is eliminating rights on a scale more reminiscent of authoritarian China than a Western liberal democracy.Last week, the whole of Auckland was sent into lockdown after the government announced a grand total of four new cases in the capital. GDP has taken its biggest slide in three decades. A total ban on foreign arrivals has endured for months, with catastrophic results for tourism, directly employing 8.4 per cent of the workforce. New Zealanders returning from abroad must pay for the privilege of isolating in military-guarded facilities, to the tune of more than £1,500 per head. One man recently received a six-week jail sentence for hugging a friend quarantining in a detention centre.The NZ experience should serve as a cautionary tale about the normalisation of overreach. Though the country has not recorded a single covid death since May, the government decided to postpone the Autumn elections following the small-scale outbreak this month. Progressives, so alert to the subversion of democracy in the USA, had little to say about this extraordinary over-reaction.An elimination strategy has made them hostages to fortune with precedence established, it will be politically toxic to change course. Ardern has ridden high in the polls so far, but if such disruption continues, public appetite for keeping the country virus-free at any cost will surely wane, and the recent outbreak, despite NZ’s geographic isolation and its draconian policy response, suggests no country can postpone the inevitable.The implications of New Zealand’s autarchy go beyond its shores as well. Tourism accounts for a third of jobs in Fiji, Palau and Vanuatu and two thirds of their visitors come from Australia and New Zealand. Yet amid mounting poverty and unemployment, island leaders’ pleadings for air bridges seem barely to have registered with an administration myopically focused on elimination. In seeking to be kind, the Ardern administration has ended up being very cruel indeed.Enthusiasts for this model imply that elimination, like the happiness budget, and like Ardern herself, puts people above the callous vicissitudes of the balance sheet. As we are increasingly finding, the two cannot be so easily disentangled. Excessively harsh lockdowns have become a form of international virtue-signalling something only wealthy nations can afford, but which promises catastrophe for the world’s poorest.Before the recent spike, commentators lauded Ardern as being “on course to eradicate the virus completely.” The ambition was childish and hubristic in the extreme. Until the planet reaches a state of elimination, New Zealand will have to stay in indefinite isolation, with domestic lock-downs a likely fixture of life, perhaps for years to come.

Conservatorship is when a  or protector is appointed by a court to manage the life of someone due to physical or mental limitations. Spears’ conservatorship was put in place in 2008 after she suffered a public breakdown in 2007.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOn Monday (17 August), Spears’ lawyers had stated that the singer is “strongly opposed” to having her father as her conservator.The conservatorship has been the subject of widespread online protests this year.The #FreeBritney movement was launched by fans who believe Spears is “trapped”, and one petition, with more than 100,000 signatures lobbying for Spears’ freedom, claims: “Her father doesn’t allow her to drive, all of her calls \u0026amp messages are monitored, she’s not allowed to vote, hang with anyone or spend her money without permission. And if she breaks a ‘rule’ he threatens to have her kids taken away.”Earlier this month, Jamie called the #FreeBritney campaign “a joke” and said he is tired of rumours that she is being exploited.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The Home Office says it provides successful applicants with only a digital copy of their status to ensure they can “constantly access proof of their status” and that it is in keeping with the “shift towards digital status in all areas of life”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHowever, charities warn that this will exclude people who are not digitally literate and that some agencies – such as landlords, employers and border officials – may continue to demand physical proof of status, which would leave millions of people cut off from their fundamental rights such as access to employment, healthcare and housing.A review into the scheme by the Government Digital Service in 2018 found the digital-only system would cause low digital users “a lot of issues”, with some unlikely to be able to use the online service “at all”. It said the Home Office’s drive to convert more services to digital and remove their physical counterparts needed “careful consideration”, warning that “digital by default doesn’t mean 100 per cent digital”.Nicoletta Peddis, 34, an Italian national who has lived in the UK for 12 years, faced a week-long delay in the process of renting a new property in York with her partner last year because the letting agent insisted that they show physical proof of their UK residency. The agent said it had “no idea” what EU settled status was when she explained that it was digital-only.“In the end, she managed to check it online, but I’m worried this might cause more problems down the line. It’s a signal of how complicated things could get next year.”She added: “The letting market in York is crazy. I thought, if someone else had applied who didn’t have this problem, they might just go with them rather than us, just because it’s easier and you don’t have to go through all these checks.“It would be so much easier if they provided a document.

I said I was an EU citizen and she said ‘but Brexit’. I said I had EU settled status and tried to explain that there was a way to check it online.“She was getting more and more confused. It was stressful, I thought I was going to miss my flight. And then eventually, she let me through.”Without physical proof of our status, EU citizens like me live in fearThe 24-year-old said she would prefer to have a physical document, particularly when travelling: “I think people in a lot of countries are aware of Brexit but they don’t know when it’s happening, what it means and how it works. It would be so much easier if there was some kind of card or stamp in my passport that I could show to avoid these kinds of conversations.“The whole idea of records only being kept online doesn’t sit well with me, especially after the Windrush scandal.”Another Lithuanian national, who has been in the UK for 13 years, and asked not to be named, was prevented from visiting her mother in Russia because the Russian embassy refused to access the link to her EU settled status online.The 40-year-old woman, who works as a private tour guide, said: “I took a screen grab and they didn’t accept it. They said other EU nationals had shown them their physical residency permit. I told them I didn’t have any paper documents. I tried to explain how it works but they said no, we can’t click on anything. They said they needed a paper proof of residency.“It’s very disappointing because the last time I saw my mother was last September. She’s 70 and she lives on her own. I’m very angry and frustrated. I don’t deserve this, I haven’t done anything wrong, I have every right to be here, but now all of a sudden I feel like I have no rights.“There should be physical proof – ID cards or something. It can’t go on like this, how many more problems will I and others face in the future?”Maike Bohn, co-founder of the3million campaign group, warned that these cases were “only the tip of the iceberg”.“From next year, millions of EU citizens who are doing key work in their communities, in fields, warehouses and offices, will be treated differently from the rest of UK residents. They will have no tangible proof of their hard-earned right to live and work in the UK,” she said.EU nationals who cannot prove ‘settled status’ denied basic rightsGovernment denies Verhofstadt claim over EU citizens’ right to remainEU nationals who cannot prove ‘settled status’ denied basic rights“EU citizens will face a crisis that is entirely preventable: being unable to open a bank account if the website is down, or lose out on a job because there was no phone signal and the next person in line had a physical card to prove their right to work there and then.“While the world inevitably becomes more digital, we need to make sure that those who struggle or face problems do not fall through the cracks in the meantime. The government should give EU citizens physical proof of their right to live and work in the UK.”Ollie Persey, a barrister at the Public Law Project, said the charity was concerned about the impact of digital-only status for disadvantaged groups, including elderly people who are not digitally literate and people who cannot access their digital status because of their disability.Describing a recent case in which the charity was asked to assist a client whose visual impairment meant that he couldn’t read screens, Mr Persey added: “Without physical documentation, people in this situation will face real difficulties in proving their immigration status next year.”  Sonia Lenegan, legal director at the Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association, said: “From the outset of the EU settlement scheme, countless organisations and iniduals have raised concerns about a ‘digital only’ status. “Iniduals are already experiencing problems within the UK as a result of this. It is unclear what steps have been taken to ensure that border officials in other countries understand what the digital status is, but this is another example of the problems caused by the lack of a physical document.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “EU citizens are our friends and neighbours and we want them to stay – which is why we are delighted that there have been more than 3.5 million grants of status under the scheme.“In the long term, physical documents expire, become invalid, or can be lost, stolen or tampered with. A digital status ensures that EU citizens who are granted status in the UK can constantly access proof of their status, which is just as valid as a physical one.“All areas of life are seeing a shift towards digital status, from banking to transport – it is only logical that borders and immigration embrace technology and continue with this shift.“EU citizens can, however, continue to use their passport or national identity card to evidence their status in the UK until 30 June 2021.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSir Mark warned: “This is a virus that is going to be with us forever in some form or another and almost certainly will require repeated vaccinations.“So a bit like flu, people will need revaccination at regular intervals,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. Oldham and Blackburn under new lockdown restrictions – liveCoronavirus puts travel agency STA Travel UK out of businessWHO chief says he hopes pandemic can be ended in less than two yearsCoronavirus tests should be compulsory for students, say scientistsProfessor Ara Darzi, a former Labour health minister and co-director of Imperial College London’s Institute of Global Health Innovation, said regular home testing could be the UK’s “best hope” against the pandemic.But he suggested the number of tests carried out in the UK may need to be increased to “one million or even 10 million a day”.Mass testing could give the public confidence the disease is under control, he suggested. “And unlike a vaccine, which is still many months away, simple, easy and cheap tests, some based on saliva, with results in as little as 10 minutes, are already out there,” he wrote in The Daily Prof Darzi is currently overseeing a study of home testing, involving more than 100,000 people. It has found nine in 10 home tests are carried out correctly.But the testing process would have to be simplified so people could self-test daily, he added.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGood Law Project’s letter claims the contract was unlawfully granted without any tender process and there was bias in play due to the company owners’ links to Michael Gove and Dominic Cummings. Ofqual’s controversial algorithm to be reviewed, regulatory body saysHow foreseeable was the A-level and GCSE fiasco, really?Government lifts cap on medical student places after A-level chaos A new grading system for qualifications had to be set up this year after exams were cancelled due to coronavirus. The government announced days after A-level results day that A-level and GCSE students could take teacher-assessed grades, following outcry over tens of thousands of A-level results being moderated down.An Ofqual spokesperson told  usual tendering rules did not apply to their contract with Public First  “due to the exceptional circumstances presented by the cancellation of exams” and “due to the need to urgently procure the work”. Good Law Project have said in their letter they believe there was enough time for a procurement process to go ahead after exams were cancelled in March.Exams fiasco ‘will be nothing compared to brewing scandal’ next yearRachel Wolf and James Frayne, the married couple who run Public First, “appear to have close personal and professional connections” with both Mr Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, and Mr Cummings, the UK prime minister’s chief adviser, their letter to Ofqual claims.

If they are not satisfied with Ofqual’s actions, they said they would issue judicial review proceedings in the High Court.Jolyon Maugham, the Good Law Project’s director, said: “We are now aware of three awards of contracts to Public First.“A river of public money is flowing into a business owned by close associates of the prime minister’s chief political adviser and his Cabinet Office minister – and all without any open, transparent tender process.”A Cabinet Office spokesperson told  Mr Gove had no involvement in the decision to grant the contract to Public First. Ofqual, Downing Street and the Cabinet Office have been approached by The Independent. Public First turned down a request for comment. An Ofqual spokesperson said: “Ofqual will respond to any correspondence in due course, once it has been received.”A government spokesperson said: “This is categorically untrue. No10 and the Cabinet Office had no involvement in the contract and did not discuss it with Ofqual.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.It was a moment that had been a long, long time coming, and when it did Kamala Harris grasped it with both hands.On a night freighted with history, the senator from California officially accepted the Democratic Party’s nomination to be vice president, the first woman of colour thus selected by a major party, and only the sixth woman in total in the US ever added to a ticket.In a speech that spread over more 15 minutes, and perhaps representing the de facto keynote address on the third night of the convention despite top billing going to Barack Obama, her words were at once warm and hopeful, yet firm. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe paid respect to the political pioneers that had gone before her, breaking the ground that would help allow a black American woman of South Asian heritage, build a career such as hers. And she paid tribute to her family, particularly her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, who came to the US at the age of 18, and raised Kamala and her sister after their parents orced. She died in 2009. Ms Harris said that when her mother gave birth to her, aged just 25, at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, California, she may have struggled to see just what lay in store for her daughter.DNC 2020“On that day, she probably could have never imagined that I would be standing before you now speaking these words: I accept your nomination for vice president of the United States of America,” she said. Ever since Joe Biden indicated in March of this year that were he to secure the nomination he would choose a woman as his running mate, there had been widespread anticipation he would select a woman of colour. Such a strategy appeared all the more vital and fair, following the killing by police in Minneapolis of an unarmed black man, triggering protests for racial justice that swept not just across the US, but around the world.In selecting the 55-year-old former prosecutor, Mr Biden said his main priority had been to find someone who could step into the job on day one, not merely a sound bite for a 77-year-old man, who will be the nation’s oldest president by far should he defeat Donald Trump in November.In her comments, Ms Harris noted that this week marked the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th amendment, which gave some women – white women – the right to vote.“So many of the black women who helped secure that victory were still prohibited from voting, long after its ratification. But they were undeterred,” she said. “Without fanfare or recognition, they organised, testified, rallied, marched, and fought—not just for their vote, but for a seat at the table.” No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And these women inspired us to pick up the torch, and fight on.”She named several female civil rights and political leaders — “Mary Church Terrell and Mary Mcleod Bethune. Fannie Lou Hamer and Diane Nash. Constance Baker Motley and Shirley Chisholm”. Ms Chisholm was both the first black congresswoman and the first black woman to make a run for the White House, back in 1972.“We’re not often taught their stories,” she added. “But as Americans, we all stand on their shoulders.”Trump’s strategy for dealing with the DNC is about to backfireMichelle Obama to hail Biden’s ‘grit and passion’ Why I can’t shake my disgust about being forced to vote for BidenMichelle Obama’s keynote speech at DNC expected to be major hitHer comments followed by an equally impassioned and hard-edged address by Mr Obama, who probably for the first time in four years in public, criticised Mr Trump by name. He said he feared for the state of the nation’s democracy should he secure a second term.“I did hope, for the sake of our country, that Donald Trump might show some interest in taking the job seriously that he might come to feel the weight of the office and discover some reverence for the democracy that had been placed in his care,” said Mr Obama. “But he never did.“If Mr Obama’s speech was heavy, and sombre, Ms Harris was able to inject a fair degree of energy into her words. Joe Biden will be relying on this verve to drive his campaign in the final three months, across a country beset by anxiety, economic hardship and the challenge of combatting the coronavirus pandemic. “Years from now, this moment will have passed,” said Ms Harris.  “And our children and our grandchildren will look in our eyes and they’re gonna ask us: Where were you when the stakes were so high? And we will tell them, not just how we felt – we will tell them what we did.” Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I can excuse the caution of Boris Johnson and Gavin Williamson deciding it was better to be safe than sorry in the early days of an unknown pandemic.But as the weeks turned into months and Generation Corona effectively lost a school year, I will never forgive the militant teaching unions for keeping them shut regardless of the social cost.It was a partisan play designed to damage a Tory government at a time when politics should not have mattered one iota.Unfortunately, the A-levels mess this week was depressingly inevitable from the moment the school gates slammed shut.A knee-jerk decision to cancel all exams without waiting to seethere was a way they could be sat in a socially distanced manner meant the current crisis was unavoidable.This situation CANNOT ever be repeated — but I’m fearful it’s already happening.Coronavirus is now being used as an excuse not to provide anything slightly dficult or complicated in all areas of our lives.But when it comes to education, the costs of that lazy caution are too great.I don’t know about you, but much of the development I experienced at school was down to my social interactions and extracurricular activities, rather than solely what was taught on the blackboard.Yet many schools are intending to use Covid- to justy axing breakfast and after-school clubs, banning music lessons and school productions, and stopping sports.It breaks my heart to see these opportunities indefinitely wrested from our youngsters with no scientic evidence to back up why.But it is being caused by a desire from adults to avoid ato normality.A King’s College London study this week revealed a majority of the public are supportive of our nightmarish “new normal”, with  per cent believing employees should be able to keep working at home until a vaccine is discovered and administered.This is cloud cuckoo land thinking. While the progress in Russia and at Oxford University looks positive, there is no guarantee we are going to have a vaccine at all.  So here’s an unpleasant newsflash: Covid is going to be part of our lives for many years. After all, smallpox is the only infectious disease to ever have been eradicated.Selfish adults can ruin their own lives by giving in to irrational hysteria, but they shouldn’t be allowed to destroy the fair education of our kids.The fightback against militant education unions, box-ticking bureaucrats and cruel social distancing regulations for students must begin today.MUCH media attention this past week has been focused on Labour MP Dawn Butler’s dubious claim that London cops are institutionally racist because they pulled over her and a black mate, even though they were driving in a vehicle with tinted windows, meaning the officers had NO IDEA of their colour.What’s far more disturbing is the release of new figures showing violent assaults on Met officers have increased by  per cent in the past three months, coinciding with a period of social unrest sparked by coronavirus and Black Lives Matter protests.Our police are under attack from all angles.They are filmed by baying members of the public desperate to show discrimination but unable to release their own body cam footage.They are accused of racism simply for arresting criminals.Andwe’re not careful, they will give up trying to stop many crimes because the potential repercussions aren’t worth it.DISTURBING news for celebrity lovers: The stars you probably think are nice are usually utter horrors in real le and those with bad reputations publicly are often delightful off camera.That’s my experience after two decades reporting on the entertainment industry both here and in Hollywood.So I’m fascinated to see a celebrity not being nice is now an offence that can see them be “cancelled”, becausethat goes on, there won’t be many left on the telly.This week, in one of the biggest celebrity reporting injustices I’ve ever seen, Nadia Sawalha was hit by claims she is nasty behind the scenes.Believe me, I saw it all over ten years working at ITV Daytime, but can vouch that the Loose Women star is one of the kindest and most genuine people I have ever met in the toxic world of showbiz.To suggest she is some sort of fake is beyond the pale.Nadia is adored by everyone backstage, her best friend is one of the broadcaster’s make-up artists, and she cares deeply about the folk she works with.While some TV stars don’t know the names of crew members they’ve worked with for years, Nadia befriends most of them.The vulnerable, self-deprecating, caring and honest-to-a-fault list you see on Loose is the real woman I know and adore.FIRST the US broadcaster HBO axed Gone With The Wind, before introducing a so-called “trigger warning” to the start of the classic film.Now it has sparked further outrage by doing the same thing to the Mel Brooks classic Blazing Saddles.If this woke attack on our culture continues, soon virtually every old film favourite will come with a sombre introduction by a liberal university professor outlining the social ills you’re about to witness.That got me thinking about what will end up being said before my three favourite films of all time :Grease: Contains ious examples of toxic masculinity, with Kenickie inappropriately invoking rape culture when he asks DannySandy “put up a fight”.The Wizard Of Oz: The scarecrow uses make-up to change the colour of his skin in an early example of blackface.The Sound Of Music: Glamorises a handsome young Nazi soldier called Rolf and features emotional abuse by the captain of his children, including the use of a whistle for discipline.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In the Iowa caucuses, the first electoral contest of the campaign to become his party’s candidate, the -year old finished in a humiliating fth place. “I’m not going to sugarcoat it. We took a gut punch,” Biden declared after the disastrous result. One commentator on the news outlet CNBC was even more scathing: “His presidential hopes are finished.”Yet today, Biden stands on the threshold of the Oval Office. Victory is in his grasp. Having clawed his way back into the primaries and won the Democratic nomination to challenge Donald Trump, he could soon be the most powerful man on Earth. It is certainly his fight to lose. Some nationwide opinion polls put him no less than  points ahead of Trump, whose popularity has taken a battering because of the coronavirus crisis and the consequent economic recession. This week’s Democratic convention, including his own powerful, well-crafted speech last night, will have done nothing to undermine his lead.But with some worrying signs of mental decline, Bidens coronation could mean the reigns of power are actually handed to the hardline leftists around him - rather than to the ageing politician himself.What makes Biden’s comeback all the more remarkable is that his two previous attempts to reach the White House failed so miserably. In  his campaign fell apart after he was exposed plagiarising one of the speeches made by Neil Kinnock during the British General Election the previous year. Some of the passages were lted almost word for word. “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to go to university ” asked the Labour Leader.“Why is Joe Biden the first in his family ever to go to university ” asked the Democratic Senator. It does not say much for either Biden’s creativity or his judgement that he had to seek secret inspiration from a socialist mediocrity widely known at Westminster as the Welsh Windbag.In  Biden did even worse, dropping out after a woeful performance in the Iowa Caucuses, where he gained just one per cent of the total vote. During the campaign, he regularly put his foot in his mouth, most notoriously when he described his rival Barack Obama as “the first African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy”.This year, after Iowa, his chances seemed to be heading in the same sorry direction.But then, in the following months, he gradually emerged as the front-runner. This was mainly because the other leading candidates were seen as either too extreme or too unlikeable. Senator Elizabeth Warren was a hard advocate of toxic identity politics who unconvincingly claimed to have Native American blood. Bernie Sanders was North America’s answer to Jeremy Corbyn, complete with revolutionary economics and brutish tax plans. Peter Buttigieg was a sanctimonious mayor of a small city in Indiana, without any experience of the national stage.In contrast, Biden had not only been a Delaware senator for  years, but had also served as Vice-President throughout Obama’s time in the White House. Through these roles, he had built up a reputation as a moderate, helped by his image as an ordinary, down-to-earth guy rather than a member of the Washington elite.The son of a used car salesman, he was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the place where the US version of Ricky Gervais’s comedy The Office was set. His popular appeal was further enhanced by his personal story of having to cope with agonising grief, which he spelt out in raw, emotive terms last night.The catalogue of anguish includes the loss of his first we and daughter, killed in a car accident in  and the death of his son Beau from brain cancer in . Yet none of this can hide a disturbing reality about Biden, one that makes him profoundly unsuited to be the leader of the free world or the commander-in-chief of the US military.It is something that the Democrats have desperately tried to downplay, along with much of the media. But, the fact is that Joe Biden is in steep mental decline. Already by far the oldest Presidential candidate in history, he shows all the signs of advancing senility. He might be able to read effective from an autocue, as he showed last night, but in other settings, away from the podium, he regularly stumbles over his words, confuses facts, loses his train of thought, and lapses into coherence. His supporters say that he has always been “gaffe-prone” and that is true, but the problem goes much deeper. In the past, Biden could be sharp, even witty, as he showed in his triumphant  Vice-Presidential debate against the Republican Paul Ryan.Today, when speaking off the cuff, he struggles to string basic sentences together.Without the help of a teleprompter, this is a man who mixes up his we and sister, gets the names of countries wrong, and keeps repeating the same phrases. In one bizarre outburst in Iowa, he called a female reporter “a lying, dog-faced pony soldier”. In another contribution, he declared that he will “choose truth over facts”. With a delusional grasp of arithmetic, he has said that million women will be put back to work by his tax credit plan, that million Americans have been killed by guns since , and that million have died from Covid-. That is why, throughout the campaign, his minders have tried to keep him in his Delaware home, almost like a hostage. Major interviews have been banned, public appearances strictly rationed. It is a strategy that his team cynically justy by claiming that they want to protect the -year-old candidate from Covid-. But the determination to shield the potential next President from any accountability makes a mockery of democracy.It might seem bizarre that the Democratic party should march under the tattered standard of such a weakened general. But from the viewpoint of political operators on the left, his decline actually makes him an ideal candidate.His senility might have to be concealed from the public, but it can be ruthlessly exploited in private. Broken and bewildered, Biden is a puppet whose strings can easily be pulled by his hidden masters. Behind the thin veneer of his supposed moderation, the radicals can seize power and enact their hardline policies, like defunding the police, imposing financial reparations for slavery, rewriting American history, confiscating wealth, promoting transgender ideology, extending public ownership, and widening the scope of affirmative action. Precisely because he is now an empty vessel, a Biden Presidency would mean the ruthless enforcement of woke dogma. In fact, its unlikely that he will last a full four-year term. Therefore his Vice President Kamala Harris, an ambitious operator can start preparing for her reign.But perhaps she should not be too hasty. The Democrats’ opportunism could backfire badlyvoters become alienated by the idea of an enfeebled President.After all, the American political structure – in contrast to our Parliamentary system – is built on the concept of a strong executive headed by a powerful, elected head of state. Already Trump, never one to pull his punches, is running adverts that highlight concerns about the “cognitive decline” of “Sleepy Joe”. The commercials seem to be having an impact. Almost  per cent of Americans do not think that Biden will serve a full term, while other polls show the race narrowing. Trump could also be boosted by revulsion at the radical Democrats’ agenda, especially the collusion with urban violence.In  widespread unrest fuelled by the civil rights movement enabled the Republican Richard Nixon to defeat the Democrats under Hubert Humphrey. Famously, Nixon said that the “silent majority”, ignored by the media, had spoken. Today the same public mood could give Trump a second term.It would be no more than the Democrats deserve for their eagerness to hide the real Joe Biden.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Politicians have repeatedly let us down, their lack of clarity is baffling and there still appears to be no coherent plan.I’ve watched as people cared for the sick and mourned their dead, and at times, like many of you, I’ve been overwhelmed by dread.Then I look at my friend and colleague Kate Garraway, who has had to bear the burden of her husband Derek being ambushed by Covid- in April.Kate has been extraordinary, which is why I am furious with those who have criticised her for ing to work, when they have absolutely no idea of what she has been going through. She has decided to step back from GMB for a while to concentrate on Derek and their children and those who have criticised her should be ashamed of themselves for making things even more dficult for the whole family. Derek may now be free of the virus but the after-effects have been catastrophic.The poor man has been in an induced coma, and although now more aware of his surroundings, he is still extremely ill.Kate’s mantra “where there is le, there’s hope”, has kept her going, and I reckon on some level Derek is aware of how much she and their children, Darcy, , and -year-old Billy are willing him to make a recovery.Kate has been astonishingly brave and positive throughout this whole ordeal, although she was tearful this week when talking about Derek’s recent birthday. His family sang Happy Birthday to him via Facebook, which must have been bittersweet for all of them.She has had to maintain a brave face for her children and give them some sort of stability for the past five months.To try to further give their lives a bit more normality, Kate went back to work last month.In fact, she was actively encouraged to do so by doctors who felt it was essential for her wellbeing, and frankly, she has to make a living because she has two children to take care of.I know coming back to presenting duties on Good Morning Britain wasn’t easy for Kate, and there have been a few wobbles when she has given updates on how Derek is doing, but all of us are so proud of the way she has coped.That’s why the nasty, malicious carping from moronic trolls is so upsetting. How dare they have a go at Kate for hosting the show and having the “audacity” to smile and laugh at funny items with her co-hosts. It’s sickening, and no matter how much anyone tries to ignore such malevolent cretins, Kate will have been deeply hurt.I had a horrible feeling this might happen, but thankfully the vast majority of viewers wish her nothing but the best, and would be overjoyed to see Derek on the road to recovery. All of us admire Kate’s courage and honesty and know that even in the darkest of times, it’s vital to hang on to positivity and yes, to even have a giggle at something silly or absurd.Watching their mum back on TV gave much needed routine and stability to Darcy and Billy, especially seeing her smile and having fun. They knew it didn’t mean she is not worried sick about their dad, but were well aware he would want her to continue working and providing for the family.As a journalist, Kate has amassed so much knowledge about Covid- and she has also been tested to her very limits.Typically, she wants to pass on that knowledge to help others and is planning to write a book about her experiences and what she has learned during this tough time. It was always her plan to do a self-help book and she had begun it before the pandemic, but now her wise words will be even more relevant and helpful than ever. I can’t wait for the day when Derek is back home, growing stronger every day and the whole family is finally reunited, and I hope she is back at work with us very soon.Happy Birthday Madonna –  years old, mad as a box of frogs but looking utterly radiant surrounded by her children at a party in Jamaica.She can be infuriating and even downright bonkersbut there’s no one quite like her.She’s a trailblazer, was always a staunch ally for the LGBT community before it was trendy and has always paddled her own canoe.Long may Her Madge continue to reign, especially as right now we need some light relief wherever we can get it. I’M not in the least bit surprised that “dad bods” have become so popular among women of all ages. These are the bodies belonging to men who proudly show off rather cute little pot bellies and love handles.Becoming softer round the edges usually happens to blokes after the birth of a couple of kids, when they start to comfort eat due to lack of sleep and stop being obsessed with going to the gym.These boys trade top-of-the-range bikes and tight Lyrca cycling gear for comfy joggers while pushing a pram, and are all the better for it.Having a dad bod is also seen as a sign of confidence, being happy in your own skin and showing that you enjoy le and that having a weekend pizza and a couple of beers is more than OK.I reckon there’s nothing more off-putting than a man with a ripped six-pack who is no stranger to the mirror and exists on steroids and just steamed vegetables.They are usually dull, self-obsessed and not in the least bit alluring.Dad bods are far less intimidating and much more fun to cuddle. Like a lot of men, famous stars including Leonardo DiCaprio and Zac Efron have developed the Dad Bod during lockdown and have been roundly showing off their new physiques.I think they are far more sexy and desirable than when their cheekbones could cut through a home-made loaf. You have to get the balance right, though. When it tips over into a very large balcony hanging over “the nursery” then that’s no longer a Dad Bod but just a big old beer gut and it shows a man who has simply given up and is on a fast track to obesity and a heart attack. BRITNEY Spears is a grown-up woman with two teenage sons, a hugely successful music career and an adoring fan base. But the -year-old has less freedom than an impoverished girl in a Jane Austen novel.Since her much-publicised meltdown in  – when she went into a beauty salon and shaved her head, looking like a little lost deer caught in the headlights – Britney has had very little control over her le.Her father Jamie has legal “conservatorship” over his daughter, basically deciding where and how she lives her le and conducts her career. He also keeps hold of the purse strings.Last year he stepped away from the role, citing health problems of his own . . . and Britney doesn’t want him back.Thirteen years ago she was clearly suffering with mental health issues and needed her father’s help.But now Britney understandably wants control of her own destiny.This week she decided to fight back and took to the courts to have her human rights and civil liberties restored.But her bid was unsuccessful and she will need to wait until February  before taking further action.She is a fragile woman and obviously needs support. But looking at it from the outside, the kind of control her father exerts over Britney’s le seems way too much.Surely some kind of compromise can be reached, with the situation regularly revised to ensure Britney isn’t left feeling trapped like a songbird in a very gilded cage.I SIMPLY cannot begin to imagine the pain actor John Michie and his family are going through right now.This week, the man who supplied the drugs that killed John’s daughter in  had his manslaughter conviction quashed.Louella Fletcher-Michie had gone to a music festival with her boyfriend, Ceon Broughton, who gave her the hallucinogenic C-P drug and filmed her tripping for hours. Belatedly realising she was in real trouble and crying for her mum, he phoned her family. They rushed to the scene but were too late to save her. Crucially, he did not at any point take her to a medical tent or seek expert help.This week a High Court judge decided that evenhe had called for paramedics, it was not clear Louella would have survived – so Broughton’s appeal against his sentence of eight and a half years was upheld. Broughton has to live with his actions but not from behind bars.Meanwhile, John and his family – who have maintained a dignied silence through the most recent twist of the kne in their tragedy – continue to mourn their lost Louella.For them, it is a le sentence of heartbreak and pain.JUST when you thought reality telly’s Below Deck couldn’t get any better, they go and set a whole series in Tahiti.There are all the usual shenanigans. Entitled and demanding guests, the crew squabbling one minute and at it like rabbits the next and Captain Lee sailing above it all while coming out with hilarious one liners like: “I’m madder than a p***ed-on chicken”, which I plan to use as often as possible in my daily le.Meanwhile, all the action takes place amid the amazing sunrises and stunning sunsets of the South Pacic.It’s no exaggeration to say that this utterly ludicrous, vacuous and extremely daft series has kept me sane during these scary times.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I co-hosted with the brilliant Jayde Adams, we had turns from Kerry Godliman, Shappi Khorsandi, Nathan Caton and Ed Gamble, and video messages from Aisling Bea and Nish Kumar, audiences watching on Zoom — something no one had ever imagined five months ago — on Facebook, and on Twitch, which I had assumed was an app for people in their twenties to chat each other up and worse.It was a brilliant night and the absolute kicker was that we had people in the room with us laughing .They were told not to overdo it for fear of aerosol transmission, but by God it felt good to have a real flesh-and-blood audience in front of me.Because here’s the thing about stand-up comics — they need an audience the way fish need water or Gavin Williamson needs chaos.But what we’ve discovered over the past couple of months, via these streamed gigs and now via gigs like the one I did on Sunday afternoon, in a car park under a gazebo, is that audiences seem to need stand-up too.It’s incredibly flattering, even for an old stager like me. On Sunday I played to  people prepared to ignore what the weather app on their phone might be saying, bring their camping chairs and sit in a car park in Tring, Herts.The comedians all seemed to savour every second of being on stage, of the delicious business of strangers laughing at their jokes together and sharing a mo-ment, a communal moment that means a lot after all these long months of doing what we’ve been asked and staying apart.Psychologically, what that might say about comedians is maybe not the thing we want to dwell on, what sort of wreck would need the laugh-ter of strangers to get them through the day  Move on!But this weekend’s gigs and the ones now springing up all over the country show that we all need the laughs it seems, the audiences too, and that nothing beats seeing it live, right there in front of you. And we can hear the laughs through the masks, don’t worry. There are more and more gigs springing up now, promoters and venues are innovating like mad, councils are doing everything they can to help get things off the ground.Some of these shows are outdoors, weather permitting affairs, some of them are under marquees and the like. Theatres are just getting going with shows with reduced capacity — at some places they’ll take your temperature on the way in, but it’s worth it for the laughs.Listings are popping up all over social media — you’ll find something near you. Don’t miss out. The shows that have been put together so far have been unforgettable and,nothing ,and when theatres do get up and running again, you can say: “Remember the time we saw this comic in a car park ”There’s something pretty exciting about seeing someone you’d have to go to an arena to see playing in a pub garden, too. Andit rains, well, stf upper lip and a good raincoat should get you through that. Hand on heart, the threat to our business is really worrying, like it is to any other right now, becausethe clubs close they will cut off the chance for new comics to get their acts together — literally — and for the new talent to come through. It’s all right for the likes of me, but the people who were set on going to the Edinburgh Fringe this summer — an event that has produced a ton of the funny people you might be familiar with — won’t get the chance for this year to be their year. Everyone has to start somewhere, andthe venues die, the whole thing dies.And that’s why it has been so amazing to see stuff being put on all over, in courtyards, pub gardens, car parks — even the biggest names can be seen doing their thing under an awning or gazebo — the audiences totally up for it and loving every moment. Because stand-up, like le, will find a way. And Jeff Goldblum knows, he used to do a bit of stand-up.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And lots of parents have been alarmed to see their children stuck at home, in-active and putting on weight.Mr Fry says: “Schools have to do something about this. We will have to measure pupils next month and again in spring to seewhat has been creeping up during this enforced period of inactivity has been countered by being back at school.”I could not agree more that schools need to do something about this issue. But bringing back weighing kids in schools is problematic.Plenty of people have spoken up about how traumatic they found it being weighed at school, and the humiliation of being told they were overweight.But much worse is how many people have said that was the trigger for a letime of disordered eating.Jameela Jamil, the star of Netflix sitcom The Good Place, says: “Being weighed at school was truly the minute my eating disorder started at . I can trace it back to that exact day.”Cycling champ Elinor Barker, who won gold at the  Rio Olympics, reckons her own experience as an elite athlete shows “lighter is not always better”.She says: “I was the heaviest I’ve ever been when I won the Olympics. At my lightest I could barely get through a training week.”I have not heard anyone credit school weigh-ins with keeping them fit and healthy, with a balanced and positive relationship to food.Weighing children is problematic for so many reasons. It sends the message that they alone are responsible for their weight, when in fact taking care of their bodies with the right food and exercise is as much down to their parents, their school and the adults around them.But also, it becomes a form of body-shaming, and encourages children to focus only on the digits on the scales rather than the much bigger picture.It can plant the seeds of a letime of dficulty around food and is very often counterproductive.There are so many other ways to help children take responsibility for their own health.Schools need to make sports fun, ied and accessible to all children.In particular, they need to find ways to encourage teenage girls to participate, as this is the age when they often drop out of sports.School meals need to be healthy and delicious.And schools need to take meal times seriously and encourage children to do the same.We also need to inspire children to want to be healthy and fit. What about more talks in schools from sportsmen and women on how to exercise and what to eat  They are such good role models.Parents also have a massive role. We lead by example andwe have an unhealthy relationship with food, it’s likely our children will too.If we teach children about what their body needs to work properly, and how to cook tasty, nutritious meals which deliver that, they will be engaged in a positive way that has nothing to do with shame or guilt.HAPPY nd birthday, Madonna.She and toyboy Ahlamalik Williams, celebrated with an extravagant bash at Jamaica’s GoldenEye resort.And anyone who saw photos and videos of her shenanigans could be forgiven for thinking she is half her age.As she left the island, she posted on Instagram: “Thank you Jamaica. We have picked your flowers, eaten your fruit, danced to your music, enjoyed every sunset.”Whatever you think of her, there is something enviable about her ability to make the most of le.I hope I look as good as she does at her age but, more importantly, I hope I am still having as much fun.Some say: “Grow old gracefully.”She proves it is much more fun to grow old disgracefully.Celebrities have the potential to really make an impact and change lives – but not all of them do.So I love the story this week that Taylor Swt has donated more than £, to Vitoria Mario, a Tottenham teenager who started a GoFundMe appeal to become a mathematician, describing herself as a “black -year-old with a dream”.Vitoria, had been offered a place at Warwick University to study maths but could not afford to take it because she did not qualy for a student loan.When Taylor saw Vitoria’s GoFundMe appeal, she gave her the entire amount she had left to raise, along with a message saying: “I am so inspired by your drive and dedication to turning your dreams into reality . . . Good luck with everything you do! Love, Taylor.”Imagine waking up to that message .Cynics might suggest that Taylor does things like this for the publicity.But eventhat is true, who cares Vitoria will never forget this and it will likely change her le for ever.Also, how impressive that she found a way to follow her dreams and get the money she needs to go to university.We could all take a leaf out of the book of Britain’s oldest coronavirus survivor.At the grand old age of , she has revealed her secrets to staying healthy are eating an orange a day and “counting your blessings”.Angela Hutor has lived through both World Wars, as well as the Spanish Flu pandemic of .She caught Covid- in April and was so close to death that her daughter was called to hospital to say her final goodbyes. But Angela bounced back.Her advice this week to family and friends is to keep calm and occupied.Angela, from North London, is adamant Britain “will get through this” – and given all that she has survived, she should know.So let’s all take that on board. This lady has a great attitude, something we should all adopt.Frankie Bridge is under fire for posting a photo of her children watching iPads at the dinner table – with some people up in arms about how unacceptable it is.But perhaps people in glass houses should not throw stones.By which I mean that anyone who has children and wants to have a nice time knows kids are not always great at sitting through long, fancy dinners out.Some people think going out to dinner is a treat and children should learn to behave properly.Butyou ask young kids to sit and wait for their food, they will get restless.And there is a definite argument that going out to dinner should be a treat for the adults too.If that means a bit of screen time for the kids while at the table, well, who am I to judge GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It terried her.”Her parents, two sisters and brother described her in a Facebook post as “our beautul, funny, talented, and a little bit crazy daughter and sister.”The post added: “We are all absolutely devastated but also immensely proud of everything she achieved in her le.“So many people have messaged us over the past five days saying how Emily helped them through hard times of their own, and we had no idea how much positive impact she had on those around her.“To many people. Emily was a really fun, energetic, happy girl, but only a few were aware of the many years of internal battles she had.“Few people are aware, but four years ago she was diagnosed with high ing autism and had a daily battle to fit in and conform with social norms.“She didn’t want anyone to know, but now she has gone we want to make people know that autism comes in all shapes and sizes.“Despite this she managed to finish school, go to college, finish an apprenticeship and start working in the King’s Arms… Please look out for people, be kind as you never know what is going on in people’s lives.”Abbie Panks, vice-chairman of Shouldham Community Enterprises which ran the King’s Arms pub, said at the time: Emily was a whirlwind of energy, so caring and funny, truly beautul inside and out.“She was loved by our team and customers alike.

Recent outbreaks have emerged in Vietnam, New Zealand and parts of China where there had been no cases for some months.Importation of contaminated food and food packaging is a feasible source for such outbreaks and a source of clusters within existing outbreaks.While it can be confidently argued that transmission via contaminated food is not a major infection route, the potential for movement of contaminated items to a region with no Covid- and initiate an outbreak is an important hypothesis.An infected food handler has the potential to become an index case of a new outbreak. The international food market is massive and even a very unlikely event could be expected to occur from time to time.Prof James Wood, head of the Veterinary Medicine department at the University of Cambridge, told The Sunday : “The authors discuss, very sensibly, how it is important that factory workers must be incentivised not to go to work when symptomatic or in contact with Covid- cases.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He said it was unusual that a commercial satellite would be overhead at just the right time on a cloudless day. The expert claimed that the mysterious underground base was a means of China covertly storing its military hardware - which included submarines and missile systems based inland. He continued: The Chinese have tremendous experience building underground facilities.Its in keeping with their strategic culture. The Yulin base is located on the southern end of Hainan Island, some  miles southwest of Hong Kong.It is considered one of Chinas key strategic outposts to protect its navy. Mr Thompson said that the country has a large and growing submarine fleet, which they are able to protect with underground facilities. A spokesperson for the US navy told CNN that the navy had sent one of its P-A Poseidon intelligence and reconnaissance jets on a flight near the base.The Type  submarine, believed to be the submarine seen in the pictures, is one of six in the Chinese fleet, according to the nonprofit Nuclear Threat Initiative.

It reveals:Downing Street is pushing hard for a trade deal but is making  contingency plans for an “unruly” exit from the EU transition period at the end of December.With trade talks looking set to go the wire, there is a risk they collapse — putting up trade barriers overnight on  January.In that scenario planners believe France will force “mandatory controls on UK goods from day one” and between  and  per cent of hauliers travelling across the Channel may not be ready for this.That could see flow between Dover and Calais down  per cent for three months, triggering long queues of HGVs in Kent.It could lead to shortages of the  per cent of our food imported from the EU as well as medicines, chemicals for drinking water purication and fuel supply.This could trigger water rationing and even power cuts.Food supply across the country would be hit by panic buying at Christmas, the busiest time of year.There are also increasing fears in Whitehall that Covid- willwith a vengeance in the winter months.The planners warned that “pandemic influenza, severe flooding, a Covid second wave and an unruly exit from the EU transition period could cause a systemic economic crisis with major impact on ­disposable incomes, unemployment, business activity, international trade and market stability.”It could be combined with likely “coordinated industrial action” as well as shortages risking public disorder and a mental health crisis that will hit the poorest hardest. Rising virus infections and hospital admissions would require a possibleto two-metre social distancing rules and further lockdown restrictions “well into ”.But, they fear, public compliance with anti-Covid measures could “steadily wane”.And ministers have been warned the NHS could be overwhelmed by a “one in -year flu scenario alongside even a continuation of the current levels of C and signicantly overwhelmed in any level of second peak”.The document says five per cent of councils in England “are already at high risk of financial failure ­following Covid-”. It means some town halls may go bust and need bailing out or may need to be under direct control of Whitehall.And inflation could “signicantly impact social care providers due to increasing staff and supply costs”.Ministers have also been told to brace for a further  months of virus infections in care homes.There are fears of public disorder as a result of shortages and a major economic slump.The outlook is also bleak for Gibraltar and the Channel Islands, both reliant on imports.Gibraltar could be cut off from Spain and economically crippled and the Channel Islands may need airdrops of medicines and food.Three quarters of UK medicine imports come through Dover, and many have a limited shelf le — making stockpiling dficult. During the pandemic the focus on Covid has led to a slump in animal vaccine production. If the borders are jammed stockpiles could deplete, risking disease among livestock.When confronted by our leaked document the Cabinet Office outlined contingency plans to avoid the chaos:It includes extensive winter planning including an extra £billion for the NHS and an extra £million for social care.Covid- testing capacity will be extended to , a day and billions of items of PPE delivered to health and social care workers.A further £million will be spent on new border and customs infrastructure and new border rules phased in over six months to try to avoid backlogs.There will also be an advertising blitz to get businesses ready for changes and encourage them to prepare supply chains and stockpiling of critical medicines.Data and finance rules will be relaxed to keep firms trading with the EU in the event of No Deal.Cabinet Office boss Michael Gove said: “We got Brexit done with a great deal in January.“And we are working flat out to make sure the UK is ready for the changes and huge opportunities at the end of the year as we regain our political and economic independence for the first time in almost  years. Part of this work includes routine contingency planning for ious scenarios that we do not think will happen but we must be ready for, come what may.“Whether we trade with the EU on terms similar to Canada or to Australia, a brighter future awaits as we forge our own path.”A Government spokesperson added: “As a responsible government we continue to make extensive preparations for a wide range of scenarios, including the reasonable worst case.“This is not a forecast or prediction of what will happen but rather a stretching scenario.

Usuallypeople want to go inside a fenced area, they ask for permission first, but I was not asked at all. It is only polite to ask. He could have put up his tent in the garden of the cottage and there would have been no problem but he didnapost do that.  He could easily have damaged the fence by climbing over it as a short cut. There is a gate a little way up and they could have just used that. Mr Cameron, who has leased the land for  years, marched up to the picturesque spot and confronted the Prime Minister after a friend saw the pictures and tipped him off. He shook his head as he checked the tent and spotted a bundle of charred wood from the remains of the campfire.  Arriving at the cottage, Mr Johnsonaposs security team then promised the farmer to take it down and clear away any rubbish. Mr Cameron said: aposItaposs just that I was not told about it. Officers from politan Police apologised to Mr Cameron and said the PM thought the field was part of the property. The farmer complained directly to the officers that he had not been asked for permission for the tent to go up and watched as the area was cleared away.

It’s asthis government is determined we’re always at the bottom. Maybe they look on the internet and scream: “Oh no, India has more people killed by tigers than us. Let a couple out of London Zoo into Camden Market so we can be the worst at that as well.” And none of them ever resign.

So he needs to make himself recognisable, by making the same points, but instead of making them in parliament, say them on Flog It!  Then he can make lots of forensic points about the Government’s failure to introduce a tracing system for Coronavirus, while finding out the value of a th century butter kne. And millions of pensioners will find out who he is. Instead of making clever points about the failures of the furlough system at Prime Minister’s Questions, that no one watches, he could present a similar speech on MTV’s Top  Grime Artists, interspersing plans for boosting the economy with his views on Stormzy and Skepta.

Just the man. Been looking for you ­everywhere. This A-level business, you’re going to have to go and do the telly.” Understandably, Mr W says: “Oh aye  Where’s the gaffer ” “Camping. Middle of nowhere. No signal.” Magnicent timing, Mr Johnson. Of all the weeks to head off on a “wilderness retreat” this was the one to pick. With the exam crisis, fresh economic worries, and the increased prospect of a second wave, what better time to take a break from running the country  Mr Johnson was finally tracked down and photographed – in the traditional British August holiday wear of a thick woolly hat – on the Scottish coast. It cost me some money this, as when it was announced earlier this week that the PM was going camping in Scotland, I offered some decent odds that this was absolutely, one hundred per cent, not going to be the case. He’s not the sort of fella who is going to pile the family in the Volvo, bolt on the roof rack, stick in a Crowded House tape and off you go. Lots of people agreed. “I just don’t see it,” one Whitehall insider said, “He doesn’t strike me as an outdoors type or anyone who knows their way round a ­rubber mallet. It would be the least successful camping trip since Deliverance.” Correct. It had Bear Grylls written all over it.  Not the survival skills bit but the part in Born Survivor where Bear told us he was living in the Calornia wilderness “off just a water bottle, a cup and a flint for making fire” but was really in a BB that did hot showers and excellent blueberry pancakes. As to my bet, there were a couple of takers – weirdly there are still people in politics who believe everything he says – and I am reluctantly paying out. Although I am still not sure you can call what the Prime Minister is doing camping. This is because he has pitched his tent fty yards from a, erm, house. Which he’s living in. It is made of bricks and costs £, a night. “It’s glamping,” said one staffer, smiling as he pocketed his winnings, “You wouldn’t understand.” It’s not though, is it  He has no ­intention of going in that tent unless he sneaks out at night with a torch and some sandwiches to read his comics.  Anyways, his absence has been noted. The latest poll I saw showed that during his time out of town, Tory approval ratings have actually gone up. I’m not sure of the message here. Does it mean voters think someone in Downing Street is doing a good job but they’re not certain who it is  Do we prefer leaders when they disappear  "},{"url":null,"title":"cleaner living life luxury 10000","story":"NewsCleaner living le of luxury from £,-a-year sideline entering competitionsEXCLUSIVE: Mum-of-three Jolene Stanley has developed a system that wins her £, of goodies every year and has bagged more than £, in toys and treats for family and friendsShareCommentsByErin Cardf:,  AUG NewsMum-of-three Jolene Stanley earns just £ a week but sideline entering competitions provides her with thousands of pounds worth of luxury goodies \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Mum-of-three Jolene Stanley earns just £ a week but her sideline entering ­competitions means that is where she really cleans up. Jolene said: “From the first competition, I was addicted. “In the first year in , I won £, worth of prizes. “My friends and family joke that I must be the luckiest ­person in the country.” Jolene, , scours the web every day for prize draws and giveaways and has bagged more than £, in toys and treats for her family and friends. Her first massive win came when she was ­pregnant with her eldest son and saw her walk away with a £, top-of-the-range pram.  Since then, Jolene has pocketed everything from gig tickets to flash holidays, scooping so many freebies that last Christmas cost her next to nothing. She takes home between  and  prizes every single month, and says her luckiest streak was in September , when she picked up  prizes. Jolene has one son, Stanley Constable, seven, from a previous relationship, and two children, Ivy, three, and Charlie, one, with her carer ­partner James Houghton, . And they all share in her good fortune. Jolene now calls herself a seasoned “comper” – the term given to someone who enters prize giveaways religiously.  Just two months after she picked up her posh pram, Jolene landed a VIP ­experience driving supercars around a racetrack. She said: “I love winning but it’s not all about the big prizes. I love the little ones too, especially when they come from new brands and small businesses.” At first, although successful, Jolene was not organised. Rather than setting aside a specic time to scour the web for prizes, she checked her phone whenever she had a chance and entered as many competitions as she could.  But, at the start of , she vowed to be more strategic – and that system has brought in ­some reliable wins. Jolene said: “I decided I wanted to win enough to get Christmas for free. So, I started setting aside three nights a week for comping. “I’d categorise the prizes, ­dedicating one day to vouchers, one to toys and one to parenting giveaways. If I spotted something great during the day, I would enter that, too.” Jolene’s approach paid off as in  alone, she won around £, of freebies and managed to get Christmas virtually free, thanks to a pile of fab festive pressies and a deluxe dinner.  She said: “My total spend for Christmas was £. Everything  was taken care of by prizes. “I gave James a bottle of rum, a camping stove and a sock ­subscription and we also had a family day out at Gulliver’s theme park. “I gave Stanley a £ scooter and Ivy a new bike. I also won £ worth of Amazon vouchers, which I used to get stocking fillers. “Then I gave the kids a £ ­climbing frame as a joint present. I got a £ Tesco voucher and a £ LoveShop voucher, which can be used at multiple high street shops, which took care of everything .” One of Jolene’s favourite things about her hobby is that it allows her to spoil her loved ones.  In the past, she has taken friends and family with her on minibreaks, spa weekends, for afternoon tea or out for fancy meals. And once a month, kind-hearted Jolene, from Wivenhoe in Essex, also makes a ­donation to her local food bank. Her best prizes include tickets to a Spice Girls gig, a stay at a five-star resort in Portugal, a £, cooker and a seven-course dinner at a Michelin starred restaurant. Jolene has also bagged £, of ­holiday vouchers, a meal cooked by a private chef and a trip to Scotland. Most of her wins come through Instagram but she also scours Facebook and comping forums. “I make more from comping than I do from my job, she said. “The trip to Portugal will always stand out as one of the best things I’ve ever won. We were picked up from the airport by a private chauffeur and driven to this incredible resort. It was like being a celebrity.” And not only do her wins make ­wonderful surprises for her friends and family, they also make everyday le cheaper."},{"url":null,"title":"four month old brit baby","story":"NewsFour-month-old Brit baby dies in Corfu hotel after mum left him in cot with bottleAccording to local reports, the four-month-old British baby died in a Corfu hotel after his mother left him a bottle to suck on in his cot after putting him down for the nightShareCommentsByAlice Peacock:,  AUG Updated:,  AUG NewsFour-month-old British baby dies in Corfu hotel after ‘mum leaves her bottle to suck in cot’\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

But I’m coming out of it a dferent woman after the best – and worst – holiday of my le. I’ve been in Chamonix in the French Alps, where I’ve been coming for  years. But I’m used to a gentle kind of escape. Yes, I went on walks, but I left all that extreme outdoorsy stuff and zipwires for other people, especially as I have a fear of heights. Those sorts of adventures were not for me, I thought, and I stayed within the boundaries I’d ­articially created for myself. But since turning  in ­lockdown, I’ve got a new lease of le. I have more energy now than ever before, even though I’m going through the menopause. And I am very aware that we need to do things that make us feel alive and appreciate our time on the planet. Now more than ever. So this holiday, I signed up with a personal trainer, Quentin, for a -day Spartan training programme, which is pretty much the polar opposite of lazing on a beach. I did things that not only exhausted me, they frightened me. It was an hour of training every day, waking up for am, carrying lb on my shoulders and running up a steep hill and wading through ice-cold glacial waters, plus cardio sessions where I wanted to be sick. Pull-ups, weights, climbing walls, monkey bars – it was gruelling. I hated every minute and just when I thought I’d finished, he made me sprint for  more minutes. But you know what  I never stopped. I gritted my teeth, fought the tears and found my inner strength. And when it did finally finish and I was released for the day, I had the biggest sense of pride. I never knew I had such willpower and that my body possessed so much strength. Not bad for . What do you think  Join the debate in our comment section below But in Chamonix I have seen other -year-olds taking on ­ultra-marathons, -year-olds climbing peaks that make you shudder, and -year-olds, men and women, trekking for miles. This valley shatters the ­stereotype of putting your feet up as you get older. Knowing what I was capable of, mentally and physically, led me to have a completely dferent holiday with my kids as well.I went to the waterparks with them and jumped in from dizzying heights. Instead of thinking, “Nope, you daft idiot, you can’t do that”, I was saying, “you can do it!” And I wenton to conquer my fear of heights.With my -year-old son, I climbed ft up into the treetops and did an obstacle course where I had to balance on a thin wire. My heart was in my mouth, it was the most horrible experience of my le, but I did it. And then zip-wired over a beautul lake – I ‘d always thought I could never be one of those people. So many of us are stuck in our comfort zones and give up as we get older. You don’t have to go on an expensive holiday, but you can challenge yourself to do new things, no matter your age. And you should – to truly feel alive. Boris taking the teepee Boris Johnson has disappeared to Scotland on holiday. You’d think he could have waited. You wouldn’t have caught his hero, Churchill, booking a week at Butlin’s during the Battle of Britain. The PM left useless Gavin Williamson to cope with thousands of angry and upset A-level pupils, who needed far more consideration.  The PM has been tracked down to a teepee with his fiancée Carrie Symonds and their baby Wilfred. Let’s hope he’s doing his fair share of dirty nappies because he clearly doesn’t give a s*** about our kids. Food shop risk takes the biscuit More Covid confusion this week – can we catch it from our weekly shop or not  Lab tests have shown it can survive for hours,not days, on ious forms of plastic. And the virus is more stable at lower temperatures, which is how most food finds its way to our shops and doors. But some scientists reckon that outside a lab, the virus cannot survive for long anyway. Hmmm. To be on the safe side, the advice is to sanitise your hands after you get out of the shop – so pick, pack, wash. Then you should wash your hands after handling any packaging and before eating too. Which is a small price to pay for a custard cream. Taylor sums it up Teenager Vitoria Mario couldn’t afford to go to uni to study maths – until Taylor Swt entered the equation. The pop superstar donated £, to her GoFundMe page to help Vitoria smash the £, target she had set to cover her accommodation, food and books at Warwick University. Vitoria moved to London from Portugal four years ago, leaving behind her family. When she arrived, she couldn’t speak English, but has gone on to get two A*s and an A in her A-levels. She’s one smart girl but not eligible for any grants, so had to try her luck online.  She wrote she was a “black girl with a dream” and that dream was to be a mathematician, which would also help her family have a better le. And Taylor paid out to make that possible. But like Vitoria said, her story is not unique. So many talented kids from disadvantaged ­backgrounds can only dream of going to uni. And it would need more than TayTay’s piggy bank to sort that out... perhaps a government that wants to give everyone an equal chance at le  Jawahir set for Match of the Day Jawahir Roble is the first black, female, Muslim, hijab-wearing referee in the UK. A Somalian refugee, she hopes that one day she will be running around the pitch in the Premier League. JJ, as her friends call her, wants to inspire more women to get into refereeing and hopes England ladies will be the best football players in the world. Her parents were not happy with the idea of her playing football at first because she’s a girl and she had to hide her muddy boots when she came home. But their attitude changed when they saw her passion. Only a few tens of thousands of white male minds to change now, JJ. But I reckon she’s the girl for the job and there will soon be a seat for her on Match of the Day. Home school is out Not long to go until the school bell finally rings – and it will be music to my ears. My kids have been with me   since March and, boy, are they ready to shake off their mum and see their friends and teachers. Not being able to run around and have a giggle with their mates has hit them hard. At my son’s high school, they will continue playing cricket, but not rugby or football as they’re contact sports. And my daughter’s primary will have social bubbles to cut down on them bumping into other children. It’s going to be dferent, but I don’t think it will faze them. They all need to get back in the playground, where they belong.

The denim perennial has been in production since  and is a favourite of Hollywood stars and manual workers alike. Second place went to the s-defining Mary Quant-style miniskirt, while Leviaposs denim jackets, UGG boots and Fred Perry polo shirts completed the top five. The poll of , UK adults saw Barbour wax jackets, Ray-Ban Wayfarers and Hunter wellies also feature on the list. Thomas Berry, director of sustainable business for Farfetch, which commissioned the study as part of its drive to raise awareness of sustainable fashion, said: Now more than ever, customers are interested in making considered purchases that will stand the test of time. From pre-owned denim to iconic designer pieces, customers are willing to seek out and to invest in pieces that are conscious, durable and also timeless, regardless of trends. Nearly a fth of those polled named Christian Louboutinaposs famous red-bottomed shoes as an iconic statement piece. Although in terms of memorability, the classy designer shoe only came one place above the gardeneraposs favourite - Crocs. It also emerged that at some point in their lives,  per cent of adults have owned a classic Ralph Lauren polo shirt, and one in six have worn some iconic Nike Air Max trainers.  Half of those polled would still wear any of these memorable trends from years gone by, and three in  have hunted in a charity shop or vintage store to find one specic piece of clothing. Many of the items in the list have been handed down to Brits, who didnapost quite realise what they had, as three in  got rid of items given to them by older relatives, only to regret it later. But just under six in adults now say theyaposd rather have fewer quality pieces in their wardrobe, than lots of cheap items which wouldnapost last as long.  The average adult spends about three hours, and £, a month in charity or vintage clothing stores, with a third actively enjoying aposthe huntapos of finding the perfect garment. More than one in  have even spent a DECADE or longer searching high and low for that one mythical item which will complete their wardrobe.And  per cent agree that fashion is cyclical, and what was once trendy will become trendy again in the future.Despite the desire for more long-lasting clothing, only eight per cent of Brits say they aposalwaysapos shop sustainably, although  per cent apossometimesapos manage to.# The research, conducted via OnePoll, also found  per cent have cut down on clothes shopping in general to reduce their carbon footprint, while  per cent buy from stores which have good green credentials. While a further four in  will be sure to clear space from their wardrobe by giving away old clothes, before buying anything new.Following the findings, Farfetch have created a aposfashion footprintapos tool which gives people the chance to consider the environmental impact of their shopping. Thomas Berry added: The tool allows consumers, when choosing to make a purchase, to consider which materials can reduce the environmental impact of their purchases, and to see the environmental savings of incorporating pre-owned products into their wardrobes. To remind people of the iconic items and test their knowledge, Farfetch have created the ultimate quiz for fashionistas to try out. The top  most iconic fashion items of all time . Leviaposs s .

Harry sparked headlines in July when he told members of the Queen’s Commonwealth Trust that its history must be acknowledged and work done to “right those wrongs”. But in a web call with members last week, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex – president and vice-president of the trust – insisted they were keen to continue the Queen’s legacy. Royal watchers claim it is proof the couple are keen to improve relations with the Royal Family, which have been further soured by the book, Finding Freedom. It is understood the book – which reveals rts between the royals – was written with Harry and Meghan’s ­approval, but left the Queen ­“upset and disappointed”. In the latest web chat, Meghan, , admitted she was “newer to the Commonwealth”, but said: “It wasn’t until joining the family I was able to meet so many young people throughout the Commonwealth. “They came with a question, they always offered a solution and that’s why I’m incredibly proud to work with the QCT, but why it’s the continuation of the legacy of your grandmother.” Speaking from the couple’s new £million home in Calornia, -year-old Harry also heaped praise on his grandmother. He said the Queen, , had achieved everything she wanted to after taking on the “huge responsibility” of the Commonwealth. A source told the Sunday People: “The Queen is fiercely protective of the Commonwealth.She wants her work to carry on through younger family members when she’s gone. “It feels like Harry and Meghan are finally trying to build bridges as I think despite their popularity in certain quarters, it has dawned on them they need the Royal Family more than it needs them.” Ingrid Seward, editor of Majesty magazine, said: “When Meghan and Harry last spoke, they made fools of themselves.  They ­managed to ­confuse the ­uncomfortable history of the British Empire with the modern Commonwealth, which caused derision.” Ms Seward also told how the couple’s biggest asset was undoubtedly their family.

It will tackle discrimination like that faced by mixed-race Meghan herself as she grew up in Los Angeles. These are the first details to emerge of a project which the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have pitched to a string of network executives. A TV insider said: “They have suggested a series focusing on the empowerment of women and young girls in today’s world. “It will home in on race issues, something Meghan has always been passionate about. It’s got quite a political stance and will also draw on feminism. “They want the series to continue their vision of empowerment for young people.” Sources say the couple “will appear in it but it’s about ‘normal’ people, not them.” Last week, it emerged the couple pitched the idea to numerous companies in June – when they bought an £million estate in Santa Barbara, Calornia, where they live with son Archie. They intend to serve as joint producers of the project. Harry and Meghan hope to make a fortune with their own film and television production company after their break from the Royal Family. Their plans include providing voiceovers and producing documentaries on worthy issues, such as mental health and climate change. NBC Universal was among the networks that heard Harry and Meghan’s first pitch.They had a meeting with its top bosses – including chairman of content studios Bonnie Hammer, who has known Meghan, , since her days on the US show Suits. Meghan has described Ms Hammer as the woman who changed her le after she cast her in the legal drama. A friend of Meghan told Variety magazine that she has no intention of acting in any projects. The duchess narrated the Disney+ documentary Elephants, which came out in April. Last year Harry, , announced he was partnering with Oprah Winfrey on an Apple TV+ series about mental health.And he is to appear in a Netflix documentary about the Paralympic Games, which will air on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper tablet offer promotion","story":"NewsGet The Mirror free on tablet for two months*Its packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownShareByDave Masters:,  APR Updated:,  APR News\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

The money could be used for one of two potentially le-saving treatments, one of which is only available in the US. The only other option is more chemotherapy on the NHS, but this is not a cure for the cancer.

Emily Owen, , was struggling with worry and distress after the pandemic unfolded and feared she would be unable to work and go out. Norfolk coroner’s court in Norwich heard she had previously been looking forward to a bright future.In the days before her death Emilyaposs family had decided to self-isolate as one of her sisters had a cough, the Sun reports.Emily was sadly found hanged by her mum and sister at their family home in Shouldham, Norfolk on March . The UK went into partial lockdown on March  when people were advised to avoid social contact and a full lockdown was rolled out a week later when non-essential shops were ordered to close and everyone was told they must stay at home. Emily never regained consciousness and died when her le support was turned off at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King’s Lynn, four days later on March . Her grieving dad Timothy Owen said Emily had been diagnosed with autism in , and had previously struggled with mental health dficulties, but she was looking forward to a fresh start as the family were preparing to move to Cornwall. He told the inquest: She was really excited and looking for a fresh start. Le was really good and the future was looking better for everyone. The straw that broke the camel’s back was the restrictions - just being unable to cope with the restrictions, which is happening to a range of people in the UK at the moment.  He said on the morning of Emilyaposs death she wanted to go for a drive but was unable to as the family were isolating. She was concerned she was going to lose her freedom and independence, not being able to go to work and the gym or drive and get out, the heartbroken dad added. Norfolk senior coroner Jacqueline Lake recorded a conclusion of suicide on Friday. She offered her sympathies to Emilyaposs devastated family.Days after Emily died Annabel Owen, , paid tribute to her sister on Facebook.She said: “Emily was very concerned about coronavirus itself but more concerned about the mental health impact of isolation and the fear of the unknown.We are all absolutely devastated but also immensely proud of everything she achieved in her le. “So many people have messaged us saying how Emily helped them through hard times of their own, and we had no idea how much positive impact she had on those around her. “To many people Emily was a really fun, energetic, happy girl, but only a few were aware of the many years of internal battles she had. “Few people are aware but four years ago she was diagnosed with high-ing autism and had a daily battle to fit in and conform to social norms.

Englandaposs chief medical officer believes there is little chance of a vaccine breakthrough before Christmas – and says our best hope now is of finding one before winter .Prof Whitty also warns that the coronavirus R rate could leap above  when childrento school – fuelling fears of more local lockdowns.He and the chief medical officers for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland stressed there were “no risk-free options” and that sending pupils back to class had to be weighed up against keeping them away. The infection risk for children is low, but with , teachers ing to work and parents set to gather at school gates again, the R rate could go back above , with scientists saying spikes are inevitable. And in a TV interview today, Prof Whitty says that would mean localised shutdowns with certain businesses closing – a move that cost Leicester £million. Prof Whitty said: “If it was shops in a particular area we would look at shops. If it was hospitality, we would look at hospitality. We’re trying to keep transmission rates low and do the least social and economic damage.” On Saturday, Prof Whitty warned it would be foolish to plan for this coming winter on the basis of having a coronavirus vaccine. But he told reporters there was a reasonable chance there could be vaccines available before the winter of -.  He said: I would obviously be delightedit came earlier rather than later but Iaposd be quite surprisedwe had a highly effective vaccine ready for mass use in a large percentage of the population before the end of winter, certainly before this side of Christmas. Now that may be wrong. A lot of people are doing a huge amount scientically, logistically to make sure thataposs a pessimistic statement, to try and seewe can get a vaccine at extraordinarily fast speed but we have to check it works and we have to make sure itaposs safe and these things do take time. So I thinkwe look forward a year I think the chances are much greater thanwe look forward six months and we need to have that sort of timescale in mind. So planning for the next winter, it would be foolish to plan on the basis we will have a vaccine. We should plan on the basis we will not have a vaccine and thenone does prove to be effective and safe and available then weaposre in a strong position to be able to use it and that will be great, but we should be planning on the basis of what we currently have. Iaposm confident in the long-term in the ability of science to get us out of this hole but I donapost think we can expect it to happen in the next few weeks or even the next few months. Prof Whitty said he was confident in the ability of science to help tackle the virus, but stressed it would take time. He added: Iaposm confident in the long-term in the ability of science to get us out of this hole but I donapost think we can expect it to happen in the next few weeks or even the next few months.  His comments come as he joined the UKaposs chief and deputy chief medical officers to issue a joint statement on schools and childcare reopening. When askedthere were decisions he would have made dferently earlier in the pandemic Prof Whitty said of course but plans had to be made with the information available. He added: There is a long list of things which,we knew at the beginning of this what we know now about this virus, about how it operates and also how the initial epidemic started, of course we would have done dferently and we knew at the time that it would be easier to plan with the huge benefit of hindsight, but you have to plan with the information youaposve got available to you, but yes, of course.

There are even warnings thatinfections get out of hand as a result of children going back, we may be in for another horrendous national lockdown. But, for once, the children aren’t the problem. It’s the grown-ups. Kids get the blame for super-spreading colds and flu, but Covid- does not act like that. Children are unlikely to get it, or become very sickthey do, or pass it on. It’s the , teachers ing to work, and parents gathering at the school gates who pose the greatest risk. So next month, we must brace ourselves for an upturn in illness. That does not make it wrong to get children back into class after more than five months’ absence. It is essential for their wellbeing that their education resumes. Join the debate in our comments section below and tell us what you think  What Chris Whitty and the UK’s other chief medical officers do today is lay out the realities of doing so. Which is more than can be said of Boris Johnson. Since the start of this pandemic, we have had promises of a world-beating this or a ground-breaking that – only for them to end in abject failure. His decision-making has been hesitant and dodgy, his mixed messaging downright dangerous. The PM would have probably done less harm by spending the entire crisis in a Scottish tent. But now he has come out of it, we urge him to start being upfront and honest with the British people. About the likelihood of a second national lockdown. About the real prospects for the economy. About plans for the future now we know Covid will be with us for at least nine months. The British are resilient. We have taken on a deadly invisible enemy. So we can easily take the clear and unnished truth. A sorry story What is it about have-it-all footballers that ends them up in trouble  Take Harry Maguire. He’s worth £million to Manchester United, so it pays him £, a week. With that kind of money he could buy his own deserted island – and do what ever he wants there with his mates.

Next to the white cabinets and stone worktops is a heavy metal, grey door that looks very out of place with the rest of the home, leading to a series of prison cells with the capacity to hold nine people.One cell contains two metal bunk beds, a basic toilet and what appears to be a holding area behind metal bars and a cell door, with other cells designed for single occupancy. Photos from the outside of the home show metal bars covering many of the windows and doors, acting as the only hint of what is concealed inside the otherwise unassuming property.A listing on House of Brokers rightly highlights the sale as an aposextremely unique opportunityapos, with the description reading: Extensive renovation in , captures modern high end finishes with traditional architecture and character.

But itaposs the apospossibilitiesapos of the home that is worrying people on social media, with some suggesting it should simply state that only psychopaths need apply. The listing does seem to offer a slightly more reassuring explanation as to why the cells are there, stating that the building was previously used as the Howard County Sherfaposs House and Jail.It was shared on Twitter by @SairaKH with the captions: This gorgeous house with AN ENTIRE PRISON in it can be yours for only ,. Have a peaceful thanksgiving upstairs knowing that your prisoners are safely and quietly confined downstairs. A single cell was described as a special room for misbehaving children, while adding: Hate your daughteraposs boyfriend  Disappear him in your basement while she sleeps in this gorgeous sunlit room.

The -strong flotilla, with vessels as big as a football pitch, has descended on the oceans around the Galapagos Islands – where the rich bioersity offers unique insights into our planet. Scientists fear the fleet puts endangered species at risk both by plundering the oceans and from the , plastic bot­­tles thrown overboard every day. They say the boats, each dangling millions of hooks, are targeting sharks that end up in expensive fin soup in markets across China and Hong Kong. In , officials from Ecuador, which owns the islands, intercepted one with  tonnes of refrigerated shark fins on board. Last week, locals spoke of their anger after finding a young shark washed up on a beach with its dorsal fins hacked off. And a whale shark called Hope that recently vanished was shown by its GPS tracker to have last been where the fleet was. What do you think about the story  Join the debate in our comments section below Esme Plunkett, , a British marine biologist based on the island of Santa Cruz, said: “I’ve never known such anger here. “Locals are devastated to see what these fleets are doing.” Darwin visited the islands in . Studying its unique species helped form his evolution theory. Conservationists say at least  species, including sea lions, turtles and marine iguanas, have been found entangled in plastic bags or lines, or swallowed plastic. Esme said: “In just  minutes I found  Chinese-labelled bottles in the rocks next to the iguanas.“Waste is not unheard of, but this was in good condition with the labels intact. They take hund­reds of years to degrade. “In two years I’ve never seen plastic waste like this.” It is understood the vessels, which claim to be catching squid, have now turned off their tracking devices to avoid being monitored."},{"url":null,"title":"huge ovarian tumour weighing almost","story":"NewsHuge oian tumour weighing almost  stone removed from -year-old womanSurgeons were forced to operate on the -year-old woman, from New Delhi after she developed breathing problems and complained about acute pain in her abdomenShareCommentsByTahir Ibn Manzoor:,  AUG NewsDoctors removed the huge tumour that had grown on the womans oy \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

In , doctors in the Indian city of Tamil Nadu successfully operated on a kg tumour from another womanaposs oy.  Nirmala also suffered severe anaemia and was unable to walk due to the size of the benign tumour. “With a low level of haemoglobin, this was a major task for the doctors” Prasad said.

But she was baffled as she was only wearing a high-waisted two piece from Amazon, with only about three inches of her stomach showing. And what made matters worse - her pal did not back her up. The woman was at a baby swim class where, she explained, she is often one of few mums who enter the pool with their babies while most couples have the dad enter the water while the mothers sit on the sidelines. This day, when she took her six-month-old to the class, there was a new baby. She takes up the story on Reddit: Today, there was a new baby at swim class! He looked to be about the same age as my son. As the father got into the pool, he said hi and I ed the greeting. I then asked him how old his son was and we made about  seconds of small talk before the class started,” the woman explained. “After class was over and my son and I were leaving the pool area, this man’s we approached me and said aposyou know,you are going to continue to swim with husbands and fathers, you should really dress more modestlyapos. Stunned, the woman explained there was only about three inches of her stomach showing and it was not like her voluptuous curves were a distraction or anything. She did not have a moment to think, so in her shocked state she simply replied: Thank you for your opinion. She walked off but, unable to shake off what had happened, she asked her friend about it later. But instead of sharing in her horror at the body-shaming at the pool, her mate told her maybe she should think about her swimwear fashion choices. She said that I should invest in a one-piece , she said. She then continued that she would also be uncomfortable with a swim class that had other women who were showing off too much skin to her husband and children.

Primary school teacher Halie Tennant, , said she felt she had lost her identity, and recalled how she asked her husband to love her no matter what.And she said the coronavirus pandemic had heightened her ordeal, as she was only allowed one visitor for one hour each day during a long recovery process after surgery. Halie, from Hotspur in Victoria, Australia, had gone on a spontaneous camping trip with a friend, but it turned into a nightmare when she dozed off in a camping chair, according to Yahoo.Her friend, who had fallen asleep in her swag, a portable sleeping unit, awoke to a murmuring noise, and to her horror found Halie lying head first in the campfire, making no attempt to move. She pulled Halie out of the fire - almost certainly saving her le - and poured ice cold water on her face to ease the burns. Halie has no recollection of how she ended up in the fire, but believes the chair must have tipped while she was sleeping in it. The pair then drove back to Halieaposs home less than two kilometres away, where her husband Matthew tried to cool her burns as much as possible by running cold water over her face, while an ambulance, an intensive care ambulance and a helicopter made their way to the scene. Halie was rushed to the intensive care unit at The Alfred Hospital in Melbourne, where she was immediately put in a coma. After being in a coma for eight days, Halie was moved to the burns ward to begin her long recovery.  She has spent more than two-and-a-half months in hospital and has gone under the kne six times - including to remove damaged skin and to have skin grafts to her face, neck, eyelids and mouth. Amazingly, Halie says she doesnapost recall feeling any pain after falling into the fire - although she does remember the agony of fearing her husbandaposs reaction. “I donapost remember any pain, she said. I remember asking Mathew to love me no matter what and him saying, ‘yes’. She said Matthew, her mum and her dad took turns to visit while she was in intensive care, describing the limited visiting hours due to Covid as the hardest part of her recovery.

I like what Olly Crankshaw brought to the Dee last term and a similar sort should be sought.At the back, a left-sider to push Jordan Marshall and a goalkeeper should be on the shopping list, while a No  to bang in the goals is needed.The clock has started ticking, let’s see what the next month and a half brings. . .Enjoying the privileged position of being able to attend games in person this season has been fantastic but minus fans it’s lacked something.Whether it’s passionate Dees banging on the Tannadice press box window celebrating a derby equaliser or hordes of Arabs heading for away days in the sun, they’ve been missed.It’s certainly earlier than expected but the September  date is promising. Fingers crossed it happens!There’s just no seeing past Bayern Munich for the Champions League is there  The Germans are an absolute powerhouse and, as good as PSG are, I don’t think they stand a chance in the Lisbon finale tomorrow.Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee\" title\"#Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp arsenal-celtic-kieran-tierney-dundee-united-gordon-young-stevie-frail embed # secretWyaDSfYoJ\" data-secret\"WyaDSfYoJ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Football with fans is what it’s all about.“It will be terric to get supporters back and I am really looking forward to getting back to having them in the stadium backing us.“Common sense will tell you that in order for football clubs to grow you need finances and part of that is getting fans through the door.“So I would imagine it will have a positive impact on that front but, as a manager, it’s about having that backing from the stands.”With impeccable timing, Mellon revealed he himself had been unable to attend a game – Tuesday’s Champions League qualying tie between the Hoops and KR Reykjavik at Celtic Park on Tuesday night.He wanted to see Neil Lennon’s men in the flesh ahead of their league clash but Mellon explained: “We tried to get into the Celtic game but we couldn’t get tickets.“Celtic told us Uefa are not allowing anyone in to watch the games.“But with the technology you have now we have been able to watch all the games they have had recently.”Mellon witnessed, albeit virtually, that - thrashing of the Icelandic team and knows this is the greatest challenge his players will have faced since stepping up from the Championship.He said: “Whenever you play the champions in any country you know the challenge will be a big one.“But it is something you want to be involved in and get excited about.“We will be encouraging the players to get involved in all games so this is an opportunity to play in a fantastic game against the champions.“It is all positive because it gives us a chance to see where we are as a club and go attack it.“We believe we can make a positive impact – that is what we are in the Premiership for.“Given the size of this football club, that is what we should we doing. That is what the fans and the owners of the club expect.”The Tangerines have impressed in the way they have nullied threats from their opponents thus far, with Motherwell and Hibs in particular struggling to make headway against a solid midfield.This test is on another level but Mellon said: “We will be trying to find a way to make it dficult for Celtic.

Of those,  were in the NHS Grampian area, compared with  in Tayside,  in Greater Glasgow and Clyde and four in Lanarkshire. No new deaths had been recorded in the last  hours.At her daily coronavirus briefing, Ms Sturgeon described the position in Aberdeen as “an improving situation” and said there was “no evidence” of transmission into Aberdeenshire or Moray.Ms Sturgeon said that when the local lockdown is reviewed on Sunday, the government would look at bringing Aberdeen into line with the rest of the country on some aspects of coronavirus policy, such as casinos and bingo halls reopening.We all hope and are optimistic that Aberdeen will be on the road back –not to complete normality then at least as much normality as the rest of the country very soon.”Nicola SturgeonElsewhere in Scotland, such venues are scheduled to come back into use on Monday. Previously, Ms Sturgeon has indicated that she would look at reopening Aberdeen’s non-licensed cafes on Wednesday.“On Sunday… we will review the lockdown restrictions in Aberdeen again,” Ms Sturgeon said. “And at that time we hope that we will be able to set out a firm timetable for the lting of these restrictions.“At that point we will also set out whether some of the changes that were announced more generally for the country yesterday – for example, the reopening of venues like bingo halls – will also apply in Aberdeen.”She added: “We all hope and are optimistic that Aberdeen will be on the road back –not to complete normality then at least as much normality as the rest of the country very soon.”The first minister added that there was “no evidence to suggest there had been wider transmission” beyond the city of Aberdeen.“That is something that has been looked at very carefully, particularly around Aberdeenshire, particularly given some of the travel patterns and proximity of communities there,” the first minister said.Ms Sturgeon said the cluster associated with those who gathered in the city’s pubs was now under control. But there was an “ongoing concern” about cases not associated with the cluster, but things were improving. In total,  cases have been identied in the Grampian Health Board area since the July .Of those,  were associated with the pub-linked cluster, and , contacts have been identied from those  cases. In the last  hours, there had been an additional seven cases not associated with the original cluster.Earlier this week Aberdeen City Council leaders expressed frustration that the city had not been allowed out of its three week lockdown earlier, warning that , jobs were at risk as a result of the coronavirus.Aberdeen City Council co-leader Jenny Laing said: “Of course we have to be mindful of public health, but we also have to be mindful of the economic implications, which could have an impact on public health as well.#It is about balancing competing harms. Economic damage could harm public health through unemployment and poverty. That’s why we thought, in line with the incident management team, that restrictions on travel, household gatherings and hospitality could have been lted earlier.”At her briefing, Ms Sturgeon repeated her warnings about house parties, saying indoor social gatherings were proving one of the major drivers of community transmission of the virus.She said: “That tells us that we need to be incredibly cautious about these kinds of gatherings.“I want to ask everybody again today to remember the advice that is in place and to comply with it.”Economy Secretary Fiona Hyslop repeated her plea for the UK Government#s furlough scheme to be extended, particularly in the hospitality and tourism industries.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

further factories linked to tayside coronavirus cluster as cases discovered across three council areas","story":"Two further factories have been linked to a growing coronavirus outbreak in Tayside, as new figures reveal the region now has the highest risk of local transmission anywhere in Scotland.The number of cases linked to the  Sisters food processing plant in Coupar Angus has risen to , and Nicola Sturgeon confirmed  employees have now tested positive for the virus, along with nine of their contacts.Speaking during the Scottish Government’s daily coronavirus briefing on the day Scotland recorded its second-highest number of new cases since May, Ms Sturgeon said  of the  new positive tests recorded overnight were in Tayside.A total of  of the new cases were in the Grampian health board area,  in Greater Glasgow and Clyde, and four in Lanarkshire.NHS Tayside announced on Thursday that anyone living in a household with a factory worker from the  Sisters site, including children, should self-isolate at home and get tested for Covid- as soon as possible.Ms Sturgeon said not all of the  Sisters workforce live in Coupar Angus so the situation involves people stretched across Perth and Kinross, Angus and Dundee.The first minister also confirmed two contacts #have links to other food processing factories in Tayside”, although it is not yet clear which businesses are affected.#The incident management team is now carrying out risk assessments at both of these sites,#Ms Sturgeon said.#There#s no evidence that this outbreak has spread to either factory at this stage but, as you can imagine, that is something that is being looked at very closely.#Ms Sturgeon said lockdown restrictions similar to the ones introduced in Aberdeen two weeks ago had not been imposed because there was currently #minimal evidence of community transmission in Tayside#.However, she said she could not rule out introducing further measures in the future and the situation would be kept under #very close review#.A new method of tracking the outbreak has revealed Perth and Kinross has the highest risk of local coronavirus transmission anywhere in Scotland and may require “greater vigilance” from health officials.The region has  surged past other areas dealing with local outbreaks, including Aberdeen, which became the site of Scotland’s first local lockdown following a cluster linked to pubs and bars in the city.A new Scottish Government report considered whether the current number of Covid- infections exceeds what health officials would expect at this stage of the epidemic, based on a new modelling system from Warwick University.It found six local authority areas – Perth and Kinross, Dundee, North Lanarkshire, Angus, Glasgow and Aberdeen – had exceeded expected levels but figures are beginning to trend towards normal.The new method is designed to be more useful than the R number – the average number of people infected by each person – because this figure can be volatile when the overall number of deaths is low.The report states: “While metrics such as the reproductive rate – R number – have been useful in guiding our response to coronavirus so far, the models we use rely on numbers of deaths to track the epidemic.“These have fallen to low levels, which means we need to find new ways to monitor trends in the epidemic.“One of the ways we can do this is to calculate whether the number of confirmed infectionsin each area exceeds the number that was expected, given the number recorded across the country – this is called ‘exceedance’.”Areas with an exceedance level above six are deemed to be at a higher risk of local transmission and may require “greater vigilance”, according to the report.In the week leading up to August , the only areas above this limit were Perth and Kinross, at ., and Dundee, where a number of workers at the  Sisters chicken factory live, at ..Angus came in at ., Aberdeen at ., and levels in Aberdeenshire are beginning to fall back towards background levels.The report stated in most cases the figures are “a reflection of a small number of cases” however, the ongoing nature of the outbreak in Perth and Kinross “may be a cause for concern”.Speaking about lessons learned from the clusters on Friday, Ms Sturgeon said indoor social gatherings are one of the major drivers of community transmission.She warned against defying guidelines on the number of people allowed indoors at once, which she said presented “a very signicant risk”.“That tells us that we need to be incredibly cautious about these kinds of gatherings,# she said. #I want to ask everybody again today to remember the advice that is in place and to comply with it.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including

Every day this week we have had lower numbers than Tayside, and it is clear the people of Aberdeen will be asking themselves why they are in lockdown and other parts of Scotland aren’t.“We have asked four or five times now what the infection rate in the city needs to be before the lockdown can be lted and we have never been able to get an answer from the Scottish Government.“We are only asking for clarity on when we will be able to reopen but they have not been able to tell us.#Mr Lumsden added: “They should be listening to the health professionals on the ground in Aberdeen and the lockdown should have been lted when the IMT recommended. What we are seeing now is lockdown being extended when the numbers are far higher in other parts of the country.“I don’t want to see any local lockdowns that aren’t needed because I know first-hand the harm that’s doing to our local economy. There are lots of businesses who can’t get through this.“There is an unfairness around this lockdown. They have got medical experts on the ground – why are they not listening to them ”The number of cases linked to the cluster which sparked the lockdown is .In her daily briefing, Ms Sturgeon explained the key dference between the Aberdeen cluster and the Tayside outbreak, which began at the  Sisters plant in Coupar Angus, was the risk of community transmission.She said: #Some people may be looking at Aberdeen and Coupar Angus and wondering why exactly the same approach is not being taken, and the key point is that the nature of the steps we take in dferent outbreaks has to depend on and be guided by the nature of the outbreak.#The assessment of the IMT in Coupar Angus is that there is minimal evidence of community transmission in Tayside.#That’s not something we were able to say with any confidence about the outbreak in Aberdeen.#So as things stand, there is a clear focal point for the Coupar Angus outbreak, which was not the case in Aberdeen where the outbreak was associated with a large number of venues across the city.#In each of these cases, and this will continue to be the case in future, we make decisions based on inidual circumstances that we’re dealing with.#In doing so, we take account of the specic risks that need to be addressed, and that is the approach we continue to take as we deal with dferent outbreaks in dferent parts of the country.#The First Minister said she hopes to be able to set out a #firm timetable# for the lting of restrictions tomorrow.In response to Mr Lumsden, a Scottish Government spokeswoman said: “Unfortunately there is no single level of infection that makes these decisions straightforward. We take into account prevalence, rate of positive tests, number of clusters and other factors. No country’s health advisers can  give an infection rate that means we are able to make certain decisions in regard to lting restrictions. There is a range of considerations about whether we can reach the conclusion that the overall situation in Aberdeen is sufficiently under control that we can start to lt the restrictions.“As the First Minister has made clear, we recognise in particular, the impact on businesses in Aberdeen, particularly those impacted by the restrictions and required to close. That’s why we have made available a £m grant support scheme for businesses in Aberdeen City impacted by local measures.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

So many people are intimidated by other vehicles. The Bikeability scheme gives children and adults the confidence to ride out safely.#The training, over three days, and was a mixture of games, exercises and on road practice, finishing with an assessment. The village#s fire engine was used to demonstrate to the youngsters how dficult they are to see from the cab of a large goods vehicle, particularly to the rear and near side at junctions.They also learned about primary and secondary road positions, right of way and good observational skills.They were even encouraged to ask their parentsthey do the #Dutch Reach# to keep passing cyclists safe. The Dutch Reach is a simple change of habit to help you open your car door safely. Instead of using the hand closest to the door, it means reaching across to open the door with the hand furthest from the door # your left handyou are the driver. This naturally turns your body towards the window, helping you spot approaching cyclists.Mr Catterwell added: #Thanks to Scottish Fire and Rescue Service for the use of the appliance and the drill yard, the Bike Bothy for administrative assistance and training materials and Graham Love for his excellent mechanical services. Also to residents and holiday makers around Craignish who were mostly respectful of the learner cyclists.#P S pupils Fergus Bennett, Beth Gregory, Magnus Hampton, Kay Neville, Harry Whittle and Reiley Van Der Zel received their Bikeability  badges. P  pupils Ross Potter-Irwin and Henry Small should get their Bikeability badges in term time next year.Through partnership with the Ardrishaig Bothy, Cycling Scotland is offering schools free instructor support, instructor training and resources to deliver Bikeability Scotland training.Bikeability Scotland is the national cycle training programme designed to give children the skills and confidence they need to cycle safely on the roads and to encourage them to carry on cycling into adulthood.

With recycling centres and charity shops open again therersquos no excuse. Spend the weekend sorting through any unwanted items and donate where you can.For storage solutions, you need to think outside the box ndash literally. Vacuum bags are ideal, they normally come in multipacks of ious sizes and are really cheap. Great for anything soft that is taking up a lot of space. Winter clothes, quilts and blankets can be reduced to a tenth of the size and slide under the bed nicely.If floor space is a problem, then the sky is the limit. Consider storing items that arenrsquot needed on a regular basis above units or wardrobes. Think about shelving units that are tall and slim, rather than long and bulky.Cheap and cheerful plastic, canvas or cardboard boxes can help to keep everything in place while adding a splash of colour and style. Perfect for keeping clutter off the floor.Shelves above radiators are a great way to use otherwise wasted space.If the kids are desperate for some space, a reading nook or kids study area can easily be achieved under the stairs or a window. A simple storage box with a couple of cushions on top will create a comfy seat and can double up as extra storage.Hooks can be attached to pretty much anything like bedroom doors and inside cupboards ndash again keeping items off the floor will create the illusion of more space. In the kitchen, using hooks to hang pots and pans and magnets for knives can free up cupboard space and make a statement.Knowing where things are is half the battle when considering storage options, so think about clear plastic boxes or bags that are easy to see into and can be labelled.Flexible furniture like extendable dining tables, sofa beds and even clothes rails are ideal as they have multiple uses and can be stored away easily when not in use.Let there be lightLighting and mirrors are your friends when it comes to making a smaller room feel bigger. Change large floor lamps for smaller wall lights and when it comes to wall colour, stick to pale colours and swap out heavy curtains with blinds. Luckily, a big tub of value white paint goes a long way. Let in as much light as possible, give the windows a good scrub and update yellowing lightbulbs to bright white.OutdoorsIs it time to rethink that huge sofa set and professional sized goal posts  When buying furniture, think small, light and foldable so that they can be stored away in a shed or cupboard or easily moved around. Updating your garden furniture doesnrsquot need to cost the earth, yoursquoll find some really great bargain sets in supermarkets like Aldi, Asda and Tesco and homeware stores like BM.Another way to make it feel bigger is to simply give it a good tidy. Yoursquoll be surprised at how much space you do have after clearing out those unwanted flowerpots, cutting the grass and trimming back the hedges.Your home is an investment, to be enjoyed for a long time and with these simple but effective ideas, you can enjoy the space you have for longer."},{"url":null,"title":"young-people-scotland-can-get-250-free-starting-new-job","story":"Young people across Scotland could be in line for as much as pound free from the Government for starting a new job, thanks to a new benefit.Its hoped the payment, which is open for applications from today, will help young people with the financial dficulties of starting a new job - including buying new clothes, travel and get childcare.It is estimated around  young people will benefit from the new financial support in its first year.What is the benefit The Job Start Payment is a one-off sum of pound for  to -year-oldsthey have been unemployed for at least six months.The upper age limit rises to  for care leavers and the payment increases to poundthe person has a child.How can I qualy for the payment To qualy for the payment, which will be delivered by Social Security Scotland, the person applying must have received a job offer for paid employment.They must be out of paid work and must have been receiving one of the qualying benefits for six months or more at the time of the job offer:Income-based Jobseekerrsquos AllowanceIncome SupportIncome-related Employment and Support AllowanceUniversal CreditWhat has the Scottish Government said Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: ldquoI am delighted that our Job Start Payment is today now open for applications it really couldnrsquot come at a better time to support our young people to take up job offers.ldquoYoung people are among those whose job prospects have been hardest hit by this pandemic.

councillor for Musselburgh West said: ldquoTragically,  local objectors and , petitioners have less value than the share value of these gigantic corporations.He called on councillors on the planning committee, which will debate the proposal on Tuesday, to halt the ldquobetrayal.Mr McAllister also lodged a formal objection, citing a range of concerns including traffic congestion, pollution, litter, obesity, residential amenity and economic damage.He claimed: ldquoThe custom predicted for this -hour McDonaldrsquos drive-thru and the intensity of the declared deliveries needed to service it are on an industrial scale. The impact on Olivebank Road would be truly calamitous.The plan will go before a lsquovirtualrsquo meeting of the planning committee after being called off the delegated list by ward councillor Stuart Currie because of the level of local concern.He said: ldquoI have called this application off the list to ensure that all the concerns raised by local residents are discussed and elected members can understand not only the strength of feeling but also the planning issues that exist as a result of this application.Musselburgh  Inveresk Community Council has lodged an objection, citing traffic congestion, emissions, and the facilityrsquos close proximity to local schools as concerns.A public campaign lsquoNo McDonaldrsquos in Musselburghrsquo was also launched in a bid to halt the plan, highlighting concerns such as increased traffic congestion, litter and air pollution.The planning report stated that there were  written representations to the application and, of these,  were objections.It said: ldquoThe councilrsquos road services advise they accept the conclusions of the traffic network modelling exercise, that the traffic impact associated with the proposed development would be minimal and there would be no adverse impact on the operation of the local highway network.ldquoMany written objections are made on the grounds of the proximity of the proposed drive-thru restaurant to Musselburgh Grammar School, and that such a facility promotes unhealthy eating and thus would lead to harmful health consequences.ldquoThe East Lothian Local Development Plan  does not contain any policies restricting the location of drive-thru restaurant facilities to a certain distance from schools, or any other educational establishments. Nor does it contain any policies relating to unhealthy eating or the health consequences of proposed developments. Thus, and in the absence of national guidance on health consequences of proposed developments, no signicant weight can be given to these matters.The report added: ldquoOn the matter of air quality, the public health and environmental protection officer advised that the proposed development was anticipated to result in up to  customer vehicles visiting the premises daily, which was a signicant number of additional vehicles given the proximity of site to the Air Quality Management Areaon Musselburgh High Street.The officer agreed with the conclusion of McDonaldrsquos Air Quality Assessment that impacts upon air quality at ldquosensitive receptors would not be signicant. The officer advised that, whilst it was acknowledged that additional traffic would have an impact upon queuing and reduce traffic speeds, the composition of the increased traffic would be from passenger cars, which are less polluting than HGVs and buses.The officer concluded that the proposed development would have ldquono harmful impact on air quality nor on the objectives of the AQMA and would not harm the amenity of the area.A McDonaldrsquos spokesperson said: ldquoWe look forward to progressing with this application and believe a new McDonaldrsquos would bring signicant investment to the local community, as well as create at least  new jobs.A supporting statement from the company added: ldquoThere are few restaurants in the country who can claim to have made so many positive changes to support healthier lestyles. McDonaldrsquos believe that the lessons they have learned in making these changes can be used to support a wider drive to reduce obesity.Planners are recommending the plan be approved with a number of conditions, including submission of litter and pest management plans.A council spokesperson declined to comment, saying the planning committee would consider the application next week."},{"url":null,"title":"preston-athletic-players-swap-boots-bicycles-fundraiser","story":"Members of Preston Athletic FCrsquos squad got on their bikes to raise money for the club and the NHS on Saturday, August .A dozen players, as a relay team, cycled from Dunbar Unitedrsquos New Countess Park through East Lothian, Midlothian and Edinburgh before reaching the finish line at their home ground, the Pennypit.Kai Austin was among those setting off from the Seasidersrsquo ground at about am but had to make a quick substitution before kick-off.He said: ldquoI had not checked my bike for about a week beforehand.ldquoI was putting it into the car and noticed the back tyre was flat.ldquoI thought we would pump it up when we got there.ldquoAfter we arrived, my girlfriend drove away and I was walking along and noticed the tyre was flat again.Fortunately, one of Kairsquos team-mates for the cycle had a spare bike and they were quickly able to get on the open road.The fundraiser came about with players deciding to visit  football grounds ndash the home of  teams ndash ahead of the   season.The first stop was at Millfield , before going on to Foresters Parkand New Recreation Park .The second group of cyclists ventured into Midlothian and ticked off Kingrsquos Park , Newbattle Complex , New Victoria Park , Newbyres Park , New Dundas Parkand Ferguson Park .Nathan Stokes, who plays in midfield and up front, was among the third group, who completed the Midlothian section by travelling on to Penicuik Park .Then it was into the Capital and Paties Road , Meggetland , Saughton Enclosureand Christie Gillies Park .Finally, the Edinburgh section was complete with a visit to Ainslie Park Stadium , St Marks Parkand Peffermillbefore ing to East Lothian and Olivebankand the Pennypit.Nathan, , said: ldquoTo get to Peffermill, we came down Cameron Toll.ldquoFrom the Commonwealth Pool, it is all downhill and by that point my legs were screaming.ldquoFor me, it was a nice relaxing run down there and when we reached Peffermill we knew it was only  minutes to Musselburgh and then another - minutes to the Pans.

This is how I heard about an otter at the Esk for the first time three years ago.A few people mentioned they had seen this elusive creature a few years ago, but never since.The otter became my new photography challenge. I tried visiting the river at dferent times of the day, especially at dawn and dusk, when otters are more active, always trying to keep the noise down to a minimum.After two years of searching, my hope was gone and I almost gave up. Until one sunny day in April during lockdownhellipThe weather that day was enjoyable, so Chris and I decided to go on a walk. The local path was very busy the dog walkers, cyclists, families with children and joggers were enjoying the sun whilst social distancing.As always, I kept my eyes low on the water hoping to see the kingfisher.As we followed the river upstream to the area at The Grove, I spotted something moving in the water.I grabbed Chrisrsquo hand and I pulled him down on the ground right behind a bush.It was not a kingfisher but something I did not expect to see in the middle of the day... an otter fishing!We managed to crawl down the slope and lie down so we would not disturbit.Whilst I was photographing the otter, I also heard a cheery pee-pee-pee and saw the kingfisher flying past the otter. What a day!Since then I have seen the otter a couple more times.The Eurasian otter is a secretive, semi-aquatic species with chocolate brown fur, webbed feet, and a powerful tail. Their thick coats are built of two layers of fur: an inner layer that works as insulation, and the outer, waterproof layer. The two-layered system prevents their skin from direct contact with water and subsequent temperature loss.Their nostrils and ears stay closed as otters swim underwater.Despite being excellent swimmers, they cannot hold their breath underwater for long periods the average time underwater is about  seconds as they e.Otters are solitary, territorial animals, that live in underground holes called lsquoholtsrsquo. The size of their territory ies and depends on the quality of the habitat, amount of food and number of possible holts.It is also known that a male otter has a larger territory that can even overlap several female ottersrsquo territories. Otters usually have a well-defined area within their grounds in which they feed, rest and breed.Seeing signs of otters is generally easier than seeing the animals themselves. If you happen to find yourself at the riverbank or a sea loch, look for five-toed footprints and otter droppings , that are left in places such as fallen trees, rocks and weirs.Spraints are easily identiable as they contain visible fish bones and have a characteristic and not particularly unpleasant smell that has been described as ranging from fish to freshly brewed jasmine tea!The otter that you may see at the coast is very often called a lsquosea otterrsquo however, this is the same species as the animals that live further inland.If you would like to share how you get on finding the otters oryou have any rare kind of wildle in your area, I would love to hear from you.Speak to you next month!zanslensfacebook zanslens instagram zans_lens twitter zans_lens"},{"url":null,"title":"tantallon-castle-john-muir-birthplace-among-attractions-reopening","story":"Historic Environment Scotlandhas confirmed that Tantallon Castle, east of North Berwick, will accept visitors with pre-booked tickets from next Friday .A phased reopening of some HES sites across the county has begun, but there is no date yet for when Dirleton Castle could reopen.Both of these county attractions closed in March when lockdown was initiated to combat the coronavirus pandemic.A statement from HES said: ldquoAfter what has felt like historyrsquos longest wait, the easing of certain lockdown restrictions means you and your family can now grab a well-earned change of scenery at a selection of our safe and secure sites.ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to welcome you back and we would like to thank you for your patience and perseverance in staying home during this pandemic.ldquoWhen you arrive at any of our reopening sites, wersquoll need to work together to make sure we are all following the rules and staying protected.Entry tickets for Tantallon Castle can now be pre-booked via the website historicenviron ment.scotWalk-up visitors without an advanced booking will not be able to gain entry.Meanwhile, in another boost for the countyrsquos residents and visitors, the museum telling the story of Dunbarrsquos most famous son has reopened its doors.The John Muir Birthplace Museum welcomed back visitors on Tuesday for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak started.The museum, on the townrsquos High Street, allows visitors to explore the le and legacy of the man recognised as the father of the US national park system, in the house where he was born.Meanwhile, further attractions are also available for visitors to see at the National Museum of Flight, East Fortune.Hangar had already been open, along with the historic airfield and the parachute store.Now, the military aviation and civil aviation hangars have also opened to the public.Lucy Casot, CEO of Museums Galleries Scotland, said: ldquoWith so many of our museums and galleries across Scotland now able to open, therersquos so much to choose from, many with wonderful outdoor spaces to enjoy with the whole family.ldquoItrsquos not just a fun day out museums and galleries have a positive impact on our social wellbeing as well as the local economy, so we are urging everyone to make a point of visiting their favourite museum or gallery.ldquoAdditionally, with many of us staycationing this year, it is a wonderful opportunity to discover more of Scotlandrsquos inspiring museums and galleries."},{"url":null,"title":"retired-musselburgh-nurse-writes-book-caring-people-dementia","story":"Dee Jenkins, , of Eskmills Road, said the main aim of the publication ndash I Remember Dementia ndash was to encourage carers of dementia patients.Born in Dublin in , Mrs Jenkins, who has lived in Musselburgh for  years, came to Scotland in  to enter a religious order, the Novitiate for the Sisters of La Sagesse, at Leuchie House, North Berwick.

Butthe free traders and corporate influencers in Westminster get their way and deregulate the law that currently governs genetic engineering there, gene edited foods could be green lighted, unlabelled, for English plates, so that most people wouldnrsquot realise that they were eating them.Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would then be put under heavy international corporate pressure to do the same.Like the old guard, now stigmatised, genetically modiedfood before it, with its unhappy history of failures to deliver and creation of new problems, such as the creation of herbicide-resistant super-weeds, proponents of gene editing spin futuristic yarns about all the miracles theyrsquore rustling up for us.Less starchy potatoes and corn, pork from super-muscly pigs, spicy tomatoes, and mushrooms that resist browning, are some front runners. In fact the mushrooms have already bypassed US Department of Agriculture regulation.How can this second wave of genetically engineered foods be a realistic prospect when the first lot were so unpopular in the UK and the EU that the general public shunned them Proponents claim that gene editing is a precise, safe technology with predictable outcomes. Sound familiar  They say that theyrsquore only making very small changes to the genetic make-up of foods, merely mimicking what might happen through natural mutation.Tellingly, they seek patents for these altered foods. Patents are only grantedyou can show an inventive step that is man-made. So claims that gene editing is simply causing changes that could happen naturally go out the window.Donrsquot worry, though, they assure us that gene editing carries no more risk than conventional breeding. In fact, there is no evidence to support this blaseacute assertion because no feeding studies have been carried out in either humans or animals.Along with scientists from around the world, I attended a briefing on gene editing led by the London-based molecular geneticist Dr Michael Antoniou. It left me deeply concerned. He flagged up the growing body of gold standard scientic research that highlights the unintended and potentially dangerous risks that gene edited foods pose. Far from being precise and predictable, these lab-based, articial interventions damage plant or animal DNA, not just at the intended site of the genetic alteration, but where.For instance, it emerged last year that a hornless bull gene edited by a Minnesota company was unintentionally contaminated by bacterial genes from another species. https:www.technologyreview     recombinetics-gene-edited-hornless-cattle-major-dna-screwup Gene editing alters how genes , which can create new allergens and toxins. The European Network of Scientists for Social and Environmental Responsibility ndash  leading international scientists ndash has expressed grave concerns. They say that the radical nature of gene edited changes could result in ldquounexpectedly high levels of known toxins, or even in the creation of novel ones.So, the bottom line here is that therersquos a push to slip gene edited food ingredients into our food, unlabelled, most likely sneakily lost in multi-ingredient, ultra-processed foods, on the assumption that they pose no risk. So far, the general public is blissfully unaware of it.To ensure public safety and the integrity of the food we eat, its absolutely vital that all ingredients from gene edited crops, plants, or farm animals, be subjected to risk assessment of the most stringent nature.These novel creations must be tightly regulated, with track and trace systems in place so that in the case of a genetically engineered public health disaster, retailers can put out effective product recalls.Most crucially, gene edited food must be clearly labelled as genetically modied so that we can choose for ourselveswersquore prepared to eat it.

But hold on! Is this really because they are women  Irsquom not a massive fan of generalisations because they lead to stereotypes. I mean, Irsquom a woman who takes an hour to decide what to watch on Netflix, who stares in food-envy at fellow-dinersrsquo meal choices in restaurants, and who, more than once, has been told to remove my rose-tinted specs.Whilst it does look as though countries with female leaders, on the whole, were quicker to lock-down and have been more risk averse when it comes to peoplersquos lives ndash Germany, New Zealand, and Taiwan come to mind as having had far fewer Covid deaths than male-led countries such as the US, Brazil, UK or India, it doesnrsquot explain male-led countries like Greece, for example where Covid deaths remained relatively low.Who can forget Boris Johnsonrsquos ill-fated declaration that hersquod been to a hospital where there were coronavirus patients and he had shaken everyonersquos hand. In the Philippines, which had one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in south east Asia, President Duterte told police and military to take matters into their own hands when dealing with lockdown breakers: ldquoShoot them dead...Do you understand  Dead. None of these are words we could imagine tumbling from current women leadersrsquo mouths.Instead, women like Jacinda Ardern, Angela Merkel and, latterly, after an arguable initial hesitancy, Nicola Sturgeon, have taken a more active listening approach. Taking advice from experts, collaborating with colleagues and, importantly, keeping the ego firmly in check, these leaders were honest and clear from the start. Whilst many world leaders were playing the threat down, Merkel told Germans that % of the population might be affected and that it would be Germanyrsquos biggest challenge since the Second World War.Ardernrsquos early motto was: ldquoWe must go hard and we must go early. In January, in Taiwan, President Tsai Ing-Wen introduced strict travel restrictions and quarantine controls for passengers entering from high-risk areas, resulting in just under  deaths in a country of nearly  million. But despite my strong impulse to declare womanhood to be the reason for this, the truth is maybe a little more prosaic. Perhaps being women simply predisposes them to having certain qualities required for good leadership ndash strong communication skills, empathy, honesty and trust. The aforementioned men are just sadly lacking in those.Leaders who were more risk averse at the thought of many deaths and who therefore took decisions to shut down whole economies will now be tested as economies begin to open up again.

Physically he was also tall and handsome, totally imperturbable, probably from having faced the worst. He was someone whose best qualities most of us would strive to emulate, and fail. Branwen described him as her rock. He was.I saw him last in February in Glasgow, we went for a drink or two in the Doublet on the edge of his native Partick, then to the Shish Mahal for a curry, where we planned the trip we would never take. The original one, viewed from now, had its moments of high farce.He had told his family that he was going grape-picking in France, instead he was travelling to Paris on a single ticket and a handful of change to pick up explosives to deliver to comrades in Madrid who were planning to blow up Franco and his cabinet on a dais at Real Madridrsquos Bernabeacuteu stadium. The only French he knew was zut alors, which amused his anarchist hosts, and his Spanish was non-existent. He was to wear a bandage on his hand so his contact could recognise him and he had to be taught a phrase ndash me duele la manondash as a coded response.He set out to the south with the plastic explosive taped to his body, hitchhiking and wearing a kilt so that hersquod get lts, which led to reports in the Argentine press that a Scottish transvestite had tried to kill the Caudillo. His last lt in France broke down just short of the Spanish border and Stuart had to push the car across, sweating and hoping the plastic would hold firm, under the gaze of the Guardia Civil in their shiny, patent, three-cornered hats.The mission had been infiltrated by an informer and when Stuart handed over the package to Fernando Carballo Blanco, a carpenter who was constructing the dais and would place the charges, they were swooped on. It was August , A Hard Dayrsquos Night was top of the hit parade and Alec Douglas-Home was Prime Minster, doing economics with matches. The two were convicted on September  in a brief trial before a military tribunal, Blanco given  years.It was undoubtedly international pressure and publicity that deterred the lsquocourtrsquo from passing the customary death sentence for lsquoterrorismrsquo, which was then carried out by garrotte, the medieval process of neck-breaking in a slow mechanical strangulation by a metal collar and a bolt through the neck.Stuart was mildly roughed-up by Francorsquos secret police but he was forced to watch his co-conspirator brutally tortured. Blancorsquos father had been shot and murdered by Francorsquos forces for being a trade unionist, driving his mother mad with grief and ending in an asylum. Although Stuart was released after just less than four years after an appeal by his mother, Blanco served  years. When I was contacted by his niece last week she denied that he had been a hero. ldquoHe just wanted to free the Spanish people, she said.Franco was an unapologetic fascist and dictator who led the overthrow of the Republican government, precipitating the civil war, with the blood of many thousands, and not just combatants, on his hands. As he put it: ldquoOur regime is based on bayonets and blood, not on hypocritical elections.Stuartrsquos memory of the show trial, conducted in Spanish of course which he could not then understand, was of  army officers, heavy with medals, swords on the table in front of them, comprising what passed for a jury in a large, sticky, vaulted room. He said he felt he had been transported into the final act of some grand opera. ldquoI was  years and six weeks old, a boy from working-class Glasgow and Irsquod never been to the opera, he remembered.He learned Spanish in the Carabanchel jail and sat A-levelsand was sent money regularly from Britain but also from Spanish anarchists. The only English names they seemed to know were John, Paul, George and Ringo, so the donations turned up in these names and the authorities thought he was being funded by the Beatles.He was released in , got work as a gas fitter as Britain was converting to North Sea gas and inadvertently almost blew up a large part of Essex when he was unable to stop a massive gas leak.In , after having been arrested and spending  months in jail on remand, Stuart was acquitted of being a member of the Angry Brigade, which had carried out a series of casualty-less explosions against Edward Heathrsquos government. He claimed, and the jury believed him, that the police had planted two detonators in his car. One of the four of the convicted Stoke Newington Eight, John Barker, said later about his own experience, ldquoThe police fitted-up a guilty man.Two years later Stuart and I holidayed in a remote cottage up a narrow, pebbled track outside Oban, where we walked, talked and sank a few malts in the evening round a roaring fire. At the same time a Francoist banker had been kidnapped by an anarchist group and a ransom paid. When Stuart ed to London he was warned by a friendly Special Branch officer that he wasnrsquot safe and should get out of town, which he did with his we Brenda, first to Yorkshire and then the remote Orkney island of Sanday, to a house called Over the Water.Then, the island might have been some prototype of an anarchist society, in that it was peacefully,bibulously, self-governing, with only an occasional police presence coming in by ferry from the mainland, the officersrsquo travel well telegraphed. Irsquom not sure anyone there bothered with car insurance. On one occasion a man was arrested for alleged drunk driving, the local doctor refused to test him and by the time the coppers had somehow managed to hire a boat and take him to the main island he was sober.I visited him and Brenda often, and many an evening was spent in the Kettletoft Hotel bar, often with instruments and a sing-song going, irregardless of conventional closing time, until the last patron exited. On one occasion two bold officers turned up and insisted that the bar was cleared at pm, to the considerable ire and disgruntlement of those of us who considered the evening was just beginning.There was a party to go to and Stuart and some others light-heartedly berated the two policemen now sitting in a car outside with the windows down. While he and they kept the officers occupied someone crept round the back of the car and let the tyres down.We sped off waving.Stuart and Brenda spent seven years on Sanday, Branwen was born there, and from the island he launched his publishing house the Cienfuegos Press , a major publisher of anarchist literature, and a radical newspaper, the Free-Winged Eagle. The local minister of course denounced him as the ldquoanti-Christ.Stuart Christie was born in Partick to a hairdresser and a hard-drinking trawlerman, Albert. He was named Stuart after Bonnie Prince Charlie, ldquothe only man in history to be called after three separate sheepdogs, according to fellow Partiquois Billy Connolly. When he was six his parents went to friends for a drink, his dad was given a glass of sherry which he looked at in disgust, poured down the sink and walked out the door without saying a word. ldquoThe joke was that he had gone for a packet of fags, but thatrsquos the last time we saw him until he turned up  years later, Christie recalls.By then Stuart had a half-sister, Olivia. But the formative influence on him had been his granny Agnes McCulloch Davis, with whom he did most of his growing up on Arran and in Glasgow. He described her as the moral barometer in his le, ldquoand she provided the star I followed. She kept me on the straight and narrow. Well, with a few well-publicised detours!His partial autobiography, a compilation of three self-published volumes, was appropriately called Granny Made Me An Anarchist, in which many of the truths are told. Itrsquos a rollicking account peppered with cultural and political reference points, from the Jeely Piece Song, to Leslie Howard, Buntildeuel and Just William. Itrsquos also extremely funny.He also wrote a trilogy of novels iexclPistoleros! The Chronicles of Farquar McHarg, about a fictional Scottish anarchist born in  who became involved in the Spanish civil war, which weaves in actual happenings and some of the principal villains of the time. Stuart also managed to pack in a degree in history and politics along the way.Brenda Christie died in June last year, nursed by her husband and earlier this year Stuart moved to Colchester to be near daughter Branwen and her girls, his granddaughters Merri and Mo, for too short a time. He had previously fought cancer, this time it was lung cancer which spread to the bone. His suffering was mercully short.Irsquove been with him when hersquos been introduced to people and occasionally the response would be, ldquoNot that Stuart Christie !

The result was prices stabilised and any increases were modest.The converse of that scenario is a reduction in interest rates to encourage spending and investment, which is where we are today.

Irsquom sure both Mr Gove and Mr Galloway will forgive meI suggest that, for some, the identity of Auld Nick in this esoteric coupling may be subject to perpetual speculation.The Twitter alliance of these seemingly irreconcilable political foes has been born of mounting Unionist fears over the break up of the United Kingdom. Two more opinion polls this week continued an extended recent trend in favour of independence with one indicating an all-time high of % for Yes.Mr Gove, unofficial minister for the Union Jack in Boris Johnsonrsquos hard-right cabinet, has thus been seeking cross-party allies for what is likely to be Britainrsquos last imperial battle. According to the London Times, he has already held discussions with Lord McConnell of Glenscorrodaleand Danny Alexander, the former Liberal-Democrat chief secretary to the Treasury.When Mr Galloway, leader of the Workers Party of Great Britain, suggested this week that the ldquo, Scots living where in the UK must have a vote in the second referendum on independence Mr Gove replied ldquointeresting question. Mr Galloway at least possesses that rare commodity in British politics: principles.He might well have enjoyed a stellar career near the top of British politics were it not for his habit of reminding assorted Labour leaders how to spell S-O-C-I-A-L-I-S-T. Presumably, hersquoll defend his present dalliance with Mr Gove, a man who once apologised for participating in a strike, on the grounds that nationalism in whatever form is the enemy of international socialism. Butyour beliefs drive you into a camp led by one who has built his career abjuring everything you hold to be dear then perhaps you might ask yourself what it was you thought you were fighting for all this time.Mr Goversquos fireside chats with the laird of Glencorrosdaleare much easier to understand. Lord McConnell and his brother Labour barons were chiefly responsible for reducing Labour in Scotland to its current status of Holder of the Jaikets. In this wretched period the party has come to be defined not by its commitment to the communities that once nurtured it but by its alliance with the Conservative and Unionist Party.Irsquom also intrigued by Mr Gallowayrsquos late attempt to gerrymander the boundaries for a future referendum. In the six years since the last independence referendum Unionists have cited the ldquopeople of Scotland in their claims of a once-in-a-generation event. Irsquom interested to know by what geographical contortion an address in Dorset can now be considered to be ldquoof Scotland.Letrsquos leave aside for the moment concerns about being over-optimistic at the shiny Yes numbers. As Irsquove suggested previously, we are living in abnormal times when the usual scrutiny of a partyrsquos domestic policy record has been suspended. And be in no doubt, when the second independence referendum does begin the British state will deploy every artice and lever at its disposal to maintain Westminster rule.Itrsquos now apparent, though, that the Yes cause is building momentum over a prolonged period of time. It would be tempting to ascribe this merely to Nicola Sturgeonrsquos lsquopresentationalrsquo skills and Boris Johnsonrsquos lack of them. Certainly, it would be foolish not to acknowledge that the First Ministerrsquos leadership has been a factor in the recent numbers for independence. If you can trust the nationrsquos leader when a pandemic threatens your existence then trusting her when she makes the economic and cultural cause for independence would not seem to be the massive leap it was in .There is something  at play here. Itrsquos become clear that from the lived experience of coronavirus has sprung a desire for profound and lasting societal change at many levels. One of the strongest suits of Better Together in  was the perception of stability. Many who had seriously considered voting for independence ultimately recoiled from taking a step into the unknown and a future uncertain. But when our immediate andlong-term future is wreathed in uncertainty the perceived risks of self-determination recede a little.During the five months of lockdown many have found that those institutions they once looked to for security and stability have let them down or revealed to have been a mirage. They have seen officials at the top of the Westminster Government recklessly disregard lockdown restrictions with impunity and disregard for the safety of the nation. They have come to discover that being locked out of Britainrsquos affluence means you are three times likelier to die of Covid- than those you entrusted with your health and wellbeing.From the outset of this pandemic they have witnessed the worst excesses of the capitalist system that gives oxygen to the forces now telling them to preserve the Union at any cost. They now know that those who always tell them ldquowe are all in it together wasted no time in saying ldquoyoursquore on your own when super-rich shareholders demanded redundancies to protect their idends. At the first hint of trouble after years of massive profits the lowest-paid workers were first to be thrown overboard. And they know too that lsquoemergency fundingrsquo means large quantities of cash being handed to the families and friends of UK ministers for sub-standard protective equipment and no questions asked.Britain during coronavirus has been exposed as a vicious little gangster state and this is what George Galloway and Lord McConnell are being duped into defending.

Expanding the swept area of the turbine to a -metre rotor diameter means an almost an % increase on swept area on its predecessor. That has a big effect on reducing costs of electricity for the turbine, he adds.In October  Orbital opened a pound million crowd funding debenture on the London-based Abundance Investment  to support building the O, a m-long floating superstructure with two MW turbines at either side and a rated power output of MW.The technology, he says, is unique to Orbital Marine: ldquoMost people are familiar with the concept of an underwater wind turbine but from day one we saw a dferent solution, one thatrsquos more akin to constructing and anchoring a boat with the signicant cost and risk benefits that result from taking that approach.The first O, which will be operational next year, is being constructed in Dundee drawing on a supply chain that spans Scotland, the UK and Europe ndash with bearing systems from Sweden and Germany, anchors from Wales, composite rotors from England ndash but Scotland plays the leading role.Most of the turbine manufacture is being done by TEXO Fabrication in Dundee, with the fabrication process using steel from Liberty Steel Dalzell in Motherwell as well as utilising many of the traditional engineering and industrial capabilities within Scotland.Itrsquos something Scott is proud of. ldquoTidal stream energy has very much been a Scottish-led endeavour and thatrsquos logical given the industrial and engineering heritage we have here, from shipbuilding to oil and gas. itrsquos natural to seize the opportunity to ersy those skills into an industry with similar requirements and operations.

Unlike many AI voices, it has been given a gender-neutral, north east of England accent.Verena Rieser, Professor in Computer Science at Heriot-Watt University, where researchers will look into methods employed to build conversational agents, said: ldquoWhen people think of Amazonrsquos Alexa, they probably imagine a woman, perhaps in some sort of secretarial position.ldquoWe are askingthey have to be female and so human-like ldquoThen there is the behaviour of these systems when they are asked something thatrsquos not appropriate.ldquoThe danger is that when people interact with these systems they may reinforce gender stereotypes: you are talking to a woman, insulting her and yet she is not even pushing back.The three-year study will involve research on the psychological impacts of the AI voices to be carried out by researchers at Strathclyde University and which will analyse what messages the female AI voices convey and how they might influence behaviour.While a digital education element will also be carried out by researchers at Edinburgh University, which will look at how AI systems are constructed.ldquoWe are interested in finding out why these systems are the way they are andit stems from the fact that the people who build them are not a very erse workforce, added Prof. Rieser.Amazon has previously said test users responded most strongly to a female voice for its Alexa assistant. Microsoft has also said it found a female voice best embodied the qualities expected of a digital assistant ndash helpful, supportive and trustworthy.Meanwhile Google has said that it planned to use a male voice for its assistant, but the technology responded better to a higher pitched female format. Last year it introduced  dferent voices in an effort to introduce more ersity.However, itrsquos possible that the AI voice of the future could be less obliging young secretary and a little more CP.Prof. Rieser added: ldquoThe argument in the original UNESCO report says we dont have to make them human voices, and they could be much more clearly robotic.ldquoBut then,you make them too robotic, does that make them creepy Designing a Feminist Alexa ndash An Exercise in Empathic Design on Thursday, August , is part of the RSE Curious summer programme."},{"url":null,"title":"back-business-aberfoyle","story":"Aberfoyle was celebrating a revival in its fortunes with a host of fledgling businesses opening up, For Sale signs taken down from the main thoroughfare and a booming number of visitors ing to the once forgotten former tourist mecca.A year later, little could those new businesses have imagined the turbulence they were about to face. With Covid  challenging even the most well established companies, how could the new kids on the block cope \"The roof fell in,\" is how Bob Taylor describes it.He and his we had just launched Maggies Aberfoyle Kitchen in Main Street in June  and thought the toughest challenge for them would be the businesses surviving its first winter when the leblood tourist trade dries up in the Stirlingshire village.\"Everything obviously fell apart in March and we struggled in the early days,\" he said. \"We were allowed to stay open because we are a food shop but we decided to close as it was quite scary here. People were still coming - it was like a Bank Holiday weekend on some days. People were still travelling.\"In the early days of the lockdown businesses relied on local support wherever they could.\"In April, we opened for two days a week - Friday and Saturday,\" Mr Taylor said.\"Maggie was on her own, the staff were furloughed. We relied on locals - they were fantastic and kept us going in spirits as well as financially. This is Maggies baby and there was no way she would let it go. She would have slept in itshe had to!\"Nick Green opened Aberfoyle Bike Hire three years ago in a former butchers shop.He has watched the progression in the recovery of the village during his time there, he said.\"Its been getting busier since I moved here,\" he said. \"Last summer was very busy and the main street was in a good condition.\"His business has been more fortunate than perhaps some others - as a bike shop he was allowed to remain open all the time and, as well documented, cycling has enjoyed something of a resurgence during the pandemic.\"We were doing a lot of repairs for locals at the start,\" he said. \"From the start of lockdown there was an upsurge in cycling which has been universal across the country.\"Despite the initial pause in trading in the first few weeks, he believes businesses adapted and those that would have catered for tourists offered services to locals instead.And, far from seeing new businesses as struggling to cope with Covid more than established ones, he thinks it could have worked to their advantage.\"I dont think Aberfoyle was any harder hit by Covid than where - I think the businesses in the main street are quite well founded even though they may be in their first years,\" he said. \"In fact, with businesses being quite new its been helpful because they are flexible and can adapt more easily.\"In the early stages of lockdown businesses that would have served tourists refocused on the local community.\"\"Local people definitely made an effort to support businesses and vice versa. Businesses stepped up to help vulnerable people and thats nice to see. We donated one of our bikes to someone who was volunteering to pick up prescriptions. There was a positive atmosphere.\"He said there had been increasing anxiety when more people started arriving but you have to balance that with the reality that Aberfoyle relies on visitors.As more family visitors started arriving when lockdown lted the anti-social behaviour and littering that had plagued the village earlier on had eased, he said.The past five or six weeks have seen something of a revival for Aberfoyle with an influx of English tourists.\"There were definitely more tourists from England than normal,\" he said. \"We are not getting the normal bus tour traffic which has always been a source of visitors but we have been getting a lot of families from the UK who are having their holidays here.\"Perhaps the staycation trend will be repeated in future years. Hopefully thats something we can capitalise on.\"Trevor Geraghty, chairman of the local Strathard Community Council, said that, in some ways, lockdown had boosted local businesses and the local community.He said people were essentially forced to shop locally much more than they ever had and that certain shops in Aberfoyle - including the Co-op, pharmacy and the butchers - had thrived in the early stages of lockdown.\"In remote areas you typically have workers commuting to bigger cities - and they do their shopping on their commute. The Post Office here became a massive leline and had more to do than they ever had,\" he said. \"There was tons of community spirit - Intrepidco-ordinated collections of stuff for a homeless charity in Glasgow, for example.\"He admitted that businesses badly affected where were naturally similarly affected in Aberfoyle but said locals made an effort to support local businesses once the lockdown started to ease. \"There were absolutely some businesses that did well and probably better than normal in terms of the local community making up, in some way, for the [tourism] drop in businesses,\" he added.\"And with people spending more time in their communities [earlier in lockdown] it opened their eyes as to what is on their doorstep - cycles they might never have done, or trails they havent explored.\"With a new Co-op to take over the vacant garden centre site on Main Street, the anchor project signals things are still on the up in Aberfoyle, he said. \"Its not easy [post Covid], but its not all grim.\"Local councillor Martin Earl said you could be forgiven for thinking these past few months would have dealt a blow from which such places would struggle to recover from.The truth was far from it, he said. \"The community spirit, support for local businesses and the determination to pull on through is what we have seen in spades,\" he added. \"Aberfoyle, its people and the businesses it supports is in good shape and is going to get better and better. Responsible visitors are welcome and always will be.\"Across in Maggies Aberfoyle Kitchen, business is now booming and the shop has opened seven days a week for the past three weeks.\"We are getting a lot of visitors from all over the UK,\" Mr Taylor said. \"Last weekend was the busiest day of the year so far.

When protesters took to the streets of Belarus two weeks ago over the disputed election result that saw authoritarian president Alexander Lukashenko claim a sixth term, the security forcesrsquo crackdown was uncompromising.Undaunted, the people of Belarus continue to protest in unprecedented numbers, refusing to be cowed by state violence. According to Lukashenko, these are attempts to orchestrate a coup.But the question many are now asking is whether what we are witnessing is the beginning of another ldquocolour revolution, one with the potential to topple the post-Soviet ruler Speaking on Friday, Belarusian opposition politician Svetlana Tikhanovskaya who was forced to leave Belarus right after the vote, said she wouldto the country when she felt it was safe to do so.At a news conference in Lithuania, Tikhanovskaya said the people of Belarus wanted a new election to be held that would be free and fair. If events in the Belarusian capital Minsk these past days are any indicator, then Tikhanovskayarsquos assessment of what many of her fellow countrymen and women want is correct.Just when, though, it would be safe for the opposition leader toto Belarus, perhaps injecting fresh impetus into opposition protests, is another matter entirely.Earlier on Thursday, the Belarusian authorities opened a criminal probe against opposition activists who set up what it called a Co-ordination Council to negotiate the transition of power.The Belarusian prosecutor generalrsquos office said the creation of the council violated the constitution and opened a criminal inquiry against its founders on charges of threatening national security.ldquoThe creation and the activities of the Co-ordination Council are aimed at seizing power and inflicting damage to the national security, prosecutor general Alexander Konyuk was quoted as saying by the Associated Press.The council consists of top associates of Tikhanovskaya as well as rights activists and representatives of striking workers. It also includes the nationrsquos most famous author, Svetlana Alexievich, who won the  Nobel Prize in Literature.In tandem with the criminal probe, the regime has again also beefed up a security presence on the streets of the capital, blocking access to some government buildings and deploying police and paramilitaries in numbers outside major factories where workers have been on strike since early last week.ldquoThere should no longer be any disorder in Minsk of any kind, Lukashenko instructed his security officials, indicating he has no intention of backing down from his -year rule, one of the worldrsquos longest.ldquoPeople are tired. People demand peace and quiet, Lukashenko added. He also confirmed that border controls had been tightened to prevent an influx of ldquofighters and arms, again implying that some kind of armed coup attempt was in the making.One challenge Lukashenko is undoubtedly facing though has come from sections of the countryrsquos state-controlled media on whom the autocrat has long relied to shape public opinion. In the past week, hundreds of employees of state television have gone on strike. Journalists from the leading state-owned daily newspaper, Zvyazda, also joined their broadcast colleagues and put out a statement demanding an end to censorship.Vyacheslav Lomonosov, one of the Belarusian TV employees who joined the strike, said he and his colleagues could no longer tolerate an official ban on reporting the truth about the regimersquos crackdown on protestersldquoThere are people killed, raped, thousands are protesting, while theyrsquore saying everythingrsquos fine in the country and nothing is going on, said Lomonosov.ldquoIt canrsquot be like that, people need to get the truth from TV, the Associated Press reported him as saying.In the first days of the protests following the election, security forces and police deliberately targeted journalists from independent Belarusian news outlets and foreign media, detaining scores, beating some of them, damaging their equipment, and seizing memory cards.Boris Goretsky, vice-president of the Belarusian Association of Journalists, confirmed the  journalists were detained while covering the protests.But it has been ordinary Belarusians who have borne the brunt of the crackdown with at least three reported killed and over , arrested.According to human rights organisations, the fates of many remain unknown two weeks after the election, feeding fears that the authorities are deliberately covering up severe injuries, or worse, carried out by the security forces.Online search services have been organised to help families locate their missing loved ones, according to Radio Free Europe  Radio Liberty RFE RL.One of them, launched by the popular independent media outlet Tut.by with the title Have You Seen This Person  enables people to post images and information about the missing and the circumstances of their disappearance so readers can contribute information or assistance in the search.People can also turn to the Angel Search and Rescue Squad, a non-profit group set up in  that describes itself as the first volunteer movement in Belarus. Its Facebook page features a hotline for readers to call with information about missing iniduals.Last week, RFE RL cited one report by the Angel group posted August  on Facebook. It concerned missing museum director, -year-old Kanstantsin Shyshmakou, who the group says was found dead by members of its team, though it provided no other details of the circumstances.Shyshmakou is said to have been one of two members of his local election commission in the southwestern Belarusian city of Vawkavysk, who refused to sign off on the results of the August  election vote.The Belarus police and Interior Ministry have questioned the veracity of such accounts provided online. In a statement, ministry spokeswoman Volha Chamadanova insisted that such information often turns out to be inaccurate.ldquoThe criminal police of the Interior Ministry have checked the information regarding more than  participants of the unsanctioned ralliesthat has been published on the website Tut.by and in ious social networks, Chamadanova wrote.ldquoThis information is not fully accurate: many of these citizens have been found at home, while the information about them is not removed in a timely fashion from these internet resources.But last week, in accounts given to Deutsche Welle , the German public international broadcaster, several Belarusian women detailed their harrowing experiences during detention and accused the authorities of inflicting torture.One of the women, Olga Pavlova, was a campaign staffer for opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya and was detained for five days. In an interview with DW, Pavlova describes how she was put into a van, filled with other people detained, and sent to prison.ldquoThe men were immediately beaten. There was a Russian woman with us. She demanded access to the Russian ambassador, but she was taken into a neighbouring cell and beaten. They told her she would neverhome, Pavlova recounted.She described how she ended up in a cell designed for four but was packed with  people. When the prisoners asked for a window to be opened, two buckets of water were dumped on them. Those in the cell, she says, nearly suffocated on the evaporating moisture. One of the prisoners suffered from epilepsy, another from diabetes, the DW interview cited her as saying. Pavlova herself had been injured by rubber bullets and stun grenades while working to provide first aid to protesters on the streets.Faced with such intimidation and given what many say is the lack of clarity about what to do next, some observers believe the opposition movement could be seriously undermined. Others point to signs that the momentum of factory and industrial strikes could be waning.According to Sergey Dylevskiy who represents strikers at the giant Minsk tractor plant , about % of workers at the plant are on strike. The rest are too afraid to leave their jobs and support the movement, he said.But other opposition activists insist the lack of any centralised leadership is not a weakness. ldquoWersquore witnessing a unique situation when protests are decentralised and spontaneous, Maria Kolesnikova, a prominent opposition figure told the BBC in Minsk.ldquoI wouldnrsquot say that in order to continue the protests, we must have a leader.Without a clear figurehead, however, it remains uncertain whether the opposition can effectively mobilise those that take to the streets. It raises question, too, whether what we are witnessing is indeed another ldquocolour revolution on a par, say, with what happened in Ukraine.Some regional watchers are wary of such comparisons.ldquoMany commentators are comparing the situation in Belarus to Ukrainersquos Orange and Maidan revolutions in   and  respectively, insists Carl Bildt, former prime minister of Sweden who also previously served as the UNrsquos special envoy for the Balkans. ldquoBut Belarus is not Ukraine, and nor is it particularly helpful to apply the Maidan model to the scene playing out in Minsk and other Belarusian cities and towns.Writing in a recent article for the Australian Strategic Policy Institute , Bildt highlights how the Maidan movement was a direct response to the Ukrainian governmentrsquos attempt to abandon the cause of European integration and reform.The revolutionaries there openly mobilised under the banner of the European Union. In Belarusrsquos case, says Bildt, domestic concerns are clearly playing the ldquomore salient role, and questions about the countryrsquos orientation vis-a-vis Europe or Russia are almost totally absent.Rather than draw parallels with Ukraine, in Belarusrsquos case, Bildt points to the situation being analogous with Armenia in spring  when mass demonstrations led to the resignation there of longtime president Serzh Sargsyan and inaugurated a new democratic era for the country.But other players are closely watching what is unfolding in Belarus, not least Russia and its president Vladimir Putin, himself no fan of colour revolutions and who has warned European leaders against ldquounacceptable meddling in the political crisis in Belarus.Last week, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov reiterated Moscowrsquos intention of protecting its influence over its longtime client state.ldquoWhat is happening in Belarus worries us very muchthinsp ...No-one is making a secret of the fact that this is about geopolitics, the fight for the post-Soviet space, Lavrov insisted.In all, Russia faces a bit of a dilemma over Belarus. That quandary was summed up on Thursday in a Financial Times article that asked the crucial questions as to how Moscow can ldquomaintain control when the dust settles, and through who .This is complicated further by the fact that while relations between Lukashenko and Putin have often been strategic, they have not exactly always been cordial.ldquoThe best option for the Kremlin now is not to sit and wait but to prepare for and manage a succession away from Lukashenko to a regime that would rely, in electoral terms, on the pro-Russian majority of Belarus, was how Dmitri Trenin, head of think tank the Carnegie Moscow Centre summed up the possible way forward for the Kremlin to the FT.But right now, of course, Belarus is not the only thing on Moscowrsquos mind. There is also the outcry over the alleged poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, a foe of Putin and a campaigner against corruption who has arrived in Germany from Siberia for treatment.Back in Belarus though it is the standoff between the regime and opposition that all eyes are focused on. As its stands, some see Lukashenko as having three options.One is wearing down the opposition through intimidation and arrests, though on that front he appears up against it given the scale of protests.Second, he could resort to martial law. Last but not least, he might call on Moscowrsquos help. Which course of action he takes will in great part be determined by what the opposition does next and that remains a dficult call for those on the streets of Minsk.ldquoI think that every person in our country feels fear and is scared now, said Svetlana Tikhanovskaya at a press conference in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius on Friday. ldquoBut it is our mission to step further over our fear and move further, she pleaded to supporters.The question now. however, is whether Tikhanovskaya herself is prepared to do just that andto Belarus. Either way this crisis is only just getting started."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"August ,  at : pmOrkney#s care experienced young people and looked after children are set to benefit from £, of funding from the Scottish Government.

Reasons for objection included:After a y discussion, councillors chose to reject the application. This decision was led by Kirkwall East councillor, David Dawson, who was seconded by West Mainland councillor, Owen Tierney. The reasoning given for this was that the application proposed an extension which extended beyond the quarry#s defined mineral safeguard area, which Councillor Dawson and his colleagues felt was not justied. It was also felt that this extension would result in cumulative adverse impacts to residents living in nearby properties.Though this rejection was unanimously agreed by the planning committee, Kirkwall East councillor, John Ross Scott, formally lodged his objection to the decision taken by members after it had been made.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Unlike student nurses and midwives, however, those training to be a paramedic are not eligible for a bursary, despite being unable to take up part time work.  To add insult to injury, their counterparts in England do receive bursaries.“This lack of a level playing field risks putting off those we need to see coming into our health service.  The current arrangements do little to encourage young people to pursue a career as a paramedic and store up problems for the future.“When I wrote to the Health Secretary recently on behalf of a constituent, I was told the government has no plans to review the funding options for trainee paramedics. Today, Nicola Sturgeon said she would look into the matter, having also been approached by a young constituent, angry at the unequal treatment.“The First Minister needs to recognise that introducing a bursary scheme would make a real dference, not least in widening access to the profession.  It’s time the Scottish Government properly recognised the dedication of our trainee paramedics by putting them on the same footing as trainee nurses and midwives.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

On the Pentland Firth, people are still being forced to pay over the odds.“COVID has inevitably created challenges, but even prior to the pandemic there seemed to be little urgency from the Scottish Government to deliver on its promise.

Cànan, ‘S na DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

The rest were reduced by a single grade and she has missed out on As in English, Biology and Modern Studies, as well as a C in Higher Chemistry.Eva said to have her grades knocked down so signicantly has made her “completely reconsider her career path”.Exams were cancelled this year because of Covid- and replaced with estimated grades based on past attainment, and the school’s previous exam record.The modelling system adapted by the Scottish Qualications Authority reduced the grades of around , results, with analysis suggesting youngsters from poorer backgrounds and historically poorer performing schools suffered disproportionately.In her letter, shared almost , times on Twitter, Eva said that “it was clear” that her grades had been signicantly adjusted “because I go to a school classed as underperforming”.Her letter calls for the system, which she describes as discriminatory, to be urgently investigated, adding: “The government has been pushing the ‘no wrong path slogan’ but why should pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds and deprived areas be forced into a pathway they didn’t want and worked tirelessly to avoid”.Eva had been predicted in her fourth year to achieve  As and two Cs at national five level, but in her exams she improved to come out with five As and a B.She added that her school’s recent performance had been affected by staff shortages.She had stayed behind after school for extra tuition, aiming to secure a university place and a career in the field of medicine.“Any further efforts by pupils to achieve higher grades in schools which have historically underperformed has been disregarded, she added.“SQA results this year have been more about fitting the statistical trends than the inidual pupil.”According to the Scottish Government#s own statistics, the estimated . per cent of most deprived pupils who would have expected an A-C band at Higher was lowered to . per cent by the SQA#s moderation system.

But what of other aspects What of community resilience, something I suspect will barely register as a priority for most us when deciding on our weekly shop It may be the case that more people will try and grow more of their own food and local produce will, hopefully, be in greater demand.All very welcome. But what’s really needed is a completely fresh approach to our behaviour as consumers.As the pound in our pocket becomes ever more stretched we need to value it in terms of what benefit it can bring to the wider collective # who can it support, what should it support and how can that can bring about greater resilience within our own communities.It’s not radical or revolutionary. It’s just about taking a bit more time and effort to think about where best to spend our cash, especially when it comes to our most basic of needs.It can’t possibly make sense to get your Sunday roast from the supermarketthe same cut of meat is available at your local butcher at a comparable price . And especiallythat butcher has sourced his meat from the crofter down the road.It takes a bit of extra effort to call in at the butcher, for sure, but add in important elements like food miles and provenance and there really is no excuse, except for our own inherent laziness.It has always amazed me how there is any fish at all on the shelves of supermarkets in this part of the world when the local fishmongers offer far higher quality at a lower price.And, in any case, it’s now perfectly possible to buy direct from the fisherman, with many of them now offering sales to the public.That may have come about through the closure of their overseas markets during lockdown, but what better example of necessity being the mother of invention.If west-coast prawns were coveted by sophisticated palates on the Mediterranean, then they should be more than adequate for consumption a bit closer to home.It’s not that long ago that our communities were completely self-reliant in food.We do demand a more discerning choice these days # no-one would want toto a diet made up entirely of fish, mutton and potatoes.But, with an abundance of quality produce on our own doorstep, surely it makes sense to take more advantage of that and in the process create greater community resilience through sourcing from independent, local retailers.If there’s a downside to that approach, I fail to see it.ONE aspect that looks certain to change, certainly for the foreseeable, is that there will be less air travel.Through the lockdown it is estimated that carbon emissions have been reduced by over  per cent by planes being grounded alone.That’s not even taking account of reductions in car journeys and it is a staggering figure from just one simple change.There are certain elements in the environmental lobby who would have you believe that methane emissions from cattle make a signicant contribution to climate change.Never mind that bovineshave roamed the land for thousands of years without causing much harm.Never mind that it’s only the last  or  years, as our economy became ever reliant on fossil fuels, that the damage to our planet has been made.The reduction in air travel will be for economic, more than environmental, reasons.But the staggering statistics of these last few months should at least mean that when it comes to a real determination in tackling environmental damage the finger of blame will be pointed in the right direction.Then again, maybe cows are a much easier target."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3301349.jpg--.jpg?1597840898000\n","title":"cullybckey volunteers praised","story":"Volunteers from Cullybackey Community Partnershipwere presented with a certicate from Mayor Councillor Peter Johnston recently to recognise their efforts during this Covid- pandemic.CCP volunteers stepped up to the mark through a number of dferent initiatives to help those most vulnerable in the area in recent months.One of those was the delivery of food parcels to those both in the village and those in outlying rural areas.

An employee at Danske Bank was even disinfecting a cash machine. People had a mixed reaction to the tightened guidelines, and whether the PSNI can or will enforce them.Judith Dickson from the town said she was worried about the rise in Covid- cases in the area but said it#s all our own fault.I think the guidelines will be enforcedthey can andthe police have the manpower, but I don#t think they do, she said. It#s up to people to report it but I don#t think they will.Gavin McCandless, who lives on the outskirts of the town, felt the temporary measures were necessary to keep everyone safe.Meanwhile, Sam Cree, who said he had the virus as far back as January, was in no doubt that a second wave was on its way.After developing a dry cough and losing his sense of taste and smell, Mr Cree was convinced he contracted Covid- but said he has fully recovered.He added that Mr Swann was correct in bringing down the gathering restrictions but was not impressed with the number of people visiting pubs.I just think there will be a second wave and people will have to learn to wear their masks going into shops, he said.Charlotte Weir and her friend Beverley Connor were much more critical of Stormont#s politicians and the PSNI in how they have handled the virus. Are there even enough police to stretch themselves that far and land at people#s doors  Charlotte asked. I just don#t think the politicians have a clue what they#re doing anymore to be honest.Beverley said: I don#t think there#s a chance the police will come in and enforce everything. There#s not enough of them.Bridget Mullen criticised the new lockdown measures and felt that allowing six people into your home is nowhere near as bad as staging a wedding with  to  people.I think the younger people are more lackadaisical because they don#t think it will affect them, she added.

The ruling came in legal challenges by two victims - including Jenner McNern,- to the continued impasse around introducing the scheme with an estimated cost of £mAugust   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThey lost legs, arms or their eyesight, but the victims who gathered outside Belfast High Court never lost heart.Yesterday, their long and exhausting years of struggle finally paid off as a judge declared that The Executive Office had unlawfully refused to advance their pension scheme.Justice McAlinden delivered a scathing ruling that surely made Sinn Fein squirm.Every legal argument advanced on behalf of Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill was demolished.Arrant nonsense, a truly shocking proposition, wilful disregard for the rule of law, or abject ignorance of whatmeans in a democratic society were just some of the terms used.How on earth did the party get it legally, politically and morally so wrong  Why fight a battle that you#re destined to lose in both a court of law and the court of public opinion  There was never going to be any other outcome.O#Neill has now agreed to nominate a department and progress the scheme. This embarrassing climbdown forced by the courts could have been avoided.Why did the Deputy First Minister not just do what she was legally obliged to do months ago  She could have saved victims so much additional trauma.You#d expect Sinn Fein to at least be PR savvy. The very powerful images of men and women in wheelchairs, or with white sticks, going into court at the start of the case, should have caused a serious rethink in the party.It argues that the pension scheme discriminates against former republican prisoners. It could have pursued that issue while allowing those who have suffered the most to apply for and receive the pension they#re entitled to.The Shinners were completely isolated on this one at Stormont and beyond. A section of their own base was certainly put out by the scheme#s criteria, but it was by no means a matter which incensed or roused the entire republican community. This wasn#t a nationalist versus unionist issue. The victims behind this legal action were from all sections of the community.There were plenty of people who support justice for the Bloody Sunday families, who believe the state committed many great wrongs over the years, who still wanted the pension paid.As well as Jenner McNern#s legal challenge, a case was also brought by Brian Turley, one of the #Hooded Men# subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment by the British Army in .As a survivor of torture, I was left with long-term injuries as a result of the actions of the state, he said yesterday.The delay in having to wait on my right to a pension can only be described as another form of torture. Turley said O#Neill had no right to stop the pension scheme and described her action as very unprofessional.Words like that wound Sinn Fein. When the party finds itself on the opposite side to a victim of state violence like him it should know that it#s on shaky ground. Negotiations will continue between Stormont and Downing Street over who foots the pensions# bill. Naomi Long#s Justice Department will now be designated to progress the scheme. Victims hope that it will be open for applications before Christmas. I feel elated, said Margaret Yeaman who was blinded in an IRA no-warning bomb in Banbridge in  and who has never seen the faces of her grandchildren.The ruling has brought immense relief, said Mark Kelly, who lost his legs in a  no-warning UVF bomb.It#s like a weight lted off my shoulders, said Philip Gault, left with le-changing injuries as a schoolboy when he was injured in on Bloody Friday in .I should never have had to take this case, said Jenner McNern, who lost her legs in the IRA#s Abercorn bomb that year.As they celebrated their win, the surviving victims remembered those who didn#t live to see it, like Paddy Cassidy and Raymond Trimble who died so recently.It was simultaneously a victory to savour, and to shame so many in society for not delivering for these courageous men and women years ago.

But maybe after Mondaywe should have looked at it again.There were voices insisting, however, that the Oireachtas Golf Society#s half-century had to be marked.There was also the fact that the family of the late Mark Killilea, a former MEP and founder member of the society, had been invited.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_de-d-f-aaf-_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_de-d-f-aaf-_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_de-d-f-aaf-_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_de-d-f-aaf-_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_de-d-f-aaf-_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Expand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeClose\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_de-d-f-aaf-_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_de-d-f-aaf-_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_de-d-f-aaf-_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_de-d-f-aaf-_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland df .ece AUTOCROP w bpanews_de-d-f-aaf-_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Dara Calleary PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappDara Calleary Dara Calleary was a political protégé of Mr Killilea, and a friend.The source said: Dara doesn#t know the first thing about golf.

We weren#t allowed to take the pin out of the hole to putt, we weren#t allowed to use the showers after the golf. We weren#t allowed to change in the changing rooms. All of these rules applied all of the time, added the politician.No drinks were served in the clubhouse without an accompanying order of food, as required under Covid rules.

We were in foursomes, but kept apart.At the , an attendee said: We were all given an A sheet with our table, saying there would be two rooms, a one-way system with the toilets, that we should stay socially distanced.It was candidly admitted: At one stage I was going to sit with Brian Hayes over in the other roomand I was told, #No you can#t sit there, you have to sit where you are placed#. They were quite adamant about that - the hotel staff and the committee.Noel Grealish was there, and it was him that was kind of making sure people stuck to the table plan.

The staff were quick on their feet, the wine was served for you.Phil Hogan came and left. He was staying in a dferent hotel. I saw him leaving pretty early. Somebody came and picked him up.In terms of the event itself: You couldn#t hardly hear, and people were grousing. You couldn#t see thembut you could recognise some of the voices.Room B was eventually called to attention. A corner of the thing was pulled back to let people go up and collect a prize.

It comes after this week’s A-level results changes that mean many students will be awarded higher teacher assessed grades. As a result universities will have to offer additional places with Queens University Belfastsaying it may need up to , extra. That will necessitate the lting of the maximum student numberscap. However, at yesterdays Economy Committee meeting at Stormont, Derry MLAs Gary Middleton and Sinead McLaughlin raised concerns thatthe correct decisions arent made it could lead to further regional imbalance with more students enrolling in Belfast courses. googletag.cmd.push DUP MLA Gary Middleton said there are several hundred unfilled places at Magee. While, SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin said thatUlster University wants to see growth at Magee it has to be engineered through the relocation of courses and the university has to invest in the marketing of the campus. The Department for the Economycontrols the number of undergraduate places available at QUB and Ulster Universityfor students from NI and those from outside the UK. Both institutions are allowed to accept between ,-, new undergraduates from Northern Ireland every year The cap exists in Northern Ireland in order to keep tuition fee costs down but results in huge competition for places. googletag.cmd.push It also means that on some courses NI students are expected to get higher grades than their counterparts applying from Great Britain. Derry politicians have called for the MaSN cap to be lted to allow universities to accommodate more students. They’ve insisted that the Magee campus should be prioritised, citing long-promised expansion to , students. However, it is courses that will determine demand and in turn additional places. A UU spokesperson said that it envisages increased demand for Magee courses such as Computer Sciences, Articial Intelligence and Personalised Medicine. She commented: “At Ulster University, students are our absolute priority and we will be as flexible as possible in order to accommodate the maximum number of students possible within our existing funding and the additional flexibility already provided by Department for the Economy. “We are actively preparing for the anticipated additional demand by building in additional places for some of our most popular courses including Computer Sciences, Articial Intelligence, Engineering, Law, Accounting, and Personalised Medicine. “To avail of these additional places, we urge students to contact us as soon as possible on    to discuss your options with an advisor.” The DfE pointed out that responsibility for MaSN allocation lies with Higher Education institutions. A spokesperson for the DfE said: “Until the local universities have received access to the full range of revised grades for all applicant students, they will not be able to confirm places for students or otherwise. “As such, until this process has been completed, there is no way of assessing the number of any additional HE places there may be, nor what the impact might be for each HE institution with regards to their respective MaSNs.” She added: “With regards to the MaSN cap, it is allocated on an institutional-level basis and relates to all full-time undergraduate NI and EU domiciled students it is for each institution to decide how to allocate its MaSN across both subject areas and campuses. “The Economy Minister has stated thatshe will be working with Executive colleagues to ensure that additional places and extra resources are put in place to support universities as soon as possible. “Enrolments for previous years are available athttps:www.economy-ni.gov.uk articles higher-education-enrolments”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Class of  have already missed out on so much. Their final year was abruptly cut short in March, with the footballers of St Patricks on the brink of a MacRory Cup Final. From March until June in your final year of school may be peak time for exam cramming, but its also a coming-of-age period for young students. googletag.cmd.push Relationships with staff gradually takes on a more collegial feel. There is almost a feeling of being in the trenches together as they prepare together for the exams. Amid our A-Levels, myself and a friend were, not particularly diligently, preparing for a History exam that was set to take place the following day. We had nipped into the shop on the way up from Coleraine town centre and bought a sticky toffee pudding on a whim. The product required heating. Mr Bob Murphy was the most likely to do the needful for us, but when he took a look at the pair of us outside the staff room, he was exasperated. googletag.cmd.push “Boys, this is Mrs McGoldricks exam..” he began. We explained that we were grand for the exam, but would he mind heating up our dessert for us  He came back with a smile and a shake of the head, but with a freshly warmed pudding in hand. Trivial, farcical moments like that are recalled much more easily than any time spent in the exam hall, but s pupils have been denied both academic and pastoral build-up to these milestone exams. They have been disenfranchised, denied ownership of what, in many cases, is a le-changing four months. You cant cram for an exam that isnt happening. Every teacher and school leader Ive spoken to over the last week has highlighted the March to June period as a key moment in exam preparation. Pupils look at how things are going, andthe picture doesnt look great, they know its time to up the ante. Its the sprint at the end of the marathon. Principal Mrs Brenda Mussen addresses the St Patricks College, Maghera, Class of . Weirs decision yesterday afternoon to revert back to teacher predictions on AS and A results is a welcome move, but one that should have come without a four-day delay. The algorithm that would have decided the immediate future of our young people was particularly harsh on comprehensive schools. To use just the previous two years as a benchmark was unfair, particularly given the huge range in results a mixed ability cohort can throw up in any given year. Given the nature of academic selection, the risk of having a below-par set of results in a grammar school is greatly reduced, meaning the system used is already subject to in-built injustice. Results are now back in the hands of teachers and schools, rather than at the mercy of a mathematical equation. Back in the hands of the people who know the pupils. The people best-placed to assess their abilities. The people who spent weeks meticulously preparing their centre-assessed grades. “It was a kick in the teeth when you see students who have been downgraded that should not have been ,” said St Patricks Principal, Mrs Brenda Mussen, last week. This years students had been been kicked in the teeth and handed the bill for the dental work. With all exam boards across the UK now awarding on the basis of teacher judgement, the bill has been belatedly waived. The pupils of County Derry, and the whole of the country, would have been at a competitive disadvantage through no fault of their own. Reverting to teacher predictions for A-Level results at least creates a more level playing field for this years university intake.The writing has been on the wall since last Thursday. It took until yesterday for the Minister to bother to read it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Nigel Henderson, a researcher with History Hub Ulster, has been documenting the locations of the , ex-servicemen’s cottages built in Northern Ireland. “The largest colony or collection of cottages in County Londonderry are the ones at Messines Park,” he told the County Derry Post. “I’ve been going through the records trying to get details of the styles of the houses, how many rooms they had, whether they had toilets and bathrooms and things like that. “Once a family was installed in them, they tended to stay there for le, but there were some issues with evictions due to non-payment of rent. “A lot of the guys coming back from the war weren’t able to keep up employment so they may not have been able to pay the rents. “The rents weren’t exorbitant for their time or the standard of the houses, but the ISSLT , were strict at taking people to court for non-payment of rent. “You had guys who were evicted in the early s and then another ex-serviceman might have moved in again. In Belfast, there were guys on the waiting list as far on as the s.” Early plans show the layout of the ex-servicemens three-bedroom cottages at Messines Park. Initial rent for the houses, designed by Roland Ingolby Smith, chief architect for the NI Ministry of Finance from  to , was nine shillings per week, around £ per week today. On the night the Luftwaffe bombed the city, all  fatalities occurred in a row of houses facing onto the Buncrana Road. Nigel Henderson said the attack on Messines Park was unlikely to have been in the Germans’ plan. Instead, it is thought the nearby docks were their intended target. “What I understand is that they were aiming for the docks. During the Second World War in Derry, there was a naval base there,” he said. “It was a base for the Royal Navy going out on patrols in the North Atlantic, but they overshot and Shantallow was not that far from where the docks would have been. Ten members from the Richmond and Murray families died in the attack, along with -year-old James Collins, his -year-old daughter Ellen and William Alexander McFarland. The youngest victim was -month-old Sheila Murray. Their loss was keenly felt within Messines Park, where a strong community spirit had grown since the houses were erected in June .

A colony of ex-servicemen being settled in Derry has the potential to be controversial when looked at through a contemporary eye, but an atmosphere of co-operation prevailed in the aftermath of the First World War. “I don’t think there was any sectarian sentiment against the houses, because for the guys who had moved in, religious affiliation was not a factor,” explained Nigel. “What was taken into account was how big a family they had, whether they had employment, whether they were wounded or gassed in the war, or the standard of housing they had. “Some of those who died were Protestants and some were Roman Catholics and because it was on the edge of the city, they formed almost a small community of their own. “The attitude was that it didn’t matteryou were a Catholic or a Protestant, a unionist or a nationalist, the guys served together. Both communities had been up for participating. “When those guys came home, the religious affiliation of their ex-servicemen neighbours would not have been a major factor or a cause for concern. “They had served together through a nightmare and living close to other ex-servicemen provided an opportunity for them to talk about their shared experiences. “This was something the veterans seldom did inside their homes or with their families.” While not their intended target, the German bombers would no doubt have felt a sense of schadenfreude at how things panned out. Nigel Henderson is struck by the tragic irony of the ex-servicemen’s demise. “It’s the only part of Derry that was hit in the German air raids, but it just happened to be men who had fought in the First World War who were the principal victims,” he said. “That is the irony of it.

Fty-seven cottages were erected on a .-acre patch of land in the Shantallow area, which had been purchased from Sir John McFarland of Aberfoyle on the Strand Road. The land was bought for £,-- - £, in today’s money - and featured a mixture of semi-detached cottages, blocks of four cottages and one detached cottage. A memorial plaque erected by Derry City Council in . Nigel Henderson, a researcher with History Hub Ulster, has been documenting the locations of the , ex-servicemen’s cottages built in Northern Ireland. “The largest colony or collection of cottages in County Londonderry are the ones at Messines Park,” he told the County Derry Post. “I’ve been going through the records trying to get details of the styles of the houses, how many rooms they had, whether they had toilets and bathrooms and things like that. “Once a family was installed in them, they tended to stay there for le, but there were some issues with evictions due to non-payment of rent. “A lot of the guys coming back from the war weren’t able to keep up employment so they may not have been able to pay the rents. “The rents weren’t exorbitant for their time or the standard of the houses, but the ISSLT , were strict at taking people to court for non-payment of rent. “You had guys who were evicted in the early s and then another ex-serviceman might have moved in again. In Belfast, there were guys on the waiting list as far on as the s.” Early plans show the layout of the ex-servicemens three-bedroom cottages at Messines Park. Initial rent for the houses, designed by Roland Ingolby Smith, chief architect for the NI Ministry of Finance from  to , was nine shillings per week, around £ per week today. On the night the Luftwaffe bombed the city, all  fatalities occurred in a row of houses facing onto the Buncrana Road. Nigel Henderson said the attack on Messines Park was unlikely to have been in the Germans’ plan. Instead, it is thought the nearby docks were their intended target. “What I understand is that they were aiming for the docks. During the Second World War in Derry, there was a naval base there,” he said. “It was a base for the Royal Navy going out on patrols in the North Atlantic, but they overshot and Shantallow was not that far from where the docks would have been. Ten members from the Richmond and Murray families died in the attack, along with -year-old James Collins, his -year-old daughter Ellen and William Alexander McFarland. The youngest victim was -month-old Sheila Murray. Their loss was keenly felt within Messines Park, where a strong community spirit had grown since the houses were erected in June .

A colony of ex-servicemen being settled in Derry has the potential to be controversial when looked at through a contemporary eye, but an atmosphere of co-operation prevailed in the aftermath of the First World War. “I don’t think there was any sectarian sentiment against the houses, because for the guys who had moved in, religious affiliation was not a factor,” explained Nigel. “What was taken into account was how big a family they had, whether they had employment, whether they were wounded or gassed in the war, or the standard of housing they had. “Some of those who died were Protestants and some were Roman Catholics and because it was on the edge of the city, they formed almost a small community of their own. “The attitude was that it didn’t matteryou were a Catholic or a Protestant, a unionist or a nationalist, the guys served together. Both communities had been up for participating. “When those guys came home, the religious affiliation of their ex-servicemen neighbours would not have been a major factor or a cause for concern. “They had served together through a nightmare and living close to other ex-servicemen provided an opportunity for them to talk about their shared experiences. “This was something the veterans seldom did inside their homes or with their families.” While not their intended target, the German bombers would no doubt have felt a sense of schadenfreude at how things panned out. Nigel Henderson is struck by the tragic irony of the ex-servicemen’s demise. “It’s the only part of Derry that was hit in the German air raids, but it just happened to be men who had fought in the First World War who were the principal victims,” he said. “That is the irony of it. They survived the Germans in the trenches of the First World War to then die during the Second World War from aerial bombing.” The victims James and Ellen Collins Father and daughter, James and Ellen Collins, lived at  Messines Park. Sixty-year old James was the oldest victim of the bombing and was originally from Eglinton.

Lissan conceded their first game to Drumsurn and last week surrendered from a position of strength against Doire Trasna. Shea McKernan had the ball in the net within minutes of the start, getting on the end of a slick passing movement to slot home. Rather than building it, eight first half wides was the story of Kieran OKanes young sides exploits. For all their shortcomings, they were well in contention and led by two points, with eight minutes to go. googletag.cmd.push Disaster struck when Stephen Conway, who made a fine first half save from Ciaran McGowan, shanked a kick-out to Eoghan Quigg who passed for Micheaacutel McNaught to strike a hammer blow to the net they never recovered from. At midfield for Lissan is the towering Conor Loane, an All-Ireland winning goalkeeper with Holy Trinity Cookstown, and MacRory Cup medallist Mattie Loughran, who kicked four points last week. The pair dovetailed well together and in Iarlaith Donaghy, they have one of the most exciting players in the county playing at number six. Defender Oran Donnelly wears , but sits back as a sweeper, with the nimble Joey Quinn playing up front with Tiarnach Donaghy. googletag.cmd.push Coming Lissans way this weekend is a Faughanvale side who have posted two wins from as many games and had a tough battle to overcome a Drumsurn side who arguably deserved a draw. Manager Joe Gray has had to come to terms with long-term injuries to Oisin Quinn and Jordan Curran. Michael McLaughlin spent last summer in America, but he is back and forms an inside forward duo with Kevin Martin. Paddy OKane is one of their key players and Lissan may face a kick-back after his quiet outing in the last round. He played off the front two, but their running game almost bypassed their middle sector. Gordon Fahey and Michael Sweeney are a formidable defensive spine, with skipper Conor McGuinness nestled between them as a sweeper - a formation that will mirror the Lissan setup,both managers adopt the same approach this time around. The Vale will also have questions to answer. When Drumsurn went down to  men, Grays side couldnt get their hands on the ball and had to rely on a strong finish. On the flip side, apart from the one they scored, the Vale carved out the best two goal chances over the course of the game. A tough ask for Lissan who cant finish above the bottom. Kieran OKane will have his side well-prepared, but Faughanvale will be fancied to come through. VERDICT: Faughanvale RELATEDJoe Grays reaction to the Vales win over Drumsurn.

The plans see new guidance released for parents and carers setting out what steps will be taken to safeguard young people when they travel, alongside simple advice on the safety actions they can also take to protect themselves and others, so everyone travels safely together. “Safety is always our top priority, saidDavid Cowan, Translink Director of Commercial Operations.  In line with the Department for Education guidelines, we have worked with EA colleagues and local schools to introduce appropriate school transport fromstSeptemberthat aims to maximise services in order to help manage the number of pupils travelling at peak times. googletag.cmd.push This will include operating extra school services ​and more ‘school only’ services, to provide increased capacity as required. “We know this will be an unsettling time for parents and for many young people it will be their first time back on public transport. Many things will look dferent with a range of safety measures now on board and in stations for everyone’s protection. “We expect that both scheduled timetabled services and dedicated ‘school only’ services will be busy at peak times andwhere possible, we encourage pupils to consider walking or cycling to and from school. “We continue to enhance our safety standards withregular deep cleaning of our vehicles and facilities using long lasting anti-viral disinfectant and our mobile cleaning teams are sanitising common touch areas. googletag.cmd.push We have protective screens in stations and on bus drivers cabs and have provided hand sanitiser in all main bus and train stations. “It is now compulsory for all pupils aged  or over to wear a face covering on public transport anditis strongly recommended that all pupils regardless of age should wear a face covering on any form of home to school transportwhere it is appropriate for them to do so. Compliance is already very high at over % and together with our wider safety measures, passenger confidence is growing. “It is important pupils also practice the wider safety and travel advice including good hand hygiene and use pre-paid tickets such as mLink or travelcards where they are not eligible for a sessional school pass. For everyone’s protection there will be no change given on board the bus and train. “We would also ask parents   carers and schools for their patience at this time as every year it takes a bit of time for the school traffic to settle into a pattern and this year is even more challenging as we work through the impact of this pandemic. “Translink has been at the frontline throughout this crisis helping get people to where they need to be and now, working together with the EA, we are ready to help get schools back up and running and get young people back into education in this ‘new normal’ and help Northern Ireland recover safely and sustainably”, David concluded.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The plans see new guidance released for parents and carers setting out what steps will be taken to safeguard young people when they travel, alongside simple advice on the safety actions they can also take to protect themselves and others, so everyone travels safely together. “Safety is always our top priority, saidDavid Cowan, Translink Director of Commercial Operations.  In line with the Department for Education guidelines, we have worked with EA colleagues and local schools to introduce appropriate school transport fromstSeptemberthat aims to maximise services in order to help manage the number of pupils travelling at peak times. googletag.cmd.push This will include operating extra school services ​and more ‘school only’ services, to provide increased capacity as required. “We know this will be an unsettling time for parents and for many young people it will be their first time back on public transport. Many things will look dferent with a range of safety measures now on board and in stations for everyone’s protection. “We expect that both scheduled timetabled services and dedicated ‘school only’ services will be busy at peak times andwhere possible, we encourage pupils to consider walking or cycling to and from school. “We continue to enhance our safety standards withregular deep cleaning of our vehicles and facilities using long lasting anti-viral disinfectant and our mobile cleaning teams are sanitising common touch areas. googletag.cmd.push We have protective screens in stations and on bus drivers cabs and have provided hand sanitiser in all main bus and train stations. “It is now compulsory for all pupils aged  or over to wear a face covering on public transport anditis strongly recommended that all pupils regardless of age should wear a face covering on any form of home to school transportwhere it is appropriate for them to do so. Compliance is already very high at over % and together with our wider safety measures, passenger confidence is growing. “It is important pupils also practice the wider safety and travel advice including good hand hygiene and use pre-paid tickets such as mLink or travelcards where they are not eligible for a sessional school pass. For everyone’s protection there will be no change given on board the bus and train. “We would also ask parents   carers and schools for their patience at this time as every year it takes a bit of time for the school traffic to settle into a pattern and this year is even more challenging as we work through the impact of this pandemic. “Translink has been at the frontline throughout this crisis helping get people to where they need to be and now, working together with the EA, we are ready to help get schools back up and running and get young people back into education in this ‘new normal’ and help Northern Ireland recover safely and sustainably”, David concluded.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In family, business and community. Devastation and disbelief reached into every corner of County Derry last Friday afternoon, as the news of his sudden death filtered through. Everyone I spoke with over the weekend was just in shock. My thoughts are with his we Anne and the entire family, as they unite in grief. Rarely would you see Hugh without Anne. They went everywhere together. His family were never far behind. My sympathy also goes out to his daughter Maureen, son Carlus, son-in-law Benny, daughter-in-law Maria, his grandchildren Ollie, Leo, Fiadh and Lily Anna. Its not often you go to Owenbeg that you dont see them all there to take in a game, no matter who is playing. googletag.cmd.push Hugh Peter was well-known far from his own townland of Cloane. He was Managing Director of HA Mechanical Services, a company he started in  with his we Anne. Together, they grew the firm from six employees to over . When you think of a local community, the provision of local jobs is unquantiable. The parish of Ballinascreen and the surrounding areas have benefited greatly. In terms of an amateur sport, like GAA, one of the factors rarely mentioned is the importance of clubs not losing players forced to emigrate in search of work. This cant be done without stable employers, without people like Hugh McWilliams. googletag.cmd.push Then there is the sponsorship element. Hugh and Anne have been the Derry GAAs main sponsor since taking over at the end of the  season. They also sponsor the camogie and ladies football teams, while also backing the senior football and hurling leagues. Derrys statement last week was very apt, labelling Hugh as a giant of generosity and all at a time when the HA logo wasnt splashed across the national media like the big hitters of Dublin, Kerry and Kilkenny. Closer to home, HA are also in their fth year as Ballinascreens main sponsor, also across all four codes. Other examples of Hughs generosity went unnoticed, away from having a company brand associated with it. All the local schools benefited from his support, local mental health charity STEPS and St Vincent de Paul. The list could go on. Two years ago, to celebrate  years of HA, he held a family fun day at the local An Raacuteth Dubh Community Centre. From the moment you walked through the gate, everything was on Hughs tab...from the bouncy castles to the refreshments. They also organised a charity golf day and coffee morning, with all three events raising pound,. He bumped the total up himself, so both charities – Cancer Fund for Children and South Derry Downs Syndrome - were presented with cheques for poundk. For such a successful business man, he never forgot where he came from. He wasnt shy about putting something back. And all with modesty, far from any fanfare. One of the most enjoyable years of my le was the summer of , training the Derry minor team. A swing of Damien Reddingtons left boot may have snatched the All-Ireland minor title from our grasp, but I feel much richer for being involved with that group. We had some craic along the way - sailing up and down the M in the big yellow bus, with the tunes belting and the summer opening up in front of us. There was also a special bond with the supporters and parents. It was the first time I met Hugh Peter. He left Carlus to the bus one Saturday morning when we were Ballyshannon bound to play Roscommon in a challenge game. The Rossies had won the All-Ireland the previous year and Hugh was asking how long I thought the Derry minors summer would last. We hadnt a clue. It was one eventful step at a time. Fast forward to September and as I got off the bus and trudged through the lobby of Dublins Crown Plaza after the All-Ireland final heartbreak, Hugh came forward to shake my hand. Defeat was gurgling in the pit of both our stomachs. I cant remember exactly what he said, but, he was thanking us, while relaying how much his son had enjoyed the journey. Years later when John Francis Bradley, who also played on the same minor team, was seriously injured in a car crash and fighting for his le. Ballinascreen club, with Hugh McWilliams at the forefront, arranged a Night for JF. Screen club was packed. You couldnt have turned a sweet in your mouth. In hospital that night, John Francis spoke for the first time since his accident. The next morning Hugh delivered the many items from the auction to the Bradley family and gave him a pathway back into work. The club later handed over the money donated on the night. Another example of giving. You could write a book. A few months after that All-Ireland minor final, Hugh arranged for a gathering of the squad at the Hogan Stand Bar in Moneyneena. There was music, a buffet, craic and Hugh was in his element. It was like closure on the season. I always enjoy calling into the Hogan Stand and the owner, Tempo man Charlie McNally, claims his porter is the best around. If Hugh was there, he would always send a pint down my direction, like he did for many others. He would never accept one back, but would merely invite you into a football debate with him and Pele, his close friend John Scullion. Hugh would love it. The topic was usually - Screen, Slaughtneil, the Derry championship, the county scene and back to Screen again. Often there would be agreement, sometimes there wasnt and the slagging would begin before theydto chatting with their wives Anne and Mary G. The four of them were so close. Tuesday was no doubt tough day for everyone in the McWilliams family circle, in Ballinascreen and beyond as they said their final goodbye. Hugh often coined the phrase its not about being here for a long time, its about being here for a good time. He always had time for a smile, time for a chat and enjoyed le to the full. He will be sadly missed by his family and friends. I count myself lucky to have known him.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Tuesday was no doubt tough day for everyone in the McWilliams family circle, in Ballinascreen and beyond as they said their final goodbye. Hugh often coined the phrase its not about being here for a long time, its about being here for a good time. He always had time for a smile, time for a chat and enjoyed le to the full. He will be sadly missed by his family and friends. I count myself lucky to have known him.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Trailing to Joseph Olowu’s early goal, the Candystripes were in trouble again, but hit back strongly in the second half with goals from Walter Figueira and Adam Hamill before James Akintunde sealed the win late on. The game started disastrously for Derry who conceded with the first attack on their goal just three minutes in, Kevin O’Connor’s high ball into a packed penalty area spilled by Peter Cherrie, allowing Joseph Olowu to capitalise, volleying the ball into the empty net to make it - to the visitors. googletag.cmd.push City were straight onto the offensive at the start of the second half two goals in three minutes turned the game on its head. City’s persistence finally paid off on  minutes as they got their equaliser and it was another goalkeeper error which led to the goal. Mark McNulty was unable to hold onto a high cross from Ciaran Coll and Jack Malone did superbly to keep the opportunity alive, pulling it back for Walter Figueira to fire home, much to the relief and delight of the home side. That relief turned to joy within two minutes as City turned the game on its head with a second goal. Again Meite was heavily involved, showing great strength and skill to hold off two Cork defenders on his way to goal. Meite seemed certain to score, but his effort was brilliantly parried by McNulty, only for the ball to roll across goal where Hammill was on hand to roll in his first goal for the club. googletag.cmd.push It took an extraordinary save from Cherrie to keep his team ahead in the last five minutes as the City goalkeeper somehow got his hand to Connor Simpson’s cross, clawing it off the goal line to save his team. The win was sealed with the very last kick of the game as James Akintunde collected the ball off Stephen Mallon and hooked the ball into the bottom corner to give the Candystripes a very valuable win. Teams DERRY CITY: Cherrie, Coll, Toal, Cole, Horgan, McCormack, Malone, Thomson , Hammill , Figueira , Meite . CORK CITY: McNulty, Olowu , Bennett, O’Connor, Fleming, Ochieng , Coleman, Slevin , Dalling, Simpson, Fenwick .

I am very proud that our incoming head boy, Cormac Savage, was at the forefront of this campaign and believe his contribution was pivotal in ensuring that the sense of injustice and unfairness felt by his peers was articulated in a forceful and timely manner.Mr McCann also welcomed confirmation that GCSE grades will be awarded as calculated by schools.ldquoTeachers were asked to exercise professional judgment and engaged in a robust process to ensure that pupil effort and attainment in the period from September  to the unexpected and unprecedented closing of schools in March was rewarded, he said. ldquoA great deal of time and energy was devoted to this task by the staff of St. Patrickrsquos Grammar to ensure that grades were awarded fairly and consistently.Down High principal Maud Perry, said after the initial publication of results last Thursday the school was celebrating its best ever A-Level achievements.ldquoThis was unsurprising, as this particular year group achieved the schoolrsquos best ever AS results last year, she said.ldquoThis was a very dferent year in so many ways, but Down High pupils continue to be among the best qualied of their generation and, beyond the curriculum, our pupils are enriched, socially confident and ready to take their place as leaders of the future in whatever fields they choose. Congratulations to all of the pupils on these fully deserved grades.Shimna Integrated College principal Kevin Lambe congratulated the schoolrsquos ldquowonderful A level students who weathered the storm of this unprecedented year.He said he was delighted that the vast majority of students had already been placed at their first choice of university before the restoration of the teacher assessed grades on Monday afternoon.Mr Lambe said that while there had been considerable controversy about the process of awarding grades this year, he paid tribute to the excellent guidance document CCEA provided and to the commitment and energy his staff brought to the grading process.ldquoI am quite sure that the moderation process was undertaken in good faith, but it caused dreadful damage and heartache across the country, he said. ldquoThe CCEA guidance was sound, the work of teachers was thoroughgoing, the teacher awarded grades were the right ones and I am absolutely delighted that they have been restored.Ballynahinchrsquos Assumption Grammar School said it was delighted with the government U-turn in awarding grades as the original process ldquocaused signicant emotional upheaval which affected students, parents and our staff.ldquoWe are fortunate in that over % of our A students had already accessed their chosen university or workplace and hope that now almost every girl has achieved their true potential and will be able to access a iety of career pathways. Assumption Girls set the highest of standards year on year and we are proud of our Year  Girls who excelled in every subject at every level, said a school statement.ldquoOur AS students now have a solid foundation of grades which will give them the confidence to believe in their own potential to achieve at the highest of levels as they enter A level. We wish our GCSE girls the best of luck for tomorrowrsquos results.Castlewellanrsquos St Malachyrsquos High School said it was pleased with Education Minister Peter Weirrsquos announcement that AS and A level students will receive their centre assessment grades or the grade awarded by the examining body, whichever is higher.ldquoWe continue to work hard in St Malachyrsquos in the best interests of all our young people, said a statement issued on Monday evening. We are all here in St Malachyrsquos to help and support our students in the best way we can. Congratulations on their wonderful achievements we wish them all the very best in the future.De La Salle High School principal Ciaran Maguire described the past academic year for students as ldquochallenging.He said students adhered to social distancing guidelines collecting their results last Thursday, with the school delighted with their overall grades.ldquoA-Level results across the province has been one of confusion and uncertainty, said Mr Maguire.ldquoWe as a school were relieved that the majority of the teacher assessment grades were secured for our pupils and will continue to appeal and challenge those that need to be addressed to ensure that all pupils get the right outcome, allowing them to progress in an ever changing world.Before Mondayrsquos announcement, Mr Mark Morgan, principal at St Colmanrsquos High and Sixth Form College in Ballynahinch, said the continued year on year improvement in grades from the students appeared to have been curtailed by the examination bodies.He said teacher predicted grades, which were in line with all the tracking data, appeared to have been totally ignored and grades were given that bore no reflection to the historic and contemporaneous standard attained by students at the school.St Maryrsquos High School in Downpatrick congratulated its A-Level and AS-Level students who received their results.The school said the studentsrsquo success was a ldquoreflection of their hard work, determination to succeed and dedicated teaching staff who always go the extra mile.ldquoOur steady, upward trend in examination results has continued this year and we wish our students all the very best as they begin their studies at university, the statement added..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 53.jpg","title":"53 dogs put down in past year – one third of all in NI  ","story":"A LOCAL politician says she is ldquoheartbroken that more dogs being put to sleep in Newry, Mourne and Down than any other council area in Northern Ireland.Fty-three dogs were destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down in - out of a total of  for the whole province.Thatrsquos almost twice as many as the next highest area, which is Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon with .By contrast six councils reported single figure death rates, while not a single dog was put to sleep in Ards and North Down.Rowallane area councillor Kathryn Owen says the figure for Newry, Mourne and Down makes for ldquogrim reading.Cllr Owen, who has four dogs, says the council should look to the successful measures being implemented in other council areas.ldquoTo say Irsquom heartbroken about the immense number of dogs destroyed in Newry, Mourne and Down District would be an understatement, she said.ldquoThis is not a statistic that we should be proud of.

The Minister cannot allow all this to simply be thrown away.Ms Armstrong said the local community previously stood together to save Exploris and would do so again.She added: ldquoI would urge anyone with concerns to make their voice heard and lodge their concerns and together we can save our local economy.It is believed that the poundm aquarium proposal for Belfast could create more than  full-time jobs and would be the biggest attraction of its kind on the island of Ireland, with city planners recommending that the new development should be given the green light.The firm behind it, reefLIVE, says around  to  jobs could be created during its construction, with  full-time posts created when it opens its doors, subject to securing planning approval.The aquarium would be a two-storey building, based across more than , sq ft and include a cafe, coral reef ocean tank, with the main exhibition space across five zones on the first floor ndash themed as Ireland, Deep Ocean, Azores, Pacic and Arctic.Around  representations were received in relation to the planning application, including  letters of objection.Concerns included the impact to traffic and travel, the impact on heritage for both listed buildings and monuments, flooding and the potential negative impact on the Exploris aquarium in Portaferry.Those behind the planned tourist attraction say it is anticipated the reefLIVE Aquarium will be the largest marine-le visitor attraction on the island of Ireland and in bringing another international-standard attraction to the Titanic Quarter, would help to boost theof tourist visits to the city.In recommending the scheme for approval, Belfast City Council planners said that ldquohaving regard to the development plan and other material considerations, including the issues raised by the representation, the proposal is considered and approval of planning permission is recommended with delegated authority given to the director of planning and building control to finalise the wording of conditions subject to no new substantive planning issues being raised by third parties..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19th August 2020 Celebrations.jpg","title":"Celebrations to mark the end of WW2  ","story":"CHURCH bells rang out across Killyleagh on Saturday morning to mark the th anniversary of VJ Day.The bells of St Johnrsquos Church of Ireland were tolled as part of the UK-wide commemorations of the anniversary.The day when the Second World War finally ended was celebrated with a short interdenominational act of remembrance at the War Memorial.At am former Army chaplain Hector Wanliss gave a ure reading and led prayers of thanksgiving for the men of Killyleagh, Shrigley and district who went to war, and for peace.Then Last Post and Reveille were sounded by Ronnie Cromie and Wilmer Cromie before two minutesrsquo silence was observed and Binyonrsquos Lines were recited by Billy Croskery, the chairman of Killyleagh and Killinchy Royal British Legion.A wreath was then laid by Mr Croskery, who was escorted by Kevin Kelly.Sadly Killyleaghrsquos last remaining Second World War veteran, Martin `Tinarsquo Charters, who is aged , was not able to take part on this occasion.Social distancing measures were in place and the organisers are grateful for those who attended adhering to these.It was a timely reminder that the main highlight of the year, the Killyleagh VE  celebrations, had to be cancelled in May by the Killyleagh Remembers the War group in the wake of the Coronavirus alert and the danger of public gatherings.The Killyleagh group has now cancelled its next proposed event, a lecture on the Second World War in the library due to be given by author George Busby on September .ldquoWe will be keeping under review the remaining schedule of the programme, in conjunction with the Heritage Lottery Fund.

It develops strength and endurance. Through dancing, a toddler will learn from the early age about what their bodies are capable of, she says.ldquo At the same time, it will build their curiosity as naturally they will experiment with certain movements. If toddlers have been introduced to dancing since early age, the chance of them developing good kinesthetic memory is increased.ldquoDuring class we work on key skills such as counting and sequencing thus subtlety engaging with numeracy and literacy.

This time Ardal McMahon provided the finish as they reached the water break.The RGU management team were left with plenty to ponder. Downpatrick continued to battle after the resumption, determined not to be hit by the threat of an avalanche of Rostrevor scores.At this stage there looked to be a real danger that Rostrevor would cut loose. To their credit, Downpatrick did not throw in the towel.Caolan Mooney burst through on the Downpatrick goal not long before half-time and a penalty was awardedwhen he was up-ended by goalkeeper Deeny. Shaun Parr stepped up and netted Rostrevorrsquos third goal.Downpatrick were given a glimmer of hope just before the interval when Parr and then Sean Cooper were black-carded.However at half-time, and the score at - to -, Downpatrickrsquos task looked onerous.The RGU came out with the right attitude to mount a revival in the second half and Doylersquos early minor reduced the gap.Chris Magee helped lead the Downpatrick forward linersquos continuing assaults on the Rostrevor goal with a couple of scores. And there emerged a real feeling of optimism amongst the massed Downpatrick ranks when Conor McGradyrsquos point left just two in it.However Rostrevor refused to hit the panic button. Guided by the experience of Mooney, they stretched their lead before the next water break.Downpatrick were awarded a penalty with the scoreboard reading - to -. However when Rostrevor needed a big moment at just the right time, goalkeeper Gareth Clarke provided it, plunging to push Tim Prenterrsquos effort to safety.That was the moment which really deflated Downpatrickrsquos resolve. You sensed that Rostrevor knew they had weathered the best that Downpatrick could summon in response to their deficit.Jordan Fegan then broke away in the closing minutes, before splitting the posts and taking Rostrevorrsquos score to -.Kane applied a classy coup de grace with the final score of the evening for the victors when he spun the Downpatrick defence and, bearing down on goal, took the safe option of landing the point.In the end it looked plain sailing on paper for Rostrevor. Certainly in terms of the opening they made to the match, catching the RGU cold, they laid the foundations early that kept many of the worries away that Downpatrick could spring a result on them.To Downpatrickrsquos credit, after that disappointing early start, there were more than enough signs there that the spirit within the camp to dig in and get themselves out of trouble in games is there.Downpatrick: James Deeny, Paddy Smith, Ronan Murphy, Eoin Rooney, Nathan McShane, Gerdie Collins, Conor Doherty, Damian Turley, Jonny Bell, Tim Prenter , Conor McGrady , Conor McCarron , Ruairi Quinn , Peter Turley , Chris Magee .Subs: Jarlath Brannigan , Morgan Fitzpatrick, Caolan Boyd, Damian Branf, Daniel McCarron, Garrett Trainor, Ruairi Og Quinn, Frank Starkey, Tom Savage, Tim Collins, Aidan McNeill, Con Farrell, Aidan Og Robinson.Rostrevor: Gareth Clarke, Jarlath Farrell, Tomas Gordon, Eoin Murdock, Nicky Murray, Colm Murney, James Donaghy, Sean Cooper, Caolan Mooney , Ardghal McMahon , Jordan Fegan , Patrick Magee, Conor Doyle , Shaun Parr, Piaras Kane .Subs: Paul McGrath, Richie Reynolds, Darren McElhinney, Conall Gordon, Eamon McConville.

It was also wetter and cooler than average.August has been poor, particularly the last week. I associate late August with the onset of autumn.While the Mediterranean gets hot weather into October and southern England is warm until late September, Northern Ireland summers end early.My late uncle rented a house on the north coast in the last week of each August.

Now, however, western world politicians often defer big decisions to committees or experts, rather than make hard choices themselves.Even the supposedly radical Tory government in London, whichwants to shake up how the UK is governed, has hidden its pandemic decision making behind scientists.The A Level-GCSE fiasco is rooted in the cowardice that led to UK schools being shut earlier than the government wanted, and staying closed for longer.Even now teaching unions and other voices are trying to stop a fullto school next month, when in fact there should have been a push to get pupils back in the weeks after Easter– or at least exam years.There are four broad reasons why ato anything like the general lockdown we experienced after March  is not plausible.• The first is that the nation can’t afford to sustain the furlough schemeIt has already pushed debt to perilous levels. If furlough was extended into next year, there would need to be massive tax increases and spending cuts, including public sector pay cuts .NI politicians have no stomach for such toughness. Even in a financial crisis, Stormont seems only ever inclined to grant pay rises, including a huge recent teacher rise. Councils abused furlough by topping up Treasury funding of % of salaries with ratepayer cash to ensure no staff had any pay reduction.• The second reason lockdown is not feasible is the public mood. The UK government has been fairly criticised for the many things it did wrong over Covid, but few people cite thingsit got right. Its behavioural experts saidlockdown came in too early people would get fed up after a while, and begin to break it. That began to happen after two months. In June there were growing reports of young people socialising in groups .As well as fatigue with restrictions, people began to develop an instinctive sense of the risk of Covid, similar to how we assess car travel .• The third reason lockdown is not feasible is that infection levels do not justy such a massive response.Even the level cited by Dr McBride –  per , cases – is low according to some experts. Prof Carl Heneghan of Oxford’s Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine said epidemic level is five times higher .He said people were failing to understand, and balance, risks.Mr Swann and Dr McBride have accepted such balance over schooling .But such balancing equations should be applied more widely .Few politicians are candid that the Covid risk cannot be cut to zero.Sweden’s former state epidemiologist Prof Johan Giesecke said from the outset that it was not possible to halt Covid’s spread. Recent upsurges in case even in nations that were seen as models of control, such as Germany and South Korea, have vindicated that prediction. • The fourth reason another lockdown is not feasible is specic to NI: Bobby Storey’s funeral shattered Stormont’s authority. There was a cross-party determination to protect Sinn Fein . This meant the first and deputy first ministers cannot preside over press briefings that might reveal suspension of liberty.Instead, the political parties erted attention from the calculating nature of SF leaders’ social distancing breach on June  in westBelfast by backing probes into important but secondary matters such as PSNI and Belfast council handling of the funeral. But in the absence of sanction against hypocritical leaders who set the rules, the damage is irreparable. A population that for months largely obeyed lockdown, including missing funerals of loved ones, watched as republicans were allowed to do as they pleased.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry: Autumn in Northern Ireland always seems to arrive in late August——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

I was a mere child then and childhood dreams develop realism as time moves on.The family home eventually became too small for us and we moved on, but not far away. My mother pined to get back to the area which she eventually did by which time I had left school, had started working and soon that meant living away from home except for the Christmas holidays. That was the one time of the year you could be guaranteed to escape what we called the midges or mayflies, to give them their proper title, harmless little blighters but a great nuisance. And this year, particularly this month, it seems, those mayflies are ‘torturing‘ the locals because August is the month of the mayfly andit’s a good, warm month they breed in their zillions.I remember having to close up bedroom windows at night andI went to visit my elderly Aunt Lizzie, who lived right on the shore at Ballyronan, she kept a permanently rolled up newspaper which she took everywhere with her.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Her laneway was fairly long and when I visited I always dreaded having to cycle though this buzzing throng with mouth closed and breath held until I could reach her front door.The mayflies first arrive in May but this balmy warm August, has been particularly perfect weather for the second generation of little blighters on all shores of the lough. Barbeques  Out of the question. Strolling around the shore on a calm evening  Forget it. The mayflies cover the walls of houses and the windows, for all the world resembling a black plague. My mother would spend her mornings shovelling them away from the doors and windows yes, even those that got inside. When the well-known McGarry Brothers were building boats on the shore not far from BallyronanI recall seeing the dead flies stacked high in their boatyard, the perfect dung heap for locals keen for valuable free compost for their gardens.Tennis, GAA matches, even paddling on the shore was out of the question when the flies took over.The sadness of it all is that most parts of the shores of Lough Neagh are scenically beautul and understandably people want to build homes there. Those who haven’t done their homework and have built a home overlooking the water will get a shock when the first tranche of mayflies arrive.These creatures spread themselves over everything including the highest trees. Fly killing sprays are useless. They come, set up home and don’t die off or go away until it suits them. And, it was that that persuaded me that no matter how much I loved the place I could never live there. I wasn’t even keen to visit the family home until the flies had gone.I try to avoid driving in the area when the mayflies are active as they splatter the windscreen ruining your vision and needing to be scraped off because they harden like glue. Step ouside the car and you’re covered in them.In sense they are not unlike the coronavirus – a first tranche arrives taking lives and scaring us witless. We try to get it under control only for a second lot to move in or at least we have been told to expect one. Even our scientists are fairly certain the virus willwith the cold weather. Our Health Minister Robin Swann has us well warned. So the police needed go looking for beach parties or illegal raves around the shores of Lough Neagh. The mayfly, though harmless, is a thorough pest which comes and goes as it pleases.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusGetting outFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

For those who believe they are immune they need to know better. This virus can and has taken lives”Minister Swann said recently his department recently has been dealing “with a signicant outbreak in a meat processing plant”.He said  cases were detected in staff and further cases of contact. He said all staff were being tested and many were self-isolating.Dr McBride added that “theof schools could see pressure on the R number”.“If your child has symptoms then keep them at home,” he added. “Get them tested. The capacity is up to  tests a day. Schools are not unsafe places.”The news came in the latest Department of Health dashboard - which also revealed that now , people have tested positive in Northern Ireland.In the last seven days  people have tested positive in Northern Ireland.There are no further deaths leaving the toll at .Most of the  confirmed coronavirus cases recorded in the past  hours by the Department of Health have been aged between -.Twenty-five of the  cases recorded were in that age range.The fewest cases recorded in the department’s latest update were between the ages  - and -.The latest dashboard reveals that the majority of the  cases of coronavirus confirmed within the last  hours were recorded in the Mid and East Antrim and Belfast council areas - both with .The remainder of cases confirmed in the Department of Health’s were located in:Antrim and Newtownabbey - Lisburn and Castlereagh- Newry Mourne and Down - Armagh Banbridge and Craigavon- Causeway Coast and Glens - Derry and Strabane - Mid-Ulster - The biggest increase in cases over a seven-day-period has occurred in Mid and East Antrim with  new cases.The dashboard also reveals there are active Covid- outbreaks in eight Northern Ireland care homes.That is an increase of seven from yesterday.An active outbreak is declared in a care home when a resident or staff member has a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of Covid-.The news comes as it emerges a meat processing plant near Ballymena is to close temporarily due to a Covid cluster.Cranswick in Cullybackey, which processes pigs, will shut at the weekend, the BBC have reported.A cluster is defined as  or more cases.

In response, we have already put additional measures in place.Last week, we moved to the next phase of our agreed, comprehensive Hygiene Commitment plan which includes increased random testing of team members, who continue to operate within team bubbles.In addition, we are also the first company in Northern Ireland to introduce a Mistpal Cleansing Tunnel for team members and guests entering the Resort for further safety reassurance. This is in addition to already established measures including a nightly, full deep-clean of all areas with hospital-grade sanitiser protectant and decontamination equipment, thermal temperature monitoring, provision of hand sanitisers in all areas and adherence to recommended social distancing guidelines.The health and safety of our team and guests remains paramount and we are grateful for their continued support and also to those guests who have rescheduled their stay as a result of the robust pre-entry testing measures we have in place.”Galgorm Spa  Golf Resort has already carried out tests with almost  team members and will continue to conduct random testing and adopt the same stringent protocols already in place in the event that any further positive cases are identied.Since reopening Galgorm Spa  Golf Resort has been focused on safety as a priority and was among the first hotels in the UK to receive the AA COVID Confident Mark for its industry leading health and safety standards.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe trials are part of further changes to coronavirus regulations announced by first minister, Mark Drakeford.Indoor visits to care homes will also be allowed from Saturday, August , subject to the strict controls set out in the guidance and conditions remaining favourable.However, the first minister emphasised that theof pupils to schools and colleges from September  is the top priority during this  day regulation cycle.The Welsh Government recognises the value of the events sector to Wales and how cultural, sports and business events are a vital part of the visitor economy and one of the last sectors left to re-open.Initially three small events, with limits of up to  people, and subject to strict risk assessments, will be held across Wales later this month.Outdoor events are being prioritised in this review period, while the weather is mild, due to evidence of lower transmission of coronavirus outdoors.If these small events can be carried out safely, and transmission of the virus remains low, it is hoped the next stage will be increased numbers of participants, allowing a limited number of spectators to attend sporting events and potentially considering trialling small scale business events.In the coming weeks three small scale events will be trialled to inform future review processes.Outdoor events of up to  people include Theatr Clwydrsquos proposals for a number of live outdoor performances from August,  Welsh Triathlonrsquos planned lsquoReturn to Racingrsquo competition at Pembrey Country Park which will be a closed venue and without spectators and a car rally at Anglesey Circuit Trac Mon Race track.The Welsh Government continues to work closely with the UK Government to monitor the outcomes from the trials that have taken place recently.Mr Drakeford also confirmed that from Saturday, August , extended households can expand to include up to four households in an exclusive, extended arrangement.From the same day, weddings and funerals will be able to include a meal for up to  people, in suitably socially distant settings.Subject to the successful resumption of weddings and funerals, it is hoped to further increase the range of indoor ceremonies allowed in the next review period, including christenings, baptisms and bar mitzvahs.Casinos will be allowed to reopen from Saturday, August , provided they follow the guidance available to them.Mr Drakeford said: ldquoWhile coronavirus remains effectively suppressed in Wales and cases continue to fall, the situation in the rest of the UK and further afield is still problematic.\"Coronavirus has not gone away and so, as we move out of lockdown and look to the future, it is important we do this in a careful and cautious way.ldquoWe appreciate how hard it has been for families not seeing their loved ones and the impact restrictions on visiting care homes is having on peoplersquos emotional, mental and even physical health.ldquoIn an effort to address this we have been working closely with partners and intend to allow indoor visits to care homes to recommence from Saturday, August , subject to the strict controls set out in the guidance and conditions remaining favourable.ldquoIn addition we will trial three small scale events, in partnership with the events organisers, local authorities and other stakeholders, to seethey can be carried out in a safe way, with a view to supporting the sector and making the most of the remaining summer months where we can spend time outdoors.ldquoWe will also learn from pilots being conducted across the UK, in reopening professional sport and indoor theatre to supporters and audiences, so we base our decisions on the best possible evidence available.\"We will continue to talk with event organisers about the possible resumption of some other activities later in the autumn.ldquoBut, for the time being, we need to learn from how we can safely hold outdoor events while maintaining social distancing.ldquoWe will use the next three weeks to continue to engage with those remaining sectors of our economy that remain affected by coronavirus restrictions.\"I would like to thank the sector representatives for the way they continue to engage, coming out of lockdown will always be harder than going into it - but, together, we will do it in the safest possible way.From  September, schools and further education colleges willfrom the summer break, and will teach pupils through a iety of ways, either in the classroom or remotely.The First Minister added:ldquoTheof pupils is the most signicant important activity which will take place in Wales during the next  days and most of the headroom we have is being devoted to making this a success.ldquoIt is critical that we get children back into schools in the safest possible way. All children in Wales have had the opportunity to lsquocheck in, catch up and preparersquo before the summer holidays, and we hope this will stand them in good stead for the changes they are due to encounter in the upcoming months. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.
