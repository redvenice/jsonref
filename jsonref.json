Metaphors and hidden meanings had no place in a production that never stopped bellowing its messages in our faces. This might be the loudest piece of TV ever made.Emma Thompson (Goneril) screamed at her father’s army rabble till her veins popped. Emily Watson (Regan) shrieked fit to shatter glass as her fingernails dug out the eyes of the Duke of Gloucester (Jim Broadbent).Everybody tried to outshout everyone else, Hopkins loudest of all. He was never knowingly caught underacting, nor underdoing the symbolism of a broken Britain.The stormy heath that Shakespeare imagined for the king’s mad scenes became a refugee camp filled with starving immigrants, and then a concrete shopping centre in a soulless new town.Hopkins has wanted to make this TV version for a long time — so long that he once had a teenage Keira Knightley in mind for young Cordelia, instead of Florence Pugh. Now he’s finally brought it to the screen, the 80-year-old has been selling it for all he’s worth, even boasting (like Lear) of his real-life estrangement from his daughter.Some of the casting was inspired. Jim Carter, the eternal butler of Downton Abbey, was perfect as the loyal Kent, and Tobias Menzies (best-known as Black Jack Randall in Outlander) was wickedly nasty as the Duke of Cornwall.Menzies will play Prince Philip in the next series of The Crown, which doesn’t bode well for the Buckingham Palace spin doctors.Thank goodness for a writer who doesn\u0027t treat viewers like...Share this articleYet Christopher Ecclestone was an odd choice for Goneril’s effete footman, Oswald.

They have no values beyond money-grubbing and treat anyone who gets in their way with contempt.’Blackstone’s billionaire co-founder and chief executive, Stephen Schwarzman, trousered a scarcely credible £572.4 million last year alone.His company tried to sell St Katharine Docks for £435 million in 2017, three years after acquiring it for £185 million.

We didn’t we told them there were tie-bars and they refused to believe us.’Blackstone will say only: ‘David Mellor has the right to claim against the insurance which is in place.’Perhaps Schwarzman could rummage through his loose change for some compensation?   Prince Harry’s fellow Old Etonian Alexander Gilkes cut a solitary figure at the Royal Wedding.He may have decided not to take his girlfriend, the Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova, because of her intense off-court rivalry with fellow tennis star Serena Williams, who was there as a friend of Meghan Markle.He may also have not wanted her to meet his ex-wife, fashion designer Misha Nonoo, another pal of Meghan.I hear that Gilkes, 38, tried to make amends at the weekend by whisking Maria, 31, off to Paris, where they visited the Picasso Museum and sipped cocktails at The Ritz.   Even Chelsea flowers are not immune to the rising tide of lawlessness in the capital.Acclaimed shoe designer Emma Hope won gold in the Chelsea in Bloom competition, held to coincide with the flower show, but the plants were stolen from outside her shop in Sloane Square. ‘This year’s theme was love,’ she tells me. ‘We turned up on Sunday and the display had been knocked down and the plants taken — white irises and roses called Rhapsody in Blue.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/29/09/4CB249EB00000578-5781781-image-a-5_1527582699110.jpg","title":"Noel Gallagher scoffed size Scone Palace Perth","story":"    Noel performed at an event at the palaceOnce home to the Stone of Destiny, Scone Palace was the crowning place of ancient Scots kings for nearly a thousand years.But one famous guest at the weekend was far from impressed by the site’s history – and scoffed at its regal heritage.Noel Gallagher, performing in the Perth venue for the BBC’s The Biggest Weekend event, signed off from the tourist attraction by writing in the official visitor’s book: ‘A palace?

Now, however, she has ‘locked-in’ syndrome. Her alert and able brain is marooned in an immobile body her mouth cannot articulate her thoughts.I imagined her condition would also have deprived her of humour and (as she cannot speak) the capacity to express it outwardly. Surely to be rendered mute and motionless must be the worst kind of imprisonment?But by some quirk of nature, and against all logic and reason, Shirley can still physically laugh. And she does so often and infectiously, bringing joy to all those around her.‘Shirley is definitely the happiest person I know,’ says one of her round-the-clock carers, Valerie Griffiths. ‘There are lots of lively and hilarious episodes with her. We laugh all the time. This isn’t a sombre job. Actually, it’s uplifting.’          Shirley, pictured with her father Henry Dennis on her wedding day aged 20 in 1980More than that, Shirley, 57, tells me — writing slowly on a computer operated by a sensor she works with her right cheek — that she is happy in some ways actually happier than she was in her former, able-bodied life.It is a startling admission and I ask her to explain. The answer takes shape slowly as she types.‘My former life was busy, noisy, pressurised and stressful, and now it’s quiet, peaceful and calm, with more time to fully appreciate life,’ she writes. ‘I’ve never really considered it before but I probably do feel liberated from the trappings of a normal working life.‘I certainly appreciate other people more and have time to fully enjoy the important things like being with friends and family. I think I feel a different kind of happiness now, born out of contentment.’It is an extraordinary response. Few of us who have the liberty to move and talk can think about being deprived of these faculties without utter horror. But Shirley has astounded, delighted and humbled me in the few weeks I have known her. She is, quite frankly, an extraordinary inidual.We spent several weeks swapping emails — she returning eloquent, thoughtful and often witty responses to my questions — before I visit her.I ask Shirley if she has ever, in her darkest days, succumbed to despair ever considered taking her own life.Her answer is emphatic. ‘Not even for a split second,’ she tells me. ‘My view is that a limited life is better than no life at all. However, I respect the views of those who differ. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.‘There were many dark moments during the first year,’ she concedes. ‘I cried a lot. But as my level of acceptance increased, so did my level of happiness.’She lives in a village on the edge of Dartmoor, Devon, in a specially-adapted bungalow next to a residential care home. Light streams through the French doors. There is a view of fields, and her cats, Smudge and Tigger, stretch languidly in the sun.  Shirley, pictured left on her wedding day in 1980 and right, aged 36, graduating from the University of the West of England in Bristol was not expected to survive her strokeShirley remains married to her husband, whom she won’t name (‘he’d kill me!’) but who lives nearby and visits often. He still runs the family farm on which she grew up.They didn’t have any children, which, she says, is not a regret because she did not want any in the first place.A good and loyal wife still, she respects his privacy. Questions as to how he copes with their situation, the nature of their relationship, whether he has found someone else, and whether she would be accepting if he did, are batted away with good humour but certitude. The no-nonsense, ruddy country girl has not gone away.‘I still love my husband,’ she says. ‘He makes me laugh. I miss him not being with me but I accept he couldn’t care for me. It would be a very demanding job. But it’s important that I’m still married.’ And that is the end of the conversation.Her constant companions are her carers. Valerie, 58 — cheerful and calm with a lilting Welsh accent — has been one of two regular carers for five-and-a-half years and works for two weeks, staying overnight in the bungalow’s bright spare bedroom, then has two weeks off when another carer comes.Extra carers from the adjacent home come in three times daily to help dress, wash and feed Shirley.She is still fiercely independent in many ways, however. She shops for clothes and groceries on the internet and manages her own care.          Shirley, aged 13 in school‘She types notes to us each day about food portions, heating, what she’d like to wear the positioning of the bed — things like that,’ explains Valerie.‘Are you allowed to say if you don’t like a carer?’ I ask Shirley. She laughs. ‘I’ve done so loads of times,’ she says. ‘I’ve sent carers away! I look for humour, patience no fuss.’It is a measure of her tenacity and determination that since she became locked in she has taken two Open University degrees — a Bachelor’s and a Master’s in social sciences with politics.The graduation certificates are framed and proudly displayed on the wall.For four hours a day, Shirley studied with the help of computer software that read books aloud to her. Exams were a test of endurance: Shirley was permitted four hours for every one hour of a usual exam.This meant standard three-hour exams — completed at her home in the presence of an invigilator — took 12 hours and were spaced over three days.I ask if the feeling of triumph when she graduated was magnified because of the effort involved. ‘Definitely!’ She smiles.She is an only child and her mum, who died three years ago, never properly recovered from the shock of seeing her daughter so severely disabled. ‘It was very hard for her,’ says Shirley, with understatement.Her dad Henry, who turned 90 in April, visits twice weekly and takes her on outings, usually to a park in Okehampton, and sometimes out to lunch. She enjoys the occasional vodka and orange. Eating and tasting food — which she is fed in pureed form — is also a positive pleasure that might have been denied to her had she not been so determined to learn to swallow.‘After my stroke I was fed through a peg-tube direct into my stomach,’ she remembers.‘I wasn’t even able to swallow saliva and I was told that I’d never be able to swallow. But with practice, initially through illicit consumption of chocolate buttons at the rehab centre where I went after hospital, I reached my goal of being able to eat.’Who fed you the forbidden chocolate buttons? I ask, amused. ‘My husband!’ she says. ‘I suppose you could have choked?’ I remark.She raises her eyes upwards, her signal for yes, and types: ‘But he didn’t dare say no!’          Despite her condition, she has successfully completed two Open University degrees - a Bachelor\u0027s and a Master\u0027s in social sciences with politics Grit and tenacity have always been strong components of Shirley’s personality — she would joke that she is actually ‘stubborn and awkward’ — and neither of these qualities has diminished since her stroke.She says she often thinks about her old life — not with wistful regret, but with pleasure that she has good memories to draw upon — and about the job she loved, her marriage and the farm.Her leisure time used to be full of activity. She loved aerobics, socialising with friends and, having grown up on her parents’ farm, the countryside and walking were in her blood.History remains a passion. Holidays in her old life were spent travelling to places ‘that had a bit of history about them’. Today, she admits the logistics are tricky — every outing assumes the complexity of a military manoeuvre — so she doesn’t venture far from home for more than a few days.In her old life she qualified as a solicitor through sheer hard graft. Having joined a law firm in Okehampton as an office junior straight from school at 17, she became a secretary, then, after a few years, studied to become a legal executive by correspondence course, while doing her day job.Finally she qualified in law in 1997 — her area of expertise was residential conveyancing — studying at weekends and passing her exams while still running a busy legal practice.          Shirley learned how to swallow again after being smuggled chocolate buttons by her husband while in a rehab centreEverything came to an abrupt halt one awful Sunday morning in December 2002. Shirley recalls: ‘I woke up with a splitting headache and, when I tried to get out of bed, I found that I had severe vertigo so went back to bed and stayed there much of the day.‘I felt a bit better late afternoon, and as I thought that some fresh air would do me good, I got up and went down to the farm for a walk.‘While I was there, I thought I would make myself useful and feed a few of the animals. But, while I was doing it, I felt a bit dizzy so sat down on a pile of hay.‘It was obviously then that I had my stroke, because the next thing I knew I was coming around in intensive care a couple of weeks later.’Much of what happened during her four weeks in hospital is obliterated from her memory. However, during the ensuing 16 months in a neurological rehab centre, the implications of the stroke hit her. ‘I didn’t handle it well. I cried a lot,’ she says of those early days.I wonder if the terror of being unable to communicate was her worst fear, but she explains that even in the early weeks she learned to raise her eyes to signal ‘yes’ and look down to indicate ‘no’.Communication with Shirley is necessarily a laborious process. If she is not at her computer, she spells out words with the help of an alphabet board, building them up painstakingly by blinking when her listener indicates the correct letter on the board.Inside, of course, her active brain is buzzing her sentences ready-formed into eloquent expressions of thought.I cannot imagine, I say, how frustrating it must be when strangers assume she does not understand them, because of her disability, and talk to her carer instead.‘At first it annoyed me,’ she admits. ‘But I’ve come to accept it as inevitable. Most people have never even heard of locked-in syndrome, let alone know what it is, so don’t know what to expect and can only go on appearance.‘I occasionally get frustrated when people don’t understand what I’m trying to say, but generally I’ve accepted my condition. It happened, I can’t turn the clock back, so I’ve just got to make the best of it.’Acceptance. It seems to be the key to Shirley’s happiness. That, and her obdurate refusal to ever capitulate.When she came out of rehab, it was obvious she would need professional care. Medics favoured a nursing home, but Shirley, then just 42, did not agree. ‘I’m not at all suited to institutional living,’ she says. ‘I’m far too independent. So they had to think again.’Their solution was judicious and creative. Her little bungalow, in a small assisted living complex next to the care home, gives her both a degree of autonomy and the comfort of knowing that, aside from her regular carer, there is constant support at hand. ‘Thankfully,’ she adds, ‘apart from the occasional bit of cramp or backache that everyone gets, I’m not in pain.’Because Shirley has such a rare capacity for joy, a visit to her home leaves you filled with an unexpected optimism that even the bleakest of personal tragedies can be turned into triumph.          Shirley said her life changed in December 2002 when she had a splitting headache and was unable to get out of bed because of vertigo‘I find joy in almost anything, no matter how small,’ she says. ‘And recently I’ve experienced the joy of watching my beloved Manchester City, who I’ve supported for 50 years, have such a record-breaking season.‘I’m very much a lady of leisure these days and, unless I’m going out, I spend much of the daytime at the computer, keeping in touch with friends and family by email or via Facebook, surfing the internet or watching TV.‘I like watching most sports, as well as historical documentaries and comedy. I laugh at just about anything and I generally laugh loudly. In fact, I only have to think of something funny and I start giggling.‘I’ve come to the conclusion,’ she adds, ‘that my brain’s default setting is happiness’ — and as I wave goodbye to her and turn to walk down the drive, once again I hear the glorious ripple of her laughter. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/28/14/4CB208FD00000578-0-image-a-18_1527514498676.jpg","title":"Britains biggest beer festival offer alcohol free ales time history","story":"    A Dutch beer will be the first alcohol-free ale on sale at the Campaign for Real Ale’s Great British Beer Festival in AugustBraxzz Brewery has developed an alcohol-free IPA and the world’s first alcohol-free porter ale.Coca-Cola launches its first ever alcoholic drink: Fizzy...See what alcohol does to the heart: Shocking images show the...Share this articleFestival organiser Catherine Tonry said: “Alcohol-free beer has become increasingly important in recent years and thankfully brewers have been keeping pace with consumer demands. “There are now some fantastic innovations in the sector and a much wider range of styles and flavours than ever before.“We are thrilled to provide an alcohol-free alternative to festival-goers who cannot or choose not to drink.”          Festival organiser Catherine Tonry says alcohol-free beer has become increasingly popular with consumersJames Leary, of Braxzz, said: “We are delighted to be attending the Great British Beer Festival for hopefully the first of many appearances.“We hope to provide something different at the event and give another option to anybody who will not be drinking but still want to taste craft ale.” "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/29/16/4CBACB1200000578-0-image-m-23_1527607021781.jpg","title":"Most Britons agree immigration harmed communities","story":"    Based on a British poll, as well as on views taken from focus groups across Britain, Germany and France, the report said nearly two-thirds of people in the UK believe life was better when they were growing up. But it added: \u0027Despite the widespread critiques of contemporary British society, and anxieties about the future, many citizens remain both resilient and begrudgingly optimistic – a point that sets them apart from participants in our French and German focus groups.\u0027Afghan Co-op worker\u0027s wife and son win reprieve to stay in...Ruth Davidson backs Jeremy Hunt\u0027s call for substantial extra...Share this articleThe report also said that alongside the concern that the country is in a \u0027state of decline\u0027, British people are united by the belief that immigration has had a negative impact and that \u0027the nation\u0027s cultures and traditions are not being sufficiently defended and promoted\u0027. Large numbers of people, it said, are \u0027particularly incensed by cultural pluralism, seen to be favoured over British values and traditions, and political correctness, regarded as taxing and repressive\u0027.The findings from Demos, a think-tank once regarded as close to Tony Blair, and which is now led by an ex-senior aide to former Lib Dem Deputy Prime Minister Sir Nick Clegg, come at a time of persistent attacks from left-wing activists on figures widely seen as central to British values.           Theresa May\u0027s portrait was removed from the geography school at Oxford University after complaints that Mrs May\u0027s policies on Brexit and the Windrush scandal were offensiveThese range from a tweet by Historic England, the quango charged with celebrating national monuments, on the idea that Nelson\u0027s Column should be demolished, to the removal of Theresa May\u0027s portrait from the geography school at Oxford University.The picture was removed after complaints that Mrs May\u0027s policies on Brexit and the Windrush scandal were offensive.The Demos poll, which saw more than 1,000 Sky TV subscribers questioned, found that while 43 per cent thought immigration into Britain had been positive, 44 per cent thought it had had a negative impact instead.Nearly 71 per cent thought immigration had ided communities where migrants have settled.

Company reveals...Share this article‘But, from the first day he joined the school, it became evident that he had a talent for football that was way beyond his years.’Thirteen years and 37 England caps later, Raheem Shaquille Sterling’s success on the football pitch continues to be as stratospheric as his all-too-regular failures off it.          Sterling, pictured here with his girlfriend Paige Lee Hansel, is part of Gareth Southgate\u0027s squad to travel to Russia next month for the World CupOn one hand, the rise of the 23-year-old star represents an old-fashioned sporting fairy tale: a working-class boy who came to the UK as an infant and, through talent and hard graft, has achieved fame and fortune beyond the wildest dreams of his immigrant single mother.A key figure in Manchester City’s title-winning season, scoring 18 goals in the process, the £200,000-a-week forward will be cheered by a nation when he takes the field at the coming World Cup.Yet, on the other hand, this supposed role model has for far too long allowed himself to be defined by acute lapses in judgment that — in the eyes of many critics, at least — have turned him into a symbol of the amorality that is today at the heart of the so-called Beautiful Game.Recent years have seen court appearances, at least one reported tryst with a prostitute and secret dates with a Playboy model who was most certainly not Paige Lee Hansel, the long-suffering fiancee and mother of his youngest child Thiago.  Sterling has been photographed taking \u0027Hippy Crack\u0027, left, and with a shisha pipe, rightOn social media, where he shares images and videos of his gaudy mansion in Cheshire, purchased for £3.1 million in 2016, high-end cars (he’s said to own seven — one for each day of the week) and collection of bling wristwatches, he’s also been filmed smoking and inhaling a mind-altering intoxicant known as ‘hippy crack.’In this ignoble tradition came yesterday’s somewhat bizarre controversy over Sterling’s decision to get a large new tattoo — of an M16 assault rifle.He showed off the design, running down the lower half of his right leg, in a photo shared with his 3.6 million followers on Instagram on Monday.It was taken at England’s training ground in Staffordshire as players assembled to start preparations for the World Cup, which begins in just over a fortnight.Critics promptly condemned it as provocative and irresponsible, pointing out that more than 60 people have been killed by gun and knife violence in London this year alone and that similar weapons have been used in countless recent mass shootings in the U.S.Branding it ‘sickening’, ‘disgusting’ and ‘totally unacceptable’, the lobby group Mothers Against Guns called for him to be dropped from the England side.Lucy Cope, whose son was shot dead outside a London club, said: ‘He’s supposed to be a role model, but chooses to glamorise guns.’Last night, her words were echoed by the father of Damilola Taylor, who was stabbed to death in a street attack aged ten.Richard Taylor told The Sun: ‘Young people look up to footballers. Sterling hasn’t displayed the discipline we expect. He should be reprimanded and made to apologise to victims’ families.’Iffat Rizvi, who runs the Starr anti-guns campaign, said: ‘This is disrespectful to young people who lost their lives.’      "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/29/17/1EE3252000000578-0-image-m-63_1527609689005.jpg","title":"Royal Sophie launches foul mouthed defence disgraced Kids Company founder","story":"    Actress Sophie Winkleman (pictured with husband Lord Frederick Windsor), Prince Michael of Kent\u0027s daughter-in-law, launched a foul-mouthed defence of the colourful former charity boss Camila BatmanghelidjhLady Frederick Windsor tells me: \u0027They don\u0027t tell the truth.

Among the tweets were ones that pictured Jarrett next to a character from Planet of the Apes, and a doctored image of Whoopie Goldberg wearing a t-shirt that shows Trump shooting himself in the head      Despite apologizing for her previous comments about George Soros and Valerie Jarrett, Barr retweeted a stream of content that backed her remarks while wading into other right-wing causes and conspiracies      Barr also said she thought former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett was white when she penned the racist tweet that got her show pulled from television          Barr said she though Jarrett \u0027was Jewish and Persian\u0027 amid a bizarre flurry tweets penned late on Tuesday night          Valerie Jarrett was born in Iran but both of her parents are African American, and her great-grandfather was the first credited African American architect. She appeared on MSNBC on Tuesday (pictured) to lay blame for Barr\u0027s rhetoric at the feet of President Trump, saying: \u0027The tone comes from the top\u0027          The shamed star also blamed her racist rant on sleeping pill Ambien.

After Barr\u0027s now-infamous Planet of the Apes tweet had been sent, Clinton replied around 9am to say that she was not in fact married to a Soros, though she admired the work his foundation does.Barr subsequently sent a Tweet apologizing to Clinton for the mistake, though launched another broadside at Soros by claiming he was a \u0027Nazi\u0027 who betrayed Jews during the holocaust.The actress also launched a salvo at Clinton\u0027s actual husband, Marc Mezvinsky, saying: \u0027HER HUSBAND IS THE SON OF A CORRUPT SENATOR.\u0027Clinton\u0027s father-in-law is a former congressman and convicted felon who in March of 2001 plead guilty to 31 of 69 felony charges of mail, bank and wire fraud.            But as the Clinton saga wound to a close Barr\u0027s tweet about Jarrett was catching a massive amount of attention, forcing the actress to brand her remark \u0027a joke\u0027.She also defended herself against allegations of racism by countering that Islam \u0027is not a race\u0027.The remarks were not enough, however, and around an hour later she offered a full apology to Jarrett and announced that she would be leaving Twitter.           Shortly after midday Wanda Sykes, an African-American comedian and writer working on the Roseanne reboot, announced that she was walking away from the program.Around an hour later ABC broke its silence over the controversy to say that Roseanne was being cancelled.We now know that the network spent this time contacting Jarrett to apologize and inform her of the cancellation.Barr later said that the network had bowed to pressure amid calls for a boycott of Roseanne\u0027s advertisers, though ABC did not immediately respond to her remark.In its statement, ABC said Roseanne\u0027s remark was \u0027abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values\u0027.       Caravans seen outside Thwaites Brewery as 100 travellers take overHillary and Bill Clinton march in New Castle Memorial Day paradeWatch the trailer for BBC Three\u0027s drama \u0027Killed By My Debt\u0027\u0027Child rapist\u0027 left covered in blood after violent attack by mob\u0027I wanted answers\u0027: Ian Huntley\u0027s daughter on why she wrote to himShocking moment bus crash leaves dozens of vehicles destroyedOut of control bus causes cars to collide on main roadWomen throw mugs of tea and council bins at each other in street brawlMoment hero scales Parisian building to rescue dangling child5-star leader: rejection of the Econ minister is \u0027unacceptable\u0027Emergency services at scene of Aldborough helicopter crashSoon after the news broke, Goodman, who played Barr\u0027s husband Dan on the TV show, was spotted looking very glum as he walked his dog          Goodman, 65, is yet to offer any comment on Barr\u0027s tweets or their show being axed          Gilbert, who played Darlene Conner on the series, had earlier slammed Barr\u0027s tweets as \u0027abhorrent\u0027  Barr also lashed out at former costar Sara Gilbert for her reaction to the racism row, in which Gilbert called her comments \u0027abhorrent\u0027 and \u0027disappointing\u0027, by saying \u0027wow! unreal\u0027  Bar clapped back at Michael Fishman, who played DJ Conner for the entirety of the series and was featured in the revival with a biracial daughter, accusing him of throwing her under a bus      Caravans seen outside Thwaites Brewery as 100 travellers take overHillary and Bill Clinton march in New Castle Memorial Day paradeWatch the trailer for BBC Three\u0027s drama \u0027Killed By My Debt\u0027\u0027Child rapist\u0027 left covered in blood after violent attack by mob\u0027I wanted answers\u0027: Ian Huntley\u0027s daughter on why she wrote to himShocking moment bus crash leaves dozens of vehicles destroyedOut of control bus causes cars to collide on main roadWomen throw mugs of tea and council bins at each other in street brawlMoment hero scales Parisian building to rescue dangling child5-star leader: rejection of the Econ minister is \u0027unacceptable\u0027Emergency services at scene of Aldborough helicopter crashBarr was widely condemned after she tweeted that Jarrett looked like \u0027Muslim brotherhood \u0026amp planet of the apes had a baby\u0027.Jarrett responded to the ordeal when she spoke at a town hall on MSNBC called \u0027Everyday Racism in America\u0027 later on Tuesday. She revealed that Disney CEO Bob Iger had called her to apologize.\u0027He wanted me to know before he made it public that he was canceling the show,\u0027 she said. \u0027First of all, I think we have to turn it into a teaching moment.

Effective immediately, Roseanne Barr is no longer a client.\u0027 It appears the cancellation of the show will also affect the cast\u0027s Emmy prospects, as ABC revealed it is suspending the show\u0027s FYC (For Your Consideration) campaign. Other networks including Viacom also dropped reruns of the original Roseanne as the industry turned its back on the show and its star performer. The swift fallout from the tweet began when Wanda Sykes  quit her role as the show\u0027s consulting producer and celebrities condemned Barr\u0027s words.   Emma Kenney, who played Sara Gilbert\u0027s daughter on the show, also revealed on Twitter that she planned to quit before finding out the show had been cancelled. \u0027I am hurt, embarrassed, and disappointed. The racist and distasteful comments from Roseanne are inexcusable,\u0027 the 18-year-old wrote. \u0027As I called my manager to quit working on Roseanne, I was told it was cancelled. I feel so empowered by @iamwandasykes , Channing Dungey and anyone at ABC standing up for morals and abuse of power. Bullies will NEVER win.\u0027Tom Arnold, who co-starred on the show from 1989 to 1993 and was married to Barr from 1990 to 1994, praised the decision to cancel the show.   \u0027Ton of respect for Bob Iger. Tough decision with financial consequences for his company but right for America,\u0027 he wrote. Michael Fishman, who played DJ Conner for the entirety of the series and was featured in the revival with a biracial daughter, said he was \u0027devastated\u0027. \u0027Today is one of the hardest days of my life. I feel devastated, not for the end of the Roseanne show, but for all those who poured their hearts and souls into our jobs, and the audience that welcomed us into their home,\u0027 he wrote on Twitter.   Comedian Wanda Sykes had earlier revealed she would not return to the show following the comedian\u0027s racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett (Pictured L-R: Sykes, Russell Peters, Barr, JB Smoove, Keenen Ivory Wayans in 2014)          Sykes, a consulting producer for Barr\u0027s eponymous show on ABC, revealed the news on Twitter          Emma Kenney, who played Sara Gilbert\u0027s daughter on the show, revealed on Twitter that she planned to quit before finding out the show had been cancelled           Tom Arnold, who co-starred on the show from 1989 to 1993 and was married to Barr from 1990 to 1994, praised the decision to cancel the showFishman said he condemned Roseanne\u0027s statement \u0027vehemently\u0027, saying they were \u0027reprehensible and intolerable\u0027 and \u0027truly offensive\u0027.  \u0027My character was designed to represent the inclusive nature of my views. To represent potions of society often marginalized,\u0027 he wrote. \u0027In this moment it is important to be clear. We must stand up against bias, hatred, bigotry, and ignorance to make society a better place for all.\u0027  Many called on ABC to fire Barr or drop the show as others criticized the broadcast network for its enduring silence amid recent controversies with the comedian.Others were skeptical that ABC would dare touch the hit series, which is the third highest-rated show this year following Sunday Night Football and This Is Us.The revival of Roseanne was a ratings juggernaut when it premiered on ABC to a whopping 25 million viewers in April.It\u0027s surprising success even elicited a congratulatory phone call and tweet from President Donald Trump. Ratings dropped steadily thereafter, with last week\u0027s season finale garnering 10.33 million viewers.ABC  initially ordered 13 episodes for the second season and said the show would move away from its controversial politics and focus on family.          Roseanne\u0027s mention of the \u0027Muslim brotherhood\u0027 seems to be due to the long-running conspiracy theory that Jarrett is Muslim, despite there being no supporting evidence           She also retweeted an article with the headline: \u0027Valerie Jarrett...was her mommy a Commie?\u0027The show most recently came under fire for featuring an episode in which Barr\u0027s character believes her new Muslim neighbors are terrorists. Roseanne\u0027s mention of the \u0027Muslim brotherhood\u0027 in her Tuesday tweet seems to be due to the long-running conspiracy theory that Jarrett is Muslim. Jarrett, who was Obama\u0027s senior adviser during his presidency, was born in Iran to American parents and lived in Shiraz for six years. The family had moved to Iran because her father was part of a program that sent American physicians to help developing countries. He ran a children\u0027s hospital.There has never been any indication that Jarrett or her parents are Muslim.  Barr later claimed the comment was a \u0027joke\u0027 when she was called out on Twitter by CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski. \u0027ABC is doing their best to ignore some of these statements from Roseanne and she is making it really hard for them by taking it to the next level here,\u0027 he wrote. After Roseanne responds, Kaczynski replied: \u0027understand it\u0027s a joke, but can you see why some people think comparing a black woman to Planet of the Apes might be racist and find the Muslim Brotherhood reference to be conspiratorial and Islamophobic?\u0027  Caravans seen outside Thwaites Brewery as 100 travellers take overHillary and Bill Clinton march in New Castle Memorial Day paradeWatch the trailer for BBC Three\u0027s drama \u0027Killed By My Debt\u0027\u0027Child rapist\u0027 left covered in blood after violent attack by mob\u0027I wanted answers\u0027: Ian Huntley\u0027s daughter on why she wrote to himShocking moment bus crash leaves dozens of vehicles destroyedOut of control bus causes cars to collide on main roadWomen throw mugs of tea and council bins at each other in street brawlMoment hero scales Parisian building to rescue dangling child5-star leader: rejection of the Econ minister is \u0027unacceptable\u0027Emergency services at scene of Aldborough helicopter crash    A number of stars have since condemned Barr for the tweet, including Patricia Arquette and Julianne Moore. Rev Al Sharpton used ABC to fire Barr, while Rosie O\u0027Donnell defended her          Not everyone was happy with ABC\u0027s decision to cancel the show. Some stood by in their support for Barr, while others said the network should have continued without her A number of celebrities  also condemned Barr for the tweet, with some urging ABC to fire her from the show completely.\u0027I am repulsed that Valerie Jarret had that racist and bigoted \u0027joke\u0027 made at her expense and I am sickened that any Black or Muslim person has to keep hearing this sickness in 2018,\u0027 Patricia Arquette tweeted. \u0027You can take @RoseanneOnABC out of racism but you can\u0027t take the racism out of @therealroseanne,\u0027 Don Cheadle wrote. \u0027I told y\u0027all about Roseanne.

the worst fire in Britain for a generationThe report also recognised that, in certain respects, the voluntary sector \u0027came up short, with some systems, structures and approaches not fit for purpose\u0027.Among its recommendations, the report said erse communities need to receive support that is sensitive to their varying needs, and such capabilities need to be embraced as core to emergency response in the UK.It said disaster response systems, behaviours and interventions all need to be tailored to the \u0027varying local socio-economic and cultural dynamics\u0027.The report recommended that, in a major disaster, local secular and faith organisations can draw on their \u0027local rootedness\u0027 to act quickly and sensitively in line with the needs of communities they understand.This capability needs to be better appreciated and supported, including in partnership with local authorities and national actors with expertise in emergency response, the report said.A spokesman for Kensington and Chelsea Council said: \u0027We are committed to learning the lessons from the Grenfell tragedy and therefore we welcome this report as part of the learning process.\u0027However, it is not right for the council to comment in detail at this stage - this is a matter for the public inquiry which is reviewing the events around the council\u0027s response to the tragedy.\u0027It is our responsibility to ensure that the whole, unvarnished truth is told so that lessons can be learned and to ensure that such a tragedy can never happen again.\u0027We will work with the inquiry to ensure this happens.\u0027 "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/02/28/16/05CC4332000003E8-5444853-Theresa_May_and_Jean_Claude_Juncker_agreed_the_outline_of_a_divo-a-6_1519834166574.jpg","title":"Energy firm SSE hikes electricity gas prices 6 7","story":"    Energy company SSE is increasing electricity and gas bills by an average of 6.7 per centThis will equate to an average increase of around £1.50 a week for customers buying both gas and electricity. Stephen Forbes, chief commercial officer of SSE Energy Services, said: \u0027We deeply regret having to raise prices and have worked hard to withstand the increasing costs that are largely outside our control by reducing our own internal costs.\u0027However, as we\u0027ve seen with recent adjustments to Ofgem\u0027s price caps, the cost of supplying energy is increasing and this ultimately impacts the prices we\u0027re able to offer customers.\u0027Claire Perry, energy and clean growth minister, said: \u0027It is extremely disappointing that SSE has decided to announce this unjustified price rise -

Rejection: President Sergio Mattarella vetoed the 5-StarLeague\u0027s choice of eurosceptic Paolo Savona as economy minister which scuppered the formation of a government this weekInstead, President Mattarella designated former IMF official Carlo Cottarelli to head a politically neutral government, which riled 5 Star and the League - and did nothing to calm financial markets.Mr Cottarelli returned for informal discussions with Mr Mattarella yesterday, after asking for more time to come up with a list of cabinet ministers, and left without comment.Unless there is a surprise imminent breakthrough, Italy will go back to elections, with most major parties calling for the president to dissolve parliament and hold a vote as soon as July 29.       Investors have been dumping Italian government bondsImpact on Britain\u0027s economy?Britain is not in the Eurozone and UK banks have already reduced their exposure to Italy, so the impact is limited, for now. However, the FTSE 100 has been pummelled, with £25 billion wiped off the value of the blue chip index on Tuesday.Italy abandoning the euro would also be bad for Europe as a whole as it would be likely to trigger a financial crisis in one of the continent\u0027s biggest economies.The pound would normally benefit from a continental crisis as investors flock to safe haven assets, but since the Brexit vote the pound has fallen out of favour and has moved up only marginally against the euro.Political implications for the UK?Analysts fear that the Euroscepticism of the League Party and Five Star Movement could ultimately spill over into a Brexit-like disaster where Italy not only crashes out of the single currency but also out of the EU.But that is a long way off and Britain has its own political crisis brewing. Theresa May\u0027s Conservative Party is yet to ink a Brexit transition deal or give any indication whatsoever of how it plans to honour its pledge to deliver the \u0027exact same\u0027 benefits of EU membership from outside the bloc.What are the experts saying?Some believe that a full blown crisis is under way.

And the thing that really matters for people is to feel that they matter.\u0027For what would every cancer patient want? To know that the best, the latest science was being used and available for them.\u0027Her daughter Jess added: \u0027The only time I\u0027ve seen mum cry since she got ill, she was sat in the waiting room and had what she described as the absolutely heartbreaking realisation that those who had that privilege of access or income may well live longer because of that and those that didn\u0027t may well die much sooner because of it.    Dame Tessa is pictured with her daughter Jess (right) and her daughter-in-law Ella Mills (left, holding Jess\u0027 child)\u0027And in her words, that is just the most despicable example of inequality. In those moments, her mission was really identified.\u0027The Health Secretary admitted that there was much about the trials he wasn\u0027t aware of until Dame Tessa brought it to his attention.\u0027There is so much we can do with the data, on the adaptive trials that I didn\u0027t know much about until Tessa brought that to my attention. But there is so much we can do.\u0027The documentary also includes a number of interviews with doctors and academics as well as patients who have been diagnosed with the same aggressive form of brain cancer as Dame Tessa.

We have fought for reproductive rights, gay rights, spent our lifetimes speaking up for women and against male violence and working to change the systems and structures that oppress us.\u0027Feminists also use Twitter to speak about another issue that threatens to erode not only our hard won rights, spaces and services, but the very definition of who we are.

I can\u0027t tell you how excited we are that the fence is down.\u0027Our fear now is that it will put it back up again - we just hope it is gone for good.\u0027I was nervous about coming to the press but I am so glad we did now - it may have saved us months of dispute.\u0027Thomas and Rebekah moved into the £220,000 four-bedroomed property on Persimmon Homes\u0027s Brook View development, just before Christmas.They arrived home from an 11-day honeymoon in the Dominican Republic earlier this month to find their home\u0027s outlook blocked by the intrusive wooden panel. And they said that since their return, their lives had been ruined by the fence - and they even considered moving out.  The couple moved into the £220,000 four-bedroom home just before Christmas last year and found the wall metres away from the side of their home when they returned from honeymoon Furious Thomas thought the fence was erected by the owner of nearby Upper Mickle Hay Farm in a dispute with Persimmon over land borders.However, Persimmon insisted that none of its development encroaches on land it does not already own.Thomas said before the wall was toppled: \u0027This was our dream home and now it\u0027s turned into a nightmare - it feels like we are imprisoned in our own house by this fence.\u0027We are being held hostage in a land dispute which is nothing to do with us.\u0027Rebekah and I have just started our own business and had to fight to get a mortgage and then to get this house.\u0027We bought it because of the view which has now been replaced by a huge wooden fence nailed to our own little one.          The wall has fallen: The Entwistle\u0027s home in Blackburn is pictured without the 6ft around it           The couple said they are fearful the wall could be put back up again but a planning meeting will decide whether it was a planning breach or not \u0027Rebekah is always in tears. She is in despair - there was no warning and the fence just appeared.\u0027It is 2ft from our front window and front door - it\u0027s like having the Berlin Wall in front of our home.\u0027 Thomas and his wife, who married in July, said they would not have even considered the property if they had known the trouble in store for them.Thomas said: \u0027We\u0027re not even sure we want to live here now.\u0027Even if the fence gets taken down there is no guarantee it won\u0027t come back later or even be extended around the back - we are in fear of that.\u0027The couple, who had moved from rented accommodation, considered employing their own solicitor.          The wooden structure is pictured on the ground after developers took it down with the help of local council officials Thomas added: \u0027At first I was tearful but now I\u0027m angry.\u0027We specifically bought this house, beating off a lot of competition, for its beautiful views and now they\u0027ve gone.\u0027We now keep the curtains closed in the front room and spend most of our time upstairs - Rebekah is too upset to be in the living room.\u0027We just want it sorted out quickly and permanently so we can enjoy our new home in peace.\u0027          Mr Entwistle was shocked to find that the enormous fence stands just two feet from his living room windowDevelopers Persimmon removed the fence after Blackburn with Darwen Council planning officials visited and told the firm the fence was constructed on land they owned.The council officials will now see if it was in breach of planning regulations.A spokesman for Persimmon Homes said: \u0027Our staff have taken down the fence after consultation with council planning officers.\u0027Local councillor Sylvia Liddle said: \u0027I am delighted for this young couple who have been so distressed - it is a victory for common sense and we now need to ensure it is a permanent solution.\u0027A spokeswoman for the farmer\u0027s land agent Gary Hoerty Associates of Grindleton declined to comment.A spokesman for Persimmon Homes said: \u0027We are confident none of our development encroaches on land not legitimately within our ownership.

Now, however, she has ‘locked-in’ syndrome. Her alert and able brain is marooned in an immobile body her mouth cannot articulate her thoughts.I imagined her condition would also have deprived her of humour and (as she cannot speak) the capacity to express it outwardly. Surely to be rendered mute and motionless must be the worst kind of imprisonment?But by some quirk of nature, and against all logic and reason, Shirley can still physically laugh. And she does so often and infectiously, bringing joy to all those around her.‘Shirley is definitely the happiest person I know,’ says one of her round-the-clock carers, Valerie Griffiths. ‘There are lots of lively and hilarious episodes with her. We laugh all the time. This isn’t a sombre job. Actually, it’s uplifting.’          Shirley, pictured with her father Henry Dennis on her wedding day aged 20 in 1980More than that, Shirley, 57, tells me — writing slowly on a computer operated by a sensor she works with her right cheek — that she is happy in some ways actually happier than she was in her former, able-bodied life.It is a startling admission and I ask her to explain. The answer takes shape slowly as she types.‘My former life was busy, noisy, pressurised and stressful, and now it’s quiet, peaceful and calm, with more time to fully appreciate life,’ she writes. ‘I’ve never really considered it before but I probably do feel liberated from the trappings of a normal working life.‘I certainly appreciate other people more and have time to fully enjoy the important things like being with friends and family. I think I feel a different kind of happiness now, born out of contentment.’It is an extraordinary response. Few of us who have the liberty to move and talk can think about being deprived of these faculties without utter horror. But Shirley has astounded, delighted and humbled me in the few weeks I have known her. She is, quite frankly, an extraordinary inidual.We spent several weeks swapping emails — she returning eloquent, thoughtful and often witty responses to my questions — before I visit her.I ask Shirley if she has ever, in her darkest days, succumbed to despair ever considered taking her own life.Her answer is emphatic. ‘Not even for a split second,’ she tells me. ‘My view is that a limited life is better than no life at all. However, I respect the views of those who differ. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.‘There were many dark moments during the first year,’ she concedes. ‘I cried a lot. But as my level of acceptance increased, so did my level of happiness.’She lives in a village on the edge of Dartmoor, Devon, in a specially-adapted bungalow next to a residential care home. Light streams through the French doors. There is a view of fields, and her cats, Smudge and Tigger, stretch languidly in the sun.  Shirley, pictured left on her wedding day in 1980 and right, aged 36, graduating from the University of the West of England in Bristol was not expected to survive her strokeShirley remains married to her husband, whom she won’t name (‘he’d kill me!’) but who lives nearby and visits often. He still runs the family farm on which she grew up.They didn’t have any children, which, she says, is not a regret because she did not want any in the first place.A good and loyal wife still, she respects his privacy. Questions as to how he copes with their situation, the nature of their relationship, whether he has found someone else, and whether she would be accepting if he did, are batted away with good humour but certitude. The no-nonsense, ruddy country girl has not gone away.‘I still love my husband,’ she says. ‘He makes me laugh. I miss him not being with me but I accept he couldn’t care for me. It would be a very demanding job. But it’s important that I’m still married.’ And that is the end of the conversation.Her constant companions are her carers. Valerie, 58 — cheerful and calm with a lilting Welsh accent — has been one of two regular carers for five-and-a-half years and works for two weeks, staying overnight in the bungalow’s bright spare bedroom, then has two weeks off when another carer comes.Extra carers from the adjacent home come in three times daily to help dress, wash and feed Shirley.She is still fiercely independent in many ways, however. She shops for clothes and groceries on the internet and manages her own care.          Shirley, aged 13 in school‘She types notes to us each day about food portions, heating, what she’d like to wear the positioning of the bed — things like that,’ explains Valerie.‘Are you allowed to say if you don’t like a carer?’ I ask Shirley. She laughs. ‘I’ve done so loads of times,’ she says. ‘I’ve sent carers away! I look for humour, patience no fuss.’It is a measure of her tenacity and determination that since she became locked in she has taken two Open University degrees — a Bachelor’s and a Master’s in social sciences with politics.The graduation certificates are framed and proudly displayed on the wall.For four hours a day, Shirley studied with the help of computer software that read books aloud to her. Exams were a test of endurance: Shirley was permitted four hours for every one hour of a usual exam.This meant standard three-hour exams — completed at her home in the presence of an invigilator — took 12 hours and were spaced over three days.I ask if the feeling of triumph when she graduated was magnified because of the effort involved. ‘Definitely!’ She smiles.She is an only child and her mum, who died three years ago, never properly recovered from the shock of seeing her daughter so severely disabled. ‘It was very hard for her,’ says Shirley, with understatement.Her dad Henry, who turned 90 in April, visits twice weekly and takes her on outings, usually to a park in Okehampton, and sometimes out to lunch. She enjoys the occasional vodka and orange. Eating and tasting food — which she is fed in pureed form — is also a positive pleasure that might have been denied to her had she not been so determined to learn to swallow.‘After my stroke I was fed through a peg-tube direct into my stomach,’ she remembers.‘I wasn’t even able to swallow saliva and I was told that I’d never be able to swallow. But with practice, initially through illicit consumption of chocolate buttons at the rehab centre where I went after hospital, I reached my goal of being able to eat.’Who fed you the forbidden chocolate buttons? I ask, amused. ‘My husband!’ she says. ‘I suppose you could have choked?’ I remark.She raises her eyes upwards, her signal for yes, and types: ‘But he didn’t dare say no!’          Despite her condition, she has successfully completed two Open University degrees - a Bachelor\u0027s and a Master\u0027s in social sciences with politics Grit and tenacity have always been strong components of Shirley’s personality — she would joke that she is actually ‘stubborn and awkward’ — and neither of these qualities has diminished since her stroke.She says she often thinks about her old life — not with wistful regret, but with pleasure that she has good memories to draw upon — and about the job she loved, her marriage and the farm.Her leisure time used to be full of activity. She loved aerobics, socialising with friends and, having grown up on her parents’ farm, the countryside and walking were in her blood.History remains a passion. Holidays in her old life were spent travelling to places ‘that had a bit of history about them’. Today, she admits the logistics are tricky — every outing assumes the complexity of a military manoeuvre — so she doesn’t venture far from home for more than a few days.In her old life she qualified as a solicitor through sheer hard graft. Having joined a law firm in Okehampton as an office junior straight from school at 17, she became a secretary, then, after a few years, studied to become a legal executive by correspondence course, while doing her day job.Finally she qualified in law in 1997 — her area of expertise was residential conveyancing — studying at weekends and passing her exams while still running a busy legal practice.          Shirley learned how to swallow again after being smuggled chocolate buttons by her husband while in a rehab centreEverything came to an abrupt halt one awful Sunday morning in December 2002. Shirley recalls: ‘I woke up with a splitting headache and, when I tried to get out of bed, I found that I had severe vertigo so went back to bed and stayed there much of the day.‘I felt a bit better late afternoon, and as I thought that some fresh air would do me good, I got up and went down to the farm for a walk.‘While I was there, I thought I would make myself useful and feed a few of the animals. But, while I was doing it, I felt a bit dizzy so sat down on a pile of hay.‘It was obviously then that I had my stroke, because the next thing I knew I was coming around in intensive care a couple of weeks later.’Much of what happened during her four weeks in hospital is obliterated from her memory. However, during the ensuing 16 months in a neurological rehab centre, the implications of the stroke hit her. ‘I didn’t handle it well. I cried a lot,’ she says of those early days.I wonder if the terror of being unable to communicate was her worst fear, but she explains that even in the early weeks she learned to raise her eyes to signal ‘yes’ and look down to indicate ‘no’.Communication with Shirley is necessarily a laborious process. If she is not at her computer, she spells out words with the help of an alphabet board, building them up painstakingly by blinking when her listener indicates the correct letter on the board.Inside, of course, her active brain is buzzing her sentences ready-formed into eloquent expressions of thought.I cannot imagine, I say, how frustrating it must be when strangers assume she does not understand them, because of her disability, and talk to her carer instead.‘At first it annoyed me,’ she admits. ‘But I’ve come to accept it as inevitable. Most people have never even heard of locked-in syndrome, let alone know what it is, so don’t know what to expect and can only go on appearance.‘I occasionally get frustrated when people don’t understand what I’m trying to say, but generally I’ve accepted my condition. It happened, I can’t turn the clock back, so I’ve just got to make the best of it.’Acceptance. It seems to be the key to Shirley’s happiness. That, and her obdurate refusal to ever capitulate.When she came out of rehab, it was obvious she would need professional care. Medics favoured a nursing home, but Shirley, then just 42, did not agree. ‘I’m not at all suited to institutional living,’ she says. ‘I’m far too independent. So they had to think again.’Their solution was judicious and creative. Her little bungalow, in a small assisted living complex next to the care home, gives her both a degree of autonomy and the comfort of knowing that, aside from her regular carer, there is constant support at hand. ‘Thankfully,’ she adds, ‘apart from the occasional bit of cramp or backache that everyone gets, I’m not in pain.’Because Shirley has such a rare capacity for joy, a visit to her home leaves you filled with an unexpected optimism that even the bleakest of personal tragedies can be turned into triumph.          Shirley said her life changed in December 2002 when she had a splitting headache and was unable to get out of bed because of vertigo‘I find joy in almost anything, no matter how small,’ she says. ‘And recently I’ve experienced the joy of watching my beloved Manchester City, who I’ve supported for 50 years, have such a record-breaking season.‘I’m very much a lady of leisure these days and, unless I’m going out, I spend much of the daytime at the computer, keeping in touch with friends and family by email or via Facebook, surfing the internet or watching TV.‘I like watching most sports, as well as historical documentaries and comedy. I laugh at just about anything and I generally laugh loudly. In fact, I only have to think of something funny and I start giggling.‘I’ve come to the conclusion,’ she adds, ‘that my brain’s default setting is happiness’ — and as I wave goodbye to her and turn to walk down the drive, once again I hear the glorious ripple of her laughter. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/28/14/4CB208FD00000578-0-image-a-18_1527514498676.jpg","title":"Britains biggest beer festival offer alcohol free ales time history","story":"    A Dutch beer will be the first alcohol-free ale on sale at the Campaign for Real Ale’s Great British Beer Festival in AugustBraxzz Brewery has developed an alcohol-free IPA and the world’s first alcohol-free porter ale.Coca-Cola launches its first ever alcoholic drink: Fizzy...See what alcohol does to the heart: Shocking images show the...Share this articleFestival organiser Catherine Tonry said: “Alcohol-free beer has become increasingly important in recent years and thankfully brewers have been keeping pace with consumer demands. “There are now some fantastic innovations in the sector and a much wider range of styles and flavours than ever before.“We are thrilled to provide an alcohol-free alternative to festival-goers who cannot or choose not to drink.”          Festival organiser Catherine Tonry says alcohol-free beer has become increasingly popular with consumersJames Leary, of Braxzz, said: “We are delighted to be attending the Great British Beer Festival for hopefully the first of many appearances.“We hope to provide something different at the event and give another option to anybody who will not be drinking but still want to taste craft ale.” "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/30/14/4CC13F3200000578-5785135-image-m-126_1527687950538.jpg","title":"John Goodman Sara Gilbert spotted Roseanne canceled","story":"Roseanne Barr unleashed a fresh stream of Twitter abuse overnight on Tuesday, retweeing several deeply offensive posts just hours after her show was cancelled for her racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett. Among the tweets were ones that pictured Jarrett next to a character from Planet of the Apes, and a doctored image of Whoopie Goldberg wearing a t-shirt that shows Trump shooting himself in the head      Despite apologizing for her previous comments about George Soros and Valerie Jarrett, Barr retweeted a stream of content that backed her remarks while wading into other right-wing causes and conspiracies      Barr also said she thought former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett was white when she penned the racist tweet that got her show pulled from television          Barr said she though Jarrett \u0027was Jewish and Persian\u0027 amid a bizarre flurry tweets penned late on Tuesday night          Valerie Jarrett was born in Iran but both of her parents are African American, and her great-grandfather was the first credited African American architect. She appeared on MSNBC on Tuesday (pictured) to lay blame for Barr\u0027s rhetoric at the feet of President Trump, saying: \u0027The tone comes from the top\u0027          The shamed star also blamed her racist rant on sleeping pill Ambien. Users have previously reported going into blackouts and performing complex actions such as driving and making food without recalling it           Roseanne\u0027s show was the most viewed program on ABC before it was cancelled over a tweet in which she said Jarrett was the lovechild of the \u0027Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes\u0027          Actor John Goodman, 65, stepped out to walk his dog in New Orleans on Tuesday soon after news broke that his show \u0027Roseanne\u0027 had been canceled because of his castmate Roseanne Barr\u0027s racist tweets          She then went on to rant about what she described as a Soros plot to overthrow America \u0027by buyingbacking candidates 4 local district attorney races who will ignore US law \u0026amp favor \u0027feelings\u0027 instead-and call everyone who is alarmed by that \u0027racist\u0027.\u0027Following on from that, she called on Americans to unite against his narrative while throwing a reference to MK Ultra, a discontinued CIA program that right-wing conspiracy theorists believe is still ongoing, into the mix           It was during this rant that Barr made the comment \u0027muslim brotherhood and planet of the apes had a babyvj\u0027, using Valerie Jarrett\u0027s initials, that would see her show axed.Barr subsequently deleted the tweet but not before it had been copied and shared across social media, leading to swift calls for her show to be pulled from the air.          After Barr\u0027s now-infamous Planet of the Apes tweet had been sent, Clinton replied around 9am to say that she was not in fact married to a Soros, though she admired the work his foundation does.Barr subsequently sent a Tweet apologizing to Clinton for the mistake, though launched another broadside at Soros by claiming he was a \u0027Nazi\u0027 who betrayed Jews during the holocaust.The actress also launched a salvo at Clinton\u0027s actual husband, Marc Mezvinsky, saying: \u0027HER HUSBAND IS THE SON OF A CORRUPT SENATOR.\u0027Clinton\u0027s father-in-law is a former congressman and convicted felon who in March of 2001 plead guilty to 31 of 69 felony charges of mail, bank and wire fraud.            But as the Clinton saga wound to a close Barr\u0027s tweet about Jarrett was catching a massive amount of attention, forcing the actress to brand her remark \u0027a joke\u0027.She also defended herself against allegations of racism by countering that Islam \u0027is not a race\u0027.The remarks were not enough, however, and around an hour later she offered a full apology to Jarrett and announced that she would be leaving Twitter.           Shortly after midday Wanda Sykes, an African-American comedian and writer working on the Roseanne reboot, announced that she was walking away from the program.Around an hour later ABC broke its silence over the controversy to say that Roseanne was being cancelled.We now know that the network spent this time contacting Jarrett to apologize and inform her of the cancellation.Barr later said that the network had bowed to pressure amid calls for a boycott of Roseanne\u0027s advertisers, though ABC did not immediately respond to her remark.In its statement, ABC said Roseanne\u0027s remark was \u0027abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values\u0027.       Caravans seen outside Thwaites Brewery as 100 travellers take overHillary and Bill Clinton march in New Castle Memorial Day paradeWatch the trailer for BBC Three\u0027s drama \u0027Killed By My Debt\u0027\u0027Child rapist\u0027 left covered in blood after violent attack by mob\u0027I wanted answers\u0027: Ian Huntley\u0027s daughter on why she wrote to himShocking moment bus crash leaves dozens of vehicles destroyedOut of control bus causes cars to collide on main roadWomen throw mugs of tea and council bins at each other in street brawlMoment hero scales Parisian building to rescue dangling child5-star leader: rejection of the Econ minister is \u0027unacceptable\u0027Emergency services at scene of Aldborough helicopter crashSoon after the news broke, Goodman, who played Barr\u0027s husband Dan on the TV show, was spotted looking very glum as he walked his dog          Goodman, 65, is yet to offer any comment on Barr\u0027s tweets or their show being axed          Gilbert, who played Darlene Conner on the series, had earlier slammed Barr\u0027s tweets as \u0027abhorrent\u0027  Barr also lashed out at former costar Sara Gilbert for her reaction to the racism row, in which Gilbert called her comments \u0027abhorrent\u0027 and \u0027disappointing\u0027, by saying \u0027wow! unreal\u0027  Bar clapped back at Michael Fishman, who played DJ Conner for the entirety of the series and was featured in the revival with a biracial daughter, accusing him of throwing her under a bus      Caravans seen outside Thwaites Brewery as 100 travellers take overHillary and Bill Clinton march in New Castle Memorial Day paradeWatch the trailer for BBC Three\u0027s drama \u0027Killed By My Debt\u0027\u0027Child rapist\u0027 left covered in blood after violent attack by mob\u0027I wanted answers\u0027: Ian Huntley\u0027s daughter on why she wrote to himShocking moment bus crash leaves dozens of vehicles destroyedOut of control bus causes cars to collide on main roadWomen throw mugs of tea and council bins at each other in street brawlMoment hero scales Parisian building to rescue dangling child5-star leader: rejection of the Econ minister is \u0027unacceptable\u0027Emergency services at scene of Aldborough helicopter crashBarr was widely condemned after she tweeted that Jarrett looked like \u0027Muslim brotherhood \u0026amp planet of the apes had a baby\u0027.Jarrett responded to the ordeal when she spoke at a town hall on MSNBC called \u0027Everyday Racism in America\u0027 later on Tuesday. She revealed that Disney CEO Bob Iger had called her to apologize.\u0027He wanted me to know before he made it public that he was canceling the show,\u0027 she said. \u0027First of all, I think we have to turn it into a teaching moment.

Effective immediately, Roseanne Barr is no longer a client.\u0027 It appears the cancellation of the show will also affect the cast\u0027s Emmy prospects, as ABC revealed it is suspending the show\u0027s FYC (For Your Consideration) campaign. Other networks including Viacom also dropped reruns of the original Roseanne as the industry turned its back on the show and its star performer. The swift fallout from the tweet began when Wanda Sykes  quit her role as the show\u0027s consulting producer and celebrities condemned Barr\u0027s words.   Emma Kenney, who played Sara Gilbert\u0027s daughter on the show, also revealed on Twitter that she planned to quit before finding out the show had been cancelled. \u0027I am hurt, embarrassed, and disappointed. The racist and distasteful comments from Roseanne are inexcusable,\u0027 the 18-year-old wrote. \u0027As I called my manager to quit working on Roseanne, I was told it was cancelled. I feel so empowered by @iamwandasykes , Channing Dungey and anyone at ABC standing up for morals and abuse of power. Bullies will NEVER win.\u0027Tom Arnold, who co-starred on the show from 1989 to 1993 and was married to Barr from 1990 to 1994, praised the decision to cancel the show.   \u0027Ton of respect for Bob Iger. Tough decision with financial consequences for his company but right for America,\u0027 he wrote. Michael Fishman, who played DJ Conner for the entirety of the series and was featured in the revival with a biracial daughter, said he was \u0027devastated\u0027. \u0027Today is one of the hardest days of my life. I feel devastated, not for the end of the Roseanne show, but for all those who poured their hearts and souls into our jobs, and the audience that welcomed us into their home,\u0027 he wrote on Twitter.   Comedian Wanda Sykes had earlier revealed she would not return to the show following the comedian\u0027s racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett (Pictured L-R: Sykes, Russell Peters, Barr, JB Smoove, Keenen Ivory Wayans in 2014)          Sykes, a consulting producer for Barr\u0027s eponymous show on ABC, revealed the news on Twitter          Emma Kenney, who played Sara Gilbert\u0027s daughter on the show, revealed on Twitter that she planned to quit before finding out the show had been cancelled           Tom Arnold, who co-starred on the show from 1989 to 1993 and was married to Barr from 1990 to 1994, praised the decision to cancel the showFishman said he condemned Roseanne\u0027s statement \u0027vehemently\u0027, saying they were \u0027reprehensible and intolerable\u0027 and \u0027truly offensive\u0027.  \u0027My character was designed to represent the inclusive nature of my views. To represent potions of society often marginalized,\u0027 he wrote. \u0027In this moment it is important to be clear. We must stand up against bias, hatred, bigotry, and ignorance to make society a better place for all.\u0027  Many called on ABC to fire Barr or drop the show as others criticized the broadcast network for its enduring silence amid recent controversies with the comedian.Others were skeptical that ABC would dare touch the hit series, which is the third highest-rated show this year following Sunday Night Football and This Is Us.The revival of Roseanne was a ratings juggernaut when it premiered on ABC to a whopping 25 million viewers in April.It\u0027s surprising success even elicited a congratulatory phone call and tweet from President Donald Trump. Ratings dropped steadily thereafter, with last week\u0027s season finale garnering 10.33 million viewers.ABC  initially ordered 13 episodes for the second season and said the show would move away from its controversial politics and focus on family.          Roseanne\u0027s mention of the \u0027Muslim brotherhood\u0027 seems to be due to the long-running conspiracy theory that Jarrett is Muslim, despite there being no supporting evidence           She also retweeted an article with the headline: \u0027Valerie Jarrett...was her mommy a Commie?\u0027The show most recently came under fire for featuring an episode in which Barr\u0027s character believes her new Muslim neighbors are terrorists. Roseanne\u0027s mention of the \u0027Muslim brotherhood\u0027 in her Tuesday tweet seems to be due to the long-running conspiracy theory that Jarrett is Muslim. Jarrett, who was Obama\u0027s senior adviser during his presidency, was born in Iran to American parents and lived in Shiraz for six years. The family had moved to Iran because her father was part of a program that sent American physicians to help developing countries. He ran a children\u0027s hospital.There has never been any indication that Jarrett or her parents are Muslim.  Barr later claimed the comment was a \u0027joke\u0027 when she was called out on Twitter by CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski. \u0027ABC is doing their best to ignore some of these statements from Roseanne and she is making it really hard for them by taking it to the next level here,\u0027 he wrote. After Roseanne responds, Kaczynski replied: \u0027understand it\u0027s a joke, but can you see why some people think comparing a black woman to Planet of the Apes might be racist and find the Muslim Brotherhood reference to be conspiratorial and Islamophobic?\u0027  Caravans seen outside Thwaites Brewery as 100 travellers take overHillary and Bill Clinton march in New Castle Memorial Day paradeWatch the trailer for BBC Three\u0027s drama \u0027Killed By My Debt\u0027\u0027Child rapist\u0027 left covered in blood after violent attack by mob\u0027I wanted answers\u0027: Ian Huntley\u0027s daughter on why she wrote to himShocking moment bus crash leaves dozens of vehicles destroyedOut of control bus causes cars to collide on main roadWomen throw mugs of tea and council bins at each other in street brawlMoment hero scales Parisian building to rescue dangling child5-star leader: rejection of the Econ minister is \u0027unacceptable\u0027Emergency services at scene of Aldborough helicopter crash    A number of stars have since condemned Barr for the tweet, including Patricia Arquette and Julianne Moore. Rev Al Sharpton used ABC to fire Barr, while Rosie O\u0027Donnell defended her          Not everyone was happy with ABC\u0027s decision to cancel the show. Some stood by in their support for Barr, while others said the network should have continued without her A number of celebrities  also condemned Barr for the tweet, with some urging ABC to fire her from the show completely.\u0027I am repulsed that Valerie Jarret had that racist and bigoted \u0027joke\u0027 made at her expense and I am sickened that any Black or Muslim person has to keep hearing this sickness in 2018,\u0027 Patricia Arquette tweeted. \u0027You can take @RoseanneOnABC out of racism but you can\u0027t take the racism out of @therealroseanne,\u0027 Don Cheadle wrote. \u0027I told y\u0027all about Roseanne.

She made a mistake.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know why fellow conservatives are playing mental gymnastics trying to justify it. Come on. Wrong is wrong.\u0027 Only Rosie O\u0027Donnell appeared to lend some support to Roseanne, writing that she loved her \u0027quite a bit\u0027. \u0027The comment Roseanne tweeted was racist and childish and beneath her best self,\u0027 O\u0027Donnell wrote. \u0027She has apologized.

I disagree on some things, but give him benefit of doubt-4 now,\u0027 she added. The tweet was similar to when, in 2015, Barr revealed that she believed the Pizzagate conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton was running a child sex-ring in a pizza shop. \u0027Americans! The reason #DEMOCRATS aren\u0027t approving #Sessions is bc he will prosecure #HRC – and make arrests over PedoGate RT THIS!! WAKE UP!!\u0027Barr was slammed and derided for the tweets.

Rejection: President Sergio Mattarella vetoed the 5-StarLeague\u0027s choice of eurosceptic Paolo Savona as economy minister which scuppered the formation of a government this weekInstead, President Mattarella designated former IMF official Carlo Cottarelli to head a politically neutral government, which riled 5 Star and the League - and did nothing to calm financial markets.Mr Cottarelli returned for informal discussions with Mr Mattarella yesterday, after asking for more time to come up with a list of cabinet ministers, and left without comment.Unless there is a surprise imminent breakthrough, Italy will go back to elections, with most major parties calling for the president to dissolve parliament and hold a vote as soon as July 29.       Investors have been dumping Italian government bondsImpact on Britain\u0027s economy?Britain is not in the Eurozone and UK banks have already reduced their exposure to Italy, so the impact is limited, for now. However, the FTSE 100 has been pummelled, with £25 billion wiped off the value of the blue chip index on Tuesday.Italy abandoning the euro would also be bad for Europe as a whole as it would be likely to trigger a financial crisis in one of the continent\u0027s biggest economies.The pound would normally benefit from a continental crisis as investors flock to safe haven assets, but since the Brexit vote the pound has fallen out of favour and has moved up only marginally against the euro.Political implications for the UK?Analysts fear that the Euroscepticism of the League Party and Five Star Movement could ultimately spill over into a Brexit-like disaster where Italy not only crashes out of the single currency but also out of the EU.But that is a long way off and Britain has its own political crisis brewing. Theresa May\u0027s Conservative Party is yet to ink a Brexit transition deal or give any indication whatsoever of how it plans to honour its pledge to deliver the \u0027exact same\u0027 benefits of EU membership from outside the bloc.What are the experts saying?Some believe that a full blown crisis is under way.

But why do so many people ask if he’s my boyfriend?’The boy is a close friend, an artist I met in Ghana about a year before I made this photo. The image perfectly captures our relationship at the time: the affection, the intimacy and the vulnerability. People who see this often ask: “Is that your boyfriend?” It’s a double standard. I’m not sure male photographers get asked that kind of question.I’d been working a lot with my family, particularly my sisters, and was timid about making images of men’s bodies. I don’t think I was ready to navigate friendship and desire in the way this image does.We met at a guesthouse in Accra, the capital of Ghana, and shot for over three hours. We talked, joked around and tried out different positions. It wasn’t organised with an end result in mind. We just tried to set up a comfortable environment so that something could emerge. There’s something off about the shot that I really like. Is he going to sleep or just waking up? Is this a body you desire? Is it the precursor to something more? There’s an ambiguity, which I hope makes people think. More than anything, though, I love the tenderness, the way his hands fall on his belly like he’s protecting himself. There’s a nervousness that comes with letting yourself be vulnerable with someone else, let alone someone with a camera. Cropping off his head draws your attention to those other features. You stop asking, “Who is he?” and start looking at the way different parts of the body can communicate things.Society puts immense pressure on people to look a certain way, to have a certain type of body. That has always been the case for women, but men are increasingly held up to these unattainable standards. Our bodies are such interesting conglomerations of things, I don’t think they should all have to fit the same mould.I wanted to open up the idea of what can be desired. To the western eye, images of black men are usually hypersexualised or super intense. It’s rare to see one at rest, let alone one that seems so vulnerable. These bodies don’t often get featured in the major galleries or shows. But as a photographer, I don’t think I should just complain about that. I have the ability to make the images that I want to see in the world.When you’re working with people in a state of undress, you have to realise how much you’re asking of them. They may have insecurities and quirks you can’t fully understand. Photographers haven’t always cared enough about that. I try to be sensitive, to explore how power dynamics change when it’s a woman behind the camera and a man in front of it. Throughout history, the male gaze has usually been about asserting power. I think about how to be fair, how I would feel if it was me. I hope my work is a starting point for people to think about bodies in different ways.Studied: BFA (University of Cape Town, Michaelis School of Fine Art).Influences: Rotimi Fani-Kayode, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Rinko Kawauchi, the Muppet show, Michael Jackson.High point: “Living and working as an artist.”Low point: “Dealing with the shadiness of the art world.”Top tip: “Read as much as you can.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f623ca269ef176dfaa8c30cff1cf576b36673a4/0_0_3579_2147/master/3579.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10f722602bfff05ec9a0e7d210cdb343","title":"frank horvat in pictures","story":"Italian-born photographer Frank Horvat, a contemporary of Henri Cartier-Bresson, revolutionised fashion shoots with his black-and-white realism and eye for a killer pose"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a137e0ccef0b5443fc790dda3a3b7b76c88eba84/0_33_3474_2084/master/3474.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=305b1af0e4798a2bc06f3c8622b344f4","title":"michael morpugo reveals radiotherapy treatment","story":"Author, 74, says he has ‘excellent prospects’ after radiotherapy at Royal Marsden hospital cancer centreSir Michael Morpurgo has revealed he has been battling cancer of the larynx.The author, 74, was diagnosed last year and underwent radiotherapy at the Royal Marsden hospital, he said on Wednesday.He said he had “excellent prospects for a full recovery” and his voice was finding “new strength”.The former children’s laureate opened up about his treatment in this week’s Spectator.In the diary entry he said: “By 74 it is easy to feel that you have seen it all, done it all, that nothing much surprises you any more.”He added: “Even an unwelcome medical diagnosis does not surprise you. You cope because you have to. You know it’s what happens to us all. You’ve been lucky all these years. Now it’s your turn, stuff happens. That’s life, you tell yourself, or the other thing.“Friends and family much younger have been ill, and suffered long some have fallen off the perch younger than I am now.

It wasn’t only the radiotherapy doing the healing. It was the memories of those children too.“They helped me through, helped me to keep hoping, keep believing. They still do, every day,” he added.In a follow-up statement to the Press Association, he said: “Last year I was diagnosed with an early cancer of the larynx and my perspective on so much changed.“Suddenly the disease became central to my life at home, and to my work.

The city showed that it had a well-established record of achieving high environmental standards and had ambitious goals for improving the environment and sustainable development.With such an environmentally sound reputation, there are many jewels in Bristol’s green business crown. Here are 10 companies helping to grow the city’s green economy …RefillRefill launched in Bristol in September 2015 and is now a nationwide scheme. It was started by the people behind the equally environmentally conscious City to Sea, that campaigns to help tackle the problem of plastics in our oceans. Refill aims to bring together businesses, cafes, museums and other public spaces to make water available for the public to refill their own water bottles, reducing the demand for single-use plastics. There is also a Refill app where you can find free water sources nearby and also add your own refill stations.SkipchenSkipchen’s aim is to tackle food waste. In 2014 it ran an extremely successful pop-up cafe in Bristol that repurposed food that discarded by supermarkets and other restaurants that was still perfectly good for eating. It now operates within the community by having conversations about the problems of waste and working with businesses in collecting their surplus. More recently, Skipchen travelled to areas including Lesbos in Greece, working to help feed refugees out of its Food Rescue Ambulance.Bee the ChangeAs part of the Bristol Green Capital Partnership, Bee the Change set up community bee hives around the city that are nurtured and cared for by the community. It also gave educational talks in schools, universities and other organisations to discuss the role of bees in the environment, as well as allowing attendees to extract their own honey. Bee the Change also plants bee forage (their food supply – nectar and pollen from blossoming plants) and builds sanctuaries for local bees. If you’re keen on getting your own beekeeping wings, natural beekeeping courses are available for groups or iniduals.Incredible Edible BristolIncredible Edible launched in Todmorden, Yorkshire, and has since spread as far as Canada, New Zealand … and Bristol too. It works hard to encourage locals to take advantage of whatever land they have, and nurture it to grow their own food. Thanks to the Bristol team, there are now 30 edible gardens scattered across the city – in parks, on street corners and even in station car parks – that are cared for by volunteers. It’s available for anyone to take away and use to make delicious meals – think herbs and easily grown veg.Grow BristolWhen you think of farming you probably think of huge expanses of fields, tractors and endless countryside. Well, Grow Bristol is here to make you think differently, through urban farming. The urban farming enterprise is developing innovative and sustainable ways to grow food in the city to benefit the people who live there, and has won awards for its work. It supplies greens and other produce to organisations including Farmdrop, who deliver local produce, and Source food hall and cafe, as well as local restaurants.The Severn ProjectAlthough it has a similar model of sustainable food growing as Grow Bristol and Incredible Edible, the Severn Project also helps support people who are recovering from addiction and other mental health issues, and assists ex-offenders by helping them return to employment. Currently, the Severn Project grows produce such as spinach and micro herbs in 1.5 acres of polytunnels, where it also harvests rainwater.Zero GreenIf you’re trying to avoid buying products with excess plastic packaging, it can be tricky finding suitable produce in your local supermarket. Zero Green is Bristol’s first waste-free food shop: customers bring their own containers and bags to fill up with everyday items such as rice and pasta, washing powder and shampoo. The shop is even fitted out with reclaimed wood from the Bristol Wood Recycling Project, which goes to show how well the eco-community in Bristol works together.Bristol Wood Recycling ProjectThe Bristol Wood Recycling Project wants to make sure no wood goes to waste. It reclaims unused wood and provides affordable wood to the community through a small range of furniture and budget firewood and kindling. The project also fosters a community of volunteers who work at the yard.Real Wrap Co.Real Wrap Co. is an environmentally friendly sandwich company that supplies local universities and other big contracts. It produces about 100,000 products a week, but sends almost zero food waste to landfill. It was featured on Channel 4’s Food Unwrapped for being one of the first sandwich companies in the UK to supply leftover bread for the making of beer, to help cut waste.To find out more about how you can support green energy and save money on your bills, visit bristol-energy"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/446013b2d2bbf76ae9a2a5a09551c502369b63b6/0_0_4163_2498/master/4163.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba933f6e47e93b4d9a2a7ee42517d4a6","title":"italy brussels descent abyss eu economics","story":"As much as some want to believe it, the EU has little to do with the country’s failure to put its house in orderAs Italians wrestle with their constitution and possibly head towards another general election, are they victims of a financial swindle perpetrated by the Germans? To read some of the commentary, and hear voices from the streets of Rome and Naples, you would think that they were.The people of Athens accused the Germans and, to a lesser extent, the French, who between them are the main props of the single currency, of being the architects of their impoverishment. It seems many Italians have followed suit.But can a country be a victim of a financial fraud in the way that, say, an inidual is the victim of clever marketing by a bank selling insurance that will never pay out?The mismatch in information and expertise between an inidual and their bank is colossal. It’s why we have regulators, and why regulators are supposed to keep tabs on the banks’ latest money-making wheezes.A quick look at the financial crisis and its impact on the euro area shows that there were several countries found with their pants down when Lehman Brothers went bust. Ireland, Spain and Portugal were especially hard hit.Yet none of these countries blamed the euro for their ills. The Irish realised that they had binged on euros – borrowed at rates previously only available to bigger AAA-rated countries – to generate a property boom of extraordinary proportions, pay public sector workers as if they were commercial marketing executives and generally live high on the hog.When the government of the day pushed through some of the most eye-watering austerity measures anywhere in Europe, the lack of equality in its impact was decided in Dublin, not Brussels.The Spanish also spent oodles of cheap euros on a property boom and a ludicrous obsession with infrastructure that meant it either built or planned 30-plus international airports, most of which were scrapped or mothballed.How could Madrid blame others for this frenzied attempt to escape its relatively recent agrarian past and enter the 21st century in supersonic style? These were homegrown decisions. Likewise Portugal, which elected a left-of-centre government that got on with the job of enacting sensible economic policies to escape austerity, improve employment prospects and stay within its meagre budget. Italians, on the other hand, cannot get their own house in order. Instead they search around for someone else to blame. A classic example can be seen in Venice, where beautiful ochre and rust red plaster falls off its stunning palazzos at regular intervals into the canals, never to be replaced. Renovation must be done according to ancient practices, and at huge cost. This rule is imposed by a regional authority that will brook no compromise, not even those put forward by city council. Subsidies that were once offered have been scrapped, leaving the buildings exposed to the elements.Then there is the mafia, mass early retirement, huge levels of tax evasion and avoidance, and a low birthrate. These are all problems created in Italy, not Brussels.That doesn’t mean the reaction of Brussels technocrats is in any way uplifting. They do themselves no favours when they deny any relationship with Rome or any part in its crisis. The euro has suited the Germans, who get a cheap currency relative to the country’s strength, and harmed Italian exporters, who have to battle against the headwind of an expensive currency.And if the European Union is to survive, it must show a recognition that lenders are complicit in any bankruptcy, just as the creditor is. If a bank or government lends money to Italy, it does it knowing the country is on an arc of decline that could accelerate at any moment, given the volatile nature of international financial markets. That means that when problems hit, debt forgiveness must be part of the deal, just as it should have been when Greece found itself unable to borrow.But the disturbingly hard line taken by some Brussels officials against Italy should not detract from the fact that Italy is the architect of its Byzantine public sector structures, bizarre tax rules and sclerotic employment regulations. Not those who designed the euro or the EU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93259c1dfacb0e70509956ac39a6988a63ec7818/0_0_2536_1521/master/2536.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e9a5ada6f90bdc2cff3d21d20d12512","title":"roseanne barr tweets conservative liberal","story":"As the new king of primetime, Richard Madeley said of Roseanne Barr’s disgusting tweets that sedatives don’t make you racist. Barr, whose show has now been cancelled, left Twitter after comparing a woman of colour to an ape and then reappeared claiming that the sleeping pill Ambien had made her say these awful things. She has also said that she is being picked on while other celebrities are not.Her excellent cast has distanced itself from her outbursts, but still she goes on. Watching this woman has for some time been like watching a car crash, and yet her talent is undeniable.When I first saw that Barr was on Twitter, years ago, I was delighted. A working-class heroine is something to be. Or it was at one time. She wrote about imperfect, complicated blue-collar life with edge. In the 90s there was no dishwasher in the Conner family house. They went to the mall, the phone was on the wall, the protagonists were overweight but had a sex life, jobs were hard to come by and the women were often smarter than the men. All of this was an inspiration, with Roseanne as the wisecracking self-styled slobby “domestic goddess” .And then Barr unravelled before our eyes. Physically self-loathing, she had numerous plastic surgeries. She claimed to have been abused by her parents after memories came flooding back. Twenty years after making those allegations, she said that going public with them was a terrible mistake .As a child she had Bell’s palsy. She nearly died in a car accident at 16 and had such traumatic head injuries that she ended up in a psychiatric institution for eight months. In 2012 she ran for presidential nomination. She claims Donald Trump stole her Twitter act.The euphemism used for her is “troubled”. These latest tweets, as obnoxious as they are, are nothing new – Barr has been tweeting outlandish conspiracy theories and racist rants for ages, from rubbish about chemtrails to vicious Islamophobic insults. Her support for Trump came as no surprise. That trajectory was visible. She says of herself that she is a radical and not a liberal, and there is something uncomfortable there that the media establishment don’t want to reckon with.When she married Tom Arnold in 1990, he and Barr claimed that they were America’s worst nightmare – “white trash with money”. The thing is, though, the Conner household were smart. They were shown reading actual books.The reaction to Barr’s new show was critically mixed but she got 18 million viewers. Can you represent Trump voters sympathetically on TV? Yes – and Barr did just that. Roseanne and her sister Jackie (the wonderful Laurie Metcalf, in “Nasty Woman” T-shirt and pussyhat) bicker over Roseanne’s support for Trump, which is portrayed as being about jobs rather than social policy. Money is tight. Dan and Roseanne are shown eking out their expensive medication, swapping statins for anti-inflammatories. Race and gender-fluidity figure (they have a black granddaughter). Grandson Mark wants to wear feminine clothing and is protected by Dan. Family rises above politics.To me this is important, as the liberal bubble of so much popular culture is surely big enough to include a little bit of “otherness”. This is not the view of Roxane Gay, who wrote: “We cannot reach people who make dangerous, myopic political choices. We concede, as Jackie does, or we resist, as hopefully the rest of us will.” She was saying that the myth of a white working-class voting for Trump has to be bust, because so many of his voters were middle-class. So it is not only about jobs.Now, though, no one has to resist the lure of watching something complicated and funny and uncomfortable, because Barr has said inexcusable things. This is her own fault – but what a waste of her gifts. At a time when politics is so polarised, anyone who can show a dialogue between sides is important. In the UK and the US, the liberal media talks mostly to itself and wonders how the right stays in power.Roseanne Barr has always been a peculiar mix of liberal and utterly reactionary social attitudes. And what do we with do that in a tickbox culture? Don’t we spend a lot of our lives learning to separate the art from the artist, usually in the case of great men who do bad things but make great art? So while I don’t think Barr can be forgiven the latest awfulness, I hope we don’t forget that she made some fantastic ground-breaking television.

In four decades as a hedge fund manager he averaged a profit of nearly $1bn a year. His success, he said, was that he did not consider errors a source of shame but of pride. “Once we realise that imperfect understanding is the human condition,” he remarked, “there is no shame in being wrong, only in failing to correct our mistakes.” It is in that spirit that Mr Soros suggested to an audience in Paris that there was a way out of the current European crisis, but only if the European Union confronted its miscalculations and blunders. Advice from the uber-wealthy is a mixed blessing for the remain cause. To Mr Soros’s credit he left his business to back with cash the kind of “open societies” he favours, embodied by the EU’s voluntary association of equal states. It has been no quiet retirement: his foundation was chased out of Hungary pursued by antisemitic slurs accusing him of being a malevolent outside meddler.However, the billionaire philanthropist’s analysis is both perspicacious and acute. Mr Soros argues that monetary union radically changed the dynamics of the EU, and the impact of the financial crash brought out into the open hitherto latent governance tensions. The\u0026nbspsolidarity of nations has been repeatedly tested, and often found wanting. He was right to add that the EU’s self-inflicted “addiction to austerity” has been exploited by populist politicians to build Eurosceptic support. They were also quick to exploit fears after the refugee crisis in 2015, when their warnings of terror threats and a breakdown in local public services seemed plausible to many. Migration also illustrates the absurdity of Britain’s Brexit obsession to Europeans: while the rest of the continent was fixated on mass migration of refugees from outside, Britain was gripped with the idea of controlling free movement within it by EU citizens.The three most pressing problems facing the EU are the refugee crisis, a self-sabotaging austerity policy, and territorial disintegration. Mr Soros’s answers are simple – perhaps too simple, given the scale of the crisis. But they deserve a wide audience. On migration, Mr Soros sensibly suggests that the EU agrees a fair, unified migration policy and fosters democratic development in the poorer parts of the world to stem the flow of migrants. On\u0026nbspBrexit, he advocates that Britain eventually rejoins a “multitrack Europe”: that is, nations travelling at different speeds to viable, different, permanent destinations within the EU.These ideas ought to be taken seriously, although they are much easier said than done. Perhaps most important is what he recognises about the eurozone: that in its present form it is unstable. What has been exposed by the crisis in southern Europe – and is being highlighted today by Italy’s election – is a continuing failure to set up a proper fiscal policy for the entire eurozone alongside a common currency.This is why France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, seeks a federal budget overseen by an EU finance minister. Much of his painful domestic programme is being carried out to demonstrate to Germany that France is committed to the sort of hard-money economics that Berlin likes. The eurozone currently entrenches a deflationary bias with no agreed framework for coordinated reflation. The European Central Bank has been buying up government bonds of countries that teeter on the brink of insolvency – but only if such nations submit to a self-defeating policy of tax hikes and spending cuts. This does not resolve the crisis, it just defers it. Like cheap wallpaper covering up cracks in the plaster, these hotchpotch measures conceal a precarious structure.Almost half of unemployed persons of working age in the EU are at risk of poverty. Britain cannot duck this debate: London is the offshore financial centre of the eurozone, something that the Treasury and the Bank of England are wrestling with. Today, faced with the onset of a downturn, Europe’s policymakers can neither easily relax fiscal policy nor devalue their currencies to make their exports more competitive. Confronting and correcting this mistake should be a matter of the utmost urgency for the EU."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/225b55ca645be3238eee817855ecbccf22e1c77e/0_0_650_394/master/650.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=bad98b9c81769188176b83faa562992a 1400w","title":"roseanne ambien racism tweet side effect response sanofi","story":"After the comedian partly blamed her controversial tweets on taking the sedative, drug-maker Sanofi released a statementThe drug manufacturer Sanofi has clarified that one of its most popular medications, the sedative Ambien, does not cause racism. Sanofi tweeted: “While all pharmaceutical treatments have side effects, racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication.”The company’s statement came after Roseanne Barr partly blamed the drug for the series of racist tweets which led to her ABC sitcom being cancelled.Early on Wednesday, a day after ABC cancelled her show, Barr tweeted: “It was 2 in the morning and I was ambien tweeting — it was memorial day too — i went 2 far \u0026amp do not want it defended — it was egregious Indefensible. I made a mistake I wish I hadn’t but...don’t defend it please.”The medication guide that comes with every bottle of Ambien lists potential activities that may occur under the influence of the drug. It does not mention Twitter outbursts, but does warn of a wide variety of other possible side effects: “You may get up out of bed while not being fully awake and do an activity that you do not know you are doing. The next morning, you may not remember that you did anything during the night … reported activities include: driving a car (“sleep-driving”), making and eating food, talking on the phone, having sex.”In a separate tweet, Barr said she was “not giving excuses for what I did” but that she had previously “cracked eggs on the wall at 2am” after taking the drug.Replying to the radio host David Pakman, who had mocked her Ambien tweet, Barr also wrote: “I have had odd ambien experiences on tweeting late at night-like many other ppl do. I BLAME MYSELF OK? it’s just an explanation not an excuse, Ok, bully?”Barr’s tweet led to Ambien quickly becoming a meme on social media. Many people suggested that other heinous acts in history were the result of taking the drug.Barr did not say whether her decade-long history of racially charged tweets and promotion of conspiracy theories also occurred under the influence of Ambien."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/baf646dd8a1ead7f1f81685ebb1bb9cbb0196399/0_1111_2310_1386/master/2310.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97d0a04ab4d6e4e4e2044a8cdace8e08","title":"classist cambridge drinking societies should shut says group","story":"Claims of ‘witch hunt’ as Facebook page publishes tales of sexual harassment, racism and snobberyFrom bikini-clad female students wrestling in pools of jelly to binge-drinking, extreme-eating contests and regurgitating live goldfish, the exploits of Cambridge University’s drinking societies have long provoked tabloid headlines.

However, other senior student representatives said the Facebook campaign amounted to an “online fatwa”, with several allegations removed from the page because they were false.Although the student concerned was not a member of the Crescents, the society was disbanded due to the incident, which is being investigated by Trinity Hall.The original administrator of Grudgebridge, who shot the video of the Crescents society, said he then began the campaign to shut down all drinking societies because they reinforced the university’s old boys network and undermined efforts to improve access for working class and black and minority ethnic applicants.The student, who wishes to remain anonymous, said prior to Grudgebridge there had been a passive resignation about the behaviour of drinking societies by the university. He added: “Now it feels like these lads are shitting themselves over what might come out.”The student, who described himself as being lower middle class, added that part of the reason why he had started the campaign was because he went to Eton on a full scholarship. “I know the feeling of being acutely aware of being in a different class,” he said.The page is now administered by two female students who said it complimented the university’s Breaking the Silence campaign, which allows students to anonymously report sexual misconduct and has led to a huge rise in such complaints. “Drinking societies aren’t actually responding to Breaking the Silence until now when they’re at risk – when they’ve been exposed,” said one of the administrators.The other administrator said they had attended one drinking society event in their first term where only attractive white female freshers were invited. “There was the most vile attention and behaviour towards girls by second and third year boys,” she said. “Trying to get girls to sit on their lap. Trying to get them as drunk as possible. We were told that last year three girls had been spiked.”Eyre said Grudgebridge had provoked a “seismic shift” in attitudes towards drinking societies at the university. She added: “It’s like the annoyance that has been bubbling up for years has erupted.”Eyre, who wrote her dissertation on masculinity and the university drinking societies, added: “The norms inside those societies are so warped. It is a crystallised version of lad culture where the jokes are coded in racist, sexist, homophobic deeply intolerant ways. They believe that making jokes - like it’s fine if you slept with the girl who’s passed out - is acceptable and funny.”Andreas Bedorf, who sits on the CUSU council as the president of Downing College’s graduate students, said the Grudgebridge campaigns “reminds me of a witch hunt or inquisition”.Bedorf, who is a member of the college’s men’s rowing and drinking society, Downing Tribe, said he had made several fake submissions to the Facebook page, one of which had been published. Grudgebridge’s administrators acknowledged that some false submissions had been posted, including quotes from the play Posh, which depicts a fictionalised version of Oxford University’s Bullingdon Club. They added they were unable to verify posts due to the high number of submissions but they did remove them on request.A university spokeswoman said colleges were in discussion with their student representatives on a joint approach to unofficial drinking societies and allegations of distressing behaviour, including bullying, peer pressure to drink dangerously, social exclusion and anything that falls under disciplinary procedures."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e2bcd34c43a65a0a65e755e63360df57796f020/1_0_2775_1665/master/2775.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxOC8wMS8zMS9mYWNlYm9va19kZWZhdWx0LnBuZw\u0026amp;s=65ecdb6637cf369ccec6a9ac4bb25356","title":"how to rewild your garden ditch chemicals and decorate the concrete","story":"There are several ways to embrace nature – no matter the size of your plotRewilding excites people with its images of wolves and ambition to return entire landscapes to nature as humans withdraw after centuries of domination. But the grandeur of rewilding can also make the concept seem remote or irrelevant to people living ever more urban lives.To declare we are rewilding our garden, or window box, is probably a contradiction in terms and risks cheapening this important conservation concept. But there are principles of rewilding – stepping back and allowing natural processes to occur, and encouraging wild plants and insects – which we can all embrace. The most relevant rewilding idea for us urban beings? Let go, and reduce our micromanagement of whatever small patch of earth we own, rent or enjoy and influence.The first step is to change our way of seeing. I’ve struggled with “weedy” patios and “rank” lawns for a few years but I now see “tidy” gardens as they are for every other living species: desolate and hostile, stripped of the natural abundance and vigour that our soils and climate naturally serve up, even in the heart of a city.We’re persuaded to apply far too many chemicals to our gardens and these are killing the insects upon which human life ultimately depends.For those of us lucky enough to have a garden, we may well have a front garden which is now concrete, shingle or tarmac. The number of front gardens totally paved over has tripled from 1.5m to 4.59m between 2005 and 2015, according to the Royal Horticultural Society. A London survey found that the capital is losing the equivalent of two-and-a-half Hyde Parks of greenery a year from its domestic gardens – about 3,000 hectares (7,410 acres).Even if your front garden still needs to house a car, there is space for unruly nature. Plant a native hedge (young hazel, field maple, hawthorn and other “whips” can cost as little as 30p each from good nurseries) or squeeze insect-friendly flowers such as Verbena borariensis, buddleia or English lavender onto your gravel. Think vertical in small concrete spaces: our native ivy (Hedera helix) is a superb wildlife host – a source of food for birds and insects, shelter for nests and a food plant for holly blue butterfly caterpillars.Just as water sustains life on earth, the single best thing for bioersity in a small space is to add water. And you don’t need much space for a pond. A washing-up bowl will do. I created a 50cm x 90cm pond, and collected some duckweed and other common pond “weeds” from a friend’s pond. Within a year, it was found by mating frogs, newts, pond snails and damselflies.The trend for wildflower meadows leads to substituting lawns for sowing a meadow of flowering annuals which looks great for a summer and then dies away. It’s often better to simply stop mowing. If lawns are old and not weedkillered to death, they are full of different species of grass and herbs, many of which “flower” as beautifully as flowers. I still have neatly mown paths and borders around my long grass. Orchid-lovers like to cut their “meadows” in July but I leave mine until November – late seeds are food for goldfinches and a high autumnal cut doesn’t kill the butterflies such as meadow browns whose caterpillars have fed up on grass and are safely hibernating in the turf.In an era of garden makeovers, we seek instant transformations. When we want a “wild” garden we buy wild flower seeds or wild plug plants or expensive “native” perennials. But how about standing back for a year? Wild nature needs space and time but responds far faster than we expect. Do nothing but watch your garden and you’ll be amazed by what pops up. A friend living on a modern housing estate in Leicester had orchids appear in his lawn as soon as he let it get a bit overgrown. My newly unkempt lawn suddenly sprouted oak trees (acorns buried by jays), hawthorn, holly, hazel and a profusion of oxeye daisies, clover and even cuckooflower. The things that find their way into your plot naturally are likely to be well-suited to your soil, and more likely to thrive than introduced species. The more vigorous arrivals – such as bindweed, bramble and nettle – may have to be managed so they don’t swamp everything else, which is contrary to rewilding ideals. But then some bramble and nettle is superbly useful for hundreds of birds and insects. Even thistles are food for a variety of moth caterpillars and the caterpillars of the painted lady butterfly.Cut hedges less. Let dandelions flower and seed. Allow a few poppies to flower between vegetables. It’s hard for keen gardeners to relax. We also learn “native good, non-native bad”. While we should use native wild flower mixes (rather than cheaper generic mixes which contain non-native species), we cannot turn back the clock and cities are full of non-native plants. Laurel hedging is terrible for nature, as is leylandii, but there are plenty of insect-friendly non-native flowers and shrubs, from buddleia to cotoneaster.Yellow rattle is a pretty little yellow flower which is parasitic on grass. It’s difficult to establish because seeds need to be really fresh but I obtained some from my father and scattered them on my lawn. (If you don’t have a yellow rattle-growing parent, try a reputable wild flower nursery.) Each July, I scatter the fresh seeds and the yellow rattle is booming. Grass is great but often too vigorous for other wild flowers to thrive. Yellow rattle creates the space for less robust flowering plants to thrive. It’s the cornerstone of a vibrant perennial wildflower meadow.We may only have a window box but there is always space for nature. We can cram dozens of wildflowers onto a window sill. Do we have a wall on which we can erect a birdbox? A roof for a swift box? (South-facing is usually too hot for breeding birds.) Or any outside wall-space for bug hotels?In the course of writing this, my six-year-old daughter barged into my study. It was important: she was carrying a stunning eyed hawkmoth. She’d found it in a patch of sallow – a scrubby “weed” of a bush. I planted a thicket of sallows (29p each) three years ago. They are the foodplant for dozens of insects, including moths and butterflies, and the eyed hawkmoth was almost certainly laying eggs on them. If you embrace a teeny bit of wild, wild nature will embrace you."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8240c9dfccaddc42f6f596816014c4e8b9f22d59/0_14_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f31537ef38873a50ba17ff266ef001f9","title":"best alternative films summer guardian","story":"While the multiplex might be overrun with superheroes, dinosaurs and space cowboys, the season also offers up a set of films untouched by sequelitisOn paper, Hearts Beat Loud might tick off a few too many twee Sundance-friendly boxes, but there’s something disarmingly likable about what actually lies underneath. Parks and Recreation’s Nick Offerman stars as the owner of a failing record store in Brooklyn whose resistance to change is driving his business into the ground. His daughter, played by Dope’s Kiersey Clemons, is one summer away from med school and the impending move is already starting to sting. As a way of bringing them together before they’re torn apart, he reinstates an old tradition: a jam session with the pair using their musical talents to create new music. It’s a warm-hearted little film that mostly avoids preciousness thanks to a strong central pairing, a niftily assembled supporting cast (Toni Collette, Ted Danson, Blythe Danner, American Honey’s Sasha Lane) and some great music.Oscar buzz doesn’t typically swirl around horror films but then not many of them star Toni Collette, who scored a nomination for her role as a struggling mother in 1999’s The Sixth Sense. She’s gaining buzz for another matriarchal role, this time in even darker territory as a woman dealing with the death of her mother and the effect it has on her fractured family. It’s a film that’s already invited comparison to The Exorcist with horrified Sundance audiences calling it one of the scariest for some time. It’s a difficult, tonally severe, often audaciously shocking film about the unbearable weight of grief and the inescapability of familial sin that will ide audiences upon release.With his ominous, stylish breakout It Follows, director David Robert Mitchell announced himself as a rare horror talent, squeezing scares from every scene of his high-concept nightmare. Rather than continue to show off his genre prowess, his follow-up takes him into an entirely different part of town, specifically Los Angeles, for a neo-noir comedy thriller. It stars Andrew Garfield as a drifter searching for a mysterious young woman, played by Riley Keough, and stumbling on a much larger conspiracy. The film has confounded, frustrated and intrigued critics at its Cannes premiere: some hated it (the ’s Peter Bradshaw gave it one star and called it “catastrophically boring”) and some loved it (Time Out’s Joshua Rothkopf gave it five stars and called it “hypnotic”). Since director Debra Granik broke out with 2010’s soulful drama Winter’s Bone, her output has been minimal (just 2014’s little-seen documentary Stray Dog) so expectations were high for her narrative return at this year’s Sundance. The result is another stark study of working-class America, this time centering on a father and daughter, played by Ben Foster and Thomasin McKenzie, who are surviving in the wilderness. But when authorities get involved, their fragile existence is in jeopardy. It’s a delicate, naturalistic film that might not be as accessible as Winter’s Bone but again proves that Granik is a measured and empathetic humanist.Falling into the increasingly populated subgenre of documentaries where truth is far stranger than fiction (see also: Tickled, The Imposter, Catfish), this plainly told yet fascinatingly plotted film tells the story of an unlikely reunion. A set of identical triplets were separated at birth and adopted by three different families. Years later, through a set of unusual circumstances, they meet and once the excitement and confusion settles, they search for the real reason for their separation. There are some staggering twists along the way and while an argument could be made for its suitability for a smaller screen, it’s involving enough to cause plentiful discussion upon release.Giving the infinitely talented Lakeith Stanfield another starring vehicle (his second lead, after searing work in Crown Heights) and providing stoners with a new favorite movie, rapper Boots Riley’s directorial debut is worthy of all kinds of attention. It’s a feverish, funny, scary, angry, surreal satire about a black man finding out that his “white voice” can unlock a whole new world of opportunity. Despite a plot overflowing with disparate elements (the film lurches between slapstick and body horror), it remains confidently balanced announcing Riley as a fiercely original film-maker and cementing Stanfield as a bona fide star.While it might seem too soon for another Whitney Houston documentary after Nick Broomfield’s compelling if slightly lacking 2017 attempt, Touching the Void director Kevin Macdonald has secured an authorized take on the star’s rise and fall. He’s gained access to her family and friends, giving the film a more comprehensive feel, and uncovered some further tragic details from her life. It premiered at Cannes to mostly positive reviews, and while some are still seeking a doc that focuses more on Houston’s musical prowess rather than her troubling backstory, Whitney is set to be one of the summer’s most talked-about films.Arriving soon after Lady Bird, this middle school-set drama promises to deliver an equally awkward and idiosyncratic look at a period in life usually served with a heavy coating of gloss. It was one of the best-reviewed titles at this year’s Sundance festival, marking the directorial debut of comedian Bo Burnham and following the misadventures of a girl preparing herself for the transition to high school. A superlative-packed trailer might play up the film’s lighter moments but reviews suggest it’s not just a cringe-filled comedy. Vanity Fair’s Richard Lawson called is “simultaneously harrowing and sweet” while the AV Club’s AA Dowd praised its combination of “crushing realism and humane affection”.US release: 13 July (UK release: TBC but screening at Sundance London on 2 June)One of 2014’s most underrated films, Appropriate Behavior served as an almighty showcase for writer, director and star Desiree Akhavan. It was a marvel of wit, sadness and insight, telling the story of a woman dealing with a difficult break-up. Her follow-up is an adaptation of Emily M Danforth’s 2012 novel about a young girl shipped off to a conversion center to “cure” her homosexuality. It was warmly received at Sundance, picking up the festival’s highest honor, the grand jury prize, and gifts Chloë Grace Moretz with arguably her first fully-formed adult performance.Despite a rather muted premiere at last year’s Toronto film festival, there’s been steady background noise accompanying literary drama The Wife. The cause of such buzz is a question that we won’t see answered until next year: can this film finally win Glenn Close her Oscar? The six-time nominee remains one of the Academy’s most cruelly overlooked talents and with many calling this one of her best performances, her luck could finally be changing. In the film she plays the wife of a celebrated author, played by an equally impressive Jonathan Pryce, who has spent the majority of her life living in his shadow but as cracks start to appear in their marriage, her position experiences a dramatic shift. It’s a dazzling showcase for Close and a compelling drama in its own right.It’s been a rocky few years for Spike Lee, with a number of his projects failing to land, from his doomed Oldboy remake to his uneven yet often startlingly effective Chi-raq to the dismally received vampire flick Da Sweet Blood of Jesus. But after he transformed his 1986 calling card She’s Gotta Have It into a well-received Netflix series last year, he’s returning to the big screen with a renewed sense of vigour at a time when America needs him most. In fact-based 70s drama BlacKkKlansman, John David Washington stars as a black detective going undercover, with the help of a white cop, played by Adam Driver, to infiltrate the local chapter of the Klan. It picked up the grand prix award at Cannes after a 10-minute standing ovation, with reviews suggesting it might be Lee’s biggest hit for years.Hoping to repeat the summer sleepover success of 2017’s The Big Sick, this romantic comedy, also produced by Judd Apatow, has a nifty conceit. Based on the Nick Hornby novel, it tells of a love triangle between Annie (Rose Byrne), her boyfriend Duncan (Chris O’Dowd) and Tucker (Ethan Hawke), the guy who happens to be both Annie’s new lover and Duncan’s favorite musician. Can the unofficial Bridesmaids reunion of Apatow, Byrne and O’Dowd lead to similarly crowd-pleasing mirth?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eca00a190104f887aefefdde3b47f2d7d86847e4/0_143_2692_1615/master/2692.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=95f09ec63771bb47927d30f1e32d7b4e","title":"pandoras box review gw pabst louise brooks","story":"Louise Brooks is the last word in amoral cosmopolitan chic as the serial seducer Lulu in GW Pabst’s magnificent tale of lust, greed and violence GW Pabst’s silent classic Pandora’s Box from 1928 is now on rerelease. It is his Weimar danse macabre, at the centre of which is Lulu, a beautiful woman who is a serial seducer and serial survivor, finally to fall victim to Jack the Ripper in London. This nauseous twist of fate is the final torsion of satire and melodrama for someone who is the plaything of her own fatal glamour.The movie is based on the two plays by Frank Wedekind – Earth Spirit (1895) and Pandora’s Box (1905). Louise Brooks plays the showgirl and adventuress Lulu, and her serene yet calculating beauty is framed in a severe black bob, of almost helmet-like shininess and purpose – the very last word in amoral cosmopolitan chic. She is the New Realist flapper of 1930s Germany. That hair is a brilliant signature of her identity. When she escapes the law, it is crucially changed to a more conventional style, combed back from the forehead – as a disguise, of course, and she is indeed almost unrecognisable like that. But when Lulu finally fetches up in London, the hair comes tumbling back down and the bob starts to reassemble itself, though as a dishevelled parody of its former bewitching glory.Lulu is the mistress of a wealthy publisher, Dr Ludwig Schön (Fritz Kortner) whom she one day humiliates by entertaining an old man called Schigolch (Carl Götz) at the apartment he’s paying for she describes him fondly to Schön as her “first patron”. In this apartment we can glimpse what appears to be a menorah, but with its central candlestick missing.Disgusted with himself, and resolving to tear himself away from this involvement, Schön curtly tells her that he is engaged to be married to a high-born young woman, Charlotte Von Zarkikov (Daisy D’Ora). As a way of finessing a diplomatic break from Lulu, he encourages her to take part in a musical revue being produced by his son Alwa (Franz Lederer) with costumes designed by Countess Anna Geschwitz (Alice Roberts) – both of whom are in love with her.But when Dr Schön brings his fiancee Charlotte backstage on Lulu’s opening night, she refuses to go on – refuses to dance for “that woman”. Agonised, intimately humiliated, infatuated, Dr Schön realises that he is still in her thrall, breaks off his engagement and later confronts Lulu with a revolver. It leads to a fatal catastrophe, weirdly presented in this silent movie. It is a gunshot that makes no noise: the musical score here does not represent it with a timpani blast. Schön just reels away. It causes a trial for murder, from which Lulu escapes with the help of a vaudeville strongman Rodrigo Quast (Krafft-Raschig) and finally hides out on a riverboat gambling den. And all this in the company of the infatuated Alwa, who is addicted to the woman who killed his father: doomed to a self-hating love.Lulu is described acidly in court by the state prosecutor as being like that “Pandora” of classical mythology who had a box or jar containing all the evils of this world – Pabst contrives a cutaway to her defending attorney’s contemptuous face. What an absurd flight of fancy, he clearly thinks. And, yes, it is absurd, but not quite in the way he thinks. Pandora is dangerous and toxic, but she has been made that way by her admirers. Her beauty and her ambition are all that she has she is no more conceited and manipulative than the men.And when she is on the run, all that allure coagulates, as if through some hideous chemical reaction, into shame. First they wanted sex from Lulu, now it is money. Everyone, it seems, wants to blackmail Lulu now that there is a price on her head. The capital at her disposal – that brazen public sexiness – has turned into a terrible liability.The London sequence at the end is a strange and mysterious coda, foggy, gloomy, with Salvation Army people trudging earnestly about. It is Christmas, the subject of sickly-sentimental sub-Dickensian references to Christmas trees and Christmas puddings. Jack the Ripper is not as he has come quaintly to be imagined – the sinister top-hatted toff silhouette in the mist. He just looks like a desperate, scruffy, homeless man, who manages to persuade kind-hearted Lulu to spend some time with him, despite the fact that he doesn’t have any money. It’s extravagantly sexual and mad, and Lulu is herself as Scott Fitzgerald might have described her: beautiful and damned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1cea88803f78f49f18e0c5c51b91927c35f1f181/0_14_3299_1980/master/3299.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dfb1a3609f96c2fe668abf95cd12353e","title":"that summer review grey gardens edith ewing bouvier beale","story":"This sensational film presents a backstory-prequel to the making of the documentary that spotlit Big and Little Edie, two great American eccentricsThey’re back! For fans of the classic 1975 documentary Grey Gardens, by Albert and David Maysles, this film is a startling, even sensational event. Despite some faults, it is basically a must-see, an archival gem with mouthwatering unseen footage of the two women who were turned by that film into pop-culture legends. It throws real light on them, and on the silent cunning of the Maysles brothers themselves, with a Greeneian splinter of ice in their hearts.That Summer is effectively a backstory-prequel to the making of Grey Gardens, which famously unveiled the tragicomic twilit existence of two eccentric American women of faded patrician glamour in their rambling chaotic home in the Hamptons. They were the elder Edith “Big Edie” Ewing Bouvier Beale and her skittish and madly eccentric daughter Edith “Little Edie” Bouvier Beale, who had lived together there for over 30 years in bizarre seclusion, after Big Edie’s husband left her, each like something between Blanche Dubois and Miss Havisham. Their niece Lee Radziwill, sister of Jackie Onassis, tactfully wanted to help the Edies restore Grey Gardens, evidently with Ari Onassis’s money. But how did the Maysles brothers gain the women’s trust to make their documentary? The answer is that there was an earlier film project, begun and then abandoned in the summer of 1972, masterminded by the well-connected artist and photographer Peter Beard – an intimate of Hampton habitués such as Lee and Jackie, Andy Warhol and Truman Capote. He got permission to make a fly-on-the-wall study of poor Big Edie and Little Edie and hired the Maysles brothers as humble cameramen. (We have to listen to a lot of irrelevant waffle from Beard about his famous friends before we can get on to the main event: his footage and the women’s show-stopping double act.) He finally shelved his project, but the Maysles came back and evidently asked permission to make their own film – and the women were sufficiently accustomed to their presence to agree. Or did the sly film-makers allow these befuddled women to assume that this was simply an extension of the first film, the one licensed by their grand family friend? We don’t know. But the Maysles’ film was much colder, shrewder and more pitilessly brilliant than anything Beard had in mind, with his emollient emphasis on fixing up the house, and all the local history. Yet the women are still extraordinary, speaking lines no screenwriter would dare invent: lines that are funny, petulant, crazy, melancholy and sometimes just plain gibberish. (I’d forgotten something from Grey Gardens: the Edies can be talking and two or three sentences can go past before you realise it’s as incomprehensible as birdsong!) But why did Beard abandon his film? He doesn’t say, though he may have been nervous of what his film uncovered – a suggestion of abuse. Is that the answer to why this poor, bewildered, humorous and yet defiant Little Edie retreated into seclusion along with her cantankerous, guilty mother? No one who loves Grey Gardens can do without this."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ff68bc5cef4df3598b9910c4c1bc9139d4fa7d6/0_419_3777_2266/master/3777.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ed0b914142bda24a5db5fa371f0e67c","title":"a beginners guide to the world cup 2018 when does the world cup start","story":"From when does the World Cup start to who’s likely to win football’s greatest prize – the 2018 tournament explainedThe Fifa World Cup is an international football tournament contested by 32 nations every four years. This year’s competition kicks off on 14 June, when hosts Russia play Saudi Arabia in Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium. After a total of 64 matches played in 12 venues across 11 different Russian cities, the champions will be crowned in the same arena on 14 July. It is, without question, the biggest, most prestigious sporting event on the planet.OK, so who organises it and for how long has it been “a thing”?Fifa stands for the Féderation Internationale de Football Association and their third president Jules Rimet was the innovator behind the first World Cup, an invitational tournament contested by just 13 teams that was staged and won by Uruguay in 1930. This year’s tournament will be the 21st.With just 32 teams taking part, an awful lot of nations must miss out. That hardly seems fair.With the exception of Russia, who qualify automatically as hosts, the other 31 teams all had to go through a rigorous two-year qualifying process to make it this far. Fifa has 211 national association affiliates spread across six different confederations around the globe.Did any traditionally “big” countries not make it?England were the only “home nation” to qualify, while Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland all failed with varying degrees of predictability. The USA, the Netherlands, South American champions Chile, Africa Cup of Nations winners Cameroon and the four-times World Cup winners Italy are among the most high profile nations to miss out on qualification for Russia 2018. For many international powerhouses, qualifying is invariably little more than a formality. For others it is an incredible achievement.Iceland will contest their first World Cup finals this summer and with a population of just 335,000 are the smallest country to qualify in the history of the competition.How will a winner be decided from those who did make the cut?The 32 countries have already been drawn into eight groups of four teams which will be decided on a round robin basis. The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stages, which is when things start to get really tense.What happens if any of these knockout matches end in a draw?If the sides are level after 90 minutes, they play an additional 30 minutes of extra time.And if they’re still level?The outcome is decided by a penalty shoot-out. There have been 26 in World Cup finals history and both Brazil (1994) and Italy (2006) have actually won finals by this very stressful method.Who is expected to win this year’s tournament?It’s a tough one to call. Germany are the holders and are expected to be in the shake-up again, while Brazil, France, Spain and Argentina are other former winners who many expect to do well.Have England ever won the World Cup?Once, in 1966 and they’re still dining out on it over 50 years later.Tell me more ...As tournament hosts, they beat Germany 4-2 in the final at Wembley Stadium to win the Jules Rimet Trophy.The what now?The Jules Rimet Trophy. It was originally called Victory but later renamed in honour of the Fifa president who dreamt up the World Cup. Brazil got to keep it after winning it for the third time in 1970, but it was stolen 13 years later and has never been returned.So what do the winners get now?Acclaim, medals, hero status in their homeland and a hefty financial bonus from their national Football Association. They also get presented with the Fifa World Cup trophy, which is just shy of 37 centimetres in height and weighs 6.1 kilograms. Made of 18 carat gold with a malachite base, it depicts two human figures holding up the earth. It is arguably the most iconic trophy in all of sport.Such a popular event must generate a lot of cash. Who gets it all?Anything else I should know?This year’s tournament will be the first World Cup in which Video Assistant Referees (VAR) will be used to help referees avoid making potentially match-deciding mistakes when it comes to such important issues as awarding goals, penalties or doling out red cards. It will also referees avoid cases of mistaken identity, as has been known to happen from time to time.Sounds like a good idea ...It certainly does in theory, but many are predicting disaster once it’s put into practice. VAR has been tested in a number of tournaments around the world, often with hilarious consequences and a number of referees will arrive in Russia with no prior experience of using it.

Now you can do the same with our interactive toolWow, choosing the Brazil best XI of all time – that’s a tough one. There are so many brilliant players in each position, and that means some great players will miss out. My team is set up in a super offensive formation. We might concede a lot of goals, but we would score so many more. In fact, I can guarantee five goals every game!The best form of defence is to have the ball. A team with Falcão, Zico and Rivellino at its heart could play for years without making a mistake in possession. When you have the ball, you don’t have a problem. That is my philosophy in choosing my all-time Brazil XI.The goalkeeper in my special team is Cláudio Taffarel. He was so calm, smooth and peaceful, always giving us confidence on the field. He didn’t do anything fancy, never jumped or ed unnecessarily and always had the ball under control. He played three World Cups, always as Brazil’s No 1. That is not an easy achievement.My right-back is Carlos Alberto Torres. Whether defending or attacking, he was always good. Carlos was a great leader, but his technique was even more incredible. His famous goal against Italy in 1970 was such a beautiful, powerful strike.The two central defenders are Aldair and Lúcio. They never played together, but I believe that they would form an amazing partnership. Aldair was very calm, never made a bad tackle and his positioning was incredible. He was my team-mate at Roma and with the Seleção – he saved my life many times when I was attacking. Lúcio was more aggressive and intense. He scored many goals, and had a great passing range and all-round quality.Left-back, for sure, is Roberto Carlos. A world champion, he played at a high level for many years, with the same quality and intensity whether defending or attacking. He was a giant. I have never seen a shot as powerful as his. He had a missile in his leg!Midfield is the hardest area of the team to pick. There are many, many players who could play in the middle of a Brazil dream team, but I can only pick four. First, my defensive midfielder is Paulo Roberto Falcão, who starred in the 1982 World Cup. He was a smart player, a legend with an elegance rarely seen on a football pitch. The king of assists, he never misplaced a pass or made a mistake.In front of Falcão, I have chosen a ‘super trio’ of attacking midfielders. The first is Rivellino. His elastico move was beautiful, like something from another planet. I love him! He was the best dribbler of a football ever.My other two midfielders are Zico and Rivaldo. Zico was intelligent, had incredible vision and could strike a superb free-kick. A foul around the area was as good as a goal to him. As for Rivaldo, he was a genius. Come on! It was so wonderful to see him with the ball. He played with the same style as Falcão. Rivaldo was brilliant.Picking the two attackers is easy. The first is the best player of all time – Pelé. Do I need to say anything more? The athlete of the century, he scored more than 1,000 goals, and won the World Cup three times. He was complete. I don’t need to say anything more. Pelé is Pelé. No one can beat him.Pelé’s partner up front is Ronaldo. He was incredible too. You had to pay attention to both feet with Ronaldo as they were as good as each other. He was an example to other players, too. He suffered three serious injuries during his career, and was always fighting against these problems. Ronaldo was essential to us in 2002 when we became world champions. The coach for my all-time Brazil team is Mário Zagallo, the manager for the World Cup win in 1970. He would make this team play very well."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/303d1ebf477979110bbd2f4bd14952285c7622a5/0_9_1992_1195/master/1992.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=346321f285c57aa0f73265cd34c57610","title":"football mohamed salah fit world cup egypt liverpool shoulder","story":"Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah will be fit to feature in the World Cup group stages, according to the Egyptian Football Association.The forward looked unlikely to play any part in the summer tournament after sustaining a shoulder injury in the first half of Liverpool’s 3-1 defeat against Real Madrid in the Champions League final on Saturday night before leaving the field in tears.The EFA president, Hani Abu Reda, the national team coach Hector Cuper and doctor Mohamed Abou El-Ela met Salah on Wednesday in Valencia, where the 25-year-old is undergoing treatment and rehabilitation.A post on the federation’s Facebook page read: “The delegation of the national team was briefed on the recovery programme for the player, who is walking well and aims to join the squad in the World Cup, as well as the determination of the great player to catch up with his team-mates. For his part, Mohamed Abou El-Ela said that the period of absence of Salah due to injury will not exceed three weeks.”Egypt’s opening World Cup match takes place on 15 June against Uruguay, with their second against the hosts Russia coming four days later.

Could we apply similar thinking to everyday life?If you’ve ever washed out a wound with saline instead of tap water or requested an x-ray for lower-back pain, you’re a fool. According to a list drawn up by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, both practices are pointless doctors only go along with them because they’re terrified that you will turn on them if they don’t. The list of useless procedures runs to 40 items, covering everything from wrist fractures to palliative chemotherapy, and has been released in the hope that medical professionals will eventually reconsider using the treatments.But medicine isn’t the only area where we’re coerced into taking action unnecessarily. Here are 40 more things you shouldn’t bother doing.The British government advises that we each eat five portions of fruit and vegetables a day. In Denmark, it’s six. In Australia, it’s seven. In 2014, campaigners tried upping it to 10. Just eat some vegetables and be done with it.If you feel a cold coming on, it’s pointless to reach for the vitamin C tablets. Study after study has concluded that – unless you live in a frozen wilderness, smoke an incredibly large number of cigarettes or subject yourself to extreme physical stress on a regular basis – vitamin C won’t do anything.In August, the British Dental Association’s scientific adviser declared flossing to be pointless, adding that all floss-based studies of the past 25 years have been of “very low quality”.

Instead, why not try rubbing off stains with a toothbrush, leaving them to air outside and never having any friends because you smell of dirt and sweat?No one calls your landline telephone. You never call anyone’s landline. No one will have a landline at all 10 years from now. They exist purely to complicate the act of changing your broadband provider.You don’t need to drink eight glasses of water a day. The figure first appeared in a recommended dietary allowance guide in the US 70 years ago, and it doesn’t take into consideration your age, your height, your weight or your activity level. Instead, just drink until your wee is no longer dark. That means you’re hydrated.Don’t put tomatoes in your fridge, because it stops them tasting of anything. Don’t put potatoes in your fridge, because it will muck up their starch and make them taste funny. Don’t put bread in the fridge, because it will go stale faster. Don’t put onions in the fridge, because they need to be well ventilated. Don’t put bananas in the fridge, because they’re tropical fruits. Don’t put avocado in the fridge, because they will never ripen. Don’t put ketchup in the fridge, because it doesn’t need to be kept in the fridge. Don’t put eggs in the fridge, because I saw Stephen Fry say on TV once that he didn’t, and he seems like a man who’s got his stuff together.Nobody in the history of the world washed their hair as much as we do now.

Knowing that your eye will naturally fall on the top-right corner of the menu, this is where restaurateurs often place their most profitable items. Why not help run these crooks out of business by ordering from the bottom of the menu, where you’ll find items with smaller margins?When food reaches its sell-by date, that doesn’t mean it suddenly becomes poisonous – it means that the supermarket has guessed this stock should be rotated.

Put the turbot on a chopping board, dark side up, and score diagonal slashes heavily across the skin. Fold the bay leaves lengthways and insert them into the slashes.Once the tray is very hot, remove from the oven and drizzle it with oil. Put the fish on the tray and squeeze over the lemon juice, then add another drizzle of oil and a good scattering of salt over the top. Put the fish in the oven and roast for 20 minutes.Once the turbot is out of the oven, scatter the butter over the fish and leave it to melt, then sprinkle over the tarragon. Serve the turbot butter from the roasting dish drizzled over any vegetable sides.The best way to eat the turbot is to use a blunt knife to gently ease the flesh away from the bones, top layer first, then, once that has all gone, pick up the fish by the tail and turn it over to do the same with the underside. You can eat the skin or discard it – it’s up to you.From The Hidden Hut by Simon Stallard (HarperCollins)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7a8ef9c4e09828128280207636cb428c15eb65b/0_47_1024_614/master/1024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57af645f112e0a219140c5349058bf8f","title":"golden chicken you might as well be lighting a fag with a burning tenner","story":"A video of 24-karat chicken wings has gone viral and – next to the trend for clean eating greens and juices – it feels almost nostalgicDepending on what you have done to your algorithm, you may have seen a video for gold chicken wings on Instagram this month.The video is short, boring and gross. A pile of golden chicken wings sit on a plate. In the corner is a pot of blue-cheese sauce. From nowhere appears a latexed hand. One wing is picked, you hear the word “lit”, the chicken is dipped and the camera pans around to show a pair of lips, turning gold as they chew. With the volume up, you can hear the sound of mastication.Golden hot wings are the Midasian ruse of Jonathan Cheban, a publicist turned food influencer who, after some wrangling, legally changed his name to Foodgōd. Designed in “collab” with the Ainsworth, a US restaurant that describes itself as multipurpose venue, they cost $45 for 10 or £1,000 for 50 with a bottle of Armand de Brignac champagne.Foodgōd is famous for appearing on TV with the Kardashians, and designing a phone cover that doubles up as a mirror, but has rebranded himself as a would-be “Anthony Bourdain for the young and hot”. His currency grew on Snapchat, a skill he parlayed into faddy eating. Foodgōd is also whimsical. He likes the ō because it looks like “a halo” but sometimes drops it. Cooking doesn’t interest him – “Chefs cook, I eat out” – but ambiance does. He is the living embodiment of the viral era. He may like gold chicken today, but tomorrow, who knows.Still, it’s all meaningless unless it tastes good. To make this golden chicken, the meat is brined for 12 hours, coated with a dry rub, baked, flash-fried, smothered in a gold marinade with extra honey barbecue sauce, and finished with a layer of gold dust. For less than £20, I made two versions of my own: one using some edible gold leaf bought from Thailand and a KFC drumstick, and another using imitation gold on a pack of Co-op chicken wings. The gold on the latter attached well to the meat, but it wasn’t actually edible. The Thai gold was, but dissolved into the KFC fat.Gold needs to be in its purest 24k form to be safe to eat. The problem is, it tastes of nothing. Your body can’t digest it and it has no nutritional value. You might as well be lighting a fag with a burning tenner – the joy, it seems, is in destroying it.Gold food isn’t new – in 2016 in Manila, a dozen Golden Cristal Ube doughnuts sold for $1,200 in Abu Dhabi, a 24-karat gold flaked cappuccino costs £15 – nor is conspicuous consumerism. But the video’s popularity – “almost 1.5 million viewers and counting!” – is significant. Clean eating, with its focus on greens and juice is dominating the weird world of Instagram food porn. By contrast, Foodgōd and his gold chicken wings seem almost nostalgic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/35fe4307b7d1d39a3630fb164e86930125acb198/0_0_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2970d29504a17e8611b088619e893e23","title":"josh eggletons recipe for spaghetti with roasted garlic and anchovies","story":"This recipe is easy to rustle up from the ingredients in your store cupboard and can work as a base to accommodate other seasonal veg and herbs you may haveThis recipe is quick, simple and easy to rustle up with staple ingredients that you’d find in your cupboard.

Young people describe how their lives changed dramatically overnightIn her bedroom in Clacton-on-Sea, on the Essex coast, 16-year-old Somer Lawrence perfects her Tim Burton-themed Halloween costume. By the time the night is done, Lawrence will have downed a 70cl bottle of vodka. The Corpse Bride is drunk.In the Cotswolds village of Wotton-under-Edge, 29-year-old Lee Peters manages to play the piano in his flat, despite having consumed an entire bottle of gin.In Malia, Crete, 18-year-old Stuart Marshall celebrates the end of his lads’ holiday by drinking five half-pints of spirits.Meanwhile, 23-year-old Rebecca Charles enjoys the sunshine with friends at the beach. They bring cider, beer and wine. By nightfall, she will have drunk 35 units of alcohol.What all these stories have in common is what happened next. Charles woke up at 5am and was sick straight away. Marshall’s friends found him curled up in a ball. Lawrence was rushed to hospital. Peters was carried out of his house on a stretcher to a waiting ambulance after a neighbour called 999.They had all developed pancreatitis, a disease brought on by excessive alcohol consumption that can turn one night in the pub, or a day at the beach, into a life-altering illness – it can often be fatal.“You can get pancreatitis after a single binge,” says Dr Sarah Jarvis of the campaign group Drinkaware, although she explains it’s more common to develop it after repeated binges.After the sudden death of the Swedish DJ Avicii, pancreatitis is becoming better known. He had been afflicted by the condition after abusing alcohol during exhausting world tours and, after his death, his family issued a statement saying “he could not go on any longer”. His death has forced us to pay attention to a condition we would perhaps rather ignore.In the UK in 2016, 7,327 people died of a range of conditions that could be directly attributed to alcohol abuse. While the number of direct alcohol-related deaths have been relatively constant since 2013, they are higher than they were in 2001, when 5,701 people died as a direct result of alcohol abuse. English alcohol-related hospital admissions are at a record high – up two-thirds from a decade ago – while spending on alcohol support services has been cut.Peters, Lawrence and Charles all now have chronic pancreatitis. “In the town I lived in, drinking was a massive part of the culture,” says Charles, who is now 31. “Everybody else was doing it. But I wasn’t getting up in the morning and drinking – the way people imagine alcoholics behave. I was just too much of a party girl.”“I was stupid and young,” says Lawrence, who is now 20. Although she went to hospital several times after the incident at her Halloween party, Lawrence continued drinking, and developed chronic pancreatitis at 17. She began drinking aged 14 because it eased her anxiety and depression. “I’d turn to alcohol as a coping mechanism,” she says. “I’d always be the one at the party who’d had the most to drink. It gave me liquid confidence.”She isn’t alone. “Wine had this lovely, numbing quality to it,” Peters says. Now aged 34, he began binge drinking after being violently assaulted at 16. “It was absolutely a response to trauma. It was the self-medication tool I used when things got stressful.”Alcohol abuse is often linked to mental ill health. “Drug and alcohol use can lead to mental health problems, and vice versa,” says Dr Cyrus Abbasian, a consultant psychiatrist at St George’s, University of London, who specialises in mental health and substance abuse. He explains that alcohol is an anxiolytic, meaning that it has a sedative effect. “You’re self-medicating your mental health condition,” he says. “Alcohol leads to short-term relief of anxiety, but it doesn’t treat the underlying problem.” Over time, a person may develop alcohol dependency, alongside their existing, untreated mental health issues.In a difficult relationship, and with postnatal depression after the birth of her daughter, Charles fell in with a party-loving crowd. “You think the alcohol is making things better,” she says. “But it’s actually making things worse.”Some argue that minimum-unit pricing, implemented in Scotland earlier this month, would tackle the problem of at-home drinkers who take advantage of cheap supermarket offers. “Minimum unit pricing is an excellent idea,” Abbasian says, “because it’s an evidence-based public health intervention. With any drug, you need to limit supply and increase price to reduce use. If something is cheaply and easily available, people tend to use it.” In some instances, supermarkets had been selling alcoholic drinks more cheaply than the same quantity of water.But would minimum-unit pricing have deterred Lawrence, who would drink a bottle of vodka because she was too young to get into bars? Possibly. “When you’re young, you can’t get into pubs, so you get a bottle of vodka for seven or eight pounds,” she says. “I don’t know why we thought it was necessary to be drinking spirits. Why were we drinking vodka at 15 or 16? It’s what everybody did, so it’s what I did.”We all have friends who push things too far. They’re the ones with cracked phone screens and jeroboam-sized hangovers on Sunday mornings. Their anecdotes of drunken misadventures make you laugh, but also make you queasy.Or maybe you’re that friend. “People drink so much because it’s our culture,” adds Lawrence. “The sun comes out and you go to a beer garden. It’s what we do. Everything is just an excuse to drink. Life is hard for everybody, so it’s nice to have an escape.”But Jarvis believes if people were aware of the health consequences of binge drinking, they would drink less. “Most people have no idea that you may be doing yourself damage now that can last a lifetime.”Here’s something to make binge-drinkers pause mid-sip: pancreatitis hurts. “It’s like the worst stomach ache you’ve ever had,” Marshall says.When your pancreas begins to fail, the pain never goes away. After her pancreatitis turned chronic, Charles’s pancreas stopped producing the enzymes she needed to digest food, causing her to become malnourished. Her weight dropped to 29kg (63lb). She can’t work full-time or look after her 10-year-old daughter. On good days, she showers and does laundry. The bad days are dark. “I think: ‘I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up.’”Life becomes small. Drinking buddies melt away faster than ice in a spritzer on a warm summer day. “It’s lonely,” Charles says, “when you’re surrounded by people who party the whole time and you don’t want to be a part of that any more. It’s like they don’t want to know you.”Peters also lives alone. A kindly neighbour checks up on him. “She has dug me out of some dark places,” he says. When he goes out, his emaciated frame attracts pitying looks. “It’s difficult because I used to be a good-looking chap with a decent body that people would comment on.” But not being able to work takes the biggest toll. “I feel quite ashamed by it,” Peters, a former accountant, says. “Having to go from being fiercely independent to being dependent on the state doesn’t sit well with me.”After we talk on the phone, Peters emails me a list of the 14 medicines he takes daily, and the 25 symptoms he experiences. (“Constant, debilitating pain … regular sepsis.”) “I can sense the grim reaper approaching,” Peters writes, before signing off with a cheerful reminder not to work too hard.How does he bear it? Keeping his mind occupied helps. So do antidepressants. Knowing that he caused his disease, Peters says, “is difficult to cope with”. After his first bout of pancreatitis, Peters kept drinking. “It’s difficult to explain why,” he says, pointing to the trauma of his early attack as a partial explanation. He also felt that doctors were possibly exaggerating the severity of his condition, out of overcautiousness.“It’s hard to explain what makes people unable to stop drinking,” says Abbasian. “With some patients, I have a conversation with them, and they say: ‘Yes, doctor, if I drink, I’ll have pancreatitis and I’ll die.’ But they don’t find other things as pleasurable and, because of their underlying anxiety disorder, they continue to self-medicate.”Peters says: “I have tried very hard to come up with a rational reason as to why I was so neglectful and blase about my health, but there’s nothing I can come up with that will make sense to anybody. I’ve been very foolish. I made those decisions and I’m aware I made them. I thought: ‘Hell, sod it, I’ll think about it tomorrow.’ But tomorrow catches up with you. It caught up with me, big time.”Chronic pancreatitis has no cure. Many people with the condition go on to develop pancreatic cancer. Surgical procedures are sometimes necessary. Charles’s gallbladder has been removed and doctors have performed a coeliac plexus block on her – an injection made using local anaesthetic to treat severe abdominal pain. Peters has advanced-stage chronic pancreatitis and takes prescription painkillers, including morphine, as well as enzyme replacement drugs, anti-sickness medication, anti-seizure medications, proton-pump inhibitors to reduce the acid in his stomach, anti-constipation tablets and meal-replacement drinks.Despite all these interventions, about one in five people with pancreatitis will die within five years of their diagnosis. “I have a terminal prognosis,” Peters says quietly. “I have gone downhill quite rapidly in the last six months. Lots of treatments don’t work any more. I’m literally wasting away.” A few days after we speak, Peters experiences projectile vomiting, a fever and excruciating pain and is admitted to hospital with an acute flare-up of pancreatitis.It’s easy to be judgmental about Peters’ situation. You may think: why didn’t he just stop drinking when his doctors warned him? But trauma makes people behave irrationally. Rape survivors become promiscuous, intelligent people ignore medical advice, the children of alcoholics binge-drink.And even if you have never experienced trauma yourself, not drinking in our culture is hard. “My friends are drunk all the time and they’ll be in the club buying me drinks,” Lawrence says. “They don’t realise the severity of my illness because they don’t have to live with it.” Charles gets angry when she sees people being peer-pressured. “People will taunt someone who isn’t drinking,” she says. “It’s like: you’re a weirdo if you don’t drink.”“Humans are social animals, but we don’t like to be around a lot of people we’re not familiar with,” Abbasian says. “Socialising, going out on a Saturday, is anxiety-provoking. When you go to a bar or club, you drink to reduce anxiety levels so you can drink and talk to strangers. Alcohol disinhibits you.”Forced sobriety at least helps you to see things anew, in a clear-eyed way. “I notice everything on nights out – I’m not blind to things any more,” Marshall says. “Even with some of my friends, I think: you turn into a wanker when you’re drunk.”Abbasian says: “If alcohol were a relatively new drug introduced into our society, and not as socially acceptable, it would be a class A drug, similar to heroin or cocaine.” He urges those who regularly binge drink to seek assistance, before it’s too late. “There’s a lot of stigma and denial. A major first step is to accept you have a problem and not be ashamed getting help and treatment.”All the people I spoke to wanted me to share their experiences. In fact, many of them reached out to me, desperate to warn others.“My message is: be careful,” Charles says. “Just because you’re young and you only go on weekend benders, and don’t drink every day, doesn’t mean you’re invincible. Because you’re not.”And the next time you drop a crate of sticky bottles off at a recycling bank, Peters would ask that you remember him and reconsider your drinking. “If just one person can read this and think that, it would be enough for me,” he says. “Just to make a difference to that person and their family. It would be my whole life’s work complete for me. I would be over the moon.”Drinkaware is an independent UK charity working to reduce alcohol misuse and harm.

Each is also short-listed for a creative hub if it fails to secure the main prize of the new headquarters.The new HQ, which will operate alongside Channel 4’s £100m London base in Victoria, will have facilities including a TV studio, and host executive and board meetings.Channel 4, which has said the shift of staff and resource out of London is the biggest structural change in its 35-year history, has also shortlisted six smaller cities that are only eligible to battle to be the home of the two new creative hubs up for grabs.These are Belfast, Brighton, Newcastle-Gateshead, Nottingham, Sheffield and Stoke-on-Trent.The broadcaster has said its second main base must be in a city with a working population of more than 200,000 people, travel time to London of less than three hours, and high-quality physical and digital infrastructure.West Midlands mayor Andy Street, the former John Lewis boss, said he was pleased his region had overcome the “first hurdle” in the bidding process. The West Midlands has been selected as a candidate for the national HQ or a creative hub.“Now the hard work really starts as we begin negotiations in earnest to develop the most compelling case possible to the broadcaster,” Street said.Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson pitched his city as a “soulmate” for Channel 4.“This is a hotly contested bidding competition and to reach this next stage in the process demonstrates Liverpool’s pulling power as a location that offers businesses and their employees a great worklife balance,” he said. Channel 4 said it received more than 30 submissions in the first round of its relocation process.“After careful consideration by the Channel 4 executive team, we’ve selected 13 cities that are best able to meet our vision for our new hubs in the nations and regions,” said Jonathan Allan, Channel 4’s chief commercial officer, who is running the pitch process. “We look forward to visiting all those on the shortlist as part of our second phase, but we will also be continuing to work with all cities and regions as part of our strategy to increase investment and support creative businesses, jobs and growth across the UK.”Channel 4 News will also open three new news bureaux, with a trebling of news jobs in the nations and regions by 2020, while spend on shows made by production companies based outside London will rise from £169m annually to about £350m a year by 2023."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/005f17f40e080f04b984b4060ad9f0239e747f02/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f43f40efdba1329350cbb9026163924a","title":"we need to talk aboutveganism","story":"In this monthly podcast,  supporters share their experiences and put questions to a panel of journalists and industry experts.

Baker became a multimillionaire when StubHub was sold to eBay for £225m in 2007, although by that time he had left the business after a bitter falling out with Fluhr.In the ensuing years he set about creating a European rival to his former firm, which he named Viagogo. He based the company in Geneva, Switzerland, although he owns it via Pugnacious Endeavors, which is based in the US state of Delaware, a business location synonymous with financial secrecy.During Viagogo’s early years, Baker succeeded in attracting financial backing from several wealthy and high-profile investors. Early backers include the tennis couple Steffi Graf and Andre Agassi the financier Jacob Rothschild Bernard Arnault, the billionaire chief executive of the luxury firm Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessy Herbert Kloiber, a German media mogul and the London-based investment firm Index Ventures.A fundraising round in 2009 valued the company at $300m (£225m), and its value is thought to have grown significantly since then.Viagogo has an office on London’s Fenchurch Street, but its headquarters are in Switzerland. That means its financial accounts are not publicly available. It has been reluctant to comment on the string of allegations levelled against it.In recent years it has faced criticism over sky-high mark-ups applied to tickets on its platform, not to mention its attitude towards consumer law, advertising regulations and customer service.The site has also been overrun by professional touts who use it to sell tickets they have harvested in bulk elsewhere, often at the expense of fans.Several companies have cut ties with the business in the light of its reputational problems. Sainsbury’s ditched a partnership in which Viagogo had been selling tickets in conjunction with the supermarket’s Nectar loyalty points scheme.Scottish Rugby Union and the ATP tennis tour have also ended their relationships with Viagogo, while Google has also clamped down on its advertising practices. Manchester City Football Club has no such qualms. It still operates a ticket resale partnership with the website.As attention on the company has built, regulators and enforcement bodies are beginning to take action. Viagogo is now facing dual investigations by the Competition and Markets Authority and National Trading Standards, as well as inquiries overseas, including in its native Switzerland.May 2018: 10,000 tickets for an Ed Sheeran tour sold on Viagogo are declared invalid by the artist and his promoters, leaving fans who have handed over hundreds of pounds at risk of being turned away at the door of venues.May 2018: The  reveals Viagogo’s involvement in resale of football tickets, which can lead to higher prices and put fans’ safety at risk.April 2018: The Competition and Markets Authority threatens Viagogo with court action for ignoring demands to stop breaching consumer protection laws.December 2017: Viagogo sells tickets for the hip-hop musical Hamilton, despite the production company’s efforts to prevent ticket resales.July 2017: The company threatens MPs with arrest when they visit Viagogo’s London office on behalf of angry consumers.March 2017: In an almost unprecedented snub to parliament, Viagogo refuses to attend a select committee hearing.February 2017: The firm is accused of trying to manipulate online reviews on the consumer website Trustpilot by offering the chance of cash payouts.February 2017: It is accused of “moral repugnance” for trying to profit from the resale of tickets to an Ed Sheeran gig in aid of the Teenage Cancer Trust.February 2017: Dozens of customers claim Viagogo is withholding thousands of pounds in refunds, after a “glitch” led to them being overcharged.

A draft copy of the so-called Horizon Europe document, seen by the , suggests that the UK is set to be offered less generous access than countries with associate status in the current programme, known as Horizon 2020, including Israel, Turkey, Albania and Ukraine.Those states, along with countries in the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) – Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland – will be “associated to all programme parts” of the new research and science framework, details of which are to be published on 7 June, according to the leaked document.It is understood that wealthy countries with a developed research and development capacity are to be offered a greater opportunity to pay in and collaborate with the EU under a reform of the current programme, which will end in 2020.However, the UK is set to join Canada and South Korea in the category of countries that will have to pay a higher price for the privilege of collaborating, while being barred from a particular raft of programmes designed to encourage innovation.According to the draft paper, so-called “third countries” will not have a seat on the new European Innovation Council, which sets priorities, and their companies will not have the opportunity to apply for “fast, flexible grants and co-investments” designed to “bridge the ‘valley of death’ between research, commercialisation and the scaling-up of companies”.Sources said it was additionally unclear what role the UK would have in shaping the priorities of Horizon Europe after Brexit, given it would no longer be a member state and would not be an EFTA member, acceding country, candidate country or potential candidate country.The European commission’s proposals will need to be approved by the member states. A senior EU official said they were aware that the UK would seek to change the rules from within during negotiations over the bloc’s future budget, known as the multi-annual financial framework (MFF).An EU official involved in the Brexit negotiations said of last week’s talks with the UK negotiators in Brussels: “We … had a discussion on science and technology where we said that from our point of view unfortunately this was slightly early as we are coming forward in early June with the proposals for the next generation of Horizon Europe, the successor to Horizon 2020, and these programmes will set out the conditions for third countries’ participation.“We would be happy to present that to the UK once that has been published. We take good note that the UK wants to maintain its role in shaping and priority setting of EU programmes in the future, and we also took very careful note of the announcement by the UK negotiators that they intend to use their part in the EU28 negotiations about the future MFF as an instrument to influence the definition of third country part rules in EU programmes.”Last week a British presentation to the EU negotiators, who were led by Michel Barnier, argued for full access to Horizon Europe and said “as an associate country we would look to agree an appropriate level of influence on the shape of the programme. This should be greater than current non-EU precedents, recognising the quality and breadth of the UK’s contribution”. Thomas Jørgensen, the senior policy coordinator at the European University Association (EUA) working on Brexit-related issues, said the commission was acting to protect its interests in the face of the emergence of the UK as a rival economic power.He said: “It is entirely understandable that you would want to help small countries in your neighbourhood, but why would you do that for small and medium-size enterprises in South Korea or other third countries such as the UK?“The view from Brussels is that leaving the EU is the UK’s choice, it is their choice to be South Korea. If they say they want a special deal, that’s not going to work.”Jørgensen said, however, that the scale of the UK’s research strength was such that it would inevitably have a large say in at least informal settings about the direction of the programmes.He said: “There is elasticity. But if it comes down to a matter of principles, then that could be a problem.”Diplomats attached to the member states suggested there were additional concerns about giving third countries access to sensitive research information. The UK is seeking an agreement to continue the flow of data between it and the rest of Europe, but a recent report on the country’s handling of personal information held on the Schengen Information System, designed to monitor the flow of people around Europe, has damaged that case.An official paper, dated 18 May 2018 and seen by the , reveals that despite a 2015 evaluation finding serious deficiencies with the UK’s handling of personal data, a follow-up visit in 2017 had discovered that a range of recommendations had not been implemented.The report notes that the EU’s inspectors had found that “very serious deficiencies in the legal, operational and technical implementation of SIS by the UK subsist”.Among the issues that caused concern was the discovery that UK officials had been copying personal data and sharing it with US contractors working for its immigration services and the border police. Some of that information was found to be out of date as well, raising the potential of people being unfairly flagged as they passed through the UK’s borders.In a further indication of the EU’s attitude, on Wednesday the commission announced that the UK could take part in the student exchange scheme, Erasmus, after Brexit, in return for a financial contribution, but that it would have no say in shaping the programme.

We need clarity and certainty, because time is running out. Uncertainty causes less investment.”No 10 said the meeting had been an “open and productive discussion” and dialogue would continue. A spokesman said May “underlined the importance of ensuring that our future trading arrangements with the EU are as frictionless as possible”, adding that the future economic partnership would go “beyond existing models”.The meeting was attended by senior members of British and other European businesses, including Carl-Henric Svanberg, chairman of BP, Vittorio Colao, Vodafone’s outgoing chief executive, Paul Bulcke, chairman of Nestlé, and Moya Greene, the outgoing chief executive of Royal Mail.Others attended from firms including BMW, the aluminium company Norsk Hydro, the French multinational Capgemini and the energy company Iberdrola, which owns ScottishPower. More than 50 firms are members of the ERT, with combined revenues of more than £1.97tn and 6.8 million employees in Europe.Downing Street said May “recognised the necessity of providing certainty for businesses”, pointing to the agreement of a transition period at the European council in March. May and Davis also discussed the future of regulatory standards, after a presentation by the Brexit secretary on the progress of the talks.May appeared to win some backing for her bid for a bespoke deal on data-sharing laws after Brexit. Downing Street said there was “consensus” in the room that a robust agreement on data-sharing was “vital to our future economic and security relationship with the EU”.In a presentation to the EU negotiating team last week, UK officials asked for the Information Commissioner’s Office to have a seat on the body that applies data laws to companies, with preferential treatment over other non-EU countries after Brexit.But the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said in a speech that such privileged access was impossible and would impact on the EU’s ability to make its own decisions.“We cannot, we will not be able to share this decisional autonomy with a third country, undoubtedly a former member state but which no longer wants to be in the same legal ecosystem as us,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7029481e83703920c5601b5fe9e0304dd1b425c/0_936_3771_2263/master/3771.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f13f518bcef068c76224d93262474337","title":"worlds oldest lizard fossil forces rethink of reptile family tree","story":"Discovery pushes back the earliest known member of lizard and snake group by 75m yearsThe fossilised remains of a small lizard discovered in rock from the Italian Alps has shaken up the evolutionary family tree of reptiles and shed new light on the survivors of the most devastating mass extinction the world ever faced, researchers say. Thought to have lived in the triassic period, about 240 million years ago, the creature, known as Megachirella wachtleri, has been unveiled as the oldest known member of a group of reptiles known as squamates – which includes lizards, snakes and peculiar legless creatures known as worm lizards.Researchers say the finding not only sheds light on what the last common ancestor of such creatures would likely have looked like, but reveals that squamates probably appeared far earlier that previously thought, and survived one of the planet’s greatest catastrophes.“All lizards and snakes are descendants from Megachirella or a Megachirella-like lizard,” said Dr Massimo Bernardi, co-author of the study from the University of Bristol, adding that Megachirella would probably have measured about 25-30cm from its nose to the tip of its tail.Writing in the journal Nature, an international team of researchers describe how they reanalysed the 240m year old fossil of the creature which was first discovered in rock from the Dolomites in the early 2000s by an amateur collector. Using an x-ray technique known as CT-scanning, the team were able to examine in 3D previously hidden features of the fossil. In addition, they spent about 400 days visiting and examining some 150 specimens of ancient lizard-like creatures held in collections around the world, and analysed both skeletal and molecular data – including DNA – from living squamates.The results reveal that Megachirella is a squamate, pushing back the earliest known member of the group by 75m years and backing up some previous molecular studies that had proposed squamates existed in the triassic. A further result of the new family tree, the team say, is that it settles a long-standing debate, revealing that geckoes evolved earlier than iguanas.David Martill, professor of palaeobiology at the University of Portsmouth who was not involved in the study, said the revelation that squamates arose before the Great Dying casts the creatures in a new light. “This means squamates are real survivors,” he said. “The Permo-Triassic extinction event was a dangerous time to be alive. Not much escaped its deathly touch.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13f410fea65685da8279e8fbc3427295b60328db/0_45_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c7825179cb7269ab09cbce52bd68c3e","title":"bernard kantor derby young rascal","story":"It is a long time – almost an entire working life, in fact – since Bernard Kantor could be cast in the role of the little guy. Forty years after he helped to set up a small leasing and finance company in South Africa, it has grown into Investec, the sponsor of the Derby at Epsom on Saturday and a banking and investment business that manages more than £150bn of clients’ funds. But when he walks into the parade ring before the Classic this weekend, there is one sense at least in which Kantor will once again be the smallest of fry in a very big pond.No matter which colt wins on Saturday afternoon, Kantor, Investec’s managing director, will be there on the podium afterwards to hand over the trophy to the winning owner. John Magnier’s Coolmore syndicate, Sheikh Mohammed’s Godolphin, the Aga Khan and Qatar Racing are among the immense and lavishly funded bloodstock operations with live contenders. And there is also the owner of Young\u0026nbspRascal, the third-favourite, who has just five horses in training. If he wins, Kantor will be in the happy position of presenting the prize to himself.It is a possibility that he is trying to dismiss from his mind until shortly before the race. “It pushes my heart-rate up,” he said on Wednesday, demonstrating as much on the monitor on his wrist. “I’m going to use this thing at 4.29pm on Saturday\u0026nbspto see what my heart-rate actually is. It’s pretty low at about 60\u0026nbspat the moment but I will not be calm at 4.29pm on Saturday, I can assure you.”The news that 21mm of rain fell at\u0026nbspEpsom on Tuesday night to raise the prospect of some cut in the ground on Saturday will do nothing to ease Kantor’s nerves. Young Rascal’s stamina for the 12-furlong trip on Saturday is guaranteed, while\u0026nbsprivals including Saxon Warrior, the odds-on favourite, and Roaring\u0026nbspLion, second in the betting, are stepping up in distance. Soft ground, or even good-to-soft, could shave the edge from their speed and put Young Rascal in a position to strike for home in the final\u0026nbspquarter‑mile.As he showed at Chester this month, Young Rascal has a potent finishing kick for a staying horse. He was caught in a pocket in the closing stages of the Chester Vase, but chased down the leader with something to spare when he finally found some space to attack. It is a moment that Kantor has clearly replayed many times in his mind.“You can see him hesitate and look a bit left and right,” Kantor says. “His legs are going but he’s not quite sure what to do. Then he gets through and then.” He claps his hands loudly, and his heart is clearly racing once again. “You can just see the difference in the speed. There was no way they were ever going to catch him.”Kantor admits that there has been “a huge amount of luck” involved in reaching the point where one of the handful of horses he owns could win the race that he has sponsored since 2009. But then, he looks back and sees fortune playing a part in his business success too, as well as the fact that Investec sponsors the Derby in the first place.“You have to get a bit of help from above, from whoever or whatever, and we were always very fortunate,” he says. “It’s not about religion, it’s just about not being arrogant. Anyone who’s that arrogant, who thinks they’re so great that they did it on their own without any help, they’re talking nonsense.Bankers are never going to enjoy a thoroughly wholesome public image, but Kantor, who will retire from Investec this year, feels like an antidote to the relentlessly negative PR directed towards his profession in recent years. His enthusiasm for the Derby is genuine and infectious, and the most important day of his life as a racehorse owner will once again be one of the busiest of his working year.“I’m trying not to think about Young Rascal until the day, and I’ll be happy whoever it is that I’m handing the trophy to. It’s a busy working day for me and I’m busy arranging things this week. There will be a lots of guests there on the day who I’ll be looking after. I’ll be running around and seeing people and it will be tiring, but I’m very happy to be tired for one more year.”Tips by Greg Wood."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea93eaced217b1daf9dd45f6c050e812efc3ebb7/0_81_3400_2040/master/3400.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d833924d1c260398782f32e523a16568","title":"novak djokovic jaume munar progress french open","story":"On a day of rapidly swirling weather and fortunes, Novak Djokovic emerged from a second perfunctory win against a qualifier to stay in the conversation about who is good enough to stop Rafael Nadal winning his 11th French Open. He could get to the quarter‑finals once there, he might even find another gear or two, which was his trademark in his pomp.Certainly the former champion is in shape comparable to that of younger contenders in Alexander Zverev, who took five sets to defeat the world No\u0026nbsp60 Dusan Lajovic, and Grigor Dimitrov, who survived a tempestuous battle over four hours and 19 minutes against the American Jared Donaldson, who was reduced at one point to serving under-arm.Djokovic, who beat Dutra Silva in the first round, had to work his way past the stubborn challenge of the 21‑year‑old Spanish qualifier Jaume Munar – ranked 155 in the world – after which he took time to reflect on the troubles of an absent friend, Andy Murray, with whom he has had long\u0026nbspconversations.“I can only imagine how difficult it is for him to deal with the circumstances of injury,” he said. “That’s something that I can relate to. I have had quite a similar situation, although his injury takes more time, obviously. Hopefully we can see him playing on grass because that’s where, I guess, he wants to play.”He does, passionately. But it will not be easy. Nearly a year after he and Murray left Wimbledon, wounded losers who had driven each other to their physical limits in pursuit of the world No\u0026nbsp1 ranking, the Serb is still standing – just, at 22 in the world – while the Scot’s prospects of fulfilling his commitment to end an 11-month sabbatical on the Dutch grass of Rosmalen the week after the French Open remain as clear\u0026nbspas mud.The hip surgery in January that Murray hoped would restore him to full fitness has not clicked as well as he had originally thought, and there is uncertainty in the camp that he will make it to the line in Holland – or even Wimbledon. If he misses the grasscourt season, he will have no ranking. If he were to make his comeback where he has won two of his three grand slam titles, he would be outside the top 150 for the first time since August 2005. Those are scary digits.Djokovic knows as much about struggle and injury as anyone on the Tour. His chronically painful right elbow kept him out for the rest of the year after Wimbledon and his comeback, which involved a recent “minor procedure”, has gone from a limping exit in Melbourne to a decent stroll in Rome last week, where he fought hard against Nadal, and gathered conviction in two wins here. On Friday he will need to lift his game against Roberto Bautista Agut, who saw off the Colombian qualfier Santiago Giraldo in just over two hours.As for his own up-and-down journey Djokovic, true to his enthusiasm for spiritual enlightenment over the past couple of years, tried to put it in a philosophical context. Asked if getting out of his current rut was harder than when he had a similar experience in 2008, he said: “It’s all a personal perspective, how you perceive things in life. It can be really tough and it can be really easy. Everything starts and ends with us in our minds. To sit here and talk about how tough it is, and you have people starving to death, for me there is no point in talking about that. It’s just the way it is. As an athlete, I have to face these challenges, I will call them and, if I overcome them or not, it’s just a matter of work that I have put in, luck at times, and circumstances. That’s it. I have achieved so much in my life and I’m very, very grateful for that.”In light suited more to burglary than tennis, Cameron Norrie got out of jail against Lucas Pouille when he dragged back a two-set deficit four minutes short of the tournament late-finish record of 9.56pm in 2010. He will resume on Thursday on the main court needing more heroics to overhaul the Frenchman’s 6-2, 6-4, 5-7 lead.It might not be beyond him. When he induced a final errant forehand from Pouille – who plays with contact lenses – he had effected an escape worthy of Houdini, and looked (to all those close enough to tell) as if he was up for the fight."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7be7771f602e84d42ad9e35b3db57795db0b47f0/0_14_3112_1867/master/3112.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e4242b693b7592b3cc0ac0122460a746","title":"rafael nadal naomi osaka paris johanna konta","story":"The clay of Roland Garros is supposed to be mysterious, an ochre deathbed for the innocent and the ill-prepared. However, at least two players at this French Open have surprisingly ergent views on it.Naomi Osaka, one of the sport’s unusual thinkers, says it is not clay at all – “not clay-clay” anyway, as she put it after bundling Zarina Dyas out in the second round on Wednesday.Asked to explain, the 20-year-old Japanese star with the American twang said: “I just focus more on the tennis part rather than making up excuses of what the surface is and how my play style isn’t suited for it, or whatever.”Her game was good enough to beat the world No 51, 6-4, 7-5. Seeded here for the first time, Osaka does not lack for confidence.As for her dismissal of the dirt at her feet, Rafael Nadal disagrees. The Spaniard, who has a degree in clay, surprised everyone when he said of his favourite killing ground: “The court is more slippery than usual. I slid a lot when I started off or when I moved to another side. It was quite complicated.Johanna Konta, who insisted she had no fear of the Parisian clay after a fourth quick singles exit here, blew a 4-2 lead in the third set of her doubles match alongside Alison Riske, as Annabel Medina Garrigues and Arantxa Parra Santonja won 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (3) in two hours and 22 minutes.Konta’s first-round conqueror, Yulia Putintseva, went through by defeating the American Jennifer Brady, 6-4, 6-3. Next up for her is Barbora Strycova, who got past Ekaterina Makarova in two sets.Petra Kvitova, who was a game away from going home in her first-round match against the unseeded Verónica Cepede Royg, seems to be her old self again. The eighth seed defeated Lara Arruabarrena 6-0, 6-4 in 68 minutes. She is in the half of the draw that has already lost the defending champion Jelena Ostapenko and Venus Williams. Anett Kontaveit, who looked good in defeating the Romanian qualifier Alexandra Dulgheru, 7-5, 6-2, should provide another stiff test.Heather Watson, who is still in singles, won her doubles match with Tatjana Maria against the French pair Manon Arcangioli and Shérazad Reix, 6-4, 6-4."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd65d8eaee9c00c2511cbb77ae38379df7a50363/4_128_4931_2960/master/4931.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12c770b22f6cdf7b98ca2902352b99df","title":"monaco grand prix f1 lewis hamilton","story":"There’s a rule of thumb around talking down the product, a “doing a Ratner” kind of thing, and by God does it apply to sport. Such is the competitive nature of the business, and of the iniduals involved, that saying anything remotely critical about an activity in general or a performance more specifically is about as likely as watching a free-to-air Test match.So the aftermath of the Monaco Grand Prix on Sunday was quite something to behold. “This is probably the most boring race ever,” was Fernando Alonso’s considered opinion. “Extremely boring.” Lewis Hamilton began his remarks more cautiously – “It was a super-unexciting race for everyone” – but when a fan hollered his own opinion that it was the “most boring race ever”, Hamilton put his foot down.“Thank God you said it,” he replied. “I thought I was the only one. Wow, it was intensely boring. Oh my God, yes. Forty laps to go, I was like, ‘Oh God, please.’ When it finished, I was like, ‘Thank goodness.’”Reading those remarks back, they look a little odd. It’s a bit like Hamilton has belatedly read the room and realised no one is in the market for a “I think the team did a great job” analysis. Alternatively, it’s how he actually feels and he’s delighted at being given licence to talk about it and he could go on for days. Either way it looks a bit weird.The technical explanation for Sunday’s snoozefest centred on the choice of tyres. Pirelli’s hyper-soft range, as well as sharing the marketing language usually reserved for toilet paper, were the sort that wear down easy. The faster that cars drove on them the quicker they would need changing and that might run the risk of taking more than one pit stop, a potentially catastrophic tactical error. So everyone drove slowly.Hamilton diagnosed another problem with the race, however, and that was Monaco itself. The picturesque principality, so beloved of leathery old men and their unbuttoned lilac shirts, does not have quite the right topography for modern Formula One. But Hamilton has a plan to fix that. “I spoke to Prince Albert the other day and said maybe we should make it longer,” he said. “There are more roads so maybe we can change this great track and make it even better. Or maybe the format should change.” Just chuck that in at the end there, why don’t you.A civil engineering subcommittee of Hamilton and Prince Albert is a prospect that naturally excites. Lewis lives in the principality, of course, and surely knows the streets well, flaneuring around the more obscure routes as he contemplates how little tax he pays. Albert, meanwhile, not only shares Hamilton’s elite sporting credentials (he was unfailingly selected for the Monaco bobsled team in the 80s and 90s whenever the then-heir to the Monégasque throne put his name forward), he also goes by the nickname “the Plugged-in Prince” because of his penchant for electric cars. These two men getting together over a Pschitt! and contemplating optimal traffic flow couldn’t fail to get lap times down by a second or two.“If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it” is another phrase used in business and there’s certainly been a lot of fixing in F1 of late. Since Bernie Ecclestone relinquished the steering wheel to Liberty Media last year, the sport has changed its race times to encourage European TV audiences. It has realised women are people too and replaced grid girls with grid kids. It has got a new logo and will even unveil an international theme tune, composed by the bloke who did the score for Iron Man 3.All this could be seen as a certain amount of tinkering around the edges. More systemic problems in the sport are still visible from space. These include the massive financial disparities between teams that, for instance, meant Ferrari, second in the constructors’ championship, took home nearly 10 times the amount in payments from Formula One Management in 2017 than eighth-placed Haas. Then there are the regulations around aerodynamics, which go way over my head but have contrived to create a situation where only three teams have won a race since 2014.One final problem is the tracks themselves: F1’s global expansion by chequebook has occasioned circuits in Azerbaijan, Bahrain and elsewhere that have served up tedious fare regardless of the state of the tyres.All these problems are for the owner to work out and new aerodynamic rules come into effect next year. Perhaps Liberty could also ship Hamilton off to Baku with his planometer and see how he can shake things up. Whatever is planned, it might be best to do it quickly, however. Despite a slight uptick in the UK this year, the long-term trajectory for F1 viewing figures across the world is downwards.So maybe the fixes will come in and F1’s glory days will return. But with Nascar also experiencing a sharp decline, perhaps motorsport is experiencing something more existential.In the real world people still love their cars but they don’t necessarily enjoy driving them. Most journeys are characterised by snarl-ups and that platonic ideal of an empty, winding road is increasingly a myth (I sat in traffic in the Cairngorms last year, go figure). Perhaps the car is losing the romantic association it held in the public imagination for a century. After all, the last thing driving was supposed to be was boring."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b70af4228da49e257e27a5d00c1d5ce1cca3211/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bdb47b24910e4e80819f3a53cbd1859","title":"piers morgan richard madeley good morning britain host","story":"As an abruptly terminated interview with Gavin Williamson shows, Morgan’s Good Morning Britain summer stand-in is even more lacking in self-awareness than his predecessorOur country has been cleaved in two. Unable to reconcile their differences over this insurmountable matter, friendships have come to an abrupt halt and families have been permanently torn asunder. The nation is in disarray. Common ground is nowhere to be seen. And all because people can’t work out whether Piers Morgan or Richard Madeley is the more spectacularly weird Good Morning Britain host.Sure, on the surface, Piers Morgan runs away with it. Ever since he debuted in 2015, Morgan has essentially treated the programme the same way your deaf grandfather treats an Amazon Echo, bellowing an impenetrable barrage of opinion and abuse at the top of his voice regardless of anything else that happens to be going on. Piers Morgan’s gone-to-seed Joffrey shtick is now so pronounced that his colleagues openly make hay with it, tweeting pictures of their own distant faraway stares whenever he so much as opens his mouth. For a while, he looked unbeatable.But now a contender has arrived, and he is glorious. Since first being brought aboard as Morgan’s holiday cover in the middle of last year, Richard Madeley has quietly carved out a niche of his own. Madeley isn’t as combative as Morgan, but what he lacks in aggression he also lacks in self-awareness. A one-man Accidental Partridge generator, Madeley is fast developing into Good Morning Britain’s real star. In his first week, he overcooked a link about quicksand and veered off into confusing tangents about Gaby Roslin. In March, he commented lustily on a weather presenter’s dress immediately before crashing into a segment about the #MeToo movement.And on Tuesday – and this might be what ultimately clinches his victory – Madeley prematurely ended an interview with Gavin Williamson live on air. Peeved that the defence secretary wouldn’t answer a question on some recent language about Russia, Madeley began to scrawl furiously on his script. “You’re not gonna answer, are you? OK, alright, OK, interview terminated then”, he barked like a stroppy teenager, while an African elephant aimlessly stumbled around behind Williamson’s back.It was all there. Drama, showmanship and, most of all, the sense that this was just the tip of the iceberg. Over the years, Madeley has essentially become a concentrated version of himself. You sense that all the golden moments of old – the Ali G impersonation, the time he shook his fist at his daughter’s mugger on live TV – have been inexorably leading to a moment like this. Whenever he appears on camera, Madeley gets to ride roughshod over Good Morning Britain. It’s a place where he’s allowed to indulge all of his whims and digressions, no matter how batty or grumpy they happen to be. If Madeley is suddenly gripped by an idea – and he often is – Good Morning Britain is now the place where it can rise up and consume him. Make no mistake, Morgan created this environment. Thanks to him, Good Morning Britain’s dynamic is now one where the male hosts get to bulldoze whatever boorish path they like and the – much more traditionally competent – female hosts good-naturedly roll their eyes at the damage. When Morgan goes away, Madeley fills this vacuum perfectly.The problem is that Madeley is better at this than Morgan. The latter is hamstrung by his need to constantly be seen as a capital-J journalist a man forged in the fires of tabloid publishing, doggedly seeking out the truth no matter how unappealing it makes him look. But Madeley’s training ground was daytime television, so he’s softer and more camera-ready. Where Morgan looks angry, Madeley just looks clueless, and cluelessness is much more palatable first thing in the morning.This might be premature, but it feels as if the competition is over. The Piers Morgan experiment was a noble one, but Richard Madeley is the T-1000 to his T-800. He’s slicker and harder to resist. Instead of punching you to death, Richard Madeley will creep into your room and shove a spike through your face. At this point, Good Morning Britain is his for the taking. Unless Good Morning Britain does something radical and hires someone more suited to the job. Someone like, I don’t know, a tomato on a stick."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/583528d9c60699838a9c4f0ab42291dd94b4718c/0_12_3543_2126/master/3543.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70f191ad77e02b3cf10993ea13b2d178","title":"head of italys m5s rekindles negotiations to form a government","story":"A bitter row over the country’s future in the eurozone had ided populist partiesThe Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, has granted Italy’s two populist leaders more time to form a government in an attempt to stave off a snap election.Mattarella signalled he was ready to install a technocrat government if a deal could not be reached, but decided to give Luigi Di Maio of the Five Star Movement and Matteo Salvini of the League more time to draw up a list of ministers that could be accepted by all parties, according to a source close to the presidential palace.The decision to “slow things down” – taken three months after an election that resulted in a hung parliament – was an attempt to try to stem a possible financial crisis, after markets slumped on Monday and Tuesday owing to fears of what a new vote could bring.A bitter row between Mattarella and the two populists at the weekend had prompted the latter to step back from their plan to assume power, but the latest twist means Di Maio and Salvini could yet form a government.It is unclear, however, whether the pair will stick by plans to nominate Giuseppe Conte, a law professor, as prime minister – a controversial choice since he has no political experience – and a Eurosceptic as finance minister. On Sunday night Mattarella refused to endorse the nomination of Paolo Savona for the finance brief, saying his appointment would send a message to markets and investors that Italy was prepared to default on its obligations to Brussels and might even contemplate an exit from the eurozone. Mattarella said leaving the euro posed a risk to all Italians’ financial security.Mattarella’s decision set off a chain of events that roiled Italian markets: Conte resigned as prime minister-in waiting and new elections appeared to be imminent, worrying markets and officials in Brussels. Their concern was that new elections could strengthen populist gains in Italy, leading to even greater uncertainty about the country’s future in the eurozone.Those fears were slightly allayed on Wednesday after Di Maio opened the door to new talks with Salvini and suggested he was open to reaching a compromise that could satisfy Mattarella’s objections.Di Maio suggested he was open to dropping Savona as finance minister and putting him into another post, but still wanted Conte, who has served as Di Maio’s personal attorney, to serve as prime minister. Di Maio said that if a deal could not be reached, he favoured snap elections. “There are two paths ahead. Either we launch the Conte government with a reasonable solution or we vote right away,” he said.Italian markets rallied on the news. Any government formed by M5S and the League would have a relatively narrow majority in the senate, limiting its ability to take any dramatic action.Salvini, the bombastic and xenophobic head of the League, who put forward plans during the election campaign to detain and deport hundreds of thousand of immigrants, indicated he still favoured snap elections.Even before the fracas over Savona’s appointment, the marriage of convenience between Di Maio and Salvini has looked tenuous since the 4 March election. The M5S and the League are Italy’s biggest populist parties but differ significantly on policy. An agreement reached this month for a shared agenda was focused on plans to increase spending, cut taxes and take a far tougher approach on immigration than the previous centre-left government, including by creating new detention centres across Italy.Di Maio and Salvini reached a deal to nominate Conte to serve as prime minister last week. Mattarella agreed on the choice, despite questions over whether he had padded out his CV. Mattarella has faced intense scrutiny for his handling of the crisis, with both Di Maio and Salvini accusing the president of acting too politically when his role is supposed to be politically neutral.

In March, Duarte accused Yunes and the Mexican newspaper Reforma of violating his human rights and his right to a fair trial.On Tuesday, Yunes claimed Macías had been an important player in Duarte’s alleged corruption racket, and argued that her detention would help recover millions of dollars of missing funds spirited overseas to places including Houston, Miami, New York and London.CNN en Español reported that lawyers acting for Duarte had dismissed the legal campaign against him and his family as politically motivated. Macías’s lawyer told the channel that his client was happy to cooperate with Mexican authorities.Little was publicly known about Macías’s whereabouts until this week, when Yunes claimed that she and her three children had moved into a luxury property in SW1, one of London’s most desirable postcodes.At a specially organised press conference, Yunes said his team had tracked Macías to a redbrick block of luxury flats in Belgravia’s Wilbraham Place.The website of the estate agent Savills shows a “superb” 156 sq metre four-bedroom flat at the property, which sold for a cool £3.6m in April 2017.That, according to Mexican media reports, was the same month Macías arrived in London to start a new life – although it was not clear from Yunes’s claims whether she had been the buyer.An eight-minute propaganda video, released by Yunes, revelled in Macías’s proximity to British royalty and power. “Queen Elizabeth of England lives 1km away in Buckingham Palace!” a narrator gasped as he described the location of her upmarket home.“Prince Charles – the heir to the throne – lives 1.5km away in a Palace known as Clarence House! Margaret Thatcher used to live 600m away!”“Karime Macías’s residence,” the narrator continued, “is 40m from Sloane Square, one of the city’s two most exclusive shopping districts with jewellers like Cartier, Tiffany, Bulgari and boutiques belonging to the most expensive fashion designers like Chanel, Valentino, Hermès, Armani, Salvatore Ferragamo, Prada and others.”In Yunes’s telling, Macías adopted mundane and extravagant habits in her new home.

She allegedly spent at least £60,000 a month, and attended a “face gym” in an attempt to strengthen her facial muscles. Critics have accused Yunes of playing politics with the accusations in a bid to give his son the edge in the race to succeed him as governor when Mexico goes to the polls on 1 July.But the governor declared the revelations were evidence of his “frontal assault” on corruption. “Nobody deserves abundance at the cost of the poverty of the people of Veracruz,” said Yunes, who called for the UK to extradite Macías immediately.On Tuesday, Interpol reportedly issued a red notice for Macías’s arrest after a request from Mexican authorities. Macías was reported to have applied for asylum in the UK last year, claiming she faced political persecution back home. An online petition urged British authorities to reject that request.“Please, Home Office, do not take part in Mexico’s long-reigning impunity and help us make them face justice by denying them asylum,” it says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff84c48828989deba9b73d38b8209eaa292b5100/0_227_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfc773ca56f07929c68725954efe29df","title":"karachi residents cool off pakistan heatwave in pictures","story":"Pakistan’s most populous city is in the grips of a heatwave as temperatures soar to 45C.

Photograph: iStockThe Government has insisted that a major overhaul of the special needs assistant (SNA) scheme in schools will improve outcomes for young people and is not aimed at cutting costs.Almost 35,000 students with additional care needs, such as autism, are supported by more than 14,000 SNAs to attend school each day.A review of the scheme by the National Council for Special Education has found that, while it works well for some pupils, “radical changes” are needed to improve outcomes for students.This involves broadening the current role of SNAs – currently confined to care needs such as toileting, mobility and feeding – to help assist with the delivery of speech and language or occupational therapy.It says qualifications required to become an SNA should rise, while existing staff should receive additional training.SNAs will also be renamed “inclusion support assistants” to reflect their focus on developing students’ independence.There are also plans to provide in-school therapy, such as speech and language and occupational therapy, through pilot projects which will later be expanded across the State.The Department of Public Expenditure has previously expressed concern over “rapidly escalating” costs which have jumped by more than a third in the past five years to half a billion euro.However, Minister for Education Richard Bruton said the changes were not about saving money.“This is about ensuring the investment we make in children with special educational needs has the best impact,” he said.Mr Bruton said the report made it clear the State’s current response to meeting the needs of students with additional care needs should be broadened to offer a more comprehensive and tailored response.“My department will now begin to develop proposals to implement the recommendations of the comprehensive review of the SNA scheme,” he said.He said it would take a “number of years” to implement and that the Government was committed in the meantime to ensuring the needs of all children were met.Among the council’s key recommendation include:Frontloading SNA support so the majority of posts are allocated ahead of time, removing the need for assessments and allowing for earlier intervention.Boosting access to a greater range of supports and making expertise available in regional teams to support schools. This will include 10 regional teams with 230 specialist teachers, therapists, special educational needs organisers and behavioural practitioners who will work directly with schools and students.Training and upskilling for SNAs as well as teachers and the wider school community.Students to have access to support without the need for diagnosis of a disability.The council estimates the changes would cost an additional €40 million a year, and says they should be phased in over time.The proposed changes follow an 18-month review of the scheme, along with consultation with schools, parents, policy-makers and students."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3513041.1527621230!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit aids surge in irish passport applications","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Department of Foreign Affairs has appealed to people to renew passports online.The UK’s exit from the European Union next year has “undoubtedly” contributed to a 25 per cent spike in applications for Irish passports, the Department of Foreign Affairs has said.The number of applications in the first four months of this year has increased by 25 per cent when compared with the figures for the same period in 2016.The department said the Passport Office, which falls under its remit, was currently experiencing “peak season”, adding that the number of applications received is up by 10 per cent compared with last year, continuing a recent trend.Each year, the Passport Office recruits additional temporary staff to assist with the seasonal increase in applications. This year, sanction was received for 220 temporary clerical officers to assist permanent staff in processing applications.“The increase in the volume of applications is undoubtedly in part influenced by Brexit-related demand, with around 10 per cent of all applications this year from applicants living in Great Britain,” the department said in response to queries.“However, there are also other drivers of demand, including a trend towards early renewal of passports, a growth in outbound travel, and a growing population.”As of the end of April, more than 276,000 passports had been issued since the turn of the year. In the same period, 39,000 passport applications were received from applicants residing in Northern Ireland, and more than 41,000 were received from applicants residing in Britain.The department said that in addition to taking on temporary staff, the Passport Office was working to improve services, including plans to expand the online renewal project, as part of its response to increasing application volumes. It said iniduals seeking to renew their passport should do so online, as waiting times for this service had been reduced significantly in recent years.“Adults renewing their passports are strongly encouraged to renew their passport online,” it said. “The online passport application service is fast, convenient and secure, and is processing applications in 10 working days, plus postage time.“In fact, in 50 per cent of cases, the processing time is currently down to five working days. “Applicants can apply from anywhere in the world, with no need for a paper form, witness or printed photos. Renewal applications received through Passport Express are currently processed in 16 working days.”It also said that applications from first-time applicants, as well as from those with loststolen passports, take longer to process.“For these categories of applications, robust identity verification and entitlement checks, as well as vital fraud and security procedures, are necessary to ensure that the integrity and security of the Irish passport is maintained,” it said. “These checks take additional time to complete.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":null,"title":"clare daly gives impassioned testimony on referendum result in the d%C3%A1il","story":"  May 29, 2018TD applauded by colleagues after impassioned speech during first D\u0026aacuteil sitting since referendum "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3514224.1527709277!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coveney says calls for border poll not wise and not welcome","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSimon Coveney: “We should be understanding of the sensitive juncture we’re at.” Photograph: Cyril ByrneCalls for a vote on a united Ireland at this “sensitive juncture” of the Brexit negotiations, now or in the near future, are “not wise and not welcome”, Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney has said.Mr Coveney was delivering a keynote speech on the Government’s Brexit policy at the British Irish Chamber of Commerce annual networking dinner in Dublin.Shailesh Vara, parliamentary under-secretary of state for Northern Ireland, also addressed the event, on the British government’s commitment to avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland.Following the referendum on the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution last weekend, Sinn Féin vice-president and leader in the North, Michelle O’Neill, called for a referendum on a united Ireland.“We can see the support for a sensible Brexit outcome in all communities in Northern Ireland, where a recent high-profile poll puts support for staying within the Single Market and Customs Union at 85 per cent,” Mr Coveney said. “But we should also be understanding of the sensitive juncture which we’re at. Calls from some quarters for a Border poll now or in the near future are not wise and not welcome.”Mr Coveney told the attendees the Government continued to do everything in its power to ensure the relationship between Britain and Ireland would thrive following Brexit.But he added: “We should not confuse optimism and positivity over future relations with any naivety over current talks. On the contrary – we are clear-eyed that greater intensity and realism needs to be brought to bear. And also that this needs to happen urgently.“It is acknowledged now that the EU and UK teams have not made the headway since March that we had hoped they would,” said Mr Coveney. “In response, we have made two things very clear. Firstly, that significantly more progress must be made on the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland before the June European Council. And secondly, that there will be no final withdrawal agreement, in October or at any stage, without that backstop on avoiding a hard border.”He said that backstop should now be the “highest priority”.The Minister emphasised the importance of delivering on commitments already made, and “the overarching guarantee of no physical infrastructure at the Border and no associated checks or controls”.He said progress in the negotiations since March had been too slow and that “significantly more by way of agreement is needed ahead of the June European Council”.Mr Coveney noted that those at the dinner represented some of the 38,000 Irish companies now doing business in Britain.He said they exemplified the mutually beneficial trading relationship Ireland and the United Kingdom enjoyed, a relationship worth more than €65 billion each year, which sustained more than 400,000 jobs across both islands.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord it took 35 years to build this stunning result","story":"Thirty-five years after it was placed into the Constitution, the electorate voted for the Eighth Amendment to be repealed and for provision be made for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day. The day when the intelligent, compassionate citizens of Ireland turned to the Catholic Church and the retreating fundamentalists and firmly said: “Thanks, but no thanks.

The WHO acknowledged however, that identifying all potential contacts remains challenging.  Since the start of the current outbreak earlier this month, 54 cases -  including 35 confirmed instances - of the disease have been reported, mostly in the remote areas of Bikoro and Iboko in the country’s north-west Equateur province. Twenty-five people have died. No new cases have been reported in the past two days. Although only a minority of cases have been reported in Mbandaka, the vaccination effort has to date focused on the densely populated city of 1.2 million due to fears the number of Ebola cases could rise rapidly in an urban environment.Dr. Salama said that take up of the vaccine among people deemed to be at risk of the disease has been high. “The vaccine is proving to be a very acceptable intervention to the community,” said Dr. Salama.He acknowledged however, that the WHO and partner agencies were “still at an early stage in this outbreak response”. He said: “We can’t conclude that we have safeguarded the city of Mbandaka.” Dr Salama did not rule out the possibility of further cases in the city.   The WHO is now expanding the vaccination campaign into the rural areas at the centre of the outbreak. On Monday, WHO began vaccinations in Bikoro, where the outbreak was first declared.  The WHO is also expecting to receive approval in the next few days from the government of the DRC to use five new drugs on patients in Ebola treatment centres. The drugs are all unregistered and will be used as part of a clinical trial.  Dr. Salama said that it was not a simple effort to do this kind of trial in this kind of environment. The WHO hopes that the trial will pave the way for future Ebola treatment efforts. Earlier this month, WHO experts concluded that the current Ebola outbreak did not constitute a “public health emergency of international concern. The health agency is however, continuing to monitor potential locations, including 80 ports on the Congo river in DRC and neighbouring Republic of Congo for new cases of the disease.The current outbreak in the DRC is the worst outbreak of Ebola since the 2014 - 2015 outbreak which killed  11,300 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health SecurityDrug company says Ambien \u0026#39does not cause racism\u0026#39 after Roseanne Barr tweetDevelopers required to plant \u0026#39urban forests\u0026#39 by covering quarter of new estates with trees under landmark plansFormer Southampton FC youth coach Bob Higgins waged \u0026#39campaign of widespread sexual abuse\u0026#39, court hearsPoland asks Donald Trump to establish permanent US military base to counter Russian aggressionDonald Trump expresses regret at picking Jeff Sessions as attorney general amid clashes over Russia probeOpioid traces found in mussels off the coast of SeattleUS televangelist appeals to followers for $54 million private jetHalf of 999 patients to be assessed on scene amid rising hospital pressuresAnti-Putin Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko shot dead in Ukraine capital Judge \u0026#39humbled\u0026#39 by \u0026#39love that shone through\u0026#39 Grenfell fire tributes  Belgium terrorist attack: Hero hostage convinced Liege gunman to spare schoolchildrenPhilippine president Rodrigo Duterte orders destruction of smuggled motorcyclesPakistan and India agree to stop exchanging fire in KashmirItaly renews attempts to form a populist coalition after three months of turmoilEight million bottles\u0026#39 worth of Champagne grapes wiped out by freak hailstormsScientists laud bioersity on renowned grouse moor after recording 103 bird speciesPolice hunt for \u0026#39botox bandits\u0026#39 suspected of not paying for £2,230 of treatments Comment: Don\u0026#39t pity the only child.

A particular favourite of his was Stuck on You by Lionel Richie, the court heard.Prosecutor Adam Feest QC told the court that Higgins was a predatory paedophile.He said that if any players complained about Higgins\u0027 actions, their future football careers would be placed in serious jeopardy.Prosecutor Adam Feest QC told the court that Higgins was a \u0026#34predatory paedophile\u0026#34The prosecutor said: On 16th November, 2016, ex-professional football player Andy Woodward made disclosures about sexual abuse he had suffered at the hands of a member of the coaching staff, not this defendant, when he had been younger.In response to the high level of publicity this generated, the NSPCC set up a dedicated helpline to field calls from anyone who had encountered childhood sexual abuse within the sport.The telephone started ringing and one name was mentioned over and over again - that of Bob Higgins.Higgins, of Southampton, has denied 50 counts of indecent assault on a male person.The trial, which is expected to last 10 weeks, continues.Drug company says Ambien \u0026#39does not cause racism\u0026#39 after Roseanne Barr tweetDevelopers required to plant \u0026#39urban forests\u0026#39 by covering quarter of new estates with trees under landmark plansPoland asks Donald Trump to establish permanent US military base to counter Russian aggressionDonald Trump expresses regret at picking Jeff Sessions as attorney general amid clashes over Russia probeOpioid traces found in mussels off the coast of SeattleUS televangelist appeals to followers for $54 million private jetHalf of 999 patients to be assessed on scene amid rising hospital pressuresAnti-Putin Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko shot dead in Ukraine capital Judge \u0026#39humbled\u0026#39 by \u0026#39love that shone through\u0026#39 Grenfell fire tributes  Belgium terrorist attack: Hero hostage convinced Liege gunman to spare schoolchildrenPhilippine president Rodrigo Duterte orders destruction of smuggled motorcyclesPakistan and India agree to stop exchanging fire in KashmirItaly renews attempts to form a populist coalition after three months of turmoilEight million bottles\u0026#39 worth of Champagne grapes wiped out by freak hailstormsScientists laud bioersity on renowned grouse moor after recording 103 bird speciesPolice hunt for \u0026#39botox bandits\u0026#39 suspected of not paying for £2,230 of treatments Comment: Don\u0026#39t pity the only child.

They discovered that mussels in three out of 18 locations came back positive for trace amounts of the painkiller oxycodone. Two were near Bremerton’s shipyard and one was in Elliot Bay, near Harbor Island in Seattle.The scientists from the Puget Sound Institute insisted that seafood lovers should not be concerned – the amount present was tiny, and the mussels were placed in urban areas where shellfish is not cultivated anyway.But, they said, it was a sign of how America’s opioid addiction is affecting the natural world.What we eat and what we excrete goes into the Puget Sound, said Jennifer Lanksbury, a biologist at the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife. It\u0027s telling me there\u0027s a lot of people taking oxycodone in the Puget Sound area.Previous studies have shown traces of cocaine and other drugs in the mussels, which act as water filters and provide a good analysis of contaminates. But it is the first time opioids have been detected.Mussels are not believed to process drugs like oxycodone, and thus would not necessarily be physically harmed by the presence of it in their tissues, but fish are not so lucky.  Scientists at the University of Utah recently discovered that, if given the opportunity, zebrafish will willingly dose themselves with opioids. Scientists say salmon and other fish might have a similar response.Ms Lanksbury said the results should be a wakeup call.“Hopefully our data shows what’s out there, and can get the process started for cleaning up our waters,” she said.Drug overdoses have dramatically increased over the last two decades, with deaths more than tripling between 1999 and 2016, according to the US Center for Disease Control (CDC). In 2016, more than 63,000 people died from drug overdoses, and more than 42,000 of these involved prescription or illicit opioids. The CDC said in March that the overdose death rate from synthetic opioids, excluding methadone, more than doubled in the period 2015-16. They said the death toll was likely driven by illicitly-manufactured fentanyl.Washington state is not even the worst affected area. West Virginia, New Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts and areas of the Mid West, including Ohio and Utah, are seen as among the hardest hit.Drug company says Ambien \u0026#39does not cause racism\u0026#39 after Roseanne Barr tweetDevelopers required to plant \u0026#39urban forests\u0026#39 by covering quarter of new estates with trees under landmark plansFormer Southampton FC youth coach Bob Higgins waged \u0026#39campaign of widespread sexual abuse\u0026#39, court hearsPoland asks Donald Trump to establish permanent US military base to counter Russian aggressionDonald Trump expresses regret at picking Jeff Sessions as attorney general amid clashes over Russia probeUS televangelist appeals to followers for $54 million private jetHalf of 999 patients to be assessed on scene amid rising hospital pressuresAnti-Putin Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko shot dead in Ukraine capital Judge \u0026#39humbled\u0026#39 by \u0026#39love that shone through\u0026#39 Grenfell fire tributes  Belgium terrorist attack: Hero hostage convinced Liege gunman to spare schoolchildrenPhilippine president Rodrigo Duterte orders destruction of smuggled motorcyclesPakistan and India agree to stop exchanging fire in KashmirItaly renews attempts to form a populist coalition after three months of turmoilEight million bottles\u0026#39 worth of Champagne grapes wiped out by freak hailstormsScientists laud bioersity on renowned grouse moor after recording 103 bird speciesPolice hunt for \u0026#39botox bandits\u0026#39 suspected of not paying for £2,230 of treatments Comment: Don\u0026#39t pity the only child.

They work on issues that transcend borders. They have to be free to attract and retain the best global talent to innovate and compete. Student news in picturesStudent news in picturesSouth Korean policemen detain student protestors during a

Many of our major competitors are growing their investment in higher education and doing more to attract international talent. In order to maintain our global position, we need to continue to invest in higher education and ensure that the UK projects a more open and welcoming message for talented international staff and students.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

One was so long ago that engraving had to do the job of photography the other was recent enough that some people alive today will have heard about it from their parents. In one, a foreign ship came to grief in British waters in the other, a British vessel went down in foreign waters, and down she stayed.First to Texel, safe haven, population 13,500: the largest of the West Frisian Islands off the coast of the Netherlands in the Wadden Sea. Today it is a magnet for Dutch cyclists, walkers, swimmers and riders (the latter an important reminder that Texel is the only known place where an entire navy was defeated by men on horseback, which is another tale altogether).In June 1743, a 700 ton vessel, VOC Hollandia, set sail on her maiden voyage bound for Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, now known as Jakarta. In any study of trade between Europe and Asia throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch East India Company is pivotal, shipping everything from nutmegs and cinnamon to coffee and tobacco, porcelain to rubber. And that is what VOC stands for: Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie.A brief history of democracy: Is it the \u0027will of the people\u0027?Yet on this prestigious occasion, Hollandia, being of brand new and bold design, an impressive 42 metres in length, was carrying a particularly special cargo: not only many VIP passengers but also 130,000 coins. Most were “pillar-dollars”, cut to represent smaller denominations, but among the haul were also highly valuable Mexican and Guatemalan silver coins.Hollandia’s captain must have been nervous therefore, as he headed for Brittany through rough seas. Perhaps he was aware too that just 36 years before, in 1707, at least 1,550 men had perished in the same waters, haplessly drifting towards the Scillies aboard four Royal Navy warships: the Firebrand, the Romney, the Association and the Eagle. (Indeed, square mile for square mile, the treacherous Scillies are probably responsible for more of the world’s estimated 159,000 shipwrecks than anywhere else.)Remember, these were the days before the invention of reliable navigation instruments still before the erection of most lighthouses.Texel is now a popular tourist venueSure enough, like those earlier ships, the Hollandia was blown off course, scarcely six weeks after setting sail, on a blustery 13 July. And it too came to grief off the Isles of Scilly, striking the notorious Gunner Rock, going down just off Annet, an uninhabited nature reserve just 54 acres in size, 20 miles from the Cornish coast.Nobody lived to tell the tale.Miraculously, in 1971 a London attorney called Rex Cowan discovered the Hollandia’s wreck, along with its bronze cannons and some of its treasure. Unusually, he was using a proton magnetometer, allowing him to test the Earth’s field of magnetic resonance, which in the process reveals every slight variation across that field – including ferrous objects embedded in land or sea.However, it is now time to turn to the anniversary of a sinking far further away and to consider the watery grave awaiting an equally emblematic vessel. This was a calamity that was far more preventable.Many boats have come a cropper in the waters around the Scilly Isles (iStock)State of the art flagship and battleship, the HMS Victoria – named in named in honour of the Queen’s impending Golden Jubilee in 1886 – was launched at a cost of £845 from Elswick on the Tyne. When she headed for the Mediterranean in June 1893 for training exercises, she had already endured one major mishap – a grounding at Platea, off the Greek coast, with Captain Maurice Archibald Bourke having permitted members of his crew to misplace the buoys that might have saved him from some very shallow waters.On that first cataclysmic day, 29 January 1892, no full tide – indeed nothing at all – would get the extraordinarily long (100 metres), extraordinarily heavy (11,200 tons) Victoria afloat again. Jettisoning 483 tons of coal, and calling for a tow from three other Royal Navy frigates, somehow the Victoria – its bottom damaged, three of its compartments seriously damaged – resumed its voyage on 4 February, limping into the new Hamilton Dock, Malta, for repairs. Bourke, despite being severely censured, retained his command.  HMS Victoria in dock, prior to completionAt the dawn of a second catastrophic day, 22 June 1893, Bourke and his contemporaries, among them Captain Jenkins on the Collingwood and Captain Markham on the Camperdown, were lined up like tin soldiers ready for an experimental manoeuvre – a very tight one at that. It was their misfortune to be in the hands of Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon, Commander of the British Mediterranean fleet: an obstinate, overbearing man with some very peculiar traits and strategies.Tryon was deliberately taciturn and unapproachable – the better, he thought, to assert the superiority of his rank. The better too to outdo “inferior” French and Italian navies also cruising the vital Mediterranean and the better to force his officers to think on their feet.Inexplicably – and at a time when signalling remained primitive, based as it was on a mixture of flags, semaphores and lamps – Tryon wanted the two columns of his fleet to turn, uniformly, a full 180 degrees, first towards each other then (so the theory went) retracing their prior course. His 11 Captains – with Tryon himself menacingly aboard the Victoria – were to do this whilst positioned a mere 1,100 or 1,200 metres from each other, even though a gap of 1,800-2,200 metres might have been considered a safe bare minimum.Markham hesitated. Surely Tryon had confused radii for diameters? Surely he had issued the sort of order likely to be revoked any minute? Perhaps Tryon really intended the convoy to turn 60 degrees to port, then 60 degrees to starboard, before resuming its original course?Tryon however, was getting impatient. Fearing humiliation – his colleagues also hesitant to defy their esteemed commander – Markham aboard the Camperdown conceded, swinging towards the fated Victoria, despite believing he cannot avoid hitting her.  Even so, the Victoria – built before the installation of automatic bulkhead doors – has many proven stabilisers. Perhaps Bourke is a more gifted captain than he has previously demonstrated?At the last, both lead vessels went straight into reverse thrust. But it was all too late.Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon was a difficult man insofar as his junior colleagues were concernedThe toughened steel ram of the Camperdown tore 9 feet into the side of the Victoria, a full 12 feet below its waterline. After two minutes the two vessels disengage but the Victoria lists, her many gun hatches and portholes taking in floods of swirling water.Three minutes later, her bow dips – but an unrelenting Tryon demands any rescue boats return to their respective ships. Now he commands the leaking Victoria to head straight for the shores of Tripoli, five miles distant. After all, the Victoria’s engines are still running, many men below deck unharmed.Maybe Tryon trusts that the “watertight” doors are still closed, so trapping many hands not already flushed into the ocean. Rapidly though, certainly by collision plus eight minutes, the whole of the Victoria’s bow is submerged, its stern far out of true, propellers turning in open air.At last, but way too late, Tryon yells: “Abandon ship! Everyone for himself!”  Five minutes on, the top deck goes under. Loosened boilers explode. Everything remotely portable bounces into the already hazardous surrounding ocean.Two men on board refuse to jump ship: Reverend SD Morris, the chaplain on duty in the sick bay, who folds his arms across his chest, closes his eyes and says a final prayer and Tryon himself, in time honoured tradition, going down on his watch, muttering: “this is entirely my doing, entirely my fault”.HMS Victoria disappears beneath the Mediterranean’s surfaceBourke – fitter and quicker than his superior – does, with great difficulty, make his escape. A distinguished fellow-escapee is the fevered John Jellicoe, one day himself to be promoted to commander-in-chief of the British Grand Fleet and dispatched to confront a detachment of the German navy off Jutland.Staff Commander Thomas Hawkins-Smith, one of Tryon’s most vocal critics, also survives by clinging on to rigging.\u0027Made in China’ label helps archaeologists solve 800-year-old mysteryIn total, 358 of Victoria’s complement perished, coincidentally the same number as those believed to have been saved. Six bodies only were taken ashore, along with 173 men injured during the tumult. Jenkins on the Collingwood unarguably rescued more people than any other captain on duty – mainly due to his not recalling his lifeboats.The stricken Camperdown, despite taking 90 minutes to effect partial water resistance, partial stability, somehow managed to keep going, battered, but without loss of life.Back in England, reliable news was scarce. Only Markham’s telegram listing 22 surviving officers was to hand and so thousands of anxious friends and relatives milled round the Admiralty.Anger and sorrow rapidly give way to philanthropy. Within three weeks, a remarkable distress fund of £50,000 was raised for Victoria widows and orphans – the equivalent of more than £5m today.John Jellicoe survived HMS Victoria’s sinking and went on to become Commander-in-Chief of the British Grand FleetDebates raged about whether there should be a public inquiry into the disaster some argued that would hand too many secrets of British seamanship to her enemies. A court martial was opened – Bourke’s second – with reporters allowed to witness some of the proceedings. Bourke requested that any captain sistering the Victoria was exempted as a judge.In the dock, Bourke kept referring to navy ships as if they were on a highway, obeying “rules of the road”. But the very concept of obedience troubled the chief investigator, Sir Michael Culme-Seymour – “a safe pair of hands” – throughout his deliberations.It appeared to be common ground that Markham on the Camperdown should have followed his first instinct and aborted the manoeuvre. But then, had there not been a collision, Markham would have been hauled over the coals for insubordination.Tryon actually gave his orders in person ignoring them was extremely difficult, however foolish and foolhardy they were.HMS Camperdown was commissioned at Portsmouth in 1889Culme-Seymour himself had to walk a tightrope: avoiding any hint at a precedent for altering (let alone ignoring) instructions from above. Tryon’s mental health was queried. Perhaps he was suffering from a brain disease, dementia, when he sent the Victoria to its doom?In the end, Bourke came out best, his reputation undiminished. Markham, meanwhile, was censured almost as much as his flag captain, Charles Johnstone. Both could have acted differently at different stages in the unfolding catastrophe. Markham was stripped of his command, his pay halved, and relegated to minor duties. He died early, aged 65, in 1906.Crucially, Tryon’s philosophy of seamanship was abandoned, history not permitted to be kind to his memory. Of the engaged fleet formation only a repaired Camperdown was still being tossed by high seas in 1898.Like the Hollandia, the Victoria’s wreckage lay undiscovered for a long time. Not until 111 years and two months later, on 22 August 2004, was the ship found, by Austrian-Lebanese er Christian Francis, assisted by British explorer Mark Ellyatt. It was positioned almost vertically, 140 metres below their search vessel. They concluded that a full 30 metres of the Victoria’s bow had buried itself in the seabed.Our fascination with the ocean is ceaseless (PA)Three intriguing footnotes to the sinking of the Victoria continue to tantalise. First, it has long been the legend that, at the very moment of inevitable collision between the Victoria and the Camperdown, Mrs Tryon was hosting a party in her London mansion, when Commander Tryon himself, but ghostlike, descended the staircase to join festivities.Second, one of Tryon’s hobbies was collecting memorabilia connected to his hero, Horatio Nelson. In 2012, Ellyat temporarily retrieved Nelson’s sword from Tryon’s cabin but, unsure what to do with this precious artefact, he hid the discovery in a different part of the wreck where it abides till this day.Third, is the very title “Victoria” fated? After all, it was the MV Princess Victoria, a British Railways’ roll-on, roll-off ferry that sank on its passage from Larne to Stranraer, on 31 January 1953, costing 133 lives (at the start of the weekend of the great Lincolnshire floods, which left many people drowned across East Anglia and the Low Countries).How Chad’s killing fields have been turned into an elephants’ havenHow crowdfunding is enabling indie talent to create graphic novelsWhy women in South Africa are carrying the burden of HIVAnd barely six weeks after that terrible storm, a reordered SS Victoria also sank, this time striking rocks – just as the Hollandia did.Why, though, recognise the anniversary of any ship’s demise when there are no living survivors and nothing to add to any inquest? Well, the lure of the sea still captivates and enchants even the most landlocked of the general population.Despite all its dangers – because of all its dangers – the sea is where many of us are most alive.Isles of Scillyor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Most people don\u0027t get to see them because they move so quickly.After catching its prey the kingfisher shot back up into the air (Vince BurtonSWNS)It\u0027s such a privilege to see them up close and it\u0027s been amazing to see the last year unfold.Mr Burton has previously captured swans, owls and other wild creatures in their natural environment and has the best results when he invests time in getting to know them.Last year he turned his attention to kingfishers and found a spot near Dereham, Norfolk to build a hide close to a family of kingfishers.\u0027It\u0027s literally the fraction of a second, my camera was doing 14 frames per second\u0027 (Vince BurtonSWNS)He spent the last 12 months becoming familiar with the birds, giving them the confidence to hunt and feed with him around.Mr Burton, who also works as an accountant, said: Knowing the subject is the key to getting good images. I get to know their behaviour too but I always put the birds\u0027 welfare first. It\u0027s establishing a long term bond with subjects which is crucial. Kingfishers are fantastic birds but they can be very elusive.The kingfisher returned to its nest with the freshly-caught fish to feed to its young (Vince BurtonSWNS)In this stunning sequence, the kingfisher can be seen piercing the surface of the water after spotting a fish on the river bed.The bird was underwater for less than a second as it plucks the fish in its beak - making Mr Burton incredibly lucky to catch it in its tracks.He added: It\u0027s literally the fraction of a second, my camera was doing 14 frames per second. They\u0027re so fast and you can only get one shot as it enters the water. They\u0027re called kingfishers for a reason as they\u0027re so successful.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The animals are cramped very close together – there is no enrichment in their life whatsoever.White foxes in cages, bred for their fur in China (HSI UK)“To make it economical, they are kept in vast numbers – it’s an industry and it’s entirely repugnant.”The animals display repetitive behaviour caused by stress, the BBC star said, adding that they gnawed at one another or at themselves. “The mental distress is immeasurable, he said. Foxes’ lives are governed by their sense of smell and each one has a unique scent, he said, “so imagine being in a shed with thousands of other foxes – it would be extraordinarily distressing.”Foxes in Quebec, Canada their water bowls are out of reach (Jo-Anne McArthur)To see a wild mink would be a treat, Packham said. “Just so someone can have a bit of trimming for their collar or hood or a full coat – I mean, come on, get a grip. We’re meant to have evolved and have greater understanding and respect for all life,” he said. “Let’s do away with this rubbish, can we?”He added: “They’re not going to be comfortable in conditions I’ve seen them kept in – way too small, dark, overcrowded, underfed. It’s shocking, just absolutely shocking. These animals are every bit as wild – they carry all the wild behaviour and needs of wild animals.”Bodies representing fur traders say animals bred and reared in cages are domesticated and know no other conditions so the practice is not cruel.But the experts behind the letter to Mr Gove, including renowned conservationist Dr Jane Goodall, point to the “worrying, even distressing evidence of persistently poor welfare conditions” from investigations at farms that export to the UK.Norway pledges to shut down all fur farms by 2025The letter, copied to all MPs on the environment and farming committee, says: “Wild animals on fur farms live their lives in wire-floored cages thousands of times smaller than their natural territories.“They are denied their biological inheritance to exhibit natural behaviours and stimulations such as hunting, digging and swimming. And they can be kept in what is for them unnatural social groups. For example, naturally solitary mink are compelled to live in very close proximity to each other.“These features of fur farms can inevitably lead to psychological stresses. Instances of stereotypical behaviour, a sign of compromised psychological wellbeing, have been well documented on fur farms, as have cannibalism, untreated wounds, foot deformities and eye infections.”The letter’s authors say that welfare certification schemes require no more than what is legally required in each country.The Council of Europe has recommended housing systems allowing animals to fulfil their biological needs, such as swimming or digging, but none of these are possible to any meaningful extent on fur farms, the letter says.An oversized fox in Finland, bred to be grotesquely obese (Oikeutta Elaimille)Alick Simmons, Britain’s former deputy chief veterinary officer, who signed the letter, said fur farming caused animals sustained psychological damage. “This is too high a price to pay for clothing where there are perfectly acceptable alternatives, and so a UK fur import ban would be entirely consistent with our animal welfare values,” he said.HSI UK, which heads the “#FurFreeBritain” campaign for an imports ban, backed by nearly half a million people, warned of “welfare washing” by fur trade chiefs who were “taking their PR spin to new levels of audacity”.Mette Lykke Nielsen, head of Fur Europe, last month told MPs on the Commons Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee that animals bred on fur farms were domesticated so being kept in cages 2ft 3in x 2ft 5in – just a little larger than the animal itself – was not cruel.A mink on a Canadian fur farm where the cages have not been cleaned (Jo-Anne McArthur )Fox cages were “enriched” with a bone and mink ones with a piece of plastic tubing, she said, insisting that such conditions would be cruel if the animals were wild.Mink would not breed in the cages if their welfare was poor, she insisted.Claire Bass, of HSI UK, said the claim “beggared belief”.She said: “The life of an animal on a fur farm is one of monotonous deprivation, and it’s extremely common that the relentless boredom and lack of space triggers the repetitive pacing and spinning o indicative of mental disturbance.“For the fur trade to shamelessly promote that miserable existence as welfare-friendly is taking their PR spin to new levels of audacity. We hope this letter from veterinary and animal-welfare experts will remind MPs to beware ‘welfare washing’ by the trade. It’s time for the UK to stop trading in this suffering.”However, those lobbying for change could face a big battle. Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee minister Lord Gardiner told the departmental hearing last month: “We think there should be an adherence to humane standards, whether it is in trapping or in fur farming … It is incumbent on the fur industry to be looking to raise standards so that those who wish to have real fur can also feel confident that the animals have been reared and farmed and indeed killed in a humane manner.”And business minister Lord Henley said: “I have no desire to close things down. I am not in the business of banning things.”Fur imports into UK by country and value, 2011-16In 2016 alone £55.6m worth of fur was imported into the UKSources: HSIUKFurEuropeRussian Fur UnionUS Association of Fish \u0026amp Wildlife AgenciesNext week’s parliamentary debate was forced by a petition calling for an imports ban that attracted more than 100,000 signatures. In its response, the government said: “National bans are less effective than working at an international level on animal welfare standards.”It said regulations ensured that any fur imported was from animals that had been treated and killed humanely.Activists said rearing animals for fur humanely was impossible and the government should take a “symbolic” stand against the trade “in line with public beliefs”.The EU bans the import and sale of seal, cat and dog fur but HSI UK says if Britain opted for a soft Brexit – remaining in the single market – a “public morality” clause in EU rules would allow for a UK ban on other animal furs.Foxes kept in wire cages in Poland, the third-biggest exporter of fur to the UK (Open Cages)Fur farming is banned in several other countries including Austria, the Czech Republic and the Netherlands and is being phased out in Denmark, Sweden and Switzerland. India has banned imports of mink, fox and chinchilla fur skins.HSI UK says that based on 2015 figures, China produces 75 million mink, fox and raccoon a year, and the EU produces 45.6 million mink, foxes, raccoon dogs and chinchilla a year.High numbers of rabbits – thought to be hundreds of millions – are also killed for fur around the world.As well as farmed fur animals, an estimated 5 million animals are caught in the wild in traps each year, including coyote, lynx, beaver and otter. or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Mr Sheleg is an Israeli-born businessman who reportedly could soon become the party’s new treasurer. He is the owner of the Halcyon art gallery in London and has recently become a major Tory benefactor. He gave the party £250,000 ahead of last year’s snap election.Ms Chernukhin’s donations are also among the largest. The lavish lifestyle she and her husband led was illustrated during a legal dispute, when it emerged Mr Chernukhin had asked a wealth management firm to buy a £13.5m private jet that was never delivered.Mr Chernukhin was on good terms with Mr Putin in the early years of his presidency, according to reports.He was on the soviet ministry of foreign trade and then served as deputy finance minister from 2000 to 2002. In 2004 he was appointed chairman of a state-owned bank by presidential decree and awarded an order of honour from Mr Putin in 2004.However, he was then dismissed from the role for for his loyalty to Mikhail Kasyanov, a vocal critic of Mr. Putin, and moved to the UK with his family some time later.Cameron\u0027s dinner guests: Anthony and Carole BamfordCameron\u0027s dinner guests: CEO of CQS Michael Hintze (pictured) and his wife Dorothy.Cameron\u0027s dinner guests: Chief Executive of  Media Group, Murdoch MacLennan and his wife Elsa.Cameron\u0027s dinner guests: Lord John Sainsbury (pictured), President of J Sainsbury supermaket, and his wife Lady Sainsbury.Cameron\u0027s dinner guests:  property developer and David RowlandCameron\u0027s dinner guests: chief executive of ICAP plc, Michael Spencer (pictured) and his wife.In 2012, the Electoral Commission declared Ms Chernukhin an “impermissible donor” before the regulatory body subsequently allowed her to donate £626,500 over the next six years.Mr Johnson told the Andrew Marr Show earlier this year that Ms Chernukhin, as a British citizen, had every right to exercise her democratic rights and donate to a political party.When Marr cited fears that the Conservative Party have been “taking far too much Russian money”, Mr Johnson said: “If there is evidence of gross corruption in the way the gentleman obtained his wealth ... then it is possible for our law enforcement to deprive him of his wealth.”Chris Bryant, Labour MP and vice-chairman of parliament’s all-party group on Russia, said at the time: “The prime minister said quite categorically this week that we should be tackling Putin’s cronies. What could be more of a crony that Putin’s former deputy finance minister?”A Conservative Party spokesman said: “All donations to the Conservative Party are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission and published by them, and comply fully with the law.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

My family is half-French and this is a specific problem.”Less than two weeks later Alexander van Terheyden, a council candidate in Hackney, was also suspended after he called Islam a “violent political ideology” comparable to fascism and communism on social media. In response to allegations of Islamophobia, Mr Van Terheyden said: “I’ve stated Islam is a violent political ideology. Note the word ‘political’ and not religious. Note I do not refer to Muslims, I refer to the political ideology.“My views have always been public. If you mean the fact that I’m happy to voice my discontent for communism, fascism, Islam and other extreme political ideologies there is no secret to this.”Three days later a Conservative council candidate in Watford, Darren Harrison, was suspended for allegedly supporting white supremacists.Mr Harrison apparently attended events held by nationalist anti-Islam group Generation Identity.He denied being a supporter of the group and said: “I do not support their views, but support their right to have their views, as I do anyone else, as long as it does not promote violence which to my knowledge, it does not.”Tory MP accused of Islamophobia after posting anti-Muslim articleOn 24 April Phillipa Auton stepped down as the council candidate in Hounslow after she responded to a story about the 2016 Berlin attacks by tweeting: “Revoke Muslim immigration, repatriate and secure European borders, keep Europe safe”. She stood by her comments and said she “supports free speech”. “You are limited to the number of characters you use in a tweet. I am against illegal immigration and I support having closed borders,” she said. The next day the Conservative mayor of Wokingham, Peter Lucey, also stood down after a number of social media posts about Islam and the English Defence League. Mr Lucey said: “Some past social media posts came to light and those are not appropriate for the town mayor.“I resigned for that reason, and I fully apologise to everyone involved. I would like to apologise to the people of Wokingham and to my party, and I resign from all of them.”On 27 April, Nick Sundin, a Tory council candidate in Newcastle, was suspended after he tweeted the Prophet Mohammed was a “f****** paedophile”. He did not respond directly to allegations of Islamophobia but did delete his Twitter account. Less than a week later, Karen Sunderland, a council candidate in Lewisham, was suspended after old tweets emerged where she called Islam “the new Nazism”.After the story emerged Ms Sunderland’s Twitter account was deleted.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesA worker cleans up the Millenaire migrants makeshift camp along the Canal de Saint-Denis near Porte de la Villette, northern Paris, following its evacuation on May 30.

Digital minister Margot James told BBC Radio 5 Live that fans looking to buy tickets from a secondary site should not choose Viagogo, one of four major ticket reselling firms in the UK, because “they are the worst”. Meanwhile, National Trading Standards said on Wednesday that it had been in contact with the Advertising Standards Authority in relation to Viagogo. “As such we have now launched an investigation into Viagogo, which will look at all legal options to bring them into compliance with the law,” a spokesperson for Trading Standards said.Viagogo has previously been censured by the Advertising Standards Authority for “failing to make clear upfront all fees that can be calculated in advance when making price claims”, putting it in breach of the \u0026nbspUK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising and Direct \u0026amp Promotional Marketing, known as the CAP Code.The ASA said it had received complaints about how prices were presented on the Viagogo website, with quoted costs not making clear to consumers that they would be expected to pay additional fees and charges when ordering tickets. The ASA said it contacted Viagogo in March requesting that the company make changes to its website, and the firm said it would make the necessary amendments. However, the ASA added, as of Wednesday, Viagogo’s website “continues to include pricing information that is in breach of the CAP Code and the ASA’s ruling”. As a result, Viagogo has been placed in the ‘non-compliant advertisers’ section of the ASA’s website. Viagogo has been contacted for comment. The company was not the only firm implicated in the ASA’s crackdown earlier this year: StubHub, Seatwave and GetMeIn were also accused of misleading customers about fees and charges when booking tickets.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The verdict means the Coxes cannot seek monetary damages, court spokeswoman Mary Ann Price said. Gavin Cox testified that he suffered brain and other injuries in a fall while stagehands urged him and others to run during an illusion that appeared to make as many as 13 audience volunteers disappear onstage and reappear moments later, waving flashlights in the back of the theatre. His lawyer, Benedict Morelli, told jurors during closing arguments that the trick was inherently dangerous, and that Copperfield should be held partially liable for Cox\u0027s injuries. Four years ago, attorneys estimated that Cox had that racked up more than $400,000 in medical costs. Copperfield\u0027s lawyers lost a bid to close the courtroom to the public to prevent disclosure of secrets about the illusion. At least 55,000 audience volunteers had taken part in the trick over 17 years, according to Copperfield and show executive producer Chris Kenner. Jurors learned that in about 60 to 90 seconds, stagehands with flashlights ushered the randomly chosen participants past dark curtains, down passageways, around corners, outdoors, indoors and through an MGM Grand resort kitchen to re-enter the theatre for the show\u0027s finale, according to testimony. I was having a good time up until the time I was injured, Cox testified. He recalled stagehands shouting Run! Run! Run! through an outdoor alleyway that his lawyers say was coated with construction dust. Cox, 57, a former chef from Kent, England, said he fell hard on his right side and didn\u0027t remember getting up to finish the illusion in November 2013. World news in picturesWorld news in picturesA worker cleans up the Millenaire migrants makeshift camp along the Canal de Saint-Denis near Porte de la Villette, northern Paris, following its evacuation on May 30.

Photographer Jonathan Ernst: In his final days in office, Obama made a visit home to Chicago. As he spoke from the stage to his wife and daughter in the audience, he became emotional when he talked about what they had sacrificed during his time in office. I turned from photographing the Obama women embracing to find him onstage wiping away tears. A combination of photos shows the crowds attending the inauguration ceremonies to swear in U.S. President Donald Trump at 12:01pm (left) on January 20, 2017 and President Barack Obama sometime between 12:07pm and 12:26pm on January 20, 2009. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump attend the Liberty Ball in honour of his inauguration in Washington on 20 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: What I see when I look at this picture is the end of a very long day, not to mention weeks and months of preparation by many photographers, editors and network experts and the beginning of everything since. US President Donald Trump greets Director of the FBI James Comey as Director of the Secret Service Joseph Clancy (L), watches during the Inaugural Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders Reception in the Blue Room of the White House on 22 January, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: I have covered the White House for 16 years and normally either the President or the pool is in position when an event starts. In this case the President was not where anyone expected him to be. In fact, he was almost blocking the door when the pool came in. We had to scramble to find a position without bumping him or the furniture as he greeted and thanked members of law enforcement for their security efforts during the inauguration. Luckily, he greeted FBI Director James Comey a few seconds after the pool had made its way into the room.US President Donald Trump, is joined by his staff, as he speaks by phone with Russia\u0027s President Vladimir Putin in the Oval Office on 28 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Very early in the Trump administration, weekends were as busy as weekdays. On Trump\u0027s second Saturday the official schedule said he would be making private phone calls to a number of world leaders including Russia\u0027s Vladimir Putin. I arrived early and, before sitting down at my desk walked up to Press Secretary Sean Spicer\u0027s office. He, too, was just taking his coat off. I gingerly made the suggestion that previous administrations had sometimes allowed photos of such phone calls through the Oval Office windows on the colonnade. To my mild shock, he didn\u0027t even think about it twice. We\u0027ll do it! he said. In truth, I really only expected the Putin call, but we were outside the windows multiple times throughout the day as the calls went on.Senior advisor Kellyanne Conway (L) attends as US President Donald Trump welcomes the leaders of dozens of historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) in the Oval Office on 27 February, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: We\u0027re often asked how much access we have to the Trump administration, and the answer is we have an awful lot. President Trump himself is very comfortable in the spotlight, and his aides are similarly unfazed by cameras. In this instance, senior advisor Kellyanne Conway was so comfortable in our presence she seemed not to consider the optics of kneeling on a Oval Office sofa to take pictures with her phone. Germany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Donald Trump hold a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House on 17 March, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Chancellor Merkel made one of the earliest important visits of any US allies to meet Trump in his first months in office. When world leaders give joint news conferences they don\u0027t always tend to give each other their full attention - but Merkel watched Trump intently at several key moments, and here seemed particularly rapt.President Trump reacts as he sits on a truck while he welcomes truckers and CEOs to attend a meeting regarding healthcare at the White House on 23 March, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: The White House organised a listening session with truckers and CEO\u0027s of major American companies, regarding healthcare reform. An 18-wheeler tow truck was parked on the South Lawn of the White House and as Trump welcomed the truckers someone invited the him to come and sit in the driver\u0027s seat. Trump jumped into the cab and started yelling and pretending to drive - creating one of the most memorable pictures of the year. A lesson learned, always be prepared for the unexpected.US President Donald Trump talks to journalists members of the travel pool on board the Air Force One during his trip to Palm Beach, Florida on 6 April, 2017. Carlos Barria: During the many trips to President Trump\u0027s residence in Florida it is usual to see the president coming to the back of the plane to chat with journalists. During one of the trips to the so called \u0027Winter White House\u0027, Trump had a long talk with reporters while the Air Force One entertainment system was playing one of the latest Star Wars movies. As I was listening to Trump talk I was also looking at the movie waiting for a part of the movie to frame the mood of the day. Of the many scenes, I choose the one with Darth Vader.US President Donald Trump speaks during an interview with Reuters in the Oval Office of the White House on 27 April, 2017. \u0026#13US President Donald Trump reacts as he arrives at Harrisburg international airport, before attending a rally marking his first 100 days in office in Pennsylvania on 29 April, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to celebrate his hundred days in office with a victory rally. He was in friendly territory as he won with a big difference over his opponent Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, during the November elections. As usual when the commander-in-chief arrives local residents gather to greet him. This time a small group of military personnel attended the arrival. Surrounded by secret service agents Trump walked from the Air Force One and raised his hand in a sign of victory as the crowd cheered him on.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer (L) and White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus watch as US President Donald Trump presents the U.S. Air Force Academy football team with the Commander-in-Chief trophy in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington on 2 May, 2017. Photographer Joshua Roberts: Covering the White House does not just mean covering the President. White House staffers are an important part of the story and their relationship with the President and each other is an indicator of how things are going in the West Wing. The tendency is to focus exclusively on the President once an event starts but I always try to look around to see how people are reacting as things unfold.Secret Service agents use a presidential limousine as cover from spraying water as US President Donald Trump lands via Marine One helicopter in New York on 4 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: The best part of any trip to New York City with the sitting US President is the helicopter ride into Manhattan. The ride out at night can be stunning. Here, Secret Service agents protect themselves from the spray from the East River as Trump lands on the helipad. US President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump wait the arrival of French President Emmanuel Macron (unseen) before a lunch ahead of a NATO Summit in Brussels on 25 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: One of the best parts of travelling overseas for White House coverage is the chance to see the U.S. president in different environments and (literally) a different light. Here, Trump and his wife came out of the shadows to greet France\u0027s President Macron.US President Donald Trump meets with Russian President Vladimir Putin during their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany on 7 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: On July 7, I witnessed one of the most important meetings of President Trump\u0027s first year in office. Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin during a bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Germany. The world\u0027s eyes were on these two leaders after speculation about Russian interference during the 2016 US elections. We entered the room for less than two minutes, where I took dozens of pictures. But there was this very interesting moment when Trump extended his hand to Putin for a handshake. Putin paused for a second and looked at Trump\u0027s hand. That was the picture that I was looking for, a little moment that seemed to say a lot. First lady Melania Trump chats with US President Donald Trump during their return from Germany at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland on 8 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: After President Trump\u0027s trip to Germany he arrived back at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. First Lady Melania Trump said goodbye to Trump as she was heading off in a different direction that day. While chatting a breeze blew Melania\u0027s hair up in the air. Vice President Mike Pence laughs as President Donald Trump holds a baseball bat as they attend a Made in America product showcase event at the White House on 17 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: This summer the White House organized an event to showcase \u0027Made in America\u0027 products. All kinds of exhibitors brought their products as the President and Vice President toured the event. One of the companies was Marucci Sport, a manufacturer of baseball bats based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As Trump approached a table full of baseball bats, photographers at the event, including me, rushed to get a good angle hoping that he would pick up a bat. As we predicted, he did. He took one and joked around as though he was hitting something hard. The only thing closer to him right there, was the media.Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says hello to reporters as he and White House advisors including Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci accompany President Trump for an event celebrating veterans at AMVETS Post 44 in Ohio, July 25, 2017. Jonathan Ernst: The most visible person in any White House is naturally the President, followed by the press secretary. But there are also the staff who support them. For those of us covering the Trump administration, there seem to be more compelling figures in the West Wing than ever before. It\u0027s crucial to know who\u0027s who and why they\u0027re important. When I raised my camera and back-pedalled ahead of the group to take this image Lewandowski gave me a hello. I liked the photo, but had no idea it would go a little bit viral, especially since Scaramucci, who was the biggest mover and shaker that week, was hidden back in the pack. But I guess the image catches a glimpse of what it\u0027s like to be a West Wing staffer on the road. US President Donald Trump arrives at a rally in West Virginia on 3 August, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Huntington for one of his usual campaign rallies. While members of his family spoke to the crowd he was waiting under a black curtain to be introduced. Suddenly he walked onto the stage, one of the first frames that I took was of his hand. I set my exposure for the light on the stage hoping to create this dark background and it worked. Without his protective glasses on, US President Donald Trump looks up towards the solar eclipse while viewing with his wife Melania and son Barron at the White House on 21 August, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: On a day when everyone, and I mean everyone, was told not to look at the eclipse without protective glasses, Trump, President of the United States, couldn\u0027t help himself.US President Donald Trump poses for a photo as he and first lady Melania Trump help volunteers hand out meals during a visit with flood survivors of Hurricane Harvey at a relief centre in Houston, Texas on 2 September, 2017. Photohrapher Kevin Lamarque: Trump, eager to deliver the image of a hands-on response to Hurricane Harvey, made this visit to a relief centre and obliged this woman with a selfie as Melania continued to work. Donald Trump welcomes 11-year-old Frank Giaccio as he cuts the Rose Garden grass at the White House on 15 September. Frank, who wrote a letter to Trump offering to mow the lawn, was invited to work for a day at the White House along the National Park Service staff.  Frank was so focused on his task that he did not notice the President arrive to surprise him. He took his father jumping in to grab his attention and point Trump out. Photographer Carlos Barria said: “The image of Trump shouting at a kid who is mowing his lawn might have many interpretations in today\u0027s politically polarized United States. But for me it was just a kid who loved what he was doing, to the point he almost appeared to ignore the President.A man kneels with a folded U.S. flag as the motorcade of U.S. President Donald Trump passes him after an event at the state fairgrounds in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S., September 27, 2017. In September, soon after Trump had made comments condemning NFL players who kneel during the national anthem, he made a day trip to a rally in Indianapolis. Jonathan Ernst managed to capture a man on one knee with a tri-folded flag and was able to use a portion of the sign on the building he was kneeling in front of to track the man down and tell his story in full. US Army veteran Marvin Boatright wanted to send a message against social injustice. President Donald Trump throws rolls of paper towels into a crowd of local residents affected by Hurricane Maria as he visits Calgary Chapel in San Juan, Puerto Rico on 3 October, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: During an afternoon visit to Puerto Rico for President Trump to survey damage from Hurricane Maria and greet some of its victims, Trump made a stop at a church where food and supplies were being distributed. Among the items were paper towels and Trump, apparently caught up in the moment, decided to distribute some of the rolls.White House Senior adviser Jared Kushner sits behind President Trump during a cabinet meeting in Washington on 1 November, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: The role of Jared Kushner has gone through a series of changes. He began front and centre as a high profile adviser, but as time has passed and issues surrounding him have surfaced, he has become more of a background figure.Donald Trump and China\u0027s President Xi Jinping shake hands after making joint statements at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on 9 November, 2017. Photographer Damir Sagolj: It\u0027s one of those how to make a better or at least different shot when two presidents shake hands several times a day, several days in row. If I\u0027m not mistaken in calculation, presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump shook their hands at least six times in events I covered during Trump\u0027s recent visit to China. I would imagine there were some more handshakes I haven\u0027t seen but other photographers did. And they all look similar - two big men, smiling and heartily greeting each other until everyone gets their shot. But then there is always something that can make it special - in this case the background made of US and Chinese flags. The first time it didn\u0027t work for me. The second time I positioned myself lower and centrally, and used the longest lens I have to capture only hands reaching for a handshake.US President Donald Trump boards Air Force One to depart for Vietnam from Beijing Airport in Beijing, China, November 10, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: There is a Reuters photographer in the tight pool covering the US president for every appearance he makes 365 days a year. This was just one of 32 images of mine that were transmitted on the Reuters wire of President Trump visiting China and Vietnam that day. You never know when a sudden interaction, a gust of wind or a unique facial expression will lead to a striking image that grabs peoples\u0027 attention.Donald Trump registers his surprise as he realises other leaders, including Russia\u0027s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Vietnam\u0027s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte and Australia\u0027s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, are crossing their arms for the traditional ASEAN handshake as he participates in the opening ceremony of the summit in Manila on 13 November, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Having covered a few ASEAN summits, I knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. Not everyone in the room knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. A lot was written about this unscripted moment, and what deeper meaning it might have. The simple truth is that sometimes in life there are unscripted moments.Since joining the US president’s legal team Mr Giuliani has made a series of notable television appearances.This includes making the bombshell admission Mr Trump repaid his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, for the $130,000 payment to adult actor Stormy Daniels as part of a nondisclosure agreement related to an affair Ms Daniels says she had with Mr Trump in 2006.But Mr Giuliani was later challenged over how his statement appeared to contradict Mr Trump’s earlier denial of knowledge of the payment to Ms Daniels.Mr Giuliani responded by saying the talk of a $35,000 a month retainer was just “rumour” – despite him having said days earlier it was fact.The Republican also revealed the president recently ordered a hamburger – one of his favourite dishes – with just half a bun.He told The Washington Post the duo dined together on 6 May at the president’s golf club in Virginia.While Mr Giuliani enjoyed a light Cobb salad, Mr Trump, whose weakness for fast food has been widely documented, ordered a well-done burger with half the bun, a choice which The Post claims was “in service to his health”.“I do that, too, sometimes. It’s a good way to do it,” Mr Giuliani said.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The financial criss that would ensure would put us back significantly. It would taint Italy’s reputation forever.Addressing populists who have raised fears outside forces are calling the shots in Italy, he said, “We are not constrained by European rules, but by economic logic.”An election is likely to focus on Italy’s relationship with the European Union and in particular the budget restraints imposed on members of the eurozone.A poll by SWG has shown support for the League has jumped to 27.5 per cent, around 10 points up from the 4 March elections, while support for Five Star has fallen about three points to 29.5 per cent. If the two anti-establishment populist parties decided to join forces again, the poll suggests they would have a majority in parliament. Additional reporting by agenciesor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Italian governments have failed to meet the aspirations of Italians since at least the 1990s and the voters have been turning to ever more populist and extremist parties as a result.Italy could still get populist government as compromise hintedThe two leading groups in Italy are now the Five Star Movement, which was, literally, founded by a comedian, and is a kind of Italian Ukip and The League, formerly the Northern League, which enjoys most of its support in the wealthier north of Italy, rather than the poorer, more rural south. (Analogous to Catalan separatism in Spain).The League advocated virtual separation for the Northern provinces to form their own state. Some seek outright independence, reversing the historic Resorgimento (unification) of 1861. The League is thus a kind of cross between the politics of the SNP and Ukip.The president vetoed their choice of finance minister because he was a eurosceptic and might seek to lead Italy out of the euro – for which the Five StarLeague parties did not receive a mandate from the Italian electorate. The parties then refused to form a government, hence the stalemate. Some form of technocratic government will govern Italy until fresh elections are held. These may in effect become a referendum on staying in the euro (though not the EU).Italy’s slow-growing economy means poorer public services, bigger national and private debts, lower wages and lower living standards than expected. Some blame immigration, and Italy is certainly the first destination for many making their way across the Mediterranean from Africa.Why Brexiteers are enjoying the crisis in ItalySome also resent the euro, the European single currency, fully adopted in 2002, and regard it as a German racket. On this reading of things, the Germans do well out of Italy by selling the Italians their cars and then lending the Italians the money to pay for them, a cycle leading to a sort of economic bondage. Italians thus believe the EU, and Germany in particular, has too much power over Italy hence the new strain of euro scepticism in what was traditionally an enthusiastic founding member (1957) of the European Union. Once the tacit admission in Italy was that they’d prefer Brussels to turn their affairs than Rome. That has now changed.So the Italian populist parties are stirring up conflicts with the EU Commission in Brussels and the European Central Bank in Frankfurt – convenient scapegoats.The Italian state and the Italian banks are going bust simultaneously, because they rely upon each other and neither is strong.The banking crisis after 2008 exposed two particular Italian problems, apart from longer term demographic and industrial trends, and these are still the immediate issues.  First and most serious is the weakness of her banks. By tradition most of the debts issued by the Italian government were purchased by Italian banks, pension funds and other financial institutions. The Italian banks are therefore stuffed full of Italian government bonds, and investors are becoming increasingly concerned that the weaknesses in Italy\u0027s public finances, namely a very large national debt, would lead to a default on the bonds, leaving them less valuable or worthless, and destroying the financial assets of the banks – which would then suffer a run and go bust.Italy and Italy’s banks would be insolvent – and beyond the capacity of Germany or the EU to rescue. Only a huge programme of buying Italian government debts, via the Italian banks, by the European Central Bank, in turn funded by the German taxpayer, has prevented this collapse from happening sooner.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesA worker cleans up the Millenaire migrants makeshift camp along the Canal de Saint-Denis near Porte de la Villette, northern Paris, following its evacuation on May 30.

These are exacerbated by the populist programme of the Five Star and League parties – which would need to borrow much more in order to fund their ambitious spending programmes.Dissolution with the post-Mussolini, post-Second World War settlement set in during the 1990s, when the old parties, the Christian Democrats and Socialists, became mired in scandal and associated with political and economic failure.Italy’s economy had began to stagnate, losing its competiveness and compounded by a low birth rate and declining working population. The post-war boom, an economic miracle which had seen Italians moving from the countryside to the towns and cities, owning scooters and cars and growing prosperous was ending.What is Italy\u0027s crisis about and how serious is it?In the 1950s and 1960s Italy, carried along by the increase in trade in the original EU, was growing at 7 per cent or so a year. Names such as Fiat, Lambretta and Zanussi became famous globally powerful brands, along with luxury brands such as Prada, Armani and Ferrari.But by the 1990s low growth, higher unemployment and stagnant living standards became the norm increased migration, which might help the Italian economy if properly managed, was viewed with resentment and suspicion.It was then that figures such as Silvio Berlusconi and his Forza Italia gained in popularity, themselves eventually giving way to Five Star and The League.If the economy, public finances and banks were fixed, many of Italy’s political problems would melt away. There are three options:This would mean allowing a Five StarLeague government to carry out its spending plans, allowing it to borrow and print much more money, and have the ECB buy all the resulting debt without complaint.Berlusconi allowed to run again for election as Italy\u0027s prime ministerItaly would also be allowed to print a parallel euro currency of its own, as the populist parties would like, (“mini bonds”) to help fund its spending, any inflationary problems being dealt with by the ECB, again without penalty to Italy.This would require the wealthier economies of Germany, the Netherlands and Finland, for example, to continue to subsidise Italy, in return for its continuing membership of the single currency and something resembling stability.However the ECB has already indicated it wishes to scale back its purchases of Italian government debt – which has fuelled investors’ concerns that no-one else will buy them.Exitaly: Italy leaves the euro In the long term this would enable Italy to devalue its own currency to get through structural reforms, solve any problems with international trade and to accommodate inflation, as was traditional when they used the lira. It cannot do this under the euro, and instead has to cut public spending, cut wages and undergo austerity – all deeply unpopular.However, bringing back the lira also means that interest rates would soar to persuade investors to take on the risk of a devaluing new lira currency or a default by an Italian government unable to pay back its treasury bonds.In the short run, Italy\u0027s already large national debt would need to be redenominated in the new lira currency, which, being worth less than the euro, will make the debt more expensive to service, perhaps prohibitively so.A European Risorgimento: Reform of the euro system: adding a banking union and a fiscal unionThis is the kind of solution President Macron of France has been campaigning for. It would mean that all eurozone governments in effect take on each others debts, and all are responsible for the stability of the banking system in every member state of the single currency.So this would include the likes of Greece, Spain and Italy, but not Sweden, Poland, Denmark, or the UK for that matter, who are not euro members.Five things to look out for that could further impact the eurozoneThere might be more pressure on the Swedes and others to join the euro to “burden share” the costs of the European fiscal union. It would also require a powerful central European finance ministry and chief.   The Macron reforms would work because any monetary union, such as the euro, will never work smoothly, or at all, without a corresponding fiscal union, and preferably banking union too.However the objection is that it would require the transfer of huge sums from the richer northern economies (Germany especially) to the poorer southern ones (Italy especially), and a leap forward in political integration.Angela Merkel has made plain her reluctance to take on such obligations and, in parallel to Italy, extremist eurosceptic movements such as the AfD have been making progress in Germany at the expense of the traditional Christian Democrats and Social Democrats.Germany, as much as Italy itself, may soon have to choose whether it still wants Italy in the eurozone.Without Italy, the zone\u0027s third largest economy, though, the fundamental sustainability of the euro would come under question. Financial chaos could break out and, via “contagion” in interlinked banks and economies, spread through the wider European financial system and economy, with a global impact.One side effect of that would be to make Brexit look somewhat more palatable to the British.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

That\u0027s where it announces all of the changes coming to its software – and sometimes some of its hardware, too – for every single one of its products.We\u0027ll see iOS 12, whatever Apple decides to call the new version of its Mac operating system, and updates to its watches and TVs. And apps and services will probably get a big upgrade, too, with new features probably coming to apps like Music.In short, if you use something from Apple, you\u0027ll see what its future looks like next week. But you won\u0027t get to see what future versions of it will look like.WWDC isn\u0027t the most splashy of Apple events: that honour belongs to the September launches when it shows off the new iPhones. It is not focused on shiny new products, or breakthrough new hardware features.Apple releases iOS 11.4 with brand new audio announcementsBut, for the reason, it can be even more exciting. It is the only one of Apple\u0027s big annual events that focuses squarely on products you already have, offering upgrades to all of Apple\u0027s products so long as they are new enough, and entirely for free.So it is worth following along if you want to get a look at what the new iOS, macOS, watchOS or tvOS actually look like. You probably won\u0027t get access to those features for some time – September, alongside the new phones, if you don\u0027t join Apple\u0027s beta programme – but you\u0027ll get a sense for what the future will look like.Sometimes, that software even offers hints at what new products – such as the the new iPhone – might look like, too.Never say never, of course – but probably not. There almost certainly won\u0027t be any flagship phones launched this WWDC, or any other one.There have been some rumours about a new iPhone SE 2, upgrading that small, cheap and beloved handset. That might come around this year, though even that is unlikely.But that doesn\u0027t mean that the whole event is devoted to software. A host of products are rumoured for potential launches at the event – everything from its AirPower wireless charging mat to updated MacBook Pros – so it is likely that there\u0027ll be some new hardware too.Apple usually streams every WWDC keynote, and is almost certain to do the same this year. It hasn\u0027t yet announced that it will – much less how it will do so – but going on previous years it should be fairly simple to watch along.The company runs a special page on its website that lets people stream the keynote live, so long as they\u0027re using the right kit. And an update will usually arrive on the Apple TV, installing a special app for watching it back.If you miss it, you\u0027ll be able to watch it back the same way. (And you\u0027ll be able to fast forward through anything you want to skip.)As well as the big keynote, Apple usually streams some of the other WWDC sessions online, too. They can often be a bit specific if you\u0027re not a developer – delving into how parts of the underlying technology of iPhones and other products work so that people can make apps for them – but some of the events such as Apple\u0027s Platforms State of the Union and design awards can be interesting.The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

We reveal all...The 87-year-old is a Hungarian-American investor who emigrated to England in 1947 from Nazi-occupied Hungary.He attended the London School of Economics and started his career at merchant banks in England and the US before starting his first hedge fund in 1969.Soros used profits from that to start Soros Fund Management, his second hedge fund, in 1970.He rose to fame and fortune two decades ago on a now-historic trade, in which he took on the Bank of England and shrewdly wagered on a devaluation of the pound.Soros is an active contributor to politically liberal causes and frequently speaks on world economic events.He has been married three times and divorced twice and is currently wed to yoga firm boss Tamiko Bolton - 42 years his junior.His fortune has been estimated at £5.8billion after he gave away 80 per cent of his wealth to charity.The philanthropist donated  £13billion to Open Society Foundations - an international group of charities that works in more than 100 countries on projects focused on refugee relief and public health.Before the transfer, he had a net worth of around £16.5billion.The investor is backing a campaign to potentially reverse Brexit by holding a second referendum on Britains EU membership.Speaking in May 2018, the billionaire said leaving the EU was an immensely damaging process and would take longer than five years to organise and sort.The Best for Britain campaign he is helping to fund is expected to launch its manifesto soon.Divorce will be a long process, probably taking more than five years. Five years is an eternity in politics, especially in revolutionary times like the present.Ultimately, it’s up to the British people to decide what they want to do. It would be better however if they came to a decision sooner rather than later.He added that a second referendum would also render Europe a great service by rescinding Brexit and not creating a hard-to-fill hole in the European budget.Mr Soros continued: The British public must express its support by a convincing margin in order to be taken seriously by Europe.The economic case for remaining a member of the EU is strong, but it will take time for it to sink in.But he added that if the EU is serious about overturning Brexit, it should reform to become more flexible.Soros, who has been accused of interfering in the democracies of several European countries, entertained six Tories at his Chelsea house last Monday.They were told that the group’s goal was “to raise public support for Remain to a clear and growing national majority by June/July 2018 and channelling that pressure into MPs’ mailbags and surgeries”.But sources at the dinner said the message fell flat and donors left without pledging any money. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Thats what I want to do now.Both euthanasia and assisted suicide are illegal in the UK.Euthanasia, sometimes known as mercy killing, is the practice of intentionally ending someones life to relieve their pain and suffering, while assisted suicide involves the person wishing to die taking an active role in ending their own life.Euthanasia carries a maximum penalty of life in jail, and assisted suicide 14 years.The only exception is passive euthanasia, which is where treatment that might extend someones life is withdrawn - such as a life machine being turned off.The only alternatives for terminally ill patients in the UK are hospice care or refusing treatment, which mentally capable patients have the right to do.As a result, some terminally ill people decide to travel abroad to die.She said she had always known her fathers wishes, and was not surprised at his request.It took seven months of planning to take her elderly father overseas, with the help of son Scott, and Susan said she felt that the clinic was professional and caring.Son Scott added: Its not pleasant to see your loved one die, obviously.It was a sense of relief for him.He was suffering and not facing a quality of life.The family said they were not worried about facing charges over Mr Lentons decision.Sandra said: I am prepared for that, because it was the right thing for my father.It has to be an individuals choice.But she hit back at suggestions that allowing people to be taken to suicide clinics would open the door to abuse.Sandra said: People are very clear about whether they want to do this or not.You cant pressure someone into this.

The knife is not the crime. Children seldom randomly pick up knives and decide to stab people. In my experience it often starts when the child is young.This spate of killings will pass but for now it affords the attention and opportunity to reflect.Currently, the debate is cyclical and futile. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan says it’s not his fault, he needs more police. The police say we need more of them. The Government says you’ve had more police but it didn’t make a difference. Meanwhile, children are dying on the streets.The search for solutions must stretch beyond the police. Aside from outrage, there needs to be a focus on the causes, as well as the symptoms, of these crimes.This shouldn’t detract from taking knives away from those carrying them, but we can’t ignore the fact that replacing a blade is as simple as going to the kitchen drawer.Those of us who are more able to look at the world through the eyes of young people who carry knives for protection and status get closer to how they think.What we are witnessing is a sophisticated type of group mind. Some of our boys are so mentally zoned into a culture of violence. All of my youths know, directly, someone murdered, or at least seriously injured, on our streets. Some have been involved.How did we get to this place? Slowly. As the influence of parents, pastors and school principals has waned, all our young people speak of a distinct feeling of powerlessness.The tried and traditional levers and sanctions affecting the development of children are not functioning effectively. For too many, the family bond is damaged and so ruptured we overlook its devastating effects. My young people need something to fight, something to believe in. Like everyone else, they want to be someone, and sometimes that means fighting each other.It is a sad day when, for some, employment prospects are more plentiful with local dealers selling weed and crack than the only other job on offer at the local barber’s.Some of the young people I work with speak about the role of their family’s socio-economic status in their life choices. If they’re lucky, they see their parents locked into dead-end, minimum-wage jobs with no security or satisfaction. Knives, they conclude, are a type of urban qualification. As one put it: “Everyone wants to be someone, this is my way.”Digging deeper, I learned that 85 per cent of my students had never patronised a black-owned business in the past five years, aside from a barber shop. Too many of them carry the assumption that blacks are inferior. “This is how it is,” Adamu told me. “Our business is on the road, we are designed for the hustle.”I began this work with an agenda to keep black boys from being arrested in their droves.Sadly, a lot of our kids have ended up in prison, but they started the three-lap race of life two laps behind. For some, it is almost impossible to work through all the scars.For many of our children, entrance to crime and urban violence is connected to a sense of wanting to be accepted and acceptable — violence is currency.Their hope is that they survive long enough to one day grow out of it. The desire to belong is so real that any community, including gangs, will do.The more law enforcement is used, the more of a challenge it becomes. It almost acts as encouragement because it is something else to beat.Drugs are also a way of life. For some it’s about using, for others it’s selling. It’s simply a way to earn money. A visit to our social housing estates will reveal high levels of organisation. Like any business, you have distribution points, a clear marketing strategy and, most of all, plans to deal with the opposition.I also see the age of involvement getting younger and they don’t care if they live or die. In that sense they are like suicide bombers.Recently I was involved in the rehabilitation of two nine-year-old boys. One was tasked with moving weapons from location to location and the other given addresses for drug drops. He would deliver the packages during school lunch breaks in exchange for McDonald’s, KFC and clothes.Children like these do not grow up seeing themselves as having a future in business or leadership. They are crying out for genuine role models. When our young men find more employment opportunities from businessmen than “road men”, real change will begin.Until that time, we need to love these children back to sanity. They are simply not able to make the rational choices our education and social systems demand.We experience a ruling class committed to maintaining the status quo.

The Government has no credible policy and the whole world knows it.“Whitehall’s real preparations are for the continuation of EU law and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.“The State has made no preparations to leave and plans to make no preparations to leave — even after leaving.”Barring a last-minute change of tune, Mrs May is walking into an ambush which will sour relations with Brussels and condemn Britain to a generation of rancorous civil discord.A botched deal will be dressed up in Brussels newspeak as a triumph for all sides.In fact it will almost certainly betray 17.4million British people who explicitly voted OUT in the biggest democratic mandate ever seen in this country.Voters who hoped for clear and unequivocal freedom from EU laws and regulations are unlikely to stay silent for long.They expected Brexit ministers to carve out a prosperous and independent future.Instead, they have watched defeated Remainers mount a ruthless and successful counter-attack.From a position of strength as a major trading nation, Britain has surrendered on all fronts, caved in to Brussels bullies — and handed over a £39BILLION ransom for the privilege.We are likely to remain bound by a version of the EU customs union, the single market and the European Court of Justice for years to come. Meanwhile, mass immigration runs out of control.Perhaps to his own amazement, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has succeeded in his aim to make Britain worse off outside.We will not be allowed to flourish as a free-trading sovereign state.Nobody can be more vividly aware of this than Mrs May as she prepares for her looming summit.Yet she has only herself to blame, starting with the catastrophic snap election which destroyed her Commons majority.She needlessly coughed up that £39billion with nothing in return from Brussels and allowed herself to be derailed by phantom threats of IRA violence if the UK establishes any sort of border with Ireland.The sad truth is that Mrs May is not up to the job as Prime Minister at a momentous point in our history.In an age when words really count, we are lumbered with an ultra-cautious leader who cannot think on her feet or speak without notes.At a time when we should all be doing our best to make Brexit work, we have a Prime Minister who would much prefer to Remain.For the moment, Leavers such as Iain Duncan Smith and Jacob Rees-Mogg are pledging their loyalty.But a bad deal would provoke die-hard Tories into the only honourable action they feel they can take — and put her premiership on the line.They already have the votes needed to trigger a leadership contest.They will not support key Commons votes to dilute Brexit, risking Government defeat by an unholy alliance of Labour opportunists, Lib Dem and SNP wreckers and Tory Remainers.A disastrous combination of weak leadership, cack-handed communication and dismal diplomacy has plunged Britain into a needless constitutional crisis.It says something about Mrs May’s position as leader that her strongest card is the prospect of yet another general election — the third in three years.And the nightmare of political throwback Jeremy Corbyn storming the barricades and leading his Marxist extremists to power.[boxout featured-image=6392734]AS PM, Tony Blair insisted 50 per cent of school leavers must go to university.The result was grade inflation across the board and “Ology” graduates struggling to find a decent job.Now his sensible son Euan, 34, is arguing for tailor-made apprenticeships, giving kids a chance to earn while they learn.His views coincide with new Tory policy – T-levels, technical and trade qualifications which fit pupils to the work they want.They can range from plumbers and computer wizards to City bankers.Many will be driving their own car and buying a home by the time pals leave university with mountains of debt.It is the way forward in skill-hungry Britain.[/boxout] Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some is also done to shut down anything other than the argument that says “It needs more money”, while other bits are there just because TV executives have noticed it’s the NHS’s 70th birthday and think they’d better do something to look caring.Like, for instance, ITV’s A\u0026ampE Live, “from the frontline”, at Leeds General Infirmary.A self-defeating three-day experiment which, on the one hand gleefully promised us all sorts of carnage: “It’s hotting up here.” But on the other was swift to assure viewers they were operating on a time delay in case patients refused filming consent, thereby ruling out most of the drunks and any possibility of a bloke being wheeled into reception with a Hoover attachment up his fundament.I’d avoid describing LGI as the most sedate-looking A\u0026ampE unit in Britain, though, because ITV had attempted to redress the noise balance by having it hosted by human Tannoy system Davina McCall, who lost little time in telling us: “I had to get hypnotised to do this job, can you believe it?”Yeah, I can, actually.“I saw my granny sever her toes with a lawnmower,” she went on to explain, “and it made me squeamish.” If you thought for one minute, however, it sedated her, you either overestimate the powers of hypnotherapy or you haven’t been watching Davina’s career closely enough.The woman was in full Street Mates mode from the moment she clocked a young couple in the waiting room. “Are you going out?” said Davina, without so much as checking their vital signs.“We were on a date . . . our first date.”“AH-MAY-ZING! THIS IS GREAT. And it’s something to talk about when you have children . . . ”Silence. “I took it too far, didn’t I?”You did rather, Davina, though I get the squeamishness thing and actually flinched when she then told us: “A 23-year-old man, Tommy, is being brought in by ambulance after being rear-ended at high speed.”You’d hope Tommy got some of Davina’s meds as well, ’cos a weird thing happened on Wednesday and Thursday’s broadcasts.She actually calmed down a bit. To the extent I finally noticed the staff, who turned out to be naturals in front of a camera, which really shouldn’t have been a surprise given TV’s insatiable appetite for this sort of show.Among other recent TV offerings, we have: A\u0026ampE Live, A\u0026ampE, 24 Hours In A\u0026ampE, The Real A\u0026ampE, Sun Sea \u0026amp A\u0026ampE, A\u0026ampE On The Road.And that’s just the ones with A\u0026ampE in the title.There’s a whole load more with the words ambulance and emergency, which you may also have watched but entirely forgotten.Why?’Cos an actual visit to A\u0026ampE is a real, vivid, frightening, frustrating, disturbing, impressive and unforgettable experience that can leave you weeping with gratitude for the NHS.TV, by contrast, generally offers a dumb, censored, antiseptic, grovelling, uncritical, cult-like, agenda-ridden version, with this sort of dialogue.Davina (to ambulanceman Gavin): “How important is it you get there early.”“The sooner we get there the more chance the patient has of surviving.”“And that’s so important, isn’t it?”Thank you, live TV. Where would we all be without you?Good Morning Britain’s Piers Morgan: “I leave a lot of phones in my bedroom, ’cos you never know when you’re going to get THE call when your manager says, ‘Got it. Prime-time America. You’re back on’.”And it’s go go go with My 600lb Life.NOTE: In order to avoid Britain’s Got Talent Live, I’m heading south of the border, down Mexico way. Column returns in a fortnight.BBC1’s version of the Jeremy Thorpe murder plot saga, A Very English Scandal, is nuts.It’s very entertaining as well, but it is nuts, with CGI badgers running around in episode one and a couple of Yucca plants shoved in some sand dunes to try and make us think North Devon is actually “California,” on Sunday night.The main issue, however, is that A Very English Scandal can’t quite decide if it’s a comedy or not. So it’s deadly serious whenever Thorpe’s commenting on Europe, immigration or gay rights, but pure Carry On when his ex-lover Norman Scott starts having it off in a caravan with the bird out of Torchwood.It’s more than saved, though, by the incredible storyline and performances of the brilliant Alex Jennings, who totally vanishes into the part of Thorpe’s sidekick, Peter Bessell, Patricia Hodge as Ursula Thorpe, and Ben Whishaw, who’s got the most difficult role of all as the insanely irritating Scott, but does it well enough to make me wish he’d been shot on Exmoor rather than his dog.In that sort of company, of course, it was also incredibly brave to give the lead role to Hugh Grant, who never quite convinces me he’s anyone other than Hugh Grant, yet I will say this for a performance that stands out from anything he’s ever done before.He’s wearing a hat.Courtesy of ITV’s Lee Dixon on England’s World Cup goalies: “You’d be down to one goalkeeper and a nervous one.”“You’d be down to one goalkeeper and a Neville Swan.”INCIDENTALLY, who claimed the following, last week: “People always get excited about cockchafers.”EASIEST gig on the soaps?EastEnders’ Big Mo, who’s just set herself up as Walford’s resident psychic and fortune teller.A job with my name on it, frankly, as I wouldn’t need a crystal ball, money or much encouragement to tell the locals: “This old craphole will be locked in an ever more depressing cycle of baby abductions, love triangles, disrupted weddings, head transplants and escaped animals from now until kingdom come. Get the hell out, while you still can.”Walford CID might also want to put me on a profiling retainer as well, given they’re the only people who haven’t noticed that every single street crime, including – surprise, surprise – last week’s stabbings of Keanu and Shakil, has been carried out by a white, working-class male with a bad stage school Cockney accent.I guess Big Mo’s probably safe in the position for the moment, though, as she seems to have foretold the re-appearance of Shane “Alfie” Richie in The Vic, earlier this month.However, at roughly the same time, she also predicted: “Jean (Slater) will get a job with teeth.”This Morning, “Earth Angel” Sarah Rebecca Vine: “I am a spiritual life coach and healer and, I feel, a messenger to wake people up.” Zzzzz.And First Time Mum, Ferne McCann: “The hypnotherapist session definitely calmed me down and emptied my mind.” Of what?The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “On the flag of South Sudan blue represents the waters of what major river?”Bradley Walsh: “What UK Prime Minister read geography at an all- women’s Oxford college?”Jackie: “Tony Blair.”Bradley Walsh: “In a hospital, the H\u0026ampN unit refers to the head and what other part of the body?”Jackie: “Nose.”And Ben Shephard: “In Australia and New Zealand a ‘long black’ is a variety of which hot beverage?”Teri: “Beer.”The BBC’s Friday night schedule offering us two left-wing panel shows (HIGNFY and New World Order), featuring ’s Mona Chalabi, when one was far too many.The A\u0026ampE Live caption writer responsible for the spelling of “interupt”. Channel 4’s Goggleboxers and all the other people who seem to think The Handmaid’s Tale is a documentary.Car Share lacking either the brains or the balls to make a preview copy of its finale available.And Good Morning Britain without that oaf Piers Morgan, on Thursdays and Fridays. An experience which really is as pointless and empty as Tight Fit performing The Lion Sleeps Tonight, without Steve Grant on lead vocals.Brilliant performances from Alex Jennings, Patricia Hodge and Ben Whishaw, as Peter Bessell, Jeremy Thorpe’s mum and Norman Scott, on A Very English Scandal.BBC1’s Motty: The Man Behind The Sheepskin, revealing an even odder character than I was expecting. Dave’s How The Young Ones Changed Comedy (not entirely for the better).And The Chase offering up my favourite quiz show moment of the year, so far.Bradley Walsh: “Which astrologer published a colouring book called The Art Of Astrology?” John: “Galileo.” Bradley: “Russell Grant.”Gareth Bale: “I haven’t seen the goal back yet, I’ve only watched it again now.”Steve McManaman: “It’s a surprise that Bale’s not playing, but it’s not a surprise that he’s on the bench.”And Rio Ferdinand: “Win the Champions League and it’s chance to be forever mortalised.”(Compiled by Graham Wray)THIS week’s winner is Britain’s Best Home Cook’s Mary Berry and Gary Oldman as Dracula.

In the US — officially the world’s fattest nation — that figure is 18.5 per cent.UK stores now stock plus-size clothes for under-tens, with H\u0026ampM becoming the latest chain to sell a “generous fit” range for kids as young as eight.Obesity is predicted to double in the next 25 years — while tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money has already been thrown at the problem.But a simple — and cheap — solution can already be found on the playgrounds and fields of around 6,000 primary schools where more than a million children take part in the Daily Mile.The exercise regime means that at some point in every school day, pupils leave their classroom, still in their uniform, to run, jog or walk for up to 15 minutes.Youngsters can set their own pace and talk to their friends while they go round.Most of the children complete a mile or more in the quarter of an hour.Teachers all over the country have reported how pupils return to the classroom invigorated and eager to learn after doing what is being called “jography”.Last week, Prime Minister Theresa May praised the Daily Mile and called on schools to take it up — but stopped short of saying it should be compulsory.Now, for all our kids’ sakes, The Sun is calling on Education Secretary Damian Hinds to make the Daily Mile mandatory in all primary schools.The idea began six years ago and has been growing steadily. But only now have scientists been able to prove it really does have an effect.Over the course of an academic year, a team of experts from Stirling University compared nearly 400 children, aged four to 11, from two primaries, with one group doing the Daily Mile and the other not.The Daily Mile kids were put through a series of tests to calculate whether they became fitter and whether they lost fat.IF you are a teacher or parent who would like to get your school doing the Daily Mile check out thedailymile or go to @_thedailymile or on Facebook. There is lots of information showing how easy it is to incorporate the Daily Mile and to support schools who want to get involved. You can also register your interest.The findings, which have just been released, show how they lost an average of four per cent body fat.They were also fitter and more active during the day, while time spent sitting around dropped by an average 18 per cent.Another investigation, conducted at an inner city school in London, found Daily Mile youngsters did much better than expected in SATS tests.Other tests have shown how children also feel less stressed and more confident.Retired head Elaine Wyllie, 62, came up with the idea of the Daily Mile almost by accident when pupils at her St Ninians school in Stirling wanted to get fitter.After just six weeks, not one of the 57 children in her first year was overweight.But to persuade the Government to introduce the Daily Mile into all Britain’s 20,000 primary schools, scientific proof was needed.After reading the latest results from Stirling University, Elaine said: “I knew this research would be the game-changer which would prove what I had believed all along — that the Daily Mile makes children fitter, happier, more active and a healthier weight.“I am delighted and relieved that we now have objective proof.”But education chiefs appear reluctant to make the Daily Mile compulsory for fear of upsetting head teachers, who might see it as an extra burden on their staff.However, Jim Cleaver, head of Westgate Community Primary in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, says: “The beauty of the Daily Mile is its simplicity.“It takes 15 minutes out of the day and for staff it is as easy as opening a door.”At Woodlands, a school for children with special needs in Leatherhead, Surrey, lead nurse Emma Packham has seen children lose weight as a result of the Daily Mile.She says: “We had five children who were clinically obese whose weight was just going up, up, up.“Since we started 18 months ago nobody in the target group has gained weight. Some have lost weight.No other factors in their lives have changed.”It is not just the children’s weight that is changing. Teachers are reporting that behaviour in classroom is improving. And many parents say their children sleep better at night.Former MP Andy Burnham, now the Mayor of Manchester, is a fan and wants his city to become the first where every primary school does the Daily Mile.Unlike some schemes, there would be no costs with introducing it into schools. All associated expenses are currently being paid by Britain’s richest man, Jim Ratcliffe, who has also used some of his £21billion fortune to advertise it during Ant \u0026amp Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway.Sports commentator Jake Humphrey, who runs the Daily Mile with youngsters at Trowse primary school in Norwich, says: “I honestly don’t think parents are aware of how unfit their children are. Why weren’t we doing this 20 years ago?”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That readiness is absolutely vital to securing a genuinely beneficial deal.We know that Civil Service mandarins want Brexit to fail.They’ve set up roadblock after roadblock in the hope we’ll be forced to cave in and change our minds on the whole exercise.That cannot be allowed to happen.Jacob Rees-Mogg is spot on when he says the PM needs to show some iron, and that Brussels won’t get the money they desperately need unless they play ball with Britain. It’s the only way we’ll focus minds across Europe.Without a plan, we’re only planning to fail.THE calls for abortion reform in Northern Ireland are entirely understandable.It looks increasingly odd that its laws are so out of step with both the rest of the UK and now with their southern neighbour.But Ulster’s abortion laws have always been a matter for the people of Northern Ireland.For devolution to work, Westminster needs to acknowledge the right of the Scots, the Welsh and the Northern Irish to set their own rules.It’s not a pick ’n’ mix depending whether or not MPs agree with them.And the way some Labour politicians have suddenly become dedicated activists to drive a wedge between the PM and the DUP is shameless.The Government’s priority in Northern Ireland must be to restore a functioning Assembly, which has been missing for more than 500 days. Then the province can have an abortion debate.But it is for Ulster, not Westminster, to make any decisions.KYLIE Minogue has had us Spinning Around for decades. We wish the Red Blooded Woman a very happy birthday.If only we could all be So Lucky to look that good at 50.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He will find out that it’s not that easy.”But it can also be revealed that Home Office bosses do fear 51 year-old Abramovich “buying” an EU passport from Russia-friendly states such as Cyprus and Malta.It is very difficult to exclude anyone with EU citizenship from coming into the UK.The source added: “If Abramovich bought an EU passport from somewhere like Cyprus, it would be very difficult to keep him out.“It would then be up to the EU to explain what they have done.”Downing Street also said that Israel’s visa waiver scheme would not give anyone the longterm right to work in the UK.The scheme only gives the likes of Abramovich half a year maximum here for leisure or business trips.His £8.6billion oil fortune means he has overtaken Israeli shipping and property magnate Eyal Ofer, worth £6.85billion.Israel grants citizenship to any Jewish person wishing to move there and issues a passport. Roman will also be exempt from paying tax for ten years, sources said.A No10 spokesman said: “Those with Israeli passports are non-visa nationals, which means they do not need a visa to come to the UK as a visitor for a maximum period of six months.“Israelis are required to obtain a visa if they want to live, work or study in the UK.”In a significantly tightening of the rules since the Salisbury nerve agent attack, it is believed the Home Office have demanded Mr Abramovich spell out precisely how he came about his £9bn fortune before his visa is renewed.The bureaucratic questions will take many months, in a retaliatory move designed to heap pressure on Mr Putin.Boris Johnson revealed the Government’s thinking during a hoax call with pranksters pretending to be the Armenian PM last week.The Foreign Secretary said: “I think it is very important for the Russians to know that the UK is absolutely determined to stand firm against them and we will continue to tighten the squeeze on some of the oligarchs that surround Putin.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some Italians told me unelected bankers and institutions in Brussels were being put first. They have a point.The EU and Italy’s President now need to tread incredibly carefully. The 5-Star Movement is already mobilising voters through street protests. The League party is calling on them to vent their frustration at the banks and financial markets.Yesterday, one EU official suggested the financial markets would teach Italian voters a lesson by withdrawing investment from the country. This will only pour gasoline on the populist fire.So, what happens next? The populists will almost certainly sweep to another victory at fresh elections, possibly triggering a new financial crisis and creating another major headache in Brussels. One of the parties might also propose a referendum on Italy’s euro membership.It seems very likely this chaos is not going anywhere anytime soon and the EU will soon be presented with yet another crisis.The events in Italy have clear implications for the Brexit debate. The EU has struggled to make sense of why Leavers opted for Brexit, just as today they are struggling to make sense of the mood in Italy.Many Leavers voted for Brexit because they felt the EU was not able to manage its own affairs, and they will see Italy as further evidence of that.But also many Leavers were anxious that the European Union allows very little room for other political views and they will see that as well in the Italy crisis.While the president was acting in the remit of his constitutional office, the problem is that many Italians and Europeans feel this is an example of Europe’s inability to accept any opposition to the euro single currency.It seems difficult to see how this crisis can be resolved without a more openly Eurosceptic Italy — and without a populist government at the head of the eurozone’s third largest economy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Whoever is holding one when the music stops gets called up on stage.The Lucky 13 are then suspended in a cage and given torches to shine back at the audience before being hidden from view with a cover and taken off the stage through a secret passageway.They are then told to run down backstage corridors to reappear in the back of the theatre clutching the torches they were given by Copperfield during the trick.But Mr Cox claims he slipped and fell 22ft from the door that lead back into the theatre, injuring his neck and brain.He testified: I was having a good time up until the time I was injured.Mr Cox recalled stagehands shouting Run! Run! Run! through an outdoor alleyway that his lawyers say was coated with construction dust.He said he fell hard on his right side and didnt remember getting up to finish the illusion in November 2013.Afterwards, Mr Cox said he received medical treatment from paramedics and at a hospital for shoulder and other injuries.Two day later, he and his wife and a lawyer returned to the theatre at the MGM Grand and filed an accident report.Copperfield testified that until Mr Cox sued in August 2014, he never knew of anyone getting hurt during nearly 20 years performing the illusion on tour and in Las Vegas.He said he stopped performing it a year later.The magician said he didnt see construction dust on the ground when he passed through the same outdoor alley alone as part of another illusion about 10 minutes earlier.Mr Coxs lawyers brought in three women who testified that they also were injured during the illusion over the years.One included a schoolteacher who said she fell but finished with a bloody knee during a Copperfield performance about five months before Mr Coxs fall."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/nintchdbpict000253378773.jpg?w=960","title":"biggest ever invasion flying ants","story":"The pests are set to swarm across the UK in record numbers - with infestations up by 150 per cent in just two months.Experts are blaming the explosion on warmer weather in April and May after Brits basked in 29C heat.Pest controllers at Rentokil say 50billion more flying ants - 1,000 for each Brit - could sweep the UK causing grief for homeowners.A spokesman said: Experts believe the rise could be attributed to the unseasonably warm start to the Spring - after Brits experienced record-breaking warm weather in April.Last month’s period of clear skies and the hottest April day since 1949 may explain the surge in activity, as ants are typically more active in higher temperatures and colonies use sunlight to navigate.This happens on Flying Ant Day when swarms take to the skies and breed mid-air.The most common type of flying ant is the black garden variety (the Lasius niger), whose nests have a single queen and anything from 5,000 to 15,000 workers.Flying ants are not dangerous insects and are unlikely to bite.Even though theyre harmless, flying ants are still annoying - but fortunately, there are many household items which can be used to get rid once and for all.Spraying with dish-washing soap mixed with water can dehydrate the ants.Asparteme-based sweeter is said to be effective.Combining this with juice to form a paste means the critters will carry it back to their colony - killing off some of the ant population in the process.Distributing some insecticidal powder around window and door openings can also prevent the ants from entering your home.Rentokil also says to clean up after yourself and keep food and rubbish bags sealed tightly.The surge also means Flying Ant Day - when the creatures search for a mate - could be bumped from July to as early as June.The day marks the start of the insects mating season, when millions of the horny critters take to the skies to breed mid-air.But it lasts for much longer than a day - usually lasting for around two weeks.David Cross, head of the technical training academy at Rentokil Pest Control, said: Last month we saw reported ant infestations rise to levels we wouldn’t usually expect until June or July.It’s rare to see ant infestations in cold or overcast weather, and while the ‘Beast from the East’ may have caused them to remain dormant in March, the sudden change in temperature has since brought them out in their droves.This trend could be set to continue throughout the rest of the summer.It comes after Brits were warned of a summer explosion of Asian hornets after reports of the striped terrors turning up in the West Country."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000409752963.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"pope francis john bradburne saint canonisation","story":"Campaigners are calling on Pope Francis to canonise John Bradburne — who they say performed miracles in the war-torn country.The poet and aid worker wore distinctives monks robes and a Christ-like beard as he cared for lepers in what was then 1970s Rhodesia.But Mugabes Zanu-PF guerillas believed him to be an informant  for the British-backed government and captured him in 1979.Bradburne was marched and tortured — including being forced to eat dog dirt — before he was subjected to a rigged trial.He was offered the chance to leave the country but he refused, insisting that he wanted to return to care for the ill and infirm at the Mutemwa colony.Bradburne, 58, was instead gunned down as he prayed and his half-naked body was dumped by the roadside before being buried outside the capital Harare.Now, supporters hope to raise £20,000 to to pay for an inquiry into his life and the reported miracles linked to him.His niece Celia Brigstocke, 63, is leading the campaign to have Mr Bradburne beatified and then canonised.If successful, he will be the first English person to become a saint in nearly 50 years since The 40 Martyrs of England and Wales — who were executed for treason between 1535 and 1679 — were canonised by Pope Paul VI in 1970.John was born in Westmorland, Cumbria in 1921 as the son of an Anglican rector before converting to Catholicism in 1947.The WWII veteran, who bravely served with the Ghurkas in Singapore and Burma, took 16 years to travel the world  and explore his spiritualism.A productive writer, John wrote around 6,000 poems in his lifetime — earning him the Guinness World Record for the most prolific in the English language.He then settled in Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe in 1969 where he built a church at the Mutemwa colony and devoted his life to its inhabitants.Bradburne was fiercely loyal to the lepers, even bathing their wounds, praying and sleeping alongside them despite the risk of infection.Among his supposed miracles, mourners at his funeral reported seeing drops of blood below his coffin although there was no blood inside.Supporters also say a man was cured of a brain tumour ten years ago after praying to Mr Bradburne.The Archbishop of Harare, the Most Rev Robert Ndlovu, is said to be supportive of the campaign which could ultimately see him beatified and made a saint by Pope Francis."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000409742564.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"incredible colour pictures reveal devastation of britains first air raids 103 years since german zeppelins bombed uk cities","story":"The bombing campaign, known as the “First Blitz”, killed 500 people on British soil during WWI.They show how peoples lives in the capital were ripped apart following the first Zeppelin attack on London in May 1915.Pictures in the fascinating collection also show the wreckage of a damaged L20 Zeppelin aircraft after it crashed into the sea off the coast of Norway.The airship was known as the “Raider of Loughborough” after being involved in the attack on the Midlands.The aircraft’s passengers can be seen rowing away from the wreckage.Other images show British soldiers desperately searching for survivors from the wreckage after a devastating raid in London.Another image shows a large sunken hole in the ground where a Zeppelin bomb tore through the ground, creating a deep well filled with rubble and debris.Military personnel and civilians are seen beside the hole as they survey the damage of yet another raid against Britain.One impressively colourised photo depicts a female munitions worker busy in a factory in 1915, before the factories became a key target for the bombing.Britain’s industrial heartlands were heavily populated, and their destruction would affect Britain’s war resources drastically.The incredible shots were colourised by British professional colouriser Tom Marshall of PhotograFix.He said: “Zeppelins were like no other weapon ever encountered before.“They were impossible to spot in the night sky, they flew higher than any British aeroplanes could reach, and were out of range of any guns.“They were the height of luxury travel before the war, but nobody imagined the death and destruction that airships could bring to Britain’s streets during World War One.”From this, the Kaiser authorised bombings on London to happen in February, however these were then postponed until April in the hopes it would be more weather permitting by this time.Once April fell, the bombing raids were delayed further until the newer and bigger P Class Zeppelins were available. This led to the first London bombings on the night of May 31, 1915.The fatal raids at the end of May in 1915 were commanded by the German officer Viktor Leopold Linnarz who ordered an LZ 38 airship to drop explosives over the capital.A total of 120 bombs were dropped from Stoke Newington to as far south as Stepney and as far north as Leytonstone.Seven people were killed and thirty-five were injured in these raids which burned down seven buildings.The damage from this one day of raids was estimated to have cost the government over £18,500, the equivalent of approximately £2 million today.The development of the Zeppelin airship was first pioneered by the German Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin in the early twentieth century, and were they first flown commercially in 1910.During the First World War, the German military made use of the power of Zeppelins by using them as bombers and scouts, killing over 500 people during the numerous bombing raids against Britain.The use of Zeppelins caused death and destruction away from the trenches and allowed Germany to attack the British on their own soil.The Zeppelin raids over London on May 31 forced the British government to issue a D-notice which prohibited any UK press outlets from reporting anything about the raids which wasn’t mentioned in the official statements.In 1921 the Allied Powers requested that Germany hand over all Zeppelins in reparation for the devastation they caused during the war."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004068280204.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"theresa mays latest suggestion to solve irish border issue dismissed by eu as very complicated before it was even presented at brexit talks","story":"The Prime Minister suggested using the so-called “back stop” solution – favoured by Brussels – after the transition period, but for a limited time only.However officials say this idea, where the UK mirrors existing EU rules, would be “very, very complicated” and fear it would only postpone the negotiations on a long-term solution.Negotiators in Brussels have said they think the backstop should be a permanent solution if it is implemented, but Mrs May has ruled it out.Instead she favours a so-called “new customs partnership” to deal with trade issues between Norther Ireland and the Republic once we exit the bloc.But that idea, along with a rival plan favoured by Brexiteers in her Cabinet like Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, has already been rejected by the EU.This latest knock-back by the EU creates further doubt that progress will be made on a border solution at the next European Council summit in June.A senior official told Politico of Mrs Mays time-limited backstop idea: “It would be a very, very complicated thing to negotiate. I really dont see how you get there.”The PM has only recently secured backing from her Cabinet, senior Brexiteers and the DUP for the proposal after weeks of wrangling.From the UK side there are two long-term options being discussed, a ‘customs partnership’ and ‘maximum facilitation’.The first is the favoured model of the Prime Minister, it is a hybrid system which would see the UK collecting tariffs on imports on the EU’s behalf.Supporters say it would allow for a frictionless border but Brexiteers say it is unworkable – with Boris Johnson labelling it ‘crazy’ – and would prevent the UK from being able to negotiate free trade deals around the world after we leave.Mr Johnson prefers the other option, known as ‘max-fac’, as it would take us further outside the grasp of the EU and allow us to strike deals of our own.It would require technological advances to smooth any problem at the border, however some suggest it may breach the Good Friday Agreement.Brussels has dismissed both options as Narnia and has set out a fallback option under which the UK would maintain full alignment with enough rules of the customs union and single market to prevent a hard border and protect the Good Friday Agreement.Mrs May suggested this could be only be a very short-term solution, saying no Prime Minister could ever agree to such terms, as they would undermine the constitutional integrity of the UK.But an agreement does need to be found soon, as the EU have said no progress can be made on other issues like trade without an agreement on Ireland first.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You dont know if its just hearsay.People are asking if Byrin had a twin and if he died but he had nothing like that.

Only half? Sounds optimistic to me.But leading the band which once epitomised sex and drugs and rock ’n’ roll — and the debauched history of the Stones is etched deeply into the corrugated faces of Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood — is the man who can teach us all we need to know about staying fit.Unlike Mick, we don’t have to take up yoga, ballet and kickboxing — but like him, we do have to think about getting our blood pumping every day of our lives.And unlike Jagger, we do not have to start every day with a smoothie — but we do have to think more about what we are putting into our bodies.Few of us could ever hope to follow Jagger’s punishing fitness regime, working out for hours most days of the week under the watchful eye of personal trainer Torje Eike.We don’t have the time, money or indeed fitness levels to keep up with this great-grandfather.But by having Mick Jagger as a role model, every one of us can be healthier than we are — slimmer, fitter and ready to rock ’n’ roll.The key to Jagger’s fitness is that everything counts.If you put good food into your body or if you eat rubbish.If you make regular demands on your body or just reach for the TV remote.Jagger gets mocked for his action-packed love life (at 73, he had a son with 29-year-old ballerina Melanie Hamrick) and for his laughter lines — nothing is that funny, Mick!But if you saw Jagger bouncing about like a 19-year-old this week, then you could not help but take him seriously.And want a slice of whatever he is having.So the next time the nation has a panic attack about how fat we are becoming, we need to get Jagger on the case.For — at the risk of being impolite — when did you ever see Jamie Oliver looking even remotely slim?But Mick Jagger is still dancing like it is 1969.And you never see a fat Rolling Stone. IT was such a glorious day in Windsor last Saturday that you would think even the hardest of hearts would soften at the sight of young love framed by pomp, pageantry and that cloudless blue sky.But the moaning anti-monarchy minnies are always with us.“Proof again that GB is an infantilised, escapist nation,” sneered Ugandan-born, Oxford-educated commentator Yasmin Alibhai-Brown, 68.Meanwhile, in Wales, Oxfam apologised if a modest royal wedding display in Oxfam’s Aberystwyth shop – Meghan and Harry face masks and some Union Flag bunting – had “caused upset”.But I was on the Long Walk in Windsor with those cheering crowds last Saturday, and I have never felt such a feeling of national unity.The monarchy exists solely with the blessing of the British people.We can divest ourselves of it at any time – as so many countries have ditched their royal families over the past few centuries.But if you stood among those crowds on the Long Walk – who came from every creed, class, race and religion on the planet – then you would believe that the future of the Royal Family is assured for the next 100 years.Anyone dreaming of a republican paradise should not hold their breath.Jada will be an inspiration to anyone suffering from the condition.Because with or without her hair, Jada still looks beautiful.BUCK-TOOTHED Brazilian footballer Ronaldinho is best remembered for two great performances – lobbing David Seaman’s ponytail in the 2002 World Cup and scoring eight times in one night with dancer Lisa Collins.One of these performances earned him the nickname “Pneumatic Drill”. And it wasn’t lobbing David Seaman.You might think that at 38, Ronaldinho’s pneumatic drill was getting a bit rusty, but in August he is to “wed” both his girlfriends, Beatriz Souza and Priscilla Coelho, in a joint ceremony.More three-in-one oil, darling?We are told that Britain should rely on the “good faith” from Brussels.What good faith?When did Brussels ever show anything but contempt, disdain and disrespect towards this country after we voted to leave?The EU’s attempt to shut Britain out of the Galileo satellite project – which we helped to fund – is just the latest insult.If May wants to give Brussels £39billion without a trade deal nailed down, then she should resign today.And make way for someone who will finally stand up for this country.THE Labour Party has suspended local party representative Ian McKenzie for saying that Islamic State would behead Labour’s Emily Thornberry rather than using her as a sex slave.McKenzie, chairman of the Lewisham East constituency, does not deny his crass comments, although some suggest they are being used by his opponents on Labour’s hard Left to discredit him.It sounds like he is doing a good job of discrediting himself.HARRY KANE will be England’s youngest ever World Cup captain – younger even than Bobby Moore.Kane will do a fine job but Bobby Moore beat testicular cancer in his early twenties and then lifted the World Cup at 25.And for any England captain, that will always be a hard act to follow.HOW stark-raving mad that TV historian Dan Snow feels he has to lie to his daughters that women flew Spitfires in World War Two so they feel free to “follow their dreams”.“My daughter was walking down rows and rows and rows of these Spitfire racers and she was going, ‘Boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy’,” says Snow.So to protect his six-year-old daughter from what he calls “the grim realities of pre-20th century gender relations”, Snow told her that some women also flew Spitfires in combat.And when I read of Snow’s bizarre lie, I thought of Violette Szabo, who was parachuted twice into Nazi-occupied Europe during World War Two to aid the French Resistance.On her second mission she was captured, tortured by the Gestapo and executed at Ravensbruck concentration camp in 1945.She was 23.Dan Snow has apparently never heard of Violette Szabo – because if he had, then he could surely have told his daughters about her.But many readers will know her incredible story from the film Carve Her Name With Pride.Violette was the working-class daughter of a French mother and a British father.She fell in love with a French Foreign Legion soldier of Hungarian descent called Etienne Szabo, who was killed in 1942 at El Alamein.Violette, who spoke fluent French, trained as a special-operations field agent to fight the Nazis.The torments she suffered before her death are beyond our imagination and her courage is at least the equal of any man who fought in World War Two – and I speak as the proud son of a Royal Naval Commando who won the Distinguished Service Medal.Educate yourself about Violette Szabo, Mr Snow.Then tell your daughters about her.WE all grew up as Star Wars fans but now it feels like there is always a new movie or spin-off coming out.The Last Jedi was only last year and this week sees the release of Han Solo’s back story, Solo. Talk about flogging a dead Wookiee.When Katy Perry is taking to the stage in a C-3PO mini-dress, the exploitation of the Star Wars franchise has possibly gone too far.We’re doomed, Katy.

By the time the 1990s came along, shipbuilding, mining, steel production and coal had been pretty much obliterated.People like my father were either unemployed, working abroad or had managed to cling on to work locally.This turbulent period in British history was captured rather well in the cult TV series Auf Wiedersein, Pet, a comedy-drama about a gang of seven British workers escaping the mile-long dole queues in England to take up cash-in-hand jobs in West Germany.Men and their roles in society were changing in a way that would be depicted two decades later in The Full Monty, a film which told the story of a group of out-of-work steel workers stripping to make money and rebuild their self-esteem.:: Podcast: The changing face of the UK:: Podcast: What do robots mean for the future of work?

I was 16.:: Sky Views: Journalists need to get out more:: Sky Views: The importance of remapping Britain I have spent the last few months working on a story about why, in 2018, men in the North are still living shorter lives than men in the South.I have been trying to find out to what extent this shorter life can be blamed on deprivation alone or whether there is such a thing as \"northern machismo\" - or an attitude that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.A doctor told me after my dad\u0027s postmortem, he would have had symptoms to suggest things were not right. I have often wondered why did not he say anything and I will never know.Almost all the indicators we use to measure deprivation are weighted towards the South, including life expectancy, heart disease, cancer rates, suicide, alcoholism, levels of tooth decay, literacy, road investment, wages and GCSE results.You name it, the North fairs worse. But how can this be?:: London is the most unequal place in the country Successive governments have either ignored the problem or deliberately diverted money to the South, where the perceived benefits to the national economy are greater.The reality is that the North-South divide is a black mark on the whole of Britain. It perpetuates inequality of the worst kind, pits regions against each other and neglects those areas of greatest need.Government policy has tried to direct funds through regional development initiatives, enterprise areas and grants, but there is very little evidence to suggest that these schemes have brought the economic prosperity intended.And Brexit won\u0027t help these areas either.:: The robots that could steal your job According to regional forecasts, every area of the UK will suffer a decline in GDP, with the North East taking an 11% hit to economic growth under the government\u0027s preferred outcome of a free trade deal with the EU.Leaving with no deal will result in a 16% dip, and staying in the single market would cause a 3% decline.These areas are as vulnerable today as they have ever been and things have to change.Governments have to take this seriously, otherwise we run the risk of damaging not just one generation, or two, but leaving permanent scars on whole swaths of Britain that have been left to rot because they are out of sight and out of mind."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-ocado-supermarket_4324323.jpg?20180530173037 ","title":"ocado moves up to ftse 100 as ms avoids relegation","story":"The re-shuffle was based on closing prices from Tuesday and M\u0026S had been just nine spots away from falling into the FTSE 250 zone, according to Thomson Reuters data based on last Thursday\u0027s closing prices."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-jesse-duplantis-televangelist_4324350.jpg?20180530182910 ","title":"televangelist asks followers to buy him a 54m jet","story":"The televangelist suggested to his viewers that they \"become a partner\" to help him purchase the Falcon 7X jet, with a page on his website encouraging people to donate up to $1,000 to his ministry.His site claimed that partners \"sow financial seeds into the good soil of JDM to help spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ to the world\".In a statement during his broadcast, Mr Duplantis claimed God told him directly to acquire a Falcon 7X.He said: \"In one of the greatest statements the Lord ever told me, he said \u0027Jesse you want to come up where I\u0027m at?\"\"I said \u0027what do you mean?\u0027 He said \u0027Before you ask I\u0027ll answer\u0027.\"Mr Duplantis added: \"I\u0027m not interested in learning to fly it, I\u0027m interested in preaching the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ.\"I really believe that if Jesus was on the Earth today he wouldn\u0027t be riding a donkey.\"Earlier in his broadcast the evangelist reflected on his history of private jet ownership, revealing he purchased his first plane in 1994.He bought his second aircraft in 2004 and his third in 2006."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/05/2048x1152/skynews-kim-yong-chol-front_4324437.jpg?20180530210119 ","title":"top n korea official lands in ny for talks with pompeo","story":"Kim Yong Chol is the highest-level representative from North Korea to set foot in the United States since 2000.The official, who is due to meet with Mr Pompeo on Wednesday and Thursday, arrived at New York\u0027s John F.

Your garden or local park can host just as much fun and help you keep costs down too. The trick is keeping everyone busy so the laughter flows and you all finish the weekend happy and re-energised. \u2028We’ve teamed up with Halfords to share some exciting ideas for what you can get up to – without breaking the bank. Get out into the garden  The key for any bank holiday weekend or half term is going to be fending off the inevitable boredom that can grip children – so why not put them in charge? They get to set the agenda, arrange the football tournament and decide if there\u0027s a water fight or not (there will be, so hide the garden hosepipe if you want to stay dry). To help them run the show, get them to help put up a tent to base themselves in.  The Secret Garden kids play tent and Rocket kids play tent are both ideal for getting their imaginations going. You\u0027ll also want to get the little’uns something to sit on, as they lay down the law of the garden. There’s even a Rocket folding kids chair and Secret Garden folding kids chair to match their tents.  Tents and a whole range of other camping gear are half price at Halfords for the bank holiday. Set up a grown-up place to chill  If the sun shows up for the weekend then you\u0027ll want to be able to find some cooling shade. \u2028While the kids are putting up their play tents, the adults can be busy erecting a sanctuary of their own – or kicking back in a Urban Escape King Size Moonchair, above. \u2028Take a look at the Halfords Gazebo with two side panels. Offering a UV rating of 50+ means not only will it offer shade, but it will also help keep you protected from the sun. \u2028\u2028  And if it rains? Don\u0027t worry, the gazebo is waterproof too. \u2028\u2028 A range of gazebos currently have 20% off at Halfords – check them out here.  Pack up a picnic lunch using a Halfords 40 litre coolbox – you can connect it to the mains or keep it charged in your car until you\u0027re ready, and then it will keep your food and drink nice and cool. It has wheels too, so no need to worry about getting it to your destination. And right now there’s 20 per cent off. You\u0027ll need cutlery, plates and something to drink out of too. The good news is Halfords has a four-piece set of acrylic wine glasses (it\u0027s your holiday too!) for just \u0026pound5. Rainbow plates and cutlery are also half price too, so grab the full set and make your park picnic bright and summery. Scoot to the park \u2028The kids can scoot on the Mongoose Stance Stunt Scooter, which is great for all wannabe daredevils. It\u0027s also down to just \u0026pound45 (save \u0026pound18), for the holiday weekend.  Or they can jump on the Slipstream Go Kart, a safe, fast and fun steel-frame go kart featuring wide pneumatic tyres for stability and a handbrake. The go kart, which also has a free wheel to stop pedals turning when going downhill, is now half price at \u0026pound70. Selected ride-ons at Halfords are currently half price.

He said today the rail industry has failed the passengers it serves following the implementation of a new timetable. There have been wholly unsatisfactory levels of disruption on Northern and Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) services since departure times were rescheduled on May 20, according to Chris Grayling. But Labour have accused Mr Grayling of trying to wash his hands of this chaos and said the blame lies at his door. The shadow rail minister Rachael Maskell said: The buck stops with him. It was him who awarded contracts to incompetent train companies and it was him who propped up a failed and unpopular system of rail privatisation.  In two letters to MPs, Mr Grayling described how he is frustrated that what should have been a good news story about the introduction of new services and expanded capacity has had such a poor start. Commuters are suffering their second week of travel chaos with the new timetable. On Tuesday some 14% of Northern services were cancelled, with a further 25% at least five minutes late. GTR saw 10% of trains cancelled and 14% delayed. The rail timetable is updated twice a year, but the latest update has seven times more changes than normal due to investment and a bid to make existing services more reliable. Mr Grayling wrote: We were aware that there might be some disruption in the early days of any new timetable change of this size, but the scale of the problem has far outstripped any expectation. The new timetable was finalised much too late to permit adequate logistical planning due to delayed Network Rail infrastructure works, Mr Grayling stated.  In relation to Northern routes, the minister explained that the failure to deliver electrification to Bolton and Preston in time for the new timetable had delayed the introduction of new electric trains. This meant there was a shortage of trains to cover the planned increase in services. He added that the way Network Rail creates timetables is simply unacceptable.

This week I challenged Jacob Rees-Mogg live on the radio because he is making misleading claims about what leaving the Single Market and the Customs Union will mean for small business owners like me.  For the last twelve years I have established my own European Express Transport Business, mainly transporting for “just in time” supply chains. This includes collecting components for the automotive industry all over Europe and delivering them to 24-hour production lines back in the UK.  Some of my customers include Ford in Dagenham and Bridgend, Jaguar Land Rover in the Midlands, BMW Mini in Oxford and Nissan in Sunderland, as well as Rolls-Royce on the south coast. All these car makers rely on the express movements of goods to assist in the smooth operation of their production lines, as they do not have the space to stockpile. Prompt collection is absolutely vital.  Most of the jobs I work on are only made possible by being inside the Single Market, which gives me access to the goods, whilst being in the Customs Union means no physical border to clear them.  Politicians like Jacob Rees-Mogg and Kate Hoey talk a lot about Switzerland being a possible model for how the UK could operate outside the EU and outside the Customs Union.  Well I’ve got actual experience of delivering goods from the EU into Switzerland and there are huge amounts of checks and paperwork and costs and delays involved. Believe me, it is very far from frictionless. When I was delivering goods for an exhibition there, I had to get an invoice of the goods in advance from the client, pay an upfront cost (to be claimed back later), contact a customs agent at Dover to let him know what was I delivering, wait hours in a car park whilst the paperwork was being cleared, drive to Switzerland and then clear customs again at the Swiss border. None of this is necessary if you’re in the Customs Union. Norway is another model that sometimes gets brought up, even though Norway is in the Single Market which the UK Government wants to leave (although like Switzerland, Norway is not in the Customs Union).

The new system would also slash the time it takes for cases to be examined - which would be aimed at clearing the backlog of complaints which is currently around 100. Recommendations from an internal working group would see the creation of a new three-person anti-Semitism panel to deal swiftly with complaints against party members. The Party hopes the more efficient system will help it to root out the abuse which has dogged the party for the last two years. The group produced a 13-point plan, which was leaked to HuffPost UK setting out plans which include using using smaller, specially-trained teams of investigators.  It suggests anonymising the complaints to avoid perceptions of political bias learning from the party\u0027s methods of tackling sexual harassment complaints. “There is a perception that cases are not dealt with in a consistent manner due to political forces influencing decisions with particular respondents – particularly at the NEC Disputes Panel stage of the process,” it states.  Christine Shawcroft was forced to resign from her role as chair of Labour\u0027s internal disputes panel after she apparently intervened to stand up for a council candidate suspended for alleged anti-Semitism. Last month party chairman Ian Lavery confirmed there were more than 100 cases waiting to be investigated. Although former London Mayor Ken Livingstone quit the party this month, it came after a two-year battle to expel him for remarks he had made linking Hitler, Zionism and Jews.  According to the leaked document the new system would see more disciplinary cases dealt with solely through written testimony rather than oral hearings. The party would also hire a new in-house lawyer to produce clearer evidence tests to standardise the system and make it more transparent.  Sanctions will range from verbal “reminders of conduct” or a “first written warning” through to more formal warnings, suspension and mandatory anti-semitism training. It is understood that the draft proposals were positively received by the NEC last week. They will now be finalised before being presented for approval at the body\u0027s next meeting, expected before the summer.

Senior Tory sources said the Party has engaged the services of UK Policy Group, a private ‘dark arts’ firm to carry out opposition research.  UK Policy Group is the UK arm of a notorious American political attack organisation, which has worked for Donald Trump’s administration and has aggressively targeted his critics.  Two former Number 10 officials are advising the firm. Employees of the company dig into the personal histories, online videos and posts of Labour candidates, collecting dossiers to be handed to the Tory party, according to sources. It\u0027s understood information is then handed to right-wing websites and newspapers to back up negative articles. The Conservative Party failed to respond to six calls and an email inviting them to comment. UK Policy Group Ltd declined to comment. Outsourcing opposition research  It’s believed to be the first time a major British political party has been accused of ‘outsourcing’ its attack research to a private company, a tactic frequently used in US elections. A string of former Tory high flyers now work for the firm, which was launched in London last January, including former Number 10 staffers and ex-party researchers.  The firm’s UK Vice President is Andrew Goodfellow , a ‘super sleuth’ who was formerly the Conservative Party’s Director of Policy and Research.  Mr Goodfellow did not respond to a request for comment. Staff working out of the firm’s plush Victoria Street offices, just a stone’s throw from Westminster, also include the Tory party’s former head of media monitoring and a former member of George Osborne’s communications team.   Official documents reveal David Cameron ’s former director of strategy, Ameetpal Gill, was given permission by parliamentary authorities to accept a contract advising the firm through his political strategy company Hanbury Strategy.   And Chris Brannigan , Theresa May’s former Director of Government Relations is a member of the group’s advisory board, though he told the Mirror his role does not involve carrying out opposition research.  He said: “I advise them on the strategic political scene and interpretation of political activities. Dull stuff.” A senior Tory source told the Mirror: “It isn’t surprising that under Theresa May the party has to outsource its ideas.” Links to Donald Trump and the Republican attack machine  UK Policy Group is the London branch of Definers Public Affairs , an elite American opposition research firm set up by two senior Republicans, Matt Rhoades , who ran Mitt Romney’s 2012 bid for the White House, and Joe Pounder the former head of research for the Republican Party.  Mr Rhoades and Mr Pounder were also founders of America Rising, a notorious Political Action Committee which solely exists to attack Democrats and opponents of Donald Trump.  Last year, lawyers working with America Rising embarked on a “witch hunt” of US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) employees who had criticised Donald Trump or his EPA director Scott Pruitt, according to the New York Times.  The lawyers requested copies of all emails sent by staff mentioning the President or Pruitt, sending a “wave of fear” through the staff that they faced public retribution for speaking out against the Trump administration’s watering down of environmental protections. “This is a witch hunt against E.P.A. employees who are only trying to protect human health and the environment,” Gary Morton, an E.P.A. employee in Philadelphia told the New York Times in December.  Raj Shah , a co-founder of America Rising LLC joined the Trump White House as Deputy Assistant to the President and Deputy Communications Director and Research Director in January 2017.   And Trump’s Special Counsel, Ann Donaldson formerly provided legal services to America Rising.   When UK Policy Group was first founded in January 2017, it was registered with Companies House under the name UK Rising Ltd, according to official documents.   Mr Pounder boasted to Time Magazine in 2016 that their file on Hillary Clinton ran to “over 7,000 pages of distilled research” and more than 10,000 videos.  Their tactics are said to include sending dozens of \u0027trackers\u0027 to follow Democratic candidates and politicians around with video cameras in the hope of capturing unflattering footage. In 2015 alone, their operatives reportedly attended around 3,500 Democratic Party events. \u0027Campaign style research dossiers\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"tory mp keeps asking ministers","story":"NewsThis Tory MP keeps asking Ministers what would happen if Theresa May is \u0027incapacitated\u0027Arch Brexiteer Peter Bone has a particular morbid fascination in the Prime Minister\u0027s unexpected demise\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByMikey SmithPolitical reporter17:41, 30 MAY 2018Updated18:03, 30 MAY 2018News (Image: Newcastle Chronicle)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTory MP Peter Bone has raised eyebrows by tabling a \u0027creepy\u0027 written question in the House of Commons, asking what arrangements are in place in case Theresa May is “incapacitated.” And it\u0027s not even the first time he\u0027s asked.  The keen Brexiteer asked Cabinet Office minister David Lidington “with whom he would plan to co-ordinate the delivery of Government objectives in the event that the Prime Minister was temporarily or permanently incapacitated.”  Constitution minister Chloe Smith answered the question, noting that in cabinet meetings the next most senior person would take charge. But she added: “In the event of the permanent incapacity of the Prime Minister, the appointment of a new Prime Minister is a matter for Her Majesty The Queen acting under the Royal Prerogative.”  Mr Bone has asked the same question of successive Prime Ministers and their deputies a total of ten times since he was elected to the Commons in 2010.  He asked a similar question of then Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg in the Commons in 2011 and of David Cameron in writing in 2015.  Mr Bone has also repeatedly tabled Private Members’ Bills which would, if passed, write a strict line of succession into British Law. The latest version of Bone’s law of succession is due for its second reading in the House of Commons in January.

The image of the newlyweds sits proudly on display in Buckingham Palace\u0027s Audience Room, where the Queen greets guests and dignitaries on a weekly basis. Perched alongside a clock, a gold box and some paperwork underneath a pair of glasses, the image of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex appeared to have replaced one of Princess Anne and her husband Timothy Lawrence. The portrait of the Queen\u0027s daughter Princess Anne and Timothy dressed in Navy uniforms was last seen in April to the right hand side of the lamp.

And while the room is decorated with touching images of the Queen\u0027s nearest and dearest, it\u0027s also adorned with some pricey ornamental pieces.  Placed on either end of the mantlepiece are two 18th Century English porcelain pheasants, reportedly valued at \u0026pound20,000, reports the Mail Online .   The white marble clock in the centre of the mantlepiece is believed to be valued at \u0026pound4,000, while the mirror is reportedly worth \u0026pound30,000. Harry and Meghan appear to be posing for the picture, which could have been taken as part of their engagement shoot by fashion photographer Alexi Lubomirski. The couple captured the world\u0027s heart with their stunning engagement shots, as Meghan opted for a partly sheer dress.

Keelan Wilson, 15, was knifed multiple times in the Merry Mill suburb of the city and was rushed to hospital but could not be saved.  West Midlands Police were called to a disturbance in the area at roughly 11pm yesterday and emergency responders found car-mad Keelan critically injured. Mum Kelly this afternoon changed her profile picture on Facebook to one of her and Keelan. Speaking outside the family home, George Ellitts also described his grandson as an angel and said the family were due to fly on holiday to Egypt next week.  He added: He\u0027s lived with me all my life. He raised a few hundred pounds for Great Ormond Street Hospital a few years back, he had his hair cut, he had the lot off. According to the Justgiving page at the time Keelan raised a total of \u0026pound243 which was donated by 22 people when he was aged just 10. Another neighbour, who didn\u0027t want to be named, added: We heard about it when we saw the paramedics last night. We speak to our neighbours when we see them but we keep ourselves to ourselves. My daughter would recognise Keelan - they went to the same school, Smestow School in Wolverhampton. It\u0027s a shock that this happened here. We have never had anything like this happen before. Resident Christina McIntosh-Smith, 20, said: We heard about it this morning. We saw the tents set up. We didn\u0027t personally know him.  It\u0027s definitely a shock - he was so young. Nothing like this has happened this close before. There will be a sad atmosphere in the street. It would be sad no matter who it was. Part of a nearby road has been cordoned off while investigations are carried out and door to door enquiries are taking place. Officers are also reviewing CCTV from the scene. Lily Thompson, 81,who has lived in the road for 39 years, said: I heard about it this morning. It was Keelan Wilson. I have known him for nearly 16 years. He wasn\u0027t a bad lad. He wasn\u0027t rude to you. He always spoke to me well, I never had any cheek off him.  He would always come out and put his hand round you and say \u0027hello Mrs T\u0027 . I always found him a nice lad.  I was quite shocked when I heard it was him, especially when you have grandkids of your own the same age. We have had a bit of trouble round here before - somebody selling drugs. There have been cars broken into, windows broken but it\u0027s only lately we have had this trouble. I never knew Keelan to be involved in that. A blue covering has been pulled over a car, believed to be a taxi, parked on the pavement of the street. The driver of the taxi described being attacked by a group of youths after he stopped to pick up a fare.  The man, who did not want to be named, said: I saw these two guys trying to jump start a car. They had a car outside but it would not start. I told them if they wanted to come, then come if not I will go. And suddenly they try to come in the car. There was another group of about four to five of them. They had a knife and they attacked me as well. I think the two groups were fighting. I injured my hand, I went hospital but did not need stitches. I was cut with a knife. My car was damaged, with what I think was a metal bar. I didn\u0027t see exactly what happened as I just tried to drive off quickly.  A man told BirminghamLive he looked out his bedroom window after hearing noises at 11pm and saw a teenager lying in the road, covered in blood. The man, who does not wish to be named said he rushed out into the street to save him. Keelan had suffered stab wounds \u0027all over his body\u0027. The resident said: “When I got to him he wasn’t talking or nothing, just mumbling in pain on the floor. “We were on the phone to the ambulance saying ‘hurry up, quick as you can, there’s blood everywhere’. “It was around 5-10 minutes later, there was four of us outside by then when the ambulance turned up.  Detective Chief Inspector Chris Mallett, from West Midlands Police Force CID, said: A young boy has tragically been killed and we are determined to find out why this has happened. We are talking about the terrible loss of a 15-year-old boy, someone who had their life to live, and we will be working round the clock to find who was responsible. We are following a number of active lines of enquiry and would urge anyone with information which could assist our enquiries to call us as soon as possible. Next of kin have been informed, the force said. A shocked local said: We heard it about 11pm. To us it sounded like someone breaking into our car.  Banging and smashing, so we looked out the window to see what was going on. My wife called police straight away. Around 5-10 minutes later the emergency services turned up. They got the victim into an ambulance and I don’t know what happened after that.

But rather than the images of a magician or escapologist that the moniker may conjour, Chesney was a triple killer who scandalised the public almost 70 years ago. Wanted by Scotland Yard for the murder of his wife and her mother, having concealed the murder of his own mother years before, he was finally brought to a form of justice by his own hand shot dead in a German forest. The bullet had gone through his head. Beside him lay a gun and a letter addressed to his German girlfriend, the beautiful Sonia Winnikes, 28. It read: My dear Sonia, By the time you read this letter I will no longer be here. . . You know I am unschuldig [innocent], but with what has happened in the past it would be difficult to prove...  His death brought to an end a two-nation manhunt for \u0027Mr. X\u0027 - a suspect Scotland Yard had asked the German police to help them find. \u0027X\u0027 was wanted in connection with the murder of Chesney\u0027s wife, Vera Isobel Veronica Chesney, 43, and her mother,  Lady  Mary Menzies, 73. The two women were murdered In Sunset House, the old folks\u0027 home that Chesney\u0027s mother-in-law ran in West London. The older woman was beaten around the head and strangled and Chesney\u0027s wife was drowned in a bath - the killer had made sure she had drunk enough gin to knock her out and then lowered her into a bath and lifted her legs so she remained submerged. It emerged Chesney had sneaked into the country from the Continent and then back out again. He hoped that killing his wife would release money held in their marriage. It was a sensational end to a sensational life for Chesney, who had been born John Merrett, which included wartime heroics, a prodigious appetite for for women, food and drink, deception at every turn and murder. And as the story unravelled of who the killer was it emerged deep in his past a earlier crime which was even more shocking - the murder of his mother. John Donald Merrett the man who became known as Ronald Chesney was born in New Zealand in 1908. The family moved to Russia but his mother Bertha found that the climate did not suit John, her only child so she took him to Switzerland.  During the First World War her husband deserted and so Bertha, the daughter of a wealthy Manchester Wine merchant, brought the boy to England when he was sixteen. For a time they lived near Reading and John was sent to Malvern College to train for the diplomatic service. Bad boy When the time came for him to go to a university, Bertha moved to Edinburgh so that her son could still live at home. They took a flat in Buckingham Terrace, near Edinburgh University, where John enrolled as an art student. He was a brilliant scholar but his conduct did not match his brains. His mother,had an income of just over \u0026pound700 a year, out of which she gave John 10 shillings a week pocket money but it was was not enough for young Merrett, who soon tired of his studies. Unknown to his mother he was regularly skipping his lectures to go dancing at the city\u0027s music halls.. At night, he would lock his bedroom door and climb out of the flat by a rope, so as not to rouse his mother\u0027s suspicions. To finance his life of stolen pleasure, he forged cheques drawn on his mother\u0027s bank account - these were the days long before Internet banking and many financial transactions ran on trust. With the money he got in this way he bought a motor-cycle, gifts of jewellery for Betty Christie, one of the dance instructors at the palais which he haunted day and night and chillingly a pistol and ammunition. However he was living on borrowed time and stolen money and the cheques were to catch up with him. Murder It was on March 17- St. Patrick\u0027s Day. 1926 — that the events happened which led to John Merrett\u0027s trial on a murder charge. It was over breakfast when Bertha opened a letter from her bank to find that she was, inexplicably, overdrawn. The Merretts\u0027 maid heard a shot, then a scream and the sound of someone falling in the sitting-room. John went into the kitchen and told the maid he and his mother had quarrelled about money. And he said: My mother has shot herself.  In the sitting-room, the maid found Mrs. Merrett lying on the floor, bleeding from a bullet wound in the right ear. A pistol was on the bureau. Later the same day, John went to his favourite dance-hall, paid the fee to book Betty Christie, and took her out for the day. During a brief spell when she regained consciousness, she had said: Donald (as she called her son ) was standing beside me while I wrote a letter. I said to him: \u0027Go away.\u0027 The next I heard was a kind of explosion. I do not remember anything more. Her son\u0027s account was when his mother told him to go away he went to the corner of the room, heard a shot and saw a revolver falling from his mother\u0027s hand. His mother died a fortnight later. The twist Merrett thought he would be free to live his life how he wanted but in her will Bertha left all she had in trust for her son until he was 25. It was a blow to the young man who longed to have access to his mother\u0027s money and so he quickly wrote a string of cheques against his mother\u0027s account. However, authorities were soon on to him, curious as to how a dead woman was spending so much money, and eight months after his mother\u0027s death he was arrested on a charge of murdering his mother and forging 29 cheques on her bank account. However there were no witness and after a seven-day trial at Edinburgh High Court and a cleverly constructed defence a jury of nine men and six women returned a verdict of not proven on the murder charge.  On the charge of forging his mother\u0027s signature to raid her savings, Merrett was found guilty and sentenced to a year\u0027s imprisonment. The trial of young Merrett was regarded as one of the most sensational murder trials of the century. Love When he was freed, after serving his sentence, Merrett — as he still called himself —found refuge in the home of one of his mother\u0027s friends, Mrs. Mary Bonner, then living at Bexhill. Mrs. Bonner — she became Mrs. Menzies when she remarried after her first husband\u0027s death — had a charming and attractive daughter, 17-year-old Isobel, known as Vera to her friends. Soon they were in love and in March 1928 they eloped and married in Glasgow. However three months later the pair stood in the dock at Newcastle Upon Tyne charged with obtaining goods worth \u0026pound200 by false pretences. Merrett gave their\u0027 names as  Mr. and Mrs, John Chesney, late of Bexhill. They had been living in a tent on the outskirts of the city.  He had signed cheques in the name of McCormick, giving his address as the Grand Hotel when he had no such fortune. Merrett, alias Chesney, alias McCormick , was jailed for nine months. His wife was discharged. The trial was made the subject of a book by William Roughead, who ended the story by saying he had not heard what became of Mrs. Chesney. Then he wrote:  But you never can tell: we may do so yet.... A windfall Two years after leaving prison Chesney inherited the then huge sum of \u0026pound50,000 from his Grandfather and went on a huge spending spree. He and his wife lived for the next decade in the lap of luxury and put \u0026pound10,000 aside for the future in trust should something happen to one of them - it was a decision which would prove costly for them both. A speedboat and a two-seater aircraft - both bought with a view to smuggling - an open top Bentley, a country mansion, lavish entertainment, and a stableful of slow racehorses helped consume his money. But as the money ran out his wife tired of his love of other women and they separated. Desperate to continue his lifestyle he moved to the continent where in the 1930s smuggled drugs and arms on a run between Malta, North Africa, and Spain and spent time in a string of foreign jails. Scotland Yard believed he used his wealthy connection to help smuggle carpets, pictures and art treasure. The war hero The Second World War, when it came, was treated by Chesney as just another opportunity to make a dishonest living and he fast became known as Mr Fixit who could get anything for the right amount of money. As Lieutenant Ronald Chesney, RNVR, in command of a mine-sweeping trawler and no-one knew of his terrible criminal past. In 1954 a former sailor who served with him, Howard Johnson, described him as Hard drinking, 6ft. tall, weighing 22st., with a huge black beard, a large gold ear-ring dangling from the pierced lobe of his right ear, and a real Cyrano de Bergerac of a nose - he was a man of violent action who lived to the full.

John Bradburne was killed during missionary work in Zimbabwe, then Rhodesia, in 1979. Before he died, he said he had only three wishes — to help lepers, die a martyr and be buried in a habit of the Franciscan order. In September 1979, the poet and warden of Mutemwa leper colony in Zimbabwe, then Rhodesia, was caught up in the country’s civil war, the Rhodesian Bush War.  Friends told him to flee before arrival of the bloodthirsty ZANU-PF guerillas who thought he was an informer. But he insisted on remaining. The guerillas bound Bradburne’s hands, took him on a forced march and humiliated him. They made him dance and sing, got him to eat excrement and dangled young women in front of him, before interrogating him and subjecting him to a rigged trial. They offered him the chance to escape so long as he left the country and abandoned his beloved flock.  He refused and, when he knelt down to pray, they shot the 58-year-old in the back with a Kalashnikov, leaving him half-naked by the side of the road. Now, nearly 40 years after his brutal murder, Bradburne is on the verge of becoming a saint — the first British saint since 1970, when Pope Paul VI canonised Cuthbert Mayne and 39 British companions — The 40 Martyrs of England and Wales. They were executed for treason between 1535 and 1679, and the Scottish Catholic martyr John Ogilvie, canonised in 1976. Campaigners, including Bradburne’s niece Celia Brigstocke, are convinced of Bradburne’s power to perform miracles.  Mourners at his funeral said they saw drops of blood beneath his coffin, even though no blood was found inside when it was opened. Others claim that, a decade ago, a man was cured of a brain tumour by praying to Bradburne. Now, with the support of the Archbishop of Harare they have raised the money to fund a Vatican investigation to justify his canonisation. Bradburne was born in Westmorland in 1921, he was the son of an Anglican rector. He fought in World War II with the 9th Gurkha Rifles, escaping Singapore when it was invaded by the Japanese in 1942 and was recommended for the Military Cross.  He took a boat to try to reach British-controlled territory, but was shipwrecked. He eventually made it to India, and then returned to fight in Burma for the Chindits, After the war and wandered the world for 16 years, trying his hand at teaching and forestry, and as a stoker on a steam ship.

Vets had to stitch up the hole to deflate Trevor and stop his body filling with air like a balloon. Dramatic X-rays show the enlarged outline of his body, inflated by the leak. Owner Fran Jennings, 49, from Lymm, Cheshire, said: We came down and found Trevor in a bad state, he literally looked like he\u0027d blown up like a balloon and we had no idea what had happened.  He was three times the size he should\u0027ve been. We put him straight in the car and took him to the 24-hour emergency vets and they had never seen anything quite like it. Vet Michelle Coward, of Beech House surgery, in Warrington, Cheshire, treated the four-year-old dachshund. She said: Every time he took a breath, some of the inhaled air escaped through a hole in his windpipe around the muscles and fatty tissue under the skin, and X-rays showed the emphysema was worsening. Surgery was the only way to repair the injury but due to its location, there was a significant risk of complications. I have never seen a case like this before and it was a new surgery for me. Fran\u0027s daughter Jessica said: When I saw Trevor, he looked like a big fat seal, his whole body was like a blob and you couldn\u0027t tell his face from his neck. Fran, a mum-of-three who runs Pets Animal Hotel, in Lymm, said she had no idea what caused the injury. Air was leaking out under his skin over his whole body, even causing his heart to lift off his sternum, she said.  Whatever it was, it affected his breathing so we had to leave him there while they tried to find out what was wrong, she said. Vets discovered a hole in his windpipe which had to be stitched up before the handsome dog could be deflated. Trevor was kept in while tests were carried out and he was diagnosed with sub-cutaneous emphysema - an abnormal collection of air under the skin in the lowest level of the skin\u0027s tissues and muscles known as the subcutis or hyperdermis. Vet Michelle, who works for the Willows Veterinary Group, said: Trevor was presented to us with signs of severe air ingress under the skin. There were no external injuries that would explain how air had got under the skin, so we suspected that an internal injury to the airway or oesophagus could have been allowing the air to leak into the body. Trevor\u0027s surgery went well, he made a quick recovery and was monitored in the hospital. When he came back for his check-ups following the surgery he was very bouncy and happy. He\u0027s a great character and everybody loves him. He was a pleasure to nurse. It was certainly an interesting case and one that is unusual as far as I understand. There should not be any long-term impact to Trevor\u0027s health.  Fran\u0027s daughter, Jessica, who shows sausage dogs at Crufts and helps run the family business said: It was horrible seeing him like that, we had to deflate the air out of him, it was weird.

She spent hours outside scrubbing to get it all ready for the summer, but when she came back inside she realised she had missed a spot on her back where her t-shirt had pulled up. She was bright red and in a lot of pain, so decided to go and see her GP. He told her the sunburn wasn\u0027t anything to worry about, but he was concerned about a mole on her back and sent her to the hospital for tests. After several tests and biopsies Lauryn, who lives in south Wales, was given the devastating news that it was skin cancer.  She said: My whole life just turned upside down. I cried for days. I was thinking I\u0027m 29, I don\u0027t have kids, I haven\u0027t even started my life yet and I\u0027m going to lose it. It was really really hard for quite a long time. She said:  However she was surprised by the response when she started telling people she had cancer, and she\u0027s worried people don\u0027t take it seriously. She said: People were like \u0027oh well, you\u0027ve got skin cancer, you\u0027ll be alright\u0027. People look at my scars and say \u0027is that is?\u0027. But what you see on the outside, it\u0027s five times bigger under the skin. They really need to know that it\u0027s serious.  Moles do change and people don\u0027t really pay attention. They\u0027re so scared to go to the doctor but if it\u0027s a bad result it\u0027s so much better to be in the hospital two or three months earlier. Sun burn actually saved my life. You don\u0027t look at your back much so you don\u0027t really notice them changing. That\u0027s why I\u0027m here and alive. I was extremely lucky. If you catch it early enough you can still have a life and do all the things you enjoy. In the eight years since her diagnoses Lauryn has received excellent support and care from a number of hospitals and charities.  But it\u0027s Macmillan which has really supported her and her family, so she was determined to give something back. She started running to release stress and before long she had completed in a number events. But she decided that just wasn\u0027t enough. She said: It just spiralled out of control. She set herself the challenge of doing 40 events before she turned 40, but it quickly escalated to the 52 in 52 Challenge - where you take on 52 events in a year.

Warm and humid air will be centred over the UK for several days, pulling in brighter weather to the north west but more volatile stormy conditions further south. The Met Office have put a yellow warning in place from 11am on Thursday until midnight across the midlands, London, Wales and the south west. On Friday the warning extends to Northern Ireland as well as Yorkshire and the north west and will remain in place until 9pm.  Lightning strikes, flash floods and strong winds could result in power cuts, damage to buildings and travel disruption. The Met Office warned: There is the potential for 30-40 mm of rain to fall in an hour and perhaps as much as 60-80 mm in 2-3 hours. Flooding of homes and businesses could happen quickly, with damage to some buildings from floodwater, lightning strikes, hail or strong winds. Fast flowing or deep floodwater is possible, causing a danger to life. Spray and sudden flooding could lead to difficult driving conditions and some road closures and where flooding or lightning strikes occur, there is a chance of delays and some cancellations to train and bus services. Power cuts might occur and other services to some homes and businesses could be lost. Some communities might become cut off if roads flood.    However, it looks like brighter conditions could extend across much of the country by the weekend with temperatures reaching the mid-20s. There will still be the prospect of thundery showers, especially in the south, and it will remain less warm in the east. But the rest of the country should stay dry with long bright spells. A spokesperson for The Weather Channel said: A weak pressure pattern will result in a showery outlook for central and southern Britain with thunderstorms but there will be some good spells of sunshine between the showers. The best of the sunshine and dry weather will be across the north. It should be generally fine into the early part of June, but there is a chance that cooler conditions could arrive by the middle of the month.

A shocking video has emerged of the two women in a physical fight, with one of them being pushed onto the floor in the street as punches and kicks are launched. One calls the other a s**t during the bizarre altercation which has been viewed more than 1.5 million times in the last 24 hours after it was published on social media. The incident took place in Shildon, County Durham on Sunday afternoon and the footage was recorded by John Canty. One woman was arrested on suspicion of assault during the incident but released without charge, police confirmed. The clip begins with the two females known as \u0027Black Juicy\u0027 and Lizzie in the middle of an argument on the street.  The brunette woman, Black Juicy, stands at the door of her house shouting at the blonde female, Lizzie. Lizzie then lifts up her pink strapless playsuit to show her bottom to Black Juicy and mockingly twerks in front of her. In response to this, Black Juicy shouts at Lizzie and calls her a s**t, an utter s**t before picking up her mug of tea. Lizzie then hurls inaudible abuse at Black Juicy and pushes her with both of her hands into her house. Black Juicy retaliates and throws her mug of tea at Lizzie\u0027s face, who manages to kung-fu punch the cup away from her face.  This astonishing feat is shown in slow motion again in the video. The two women then return to physically fighting each other and slap each other in the face.. Black Juicy then grabs Lizzie by her pig-tails, putting her in a headlock whilst the two geordie lasses continue punching each other. As the incident continues, Lizzie falls dramatically onto the street and as she does this, Black Juicy briefly forgets about her and starts shouting at a neighbour saying I\u0027m sick of you. Lizzie exploits this momentary distraction and pushes Black Juicy so she falls face first onto the ground. Black Juicy starts to pick herself up and Lizzie screams go on before Black Juicy retaliates saying you stupid little s**g as she lifts up her trousers.

Mari Llewellyn, 24, originally from Wales, weighed 17st 5lb before she radically changed her lifestyle and started eating cleaner food. “I’ve learnt what food is nutritional for my body, she explained. I eat more than I did then and some people are surprised by how much I weigh but it’s because I’m tall and I’ve built muscle. Mari, who moved from Newport to New York, US, when she was 10 years old, took up weight lifting as well as adopting a disciplined diet.  She originally started eating a bodybuilder’s diet which was full of high protein food such as chicken and eggs, Wales Online reports. But now, she eats a diet that’s higher in fat. Today, the 5ft 11in fitness blogger weighs a healthy 12st and works out six days a week. In just over a year, she lost 170 pounds – or 5st 3lb. She shares her progress on Instagram, YouTube and her fitness blog, Mari Easy Fitness, and has attracted tens of thousands of followers. Mari said: “It all started when I was in my final year of university. “I struggled with depression and anxiety and I ended up having to drop out and move back home for a bit. That’s when I started to eat lots of pizzas and unhealthy food.  “I decided to make small changes, like eating cleaner food and my boyfriend was really into bodybuilding, so I started to get into the gym. “I went from hating the gym to loving it. Seeing my body change motivated me more.” She added: I taught myself a lot about the gym. I was doing a lot of the same exercises as my boyfriend but then I learnt how to do things that I wanted to do like tone my butt.” Mari, who recently completed her degree in fashion and retail in Philadelphia, has also released fitness programmes called Fit with Mari and a resistance band which sold out online. “It’s something I love doing and I’m doing it full time at the moment,” she continued.  “People think being a social media influencer is easy and all you have to do is post a few photos, but it’s hard work. “I’ve also used some of the things I learnt [at university] which I didn’t think I would do. I had to work on the sizes and the designs and work with prototypes.” Mari puts part of her social media success down to being an ordinary woman who has worked hard for her body. “When you go on Instagram, it can be scary because it’s just full of beautiful women,” she said. “But I think more people can relate to me because I did use to be overweight.

Laura Watson claims the small child can be seen with his hand on her son’s shoulder in the creepy image. The family had been enjoying a picnic at the Plessey Woods Park last weekend when Laura took some pictures of her daughter Charlotte Hill, 15, and son Byrin Watson, nine, climbing a tree with their cousin Jack, 16. However, medical receptionist Laura was left “terrified” when she later discovered the face of another child had appeared behind Byrin, despite no one else being near them in the park at the time.   While originally sceptical of anything to do with ghosts and the paranormal, Laura says the picture has changed her mind as the boy is so clear.  She now wants to return to the woods as the figure has sparked her interest in ghosts but admits she hopes the apparition doesn\u0027t “follow them home”. Laura, from Newcastle, said: It\u0027s very unusual and everyone is really freaked out. Me and my daughter couldn\u0027t even go to sleep last night because we were so scared. My husband is on night shifts and I was alone and I was like \u0027oh God\u0027. I was terrified in case anything had followed us back.  I\u0027ve had people on our Facebook saying they are going to send me prayers.  I didn\u0027t believe in anything like that until I saw this for myself.  Laura had been enjoying the sun with her mum, dad and sister, along with her two children and her niece and nephew when they decided to walk the dogs after finishing their picnic.   On the way back the youngsters came across the large tree and began to climb it - prompting Laura to get out her camera. Laura said: There was no one behind the tree, my daughter or my nephew would have seen them. There was nobody there. There was only us there. It\u0027s very, very bizarre. When I got home I put the picture on the computer and when it zoomed in and I was able to see it closer, I thought what is that thing behind Byrin? When I zoomed in further I could see a face. But I was like \u0027but there was nobody there!\u0027 It looks like a child to me, I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s a girl or a boy. But I can see this face and it looks like the hand is on my son\u0027s shoulder, which is very bizarre. Some people have said I must have Photoshopped it as they can\u0027t believe it. But I\u0027ve explained that I wouldn\u0027t even have a clue how to do anything like that.  It was literally taken on a phone. I\u0027m rubbish with technology and I\u0027m just not the kind of person to do that. There\u0027s no way that is anything but what it is - you can basically see a face. For someone to be that close to my son, if it was another child, he would have noticed them. I would have seen them and I wouldn\u0027t have taken a picture with another kid behind him. Many have speculated what the figure could be with some suggesting it might be the spirit of a boy who drowned in the woods years ago. Laura said: I don\u0027t know much about the history of the woods but some people are saying that many moons ago a young boy drowned in the river. You don\u0027t know if it\u0027s just hearsay. People are asking if Byrin had a twin and if he died but he had nothing like that. I\u0027ve not had any kids die in my family so it couldn\u0027t be anyone that I know. It certainly isn\u0027t something that I\u0027m familiar with. I\u0027ve never, ever experienced anything like it in my life. It was just a normal day. It was lovely hot day and we were just having fun.

A dad-of-three who tried to help Andrew Westlake moments before the fatal fall was left so shaken by what he witnessed he had to see a doctor after returning home. He is still haunted by Andrew\u0027s last moments in which he looked sad and desperate. The dad, his partner and their three children - aged two, four and six - were queueing to check in for a flight when the horrifying incident unfolded at Dalaman Airport. Tourists said Andrew, 30, jumped over a glass barrier and plunged about 50ft from a balcony, telling a witness as he lay dying that he just wanted it to end. His family have said he was on his first family holiday since the birth of his daughter.   Andrew, from the Annfield Plain area of Co Durham, had reportedly been waiting three days for a flight home after losing his ticket, and had allegedly been removed from a Jet2 plane shortly before the fatal fall.  It is understood he had been on holiday in south-western Turkey with his partner and one-year-old daughter, but was alone when he fell around 3.30am local time on Tuesday. The 34-year-old dad who tried to help Andrew went to see a doctor on Wednesday because he\u0027s been left so distressed, his partner told .  The woman, 29, added: He hasn\u0027t slept. He\u0027s been sick constantly and he can\u0027t even eat anything. The doctor has given him some sleeping tablets and told him not to go into work. She said they had to carefully explain the incident to their three young children and shield them from the grim details. She added: My six-year-old daughter was asking what happened to [the man]. I haven\u0027t told her. I just said he\u0027s hurt his leg and he has to go to hospital to fix it.  The woman said the family, from Watford, were at the back of a queue for a Thomas Cook Airlines flight to Stansted Airport in Essex when they heard a loud noise. She said they turned around and saw the man on the floor after he had apparently run into the barrier. She added: My partner said \u0027Are you OK\u0027 and tried to give him a hand, but he didn\u0027t speak. My partner watched him stand back up and he backed away from the barrier and then just ran for it and hopped over straight down onto the floor below. Initially, I think he tried to do it before but he hit the glass barrier - the noise that we heard - and fell, and then tried again.  When my partner helped him up he looked so sad and lost. The image that my partner still has in his head is the man looking so desperate. The woman said she called out to Andrew as he lay on the floor below, and frantically alerted airline and airport staff as dozens of Brits were gathered for flights home to Stansted and Birmingham. She said of Andrew: He was looking up at me and ... he was talking but I couldn\u0027t hear what he was saying. He was too far down to hear anything. Everyone was in shock. She said the man had his passport but he was not carrying any luggage.  A doctor eventually arrived to help the man and paramedics later took him away in an ambulance, she added. Another holidaymaker said a Thomas Cook Airlines worker, who rushed to Andrew\u0027s aid, told her that he said he just wanted it to end as he lay dying. The 23-year-old woman, from Hertfordshire, told  that her 24-year-old boyfriend was one of the first to reach the Brit after he plunged from a ledge inside the terminal. The woman, who was also preparing for the flight to Stansted, said: Everybody was queued up and just behind us was a ledge, with a glass wall, going down to the floor. He jumped over the ledge.  My partner went down there with someone else to see if he was OK. He was still conscious when they got down there, he was still moving and he was responding to them, but he was a bit out of it. The woman said a Thomas Cook Airlines worker appeared to be the first person to reach Andrew as he lay on the floor. The woman added: When we spoke to the airline representative who went down there, she said that he was saying to her that he just wanted it to end. She didn\u0027t know what he meant by it. She added: It was very traumatising for everyone that was there, especially my partner. Everyone was so in shock. The airline worker was great, she was down there super quick.  The airport security, all of them were just standing there. No one else responded to it quickly. After falling from the ledge, Andrew was treated at the scene and rushed to a private hospital, where he died of his injuries, it was said. Turkish media reported that he had suffered fatal injuries after falling from the exit of a plane and landing on the tarmac. But witnesses said those reports were inaccurate and that he plunged to his death inside the terminal. Turkish media reported that he had lost his ticket and spent three days waiting for a flight back to the UK. When he was finally due to fly home, he was removed from a plane over flight safety concerns and prevented from travelling, the reports added. Andrew had boarded the flight around 3am but was ordered off the plane after he got into an argument with cabin crew, according to reports  Witnesses said his unkempt appearance suggested he may have been at the airport for some time. The holidaymaker from Hertfordshire added: He didn\u0027t look in the best of ways. His clothes were quite dirty. The woman from Watford added: He was dirty. There was another lady there that said he had lost his ticket and was trying to get home. She said he walked past her and ... he might have been sleeping rough.  Andrew\u0027s Facebook page stated that he was from Stanley in Co Durham and had previously worked as a roofer and at Clayton Glass, in Annfield Plain.  The tourists said they decided to speak out about the incident because they want to correct the initial media reports, and they want the man\u0027s family and friends in the UK to know what happened before his death. Reports claimed Andrew had been removed from a Jet2 plane shortly before he fell to his death, but the Leeds-based holiday firm declined to provide details about whether he was prevented from travelling.

Remarkable pictures show a skeleton pinned beneath the stone.  The impact crushed the top of the man\u0027s body. His head might still be buried beneath the block of stone. It appears that the man survived the first phase of the eruption and fled along an alley. But there he was hit by the massive stone block -- perhaps a doorjamb -- possibly hurled at him by the force of the pyroclastic flow. According to CNN, Massimo Osanna, general director of the Archaeological Park of Pompeii, said: This discovery has shown the leaps in the archaeological field.

UK tourists have told of their horror after watching the man fall to his death at Dalaman Airport as they prepared to fly home following beach holidays. A holidaymaker said the dying man, named by his devastated family as Andrew Westlake, 30, from Annfield Plain in Co Durham, told a Thomas Cook Airlines worker, who rushed to his aid, that he just wanted it to end. Andrew had reportedly been waiting three days for a flight home after losing his ticket, and had allegedly been removed from a Jet2 plane shortly before the incident. He had been on holiday in south-western Turkey with his girlfriend and one-year-old daughter - their first family holiday together - and members of his partner\u0027s family, but was alone when he fell.  His aunt, Pauline Butler, told ChronicleLive that her family was notified of Andrew\u0027s death by Durham police on Tuesday, but they haven\u0027t been told exactly how he died. She said Andrew\u0027s grief-stricken mother June, 54, is heartbroken and can barely speak. Family members had been reading news reports and contacting witnesses who wrote about the incident on Facebook to learn more. Multiple witnesses told  that initial Turkish media reports - that Andrew died after falling from a plane\u0027s exit onto the tarmac - were not true. A 29-year-old woman from Watford, who was flying back to the UK with her 34-year-old partner and their three children, aged two, four and six, said the incident happened inside the terminal around 3.30am local time on Tuesday. The family were among dozens of Britons queuing to check in for flights to Stansted Airport in Essex and Birmingham when they heard a loud noise as the man apparently ran and crashed into a glass barrier of a balcony.  The woman, who was preparing for a delayed Thomas Cook Airlines flight to Stansted, said they turned around and saw the man on the floor near the barrier just behind them. She added: My partner said \u0027Are you OK\u0027 and tried to give him a hand, but he didn\u0027t speak. My partner watched him stand back up and he backed away from the barrier and then just ran for it and hopped over straight down onto the floor below. Initially, I think he tried to do it before but he hit the glass barrier - the noise that we heard - and fell, and then tried again. When my partner helped him up he looked so sad and lost. The image that my partner still has in his head is the man looking so desperate. She called out to him and alerted airline staff as he lay on the floor about 50ft below and people rushed to help him. The woman also called out to airport staff, but it appeared they didn\u0027t understand English, she added. She said of the Brit who fell: He was looking up at me and ... he was talking but I couldn\u0027t hear what he was saying. He was too far down to hear anything. Everyone was in shock.  She said the man had his passport but he was not carrying any luggage. A doctor eventually arrived to help the man and paramedics later took him away in an ambulance, she added. An image posted online and verified by witnesses shows the moment Andrew went over the glass barrier. A 23-year-old woman from Hertfordshire told  that her 24-year-old boyfriend was one of the first to reach the Brit after he plunged from a ledge inside the terminal. The woman, who was also preparing for the flight to Stansted, said: Everybody was queued up and just behind us was a ledge, with a glass wall, going down to the floor. He jumped over the ledge. My partner went down there with someone else to see if he was OK.  He was still conscious when they got down there, he was still moving and he was responding to them, but he was a bit out of it. The woman said a Thomas Cook Airlines worker appeared to be the first person to reach Andrew as he lay on the floor. The woman added: When we spoke to the airline representative who went down there, she said that he was saying to her that he just wanted it to end. She didn\u0027t know what he meant by it. She added: It was very traumatising for everyone that was there, especially my partner. Everyone was so in shock. The airline worker was great, she was down there super quick. The airport security, all of them were just standing there. No one else responded to it quickly. After falling from the ledge, Andrew was treated at the scene and rushed to a private hospital, where he died of his injuries, it was said. Turkish media reported that he had lost his ticket and spent three days at the airport waiting for a flight back to the UK.  When he was finally due to fly home, he was removed from a plane over flight safety concerns and prevented from travelling, the reports added. Andrew had boarded the flight around 3am but was ordered off the plane after he got into an argument with cabin crew, according to reports. Witnesses said his unkempt appearance suggested he may have been at the airport for some time. The holidaymaker from Hertfordshire added: He didn\u0027t look in the best of ways. His clothes were quite dirty. The woman from Watford added: He was dirty. There was another lady there that said he had lost his ticket and was trying to get home. She said he walked past her and ... he might have been sleeping rough. Andrew\u0027s Facebook page stated that he had previously worked as a roofer and at Clayton Glass in Annfield Plain, where he grew up with four siblings. His aunt Pauline, 67, said relatives are still in the dark over how he died. She added: We really don’t know what to think. His mum is absolutely devastated. They were very close.

Bill Browder told  he believes the Russian president is abusing international law in a desperate attempt to kill him.  He found himself at the centre of an international storm this morning when he was taken into custody, amid fears he could be extradited to Russia - where he believes he would be murdered.  The hedge fund manager has successfully lobbied for tough sanctions against Russia following the death of his lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, in a Russian prison in 2009. Mr Magnitsky exposed a \u0026pound174 million corruption ring involving senior officials - allegedly including Putin himself - and was reportedly tortured before he died. Since his death, Mr Browder has lobbied countries across the world to bring in sanctions against those involved - and defiantly said Putin\u0027s strong-arm tactics will not intimidate him.  Mr Browder said Putin is desperate to silence him - and the Russian leader has in the past even gone as far as accusing him of being a \u0027serial killer\u0027. The businessman, 54, one of the Kremlin\u0027s most high-profile public enemies, was released this morning, less than two hours after his arrest. After returning to London he told : It is clear that Russia is abusing Interpol and using all their tools to get me back to Russia to kill me. He had been due to meet a Spanish prosecutor to discuss Russian corruption when the manager at the hotel he was staying in and two cops appeared at his door. The businessman recounted: I wasn\u0027t 100% sure they were police officers, they didn\u0027t show me any ID, and when I said can I call my lawyer they said no. I thought I was being kidnapped. After quickly gathering his belongings, Mr Browder was put in the back of a police car, fearing for his life. Convinced he was in danger, he tweeted a picture from the back of the car, alongside the words: In the back of the Spanish police car going to the station on the Russian arrest warrant. They won’t tell me which station.  The officers, who spoke little English, initially tried to stop outside a building which wasn\u0027t a police station, he said, telling him it was procedure to see a doctor first. We had a standoff and they eventually took me to a police station, he stated. It was only when I got there that I realised it wasn\u0027t a kidnapping, I was relieved. He added: I thought I\u0027d been very careful about avoiding these situations, but they\u0027d finally got me. When he arrived at the Madrid police station, he was finally shown an Interpol warrant saying he was accused of fraud in Russia. But, he said, he was allowed to leave after senior figures within Interpol confirmed to local police that the warrant was not valid.  When it got to the higher levels of Interpol, I was allowed to leave, he said. And he believes it is part of a concerted effort to intimidate him. Every time a Magnitsky Act gets passed, Russia puts me on the Interpol list, he stated. Mr Browder received a phone call from British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in the aftermath, with Mr Johnson expressing his relief at his release.  The cabinet member later tweeted: Just spoken to Bill Browder – very glad that he has now been released. Moscow should concentrate on bringing those responsible for the murder of Magnitsky  to justice.  Mr Browder has been sentenced to 18 years in prison in his absence on fraud charges by a Russian court - charges which he dismisses as ludicrous. He said: I assume it\u0027s the same allegation, but it could be new allegations, there\u0027s no shortage of creativity in the Russian police.  They want to get me into a Russian prison. Killing me in the west would create a huge backlash, but they could do it quietly in a Russian prison and have plausible deniability. Mr Browder said: Putin is very angry with me, he doesn\u0027t like people who find ways of creating consequences for him. Mr Magnitsky was allegedly tortured in prison after reportedly being convicted on false charges. In 2012 US President Barack Obama signed the Magnitsky Act, a law to punish Russian human rights violators, into law after lobbying by Mr Browder. And two years later the European Parliament voted in favour of sanctions against 30 Russians alleged to be involved in the Magnitsky case.  There are now seven countries with Magnitsky laws in place, including the UK, with sanctions on Russian oligarchs given royal assent last week. And Mr Browder alleged that Putin is personally affected each time a Magnitsky Act is passed. He is an an extremely rich man, he has a fortune of around $200 million which he keeps in the west, he said. Each time an act is passed, it puts his own fortune at risk. He personally sent an emissary to Trump Tower (calling for the act to be repealed), this shows how he feels about it. We know he was a recipient in the crime which Sergei was killed over.  Despite fears for his own safety, Mr Browder remains defiant, stating: I\u0027m single-mindedly dedicating my life to getting justice for Sergei, I\u0027m not going to let them get away with it. It won\u0027t affect me in any way, I\u0027m carrying on. He is due to address the Danish parliament next week, and is confident that Magnitsky Act laws can be passed in seven more countries. I think talking about this so publicly is my biggest security, he said. People who are unknown and enemies of the Putin regime are dying in great numbers.

It’s definitely significant.“It’s across the whole ward. I’ve also had reports from the Charleston and Wellbank areas.”Mr Malone added: “There’s nothing to suggest at the moment that it’s anything to do with cleanliness.“I raised concerns about vermin when the new bins were rolled out last year.“Council officers are aware of it and they’re going up to take a look and see if they can find out what’s causing it.“Hopefully other councillors will keep a close eye on their wards to stop any further outbreak.”Brian Baird, operations manager for Eliminate – a pest control service which works in Dundee – said the most likely cause of the infestations was the rats having a plentiful food source.He said: “The usual reasons for them being in an area would be a food source – obviously around places such as takeaways that deal with food a lot or if there was somewhere else that food had been left.“The best thing to do to try to prevent rats is just general housekeeping – being vigilant.”Mr Baird also warned people not to ignore signs of rats because there are a number of illnesses that can be passed on to humans through the rodents’ urine or faeces, notably Weil’s disease.Weil’s disease is a form of a bacterial infection also known as leptospirosis that is carried by animals, most commonly rats and cattle.A spokesman for Dundee City Council said: “Pest control officers have attended the site and will revisit later today for further investigation and action where necessary.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b0d1f489e53b-478x564.jpg ","title":"clarks goals can leave dundee united in good nick ex teammate believes","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHis allegiances these days lie on the other side of the street but Bobby Mann looked on with approving interest as Dundee United fixed up lower division scoring machine Nicky Clark last week.As well the fact he’d like to see his home city back with two Premiership clubs, the former Dundee defender’s attention was sparked by the fact he’s a former team-mate of the new Tangerines striker.And he believes he’s exactly the type Csaba Laszlo needs to get United to the top flight.After leaving Dens Park in 2007, Bobby joined Peterhead and it was during his time at Balmoor his and Clark’s paths crossed.He’s quick to point out, though, back then the there was little indication the teenager he first saw in action would go on to get the goals he has.“I remember him coming to Peterhead, on loan from Aberdeen and then being signed up when he was released by them,” he said.“With us he wasn’t a striker but operated in midfield. He was obviously an attacking player and I think he scored a few goals but he never played right up front.“That might have been because he was young and, when he first arrived, Aberdeen just wanted him getting games. Because we had Martin Bavidge as the main striker, he wasn’t going to get in the team right up top.“Saying that, I’m pretty sure Nicky regarded himself as a midfielder back then and I don’t think there was any thought of moving him forward.”After two seasons and eight goals, Clark moved on from the Blue Toon to Queen of the South in 2011 and, in terms of goals, has never looked back.Whether it was having former Rangers and Hearts front man Sandy as his father, or the foresight of someone at Palmerston, Bobby acknowledged the decision to make him into a striker was a masterstroke.“His dad has obviously had an influence on his career and he might have pushed for him to go up front, or maybe it was just something someone else saw in him that made them think they should give it a try. Either way, it was a great move for him and a player that gets the goals he does is probably just what United need right now.”The fact Clark is a player who knows the Championship well, having played there for Queens, Rangers and now Dunfermline, is a big plus.United now have a few members of their squad who are used to the rigours of the second tier and, for Bobby, that’s the way to go.“When I played in the lower divisions, the teams who were successful were usually ones who had players who knew the league.“United have brought in Nicky and, assuming he’s back fit for next season, they’ll have James Keatings just behind the main striker.“I thought he was a very good signing when he joined up last summer but the season was ruined by injuries. If he’s back, though, you are talking about a player who’s got goals at that level for quite a few clubs now.“These are the type you want – once you go up you worry about a team for the league above.“If you build a team for the league you’re in and get out of it, you find a few of the boys you did bring in are capable of doing well at a higher level.“Some won’t be and will have to be replaced but you are always going to want to freshen the squad each year.“With Nicky, only time will tell how he does if United get back to the Premiership, but he’s a proven scorer in the Championship and, right now, that’s the most important thing.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/03/5abe00fa671c1-848x564.jpg ","title":"confirmed dundee rename dens park","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee FC have completed a historic deal to rename Dens Park in a sponsorship deal.As the Tele exclusively revealed last week, the ground will now be officially known as Kilmac Stadium at Dens Park for the next two years, when the Dark Blues hope to have moved into a new stadium beside Camperdown Park.Managing Director John Nelms said: “We are always looking for new unique revenue streams and this is a fantastic opportunity for the club and it makes it even better that it is with Richard and Kilmac who are and have been lifelong supporters of the club.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5b0d1e2cc7499.jpg ","title":"dundee council calls last orders on pub after revoking its licence","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee licensing chiefs have called last orders on a Hilltown pub after revoking its licence to trade.Boyds Bar closed its doors suddenly earlier this month, having been trading at the Rosebank Street premises for nearly a year.A spokeswoman for Dundee City Council confirmed that the licence for the venue had been revoked as there was no designated manager at the premises.The pub has gone through as many as four owners in recent years.Previously called McAdams Bar, it was rebranded Boyds Bar earlier this year.Events including a medium night had been held at the pub as recently as last month.One former patron claimed the pub had “barrels” of potential, saying: “I’m aware that the premises have changed hands a number of times in recent years.“It was called Boyds Bar for a number of years before it was changed to McAdams and rebranded Boyds Bar.“It’s always sad to see a pub close but I was aware it had been struggling to make a go of it.“Given the right management it still has barrels of potential to be a great local for residents.”The closure comes amid tough trading conditions for Hilltown pubs after The High Corner on neighbouring Kinghorne Road failed to attract new suitors following its closure last year.Janet Hood, who runs Janet Hood Consulting and represents publicans in licensing cases, said any change to a designated manager within a public house would require the owner of the business to notify the licensing board within seven days.She said: “Not knowing the full circumstances of this particular case, it is hard to ascertain what exactly has happened.“You have to have a designated manager – that is the law.“There could be a number of reasons to change the designated manager, whether the person is sacked, loses their personal licence or passes away.“As long as you notify the licensing board within seven days you have six weeks to replace the person or you are no longer allowed to trade.“I tell all my clients for all intents and purposes to have two personal licence holders at all times.

She will tell you the rest\u0026#8230Hi, my name is Kirstie Macrae.I am eight years old and I love writing stories.It all started on a Friday at show ‘n’ tell week at school.I had written a book and my primary two teacher loved my story.A year later, when I was in primary three, an author called Pamela Butchart came to the school and signed my book.I thought about her for a few days and realised that I wanted to be an author when I grow up.I started to write stories about fruit. My first one was about Banana being very serious but Orange wanting to have a party.Banana was furious when he came home and Orange had all the fruit and vegetables over for a party.Orange had to say sorry.I also did all the drawings for my book and my Grandad Kelly said it was brilliant.My school is Newport Primary and I am very lucky to have great friends – Zerah, Eva, Darcey, Ava-Ruth and all my classmates.They love getting to hear my stories at homework sharing time every week.Just now, I am writing stories about my class. I put jokes in too.Sometimes people don’t laugh but my mum/editor says this happens all the time, even to comedians, so I shouldn’t let it bother me.My first class story was about how we were all kidnapped and there were no teachers around so the pupils saved the day.My second story was about how we lost someone and I found him and saved the day.In my third story, we were all locked in and had to be saved by the primary ones.My next story will be called “Chaotic Classroom”. I think you know what happens there!I have been inspired by lots of different people including Pamela Butchart, Roald Dahl, my brother Conor, who is 10, David Walliams and my classmates.My dad always shows me comics and tells me all about the Marvel Universe. I love these films.Even though I am only writing small stories, the good thing is that I’m learning all the time.Even great authors make mistakes and all you have to do is fix them.When I am older and have written some books, I hope you will read one of them.I had a great time telling you all about my love of writing.Thank you for reading my column.

I am very impressed by your penguin designs and delighted to hear that they were inspired by watching Blue Planet II. How fabulous that they were chosen for the sculptures and for such a worthy cause.“Congratulations and thank you for writing to let me know. With best wishes, David Attenborough.”Rebecca, who is a massive fan of Sir David’s nature programmes, said, “I was very excited to receive the letter as I didn’t expect a reply.“I felt honoured as I know he’s very busy. It was very nice of him to take the time to read my letter and respond.”Rebecca said that after watching Blue Planet II she wanted to raise awareness about plastic polluting the world’s oceans and she hopes her design will show the “good side and the bad side” of the sea.“I hope people who come to see the High School penguin like the design but can also take away a deeper message,” she added.Rebecca’s winning design is being painted on to the blank sculpture by F6 pupils Morven Wright, Joanna Brunton and Lily Bircham . After being given its make-over, the statue will then join 79 others on display on the streets of Dundee and beyond from June 29th in the Penguin Parade, a charity public art event that aims to raise enough money to fund the Maggie’s Centre Dundee for a year.And the entire High School community is getting behind the campaign. In addition to the design contest, the School has also already staged a Bingo Night and held a Penguin Day in the Junior Years and Nursery, with more fundraising events to come.The school’s Charities and Community Outreach Co-ordinator, Karlene Douglas, said, “Rebecca’s entry was chosen as the winning design for our penguin sculpture because it is both visually stunning and incorporates an important environmental message about our planet.“David Attenborough’s documentary series was a crucial inspiration to Rebecca’s design and so as a school we were delighted when he responded to Rebecca’s letter, congratulating her on winning the competition.“We are proud to support the Maggie’s Penguin Parade and look forward to seeing our finished sculpture outside the school gates.”Maggie’s Centres provide free practical, social and emotional support for people with cancer and their families and friends.

I would imagine that should the move to ‘Nou Campy’ (the club’s proposed new stadium) happen, that will also follow suit with a stadium sponsor.”Fellow fan Garry Joiner, of Dunfermline, wrote: “Football is no longer a sport, it is a business and needs to operate as one.“A name change will have no fundamental impact on Dens Park to those who have always known it as Dens Park.”Richard Gennies, who’s based in Jakarta, backed sponsorship but insisted the stadium would “always be known as Dens Park no matter what the sign says”.Another fan who also backs the move wrote: “If the name change brings in ongoing cash investment it must be a good thing for the club.“It would be good to retain Dens in the name.”One supporter suggested the name “Kilmac Dens Park” and others said they would support the move if “Dens” was incorporated.However, others hit out at the sponsorship idea.One fan wrote: “What good would changing the name do? All it would do is annoy the loyal fans who go to Dens week in, week out.”Jasen Niblo, from Birkhill, said he didn’t like the fact the move was “all about money” and urged the club to keep the name.Another fan cautioned the club against inviting any food-related sponsors, saying: “As long as it doesn’t sound as bad as the Tony Macaroni Arena (in Livingston) we might live with it.”Graham Pert, from Whitfield, added: “I’m all up for things that will be great for the club but at this stage I think it would be sad to see the name changed from Dens Park.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7590066.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7608211.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Chris Cadden cheered Scotland on against England last summer -

Public consultation followed with 328 nearby addresses contacted, prompting 104 formal responses.The report to the committee stressed that the brief \"does not seek to create competition between the two locations\".Stratton, it stated, \"has opportunity for larger footprint retail and community buildings whereas Ashton provides opportunity for education, park and higher density residential development\".The focus of development would be \"east Ashton\". The owners of the adjacent western part of Ashton Farm do not intend selling for development but to continue farming the land.Opportunities have been identified for improving public transport links, particularly for Inverness Campus users. Transport agency HiTrans will consider the provision of a new rail station at Seafield, the campus or Stratton.Discussions are underway with the college and Highlands and Islands Enterprise on the \"early delivery\" of sports facilities at the campus. A least one pitch plus associated buildings could cost \u0026pound4.7 million.The expansion also promises to include an upgrade to the busy Inshes roundabout layout.Planning officials are discussing road widening proposals with landowners. Council representatives will attend community council meetings in the coming months to assess local requirements.A 500-space park-and-ride facility was consented as part of the Stratton scheme.The report references a landowner who argued that the brief contradicts an existing development plan and \"fails to recognise Stratton and only refers to potential future development at Ashton Farm\".They also complained that the \"vision map does not reflect the original permission\u0027 town centre at Stratton or the development plan support for it\".Another considers \"Ashton centre\" to be \"an unreasonable competitor location to Stratton\" that \"undermines\" Stratton.It is unclear from the report what long-term employment would be created in the area \u0026ndash an issue raised historically by numerous city councillors who questioned council officials\u0026rsquo aspirations for growth.The report stated: \"Analysis identified that the optimum location for a new centre is at east Ashton.\"This location is, therefore, identified as the core area for new and existing communities to visit as a destination that has footfall generating uses including a new district park, high school and mixed-use centre that includes high-density residential uses.\"It emphasised that the Stratton site does not include provision for a district park or high school with community facilities like those at Inverness Royal Academy.The brief \"does not seek to create competition between Stratton and Ashton\", according to the development planning team.Public feedback has already established an aversion to more development in the area with calls for the focus to instead be on the city centre and brownfield sites, and concern that the recent demand for new homes could stall, leaving a surplus of residential properties.Other responses included a plea that \"pubs should not be allowed\".Smithton and Culloden Community Council chairman David McGrath welcomed the document, with a caveat that it improves access to the nearby Inverness Shopping Park with a short cut for existing residents.A spokesman for the Stratton developer Hazledene said: \"We don\u0026rsquot think it\u0027 appropriate that a competitor town centre should be introduced, as this would add uncertainty and confusion.\"These [Ashton] proposals are early stage proposals and we believe should not be given the same weight as the Stratton permissions already granted.

I think it will help support people\u0027 fond relationship with the river.\"While the final detail has still to be completed, a group of fishermen from Inverness Angling Club seemed relaxed as they studied the computer generated images.Club president Graham MacKenzie said: \"Around the hut is already a gathering place. It attracts local and visitor alike, and often the anglers act as unofficial guides for visitors. We have been co-operating on the project.\"Last autumn, the artists showed a specially commissioned film of the river at Inverness Railway Station and invited people to share their stories, views and reminiscences, said Highland Council which is backing the project.Mr Surtees added: \"The work aims to complement the river and people\u0027 relationship to it, to frame and invite others to appreciate it.\"A thin ribbon of stone starts as an access, becoming a path to run along for a child, a bench for reading a book, a viewing point up and down the river, a back-rest for looking across it.\"Professor Jim Mooney, chairman of the independent evaluation panel said: \"Our members were unanimous in their enthusiastic response to the reworked proposal.\"The panel was impressed by the expansion of the site to include the opposite bank and by the elegance and innovation embodied by the new design.\"It is our settled view that the proposed structure will greatly enhance the natural beauty and flow of the Ness and will attract locals and visitors alike to explore new ways of relating to and engaging with the river.\"Councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, chairwoman of the Inverness City Arts Working Group, said: \"It is pleasing to see how My Ness embraces both sides of the river and I am confident that it will enhance the location and be very well received by everyone.\"The River Ness Public Art Project which includes other smaller art work is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).

Inverness economist Tony Mackay has suggested that a trick was missed in the 2018/19 budget.In the wake of a plea from council leader Margaret Davidson for the public to lobby MPs and MSPs for an increased annual grant, Mr Mackay believes much more could already have been done.\"It needs to do more to balance income and expenditure,\" he said.\"I have friends in the council\u0027 finance department who tell me it should be possible to cut spending by a further 10 per cent to 15 per cent without a significant impact on services.\"Regarding expenditure, the two main categories are care and learning (\u0026pound430 million) and community services (\u0026pound117 million).

He pinpointed Neale and insisted he was an “outstanding” player who could walk into any top team in Europe.Still a teenager, Neale proved that in Munich.Willie said: “I have so many happy football memories of Neale, but also so many other great memories because he was such a great guy.”Neale made his Aberdeen first team debut on October 11 1980 in a 2-0 defeat of Kilmarnock at Pittodrie.He partnered Willie at centre-back in that game because Alex McLeish was out injured at the time.Willie said: “Neale broke through very early in his career and was just a wee lad.“He always had that talent and I think he had the eye on the sweeper’s position but I had to persuade him to move into midfield.“Neale and Neil Simpson were an absolutely magnificent combination.“Neale was an Aberdeen boy brought through and developed by the club and given the big chance to shine.“And he certainly did that.”Following that debut, Neale would go on to win two league titles, four Scottish Cups and the League Cup domestically.“Tattie” would add the European Cup Winners’ Cup and Super Cup in 1983 as an integral part of the only Scottish team to win two European trophies.His first trophy success came in 1982 with a 4-1 Scottish Cup win over Rangers after extra-time.With the Reds 3-1 up at Hampden, Neale, just 18, scored an iconic goal.He smashed a shot into an open net in front of the Rangers end, before punching the air \u0026#8230 and then doing a forward roll.Neale made 220 appearances for Aberdeen, scoring 10 goals, before transferring to top flight Aston Villa in 1986.He would go on to play for Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline Athletic and Ross County.In a successful managerial career, Neale guided Ross County through two successive promotions.As manager of Hartlepool he took the side to the play-offs for the second tier.Neale would also go on to manage Gillingham and Peterhead before returning to Hartlepool in the 2011-12 season.His final trophy success with Aberdeen was the Scottish Cup in 1986 – a 3-0 win over Hearts at Hampden.Fellow midfielder Jim Bett played alongside Neale in that cup final win.Jim, speaking from his home in Iceland, said: “Neale was a great guy to have in the dressing room as he was always upbeat and telling jokes.“He was a great footballer and also a great guy.“We played together in the Aberdeen team that won the Scottish Cup in 1986.“Alex Ferguson left the following season and that was the start of the team beginning to break up.“The boys who had played under Sir Alex had won everything and perhaps needed a new challenge.“Neale went down to Aston Villa and one or two others went elsewhere.“He played for a few other clubs but his heart was always in Aberdeen.”Neale signed schoolboy forms with Aberdeen under Billy McNeill in the 1977-78 season.He was such an exciting talent Neale made his debut for the Aberdeen reserves at the age of just 14.On turning 16, Neale was secured on a full-time contract at Pittodrie by Sir Alex Ferguson.He would go on to conquer Europe before he was out of his teens.Jim said: “It was some achievement for a player to come through the youth ranks at Aberdeen and then win European trophies.“Neale won everything domestically with Aberdeen and was a key part of that side that won two European trophies.“Alex Ferguson was a manager who gave young players a chance and at that time there were a few of them coming through at Pittodrie.“That was very fortunate for Aberdeen.“Neale went on to reach the heights with Aberdeen and lift European trophies.“It was fantastic to see a young player from the city go on to have so much success.“Neale achieved so much during his career.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/05/roadmap-632x564.jpg

almost three hours late – the full 156-seater plane tried to land at Dyce and had to quickly ascend due to thick fog – and the same happened when it tried again.The pilot then prepared a third landing

handed the plans for the skatepark a major boost last week, as the Marr area committee offered its support to BSG to pursue a lease for the land.On the committee vote, Russ said: “We’re absolutely delighted.“This is a major step forward for us.”The land is listed as “for the common good”, meaning that it is not owned by any party.Due to this, the BSG will have to seek permission from a sheriff to gain the lease, which requires a community consultation to be undertaken, and then to seek planning permission from Aberdeenshire Council.Russ, who has lived in Banchory for 10 years and has three children who all use the existing ramp, regularly updates the skaters in Banchory about the progress of the park.He said: “They’re all really excited about the prospect of the park, but of course,

squad.Shinnie, 26, earned a debut cap in Scotland’s 2-0 friendly loss to World Cup-bound Peru.Pittodrie captain Shinnie is in contention to face Mexico at the 87,000 sell-out Azteca Stadium on Sunday morning.Scotland begin the bid to reach Euro 2020 later this year with Nations League ties against Albania and Israel in September.Scotland legend Willie Miller believes Shinnie has the pressing game needed for those clashes.Reds’ defender Scott McKenna secured his third straight cap in starting in Lima but his handball led to the penalty for Peru’s opening goal.Miller said: “Shinnie can play in competitive games like Euro qualifiers.“He plays in an area where Scotland have a lot of players (midfield).“However, Shinnie brings a different dynamic to the midfield in terms of the way he plays.“He leads that pressing pack for Aberdeen and is the first one to try to win the ball back which is an important element of the modern-day game.“Particularly if you are looking to press the game and win the ball back early.“There are two games coming up against Israel and Albania where Scotland should be desperate to get the ball and have as much possession as they can.“Shinnie adds that dynamic of physical enthusiasm to the midfield that would serve Alex McLeish and Scotland well in top competitions.“He has plenty of experience as well.“The manager can only give him a chance and he has the experience so there is no reason why he cannot take it.”Shinnie was introduced as a second-half substitute for Hibs’ Dylan McGeouch with 15 minutes remaining.Shinnie had been in previous Scotland squads but had yet to be capped. He was an unused substitute in the 1-0 friendly loss to Holland at Pittodrie last November under then interim boss Malky Mackay.Dons great Miller, capped 65 times, said: “I am delighted that Shinnie has been given a chance as I see what he gives to Aberdeen.“He has been outstanding and is someone that leads by example.“You are talking about the captain of the team that have finished second in the Premiership in recent seasons and has played in cup finals.“Shinnie has also lifted the Scottish Cup with Inverness Caley Thistle.“You are not talking about an untested player and he deserves the opportunity to show he is good enough at international level.“Shinnie merits it for the station he holds within Scottish football and on performances.“He is definitely of a high enough standard.”Shinnie was one of seven players securing a debut Scotland cap in Lima. Peru extended their record unbeaten run to 13 games courtesy of goals either side of half-time from Christian Cueva and Jefferson Farfan.Dons defender McKenna played for 90 minutes. The 21-year-old’s hand ball conceded a penalty for the opener.It came from a blunder from debut keeper Jordan Archer where Farfan’s shot struck the Don’s elbow.Miller said: “The standard McKenna has set himself for a young lad is incredible.“He is still young and still learning the game.“Yet out of nowhere he has burst on to the international scene and looks as if he has been playing there for years.”Former Aberdeen midfielder Kenny McLean, who will return to parent club Norwich this summer, earned a fourth cap.Boss Alex McLeish praised the seven new caps for coping with the conditions.McLeish said: “I’m proud of the mentality they showed in a cauldron of a place.“They embraced it.“Bringing these guys into the team for the first time, they handled it really well.“It’s a squad where everybody deserves a cap.“It was hot out on the surface, especially when you’re doing a lot of chasing, which the Peruvians made us do.“Peru are a super team, they move it about well and know each other inside out.”McLeish’s depleted squad are set to be reduced further with some players leaving ahead of the friendly against Mexico.He said: “We’re going to lose a couple of players now.“Lewis Stevenson is going away.“We had an agreement with him to play the first game.“Matt Phillips is going back to England for an engagement there, which we agreed a couple of months ago.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 18","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/05/18, 11:38 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,According to a report that appeared in your edition of April 27, a traffic accident occurred on the A83 near Lochgair at 2.30pm on Saturday April 21.It is further reported that the A83 between Lochgilphead and Inveraray was closed to traffic \u0026#8216while investigations were carried out\u0026#8217 \u0026#8211 before re-opening \u0026#8216in the early hours of Sunday April 22\u0026#8217.Even if the early hours is taken to mean, say, 1am on the Sunday morning, this suggests the principal route for access to and egress from Mid Argyll and Kintyre \u0026#8211 as well as the  ferries \u0026#8211 was arbitrarily closed by police for some eleven and a half hours.I would like Police Scotland to explain why this was necessary.I well remember a retired police officer telling me that, in the days prior to Argyll entering the stranglehold of Strathclyde Police, the local superintendent would want to know the reason why if the scene of an accident was not re-opened to traffic within about 30 minutes.Police Scotland should understand that (a) the usual excuse (lengthy closures are necessary in order to gather information thought useful in prevention of similar accidents in the future) will not wash (b) perusal of any half-decent road map will reveal to Police Scotland that, unlike the central belt, Argyll does not have a multiplicity of short alternative routes suitable for use as diversions and (c) their one-size-fits-all approach is a negation of management.If Police Scotland is so keen to glean evidence relative to a traffic accident they might also look at actual or potential accidents resulting from these enormous diversions \u0026#8211 fatigued drivers \u0026#8211 drivers unfamiliar with diverted routes \u0026#8211 difficulties finding overnight accommodation \u0026#8211 insufficient fuel \u0026#8211 appointments missed and so on and so on.Eric Box, XxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxSir,You may recall that I incurred a ruined tyre while driving through the roadworks at Strone Point on the A83 back in February.I claimed for £270, which was the cost of the rescue and renewing the tyre, against the trunk road maintenance contractor, BEAR Scotland, who had let the road deteriorate to such a dreadful state while road improvements were going on.While they haven\u0026#8217t admitted liability or anything as rash as that, they have, on the other hand, offered to pay me £250, most of the expense I incurred.I have accepted this offer and I thought you might publish this as an encouragement to others who have suffered expense for similar reasons.It pays to complain.Graham Thomas, St CatherinesSir,Having held a successful evening of music at the Argyll Inn in Lochgilphead on Friday April 27, the Easy Club would like to thank a number of people and organisations.Thanks to the ownership/management/staff of the Argyll Inn and the donators to the prize draw the Co-op, Danny\u0026#8217s, Dalriada DIY, the Smiddy, Fyne Living, ABC Bookshop, the Archway and Marmalade Deli.Also all the helpers and carers, and the many musicians, and the enthusiastic audience who came along to enjoy the evening.As we start to plan workshops for the coming months we would be very happy to welcome new participants.

There are no rules or limits to the imagination – they may want to be a wizard or superhero.If a child does not know what they want to be they can decorate their hat with something they are passionate about such as a sport, graffiti art, dancing shoes, or musical instrument.The idea behind the fun is to raise money for the UK’s leading children\u0026#8217s charity to help give thousands of disadvantaged children a better future. When they go into school, nursery or playgroup on May 18, parents and carers can make a voluntary donation of £1 to £2 to Barnardo\u0026#8217s Scotland.Children are full of surprises, and this is a fun way of allowing their imaginations to run wild in a way that will be inspiring, educational and raise money to help transform the lives of children who desperately need our support.It is easy to sign up on our website where you\u0026#8217ll find lots of resources and ideas to ensure your fundraising Hat Day will be a huge success and help support the children and young people we support in your local community.To register, visit www.barnardos.org.uk/hatday. Here you\u0026#8217ll find everything you need to make the event a success at your school, nursery or playgroup.Our resources section has school posters, sample letters for parents and hat-making guides. Contact regional relationships manager for Scotland, Jennifer Keegan on Jennifer.Keegan@Barnardos.org.uk for further information or assistance.To help with ideas, Barnardo\u0026#8217s is launching a separate \u0026#8216Top Hat\u0026#8217 competition for teachers/parents for best hat in the run up to Hat Day, with a poll to decide the winner on the Barnardo\u0026#8217s Community Fundraising facebook page.Martin Crewe, director for Barnardo\u0026#8217s ScotlandSir,I write concerning the blight of ferry disruptions across my council ward, particularity on the island of Islay.We cannot allow CalMac\u0026#8217s management blunders and lack of funding from the Scottish Government to act as a ball and chain which is holding back my local ward\u0026#8217s fast industrial growth.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,Stroke is the leading cause of adult disability in the UK.

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding. And it can take place anywhere – at home, at work, at school.Just pop the kettle on, slice up a cake or two, homemade or bought (you have to have cake at a wedding) and invite friends, relatives and colleagues to enjoy a cuppa or perhaps even a glass of champagne.The serious point is that you’ll be helping to fight meningitis and move us one step closer to our vision of a future where no one in the UK dies from meningitis \u0026#8211 and everyone affected gets the support they need to rebuild their life.Sadly, despite developments in vaccines, meningitis and septicaemia continue to affect thousands every year and kill more under-fives than any other infectious disease.

Moore took the free-kick, but his curling effort from 27 yards lacked power.Moore, however, was not to be denied his hat-trick and 60 seconds later  steered a good low finish past Scott Urquhart\u0026#8217s left hand.The early first-half jitters returned to the League defence just after the hour mark when hesitation in the box allowed Nikki MacDougall, of host club Tarbert, to nip in and force the ball past Urquhart from nine yards to add a fifth goal for Argyll.A flurry of changes from both sides with 16 minutes remaining saw Scott Soudan and Lewis MacNaughton replace MacDougall and McCallum for Argyll.The league adjusted quicker to the changes and Kyle Reid and Robbie Martin combined well for Martin to pull a goal back in the 77th minute.With five minutes remaining, Soudan\u0026#8217s tenacity in the box robbed Daniel Smith on the six yard line and left him one-on-one with Urquhart.Soudan\u0026#8217s stabbed effort was stopped by Urquhart\u0026#8217s outstretched right foot but, typical of his luck on the day, the rebound fell kindly for the Campbeltown Pupils\u0026#8217 striker who rounded the prostrate Urquhart and walked the ball into the empty net.The full-time whistle ended an entertaining encounter with the players and officials retiring to the Islay Frigate Hotel for the presentation ceremony.The Duncan MacDougall man of the match award was given to Red Star\u0026#8217s Kieran Moore.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sun brings out the best in lochgilphead golfers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 17/05/18, 2:24 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOn a lovely sunny Sunday the gents competed to gain a place to play in this year\u0026#8217s match and knockout competition.Jim Hunter was excited to return a nett score of 58, six strokes below par.

It was a gamble \u0026#8211 but one that paid off, with the business now turning over millions each year.He left the business \u0026#8216at least 10 years ago\u0026#8217, but was a very interested visitor at last week\u0026#8217s \u0026#8216Fyne at 40\u0026#8217 celebrations \u0026#8211 more on pages 16 and 17 \u0026#8211 to mark the company\u0026#8217s four decades in business.\u0026#8216Looking back, I feel quite astonished really,\u0026#8217 he told the Advertiser.\u0026#8216I mean, away back we had a wooden hut, but before that there was a fish box and an umbrella. We were growing shellfish, cooking prawns and smoking a bit of fish.\u0026#8216The restaurant as we see it today was an old farm steading \u0026#8211 well, it was a midden, really. But we slowly evolved within it.\u0026#8216It was open to the slates and the wind used to go straight up the length of the oyster bar. We had a hessian sack to keep down the draught, and it used to stand out at about 45 degrees a lot of the time. It was very primitive for many years, because we were skint.\u0026#8216People sat in their overcoats, but they liked the style. All of a sudden they could get local shellfish, and it just developed from there.\u0026#8217He continued: \u0026#8216Since my time the whole place has had a re-make and it is really, really nice.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s been driven by the volume of people wanting to dine here.

Just superb.\u0026#8217Johnny Noble sadly died in 2002, aged just 66.\u0026#8216He was an inspiring, lovely man, said Mr Lane. \u0026#8216No matter what disaster befell us no matter what cock-up happened, he was ever-optimistic and just kept us going.\u0026#8216We would have our business meetings in the billiard room at [Johnny\u0026#8217s home] Ardkinglas House, and there would be a bottle of something. That just keeps the morale going.\u0026#8216He was a great man, and wonderful entertainment.\u0026#8217The stories of Johnny Noble are legion, and most are true.Andy Lane recalled: \u0026#8216In the days of the Oyster Bar in our old draughty building, everyone had to muck in. Johnny would go round being the wine waiter for a while. Until, that is, someone would choose an inappropriate wine. At that point he\u0026#8217d start a sort of genial argument with them.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus. We asked West Coast Motors about this and they gave us the answer we wanted.All Citylink buses are fitted with an access ramp, worked by the driver. A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

Whitletts has landed an unenviable spot in the country’s top 10 road tests to avoid. The list, published by recovery firm 24/7 Vehicle Rescue, claims the “nerve-jangling lottery” has put Ayr on the map for all the wrong reasons. It follows a \u0026pound3.5m scheme to increase lanes and install traffic lights on the roundabout in 2006, which has sparked trouble for many trying to negotiate its contours ever since. Transport Scotland held a safety review in 2015 after stats showed Whitletts was more dangerous than the giant M8 roundabout at Hermiston Gait near Edinburgh.  Ranjen Gohri, spokesman for 24/7 Vehicle Rescue, said: “Britain is famed for its roundabouts, and being able to safely negotiate them is a major part of driving in this country. “Unfortunately, many motorists are terrified of them. “This is not helped by some of the cases we’ve gathered that have a fearsome reputation and seem to almost unnerve drivers before they even get to them. “With the volume of traffic and unavoidable problems such as breakdowns, driving in the UK is difficult enough without having to attempt some of these roundabouts from hell.” Also making the top ten is Sheriffhall, which sits on Edinburgh’s city bypass, and Haudagain in Aberdeen, which is due for a \u0026pound30m redesign later this year.

A shiny, newly constructed bus terminal would be half a mile across town to Burns Statue Square. And the historic train station would be prised apart from the Station Hotel and rebuilt as a modern standalone hub. The dramatic vision, which is only one of the options being considered, would also see a chunk of the hotel knocked down and the remainder converted to homes. The multi-million pound makeover of the town’s transport infrastructure depends on businesses such as Stagecoach and ScotRail buying into the idea. Parkhouse Street, which is home to a number of high-profile estate agents, would be pedestrianised in one option.  And the dual carriageway A70 leading from the Market Inn roundabout into the town could become single lane in either direction. Folk had the chance to see the ideas from Ayr Renaissance at a public exhibition in the Town Hall last week. Ayr Renaissance chair James Knox said: “We want to give everyone the chance to have their say on the masterplan for Burns Statue Square. “Nothing is written in stone. We have just begun the consultation process.” A council spokesman said: “We’re at the start of a process looking at options to regenerate Burns Statue Square and the Affleck’s block site, one of Ayr’s hidden gems behind the town hall. Some initial options were pulled together for the consultation last week, however we’re keen to hear more ideas from the public, so we’re looking at additional exhibitions in the near future.”  Depute council leader Brian McGinley said: “This is a good opportunity to get on and regenerate Ayr town centre, which is badly needed. There are multiple issues that need to be addressed and we need all stakeholders to put the interests of Ayr first and foremost. “These are ideas that we can work with and shape to make Ayr better. But these improvements will only happen if we all pull together.” Consultants Ironside Farrar have been working on designs. Concerns have been mounting over the future of Ayr’s railway presence as the state of the Station Hotel continues to deteriorate.  The hotel owners have been told to carry out essential maintenance by the council and were slapped with a dangerous building notice. There are still question marks over the future of the Odeon amid speculation it could move to another location in the town. Office building Burns House has been labelled as not fit for purpose and is due to be demolished. But the new replacement building plans for the bottom of the town have been knocked back – throwing the office relocation timescale off. The timeline and budget for the Burns Statue Square makeover has not been released. Stagecoach and Network Rail did not reply to Ayrshire Post requests for comment before our deadline.

The prolific striker turned down Premiership riches and clubs in England to agree a one-year contract at Somerset Park on Tuesday. Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision. It is a big, big signing which shows our intent and now we need the fans to respond with an upsurge in season ticket sales.

We moved in together early 2016 and then Stuart proposed whilst we were on holiday in Dubai in September 2016. “He bought me a pair of Valentino shoes and got down on one knee to put them on for me before pulling out my beautiful engagement ring that he’d designed himself and had made by a jeweller in Dubai.  The couple tied the knot on Saturday, February 24 this year, with the ceremony held at Glasgow University Memorial Chapel and the reception at Boclair House in Bearsden. Erin said: “It was a nice contrast of traditional and modern glam. “We were so lucky getting a beautiful crisp sunny day - right before the Beast from the East came later that week. “Stuart and I wrote our own ceremony and personalised vows. “We ended the night with [I want to spend my] Life with You by The Proclaimers. “It really was a perfect day and more than we could of dreamed of! The bride wore Everlasting by Caroline Castigliano, from The Bridal Garden in Glasgow, with her bridesmaids wearing customised blush Haley Paige dresses from Anne Priscilla, Glasgow.  Groom Stuart wore an Arran Mist kilt and plaid with matching navy jacket and gold tie. And the groomsmen wore Arran Mist tartan kilts with charcoal jackets and gold ties - exclusive to MacGregor \u0026amp MacDuff in Prestwick. The bridal party consisted of chief bridesmaid Eilidh McKenzie and bridesmaids Lynsey Ross, Raina Purba and Kirsteen Havlin. Making up the rest of the wedding party were best man Craig Marshall, ushers Les Lawrie, Dean Wear and Torin McKenzie, mother of the bride Una McKenzie and parents of the groom Yvonne and Fraser Murray. The couple celebrated being newlyweds with a trip to the sunshine. Erin said: “We squeezed in 10 nights in at the Centara Ras Fushi resort in the Maldives before Stuart went offshore again. “It was paradise! Our villa was right on the beach so it was perfect for watching the sunset.  Thistle \u0026amp Blink Photography from Kilmarnock captured the couple’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to relive. Emma Lawson of Betty Bluebell, based in East Kilbride, pieced together the bouquets with Ashley Nimmo, Ellis Dewhurst and Jett Paterson of Allure in Kilmarnock creating the hair and beauty looks for the day. As for their cake, the couple opted for four-tiers with all their favourite flavours, including red velvet. A local lady called Gianna made the cake, completed with a handmade topper by friend Rachel Currie. Erin added: “We would like to say a huge thank you to our families, bridesmaids and groomsmen for their help in the planning and execution of our dream wedding- it couldn’t have gone better! “Thank you to everyone who shared in our special day, your generosity and well wishes have been overwhelming.

Neighbours have slammed fast motorists in the Heathfield area and also in Whitletts Road. One resident claims an existing speed camera on Whitletts Road currently isn’t in operation and insist vehicles are zooming past her home at speeds of up to 50mph. She is calling for a speed camera further along the road to curb fast drivers. The concerned woman has called for the camera between Whitletts Road and Mainholm Road. Speaking at this month’s North Ayr Community Council, she said: “I am convinced the speed camera in Whitletts Road is not switched on. “I can hear cars at 6am or 7am travelling at more than 30mph coming into the town and the same going out.  “We need a speed camera.” Councillor Ian David said: “I am waiting for a response from the Partnership Panel as speeding in Whitletts Road was mentioned and it will be taken up with the police.” Speeding was also a hot topic discussed at last month’s Newton and Heathfield Community Council held in Newton Pavilion. Community councillors highlighted problems with speeding cars in Alderston Avenue and Northfield Avenue, and the problem of these streets being used by drivers as rat run to avoid the traffic lights in Prestwick Road. One woman said: “(There is) speeding in Alderston Avenue and there are a few children who stay in that street at the corner and the cars are turning right on to Northfield Avenue.” Police attending the meeting said they would do their best to monitor the situation. A council spokesman said Police Scotland/Safety Cameras Scotland administer speed cameras: “Safety cameras in Scotland are operated under the rules and guidelines of the Scottish Safety Camera Programme.”  A Police Scotland spokesman said: “The speed detection cameras are rotated around camera housing sites and have the ability to be used at any time. “You can find more information on the Scottish Safety Camera Programme and the location of camera sites by visiting www.safetycameras.gov.scot” In March, the Post reported that more than 13,000 speed offences have been captured on Ayrshire’s roads over the past three years Fast drivers were caught 13,103 times racing through the streets at breakneck speeds across the county from 2015 to 2017. And the highest clocked by a speed camera during that period was in 2016 at 140mph. Over last three years, a total of 715 speeding offences were detected in Ayr, 227 in Troon, 116 Prestwick, 32 in Maybole, 105 in Girvan and 88 in Cumnock.

Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"win a summer shopping spree","story":"NewsWin a summer shopping spreeTo help you get fashion and beauty- ready for summer, Debenhams at Ayr Central are hosting a fabulous VIP shopping event on Thursday June 7.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post10:35, 30 MAY 2018Updated10:36, 30 MAY 2018NewsGet ready for summer and be in with a chance of winning a shopping spree\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWIN A SUMMER SHOPPING SPREE!

Wren Kitchens will move into a 10,000sq ft unit at Heathfield this September, the Post can reveal. The firm, based in Lincolnshire, will make its first foray into Ayrshire when the store opens its doors. Its nearest outlet is currently more than 40 miles away at Abbotsinch, near Paisley. The addition comes as a welcome boost for park bosses, who are set to lose three retailers this year. Homebase will bow out on June 24, joining Carpetright and Maplin on the casualty list. The departures will see 50,000sq ft of trading space lost. However, Alastair Dickie, director at Heathfield’s developers Ediston Properties, said: “This is a positive piece of business. “Wren are an expanding company and this represents their first store in Ayrshire.  “They clearly view Ayr as a place to be and we are happy to have them on board. “It will mean jobs, not only in store but indirectly for fitters.” Wren will move into the unit vacated by the former PC World. The firm, which was founded in 2009, employs more than 4000 staff. It comes as park bosses prepare to seal a deal with another new name on site. Mr Dickie added: “Since acquiring the park we’ve let out ten units and don’t anticipate stopping there.” Ediston bought Heathfield in 2011 in a deal worth \u0026pound31.8 million. Retail giants such as M\u0026ampS, DFS and Costa have all moved in as part of the park’s overhaul in the intervening years.

This must have been a favoured site well-placed beside a coaching inn on the main road North.\nThe 1860s saw the further development of the railways begun five years previously.\nBefore this Peebles lived up to its reputation of being, \u0026ldquoAs quiet as the grave or as Peebles. With the railways came industry and people and money.\nCommercial Peebles began to develop and the Northgate was no exception. Up until then the Northgate was little more than the road out of town with several pastoral tofts strung out along it.

determining whether a meeting between Mr Trump and Kim Jong Un, originally scheduled for June 12 but later cancelled by the US president, can be restored.\nThe talks come as preparations for the highly anticipated summit in Singapore were barrelling forward both in the US and in Asia, despite lingering uncertainty about whether it will really occur and when.\nNorth Korea\u0026rsquos flurry of diplomatic activity following a torrid run in nuclear weapons and missile tests in 2017 suggests Kim Jong Un is eager for sanctions relief to build his economy, and the international legitimacy the summit with Mr Trump would provide.\nBut there are lingering doubts on whether Mr Kim will ever fully relinquish his nuclear arsenal, which he may see as his only guarantee of survival in a region surrounded by enemies.\nMr Trump announced that Kim Yong Chol was coming to New York for talks with Mr Pompeo in a tweet on Tuesday in which he said he had a \u0026ldquogreat team working on the summit.\nWe have put a great team together for our talks with North Korea. Meetings are currently taking place concerning Summit, and more. Kim Young Chol, the Vice Chairman of North Korea, heading now to New York. Solid response to my letter, thank you!    \n\u0026mdash Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) \nMay 29, 2018\nThat was a shift from last week, when Mr Trump announced in an open letter to Kim Jong Un he had decided to \u0026ldquoterminate the summit following a provocative statement from the North.\nMr Pompeo, Mr Trump\u0026rsquos former CIA chief, travelled to Pyongyang twice in recent weeks for meetings with Kim Jong Un, and said there is a \u0026ldquoshared understanding between the two sides about what they hope to achieve in talks.\nSouth Korean media speculated Mr Pompeo could make a third trip to Pyongyang and Kim Yong Chol was carrying a personal letter from Kim Jong Un, and might push to travel to Washington to meet Mr Trump.\nNorth Korea\u0026rsquos mission to the United Nations in New York is its sole diplomatic presence in the United States.\nThat suggests Mr Kim might has chosen to first go to New York because it would make it easier for him to communicate with officials in Pyongyang, North Korea\u0026rsquos capital.\nNorth Korea and the United States are still technically at war and have no diplomatic ties because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty.\nMr Trump views a summit as a legacy-defining opportunity to make the nuclear deal that has evaded others, but he pledged to walk away from the meeting if he believed the North was not serious about discussing dismantling its nuclear program.\nAfter the North\u0026rsquos combative statements, there was debate inside the Trump administration about whether it marked a real turn to belligerence or a feint to see how far Kim Jong Un could push the US in the lead-up to the talks.\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, left, met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on May 9 (Korean Central News Agency/Korea News Service via AP)\nMr Trump had mused Mr Kim\u0026rsquos \u0026ldquoattitude had changed after the North Korean leader\u0026rsquos surprise visit to China two weeks ago, suggesting China was pushing him away from the table.\nThe US president\u0026rsquos letter, the aides said, was designed to pressure the North on the international stage for appearing to have cold feet.\nWhite House officials maintain Mr Trump was hopeful the North was merely negotiating but that he was prepared for the letter to mark the end of the two-month flirtation.\nInstead, the officials said, it brought both sides to the table with increasing seriousness, as they work through myriad logistical and policy decisions to keep June 12 a viable option for the summit.\nKim Yong Chol is a vice chairman of the North Korean ruling party\u0026rsquos central committee.\nThe last official of his stature to visit the United States was Jo Myong Rok, the late first vice chairman of the National Defense Commission, who visited Washington in 2000, South Korea\u0026rsquos Unification Ministry said.\nThe White House emphasised it has remained in close contact with South Korean and Japanese officials as preparations for the talks continue.\nSpokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Mr Trump will host Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on June 7 to coordinate their thinking ahead of the summit. Mr Trump also hosted South Korean President Moon Jae-in last week.\nMr Moon, who has lobbied hard for nuclear negotiations between Mr Trump and Kim Jong Un, held a surprise meeting with the North Korean leader on Saturday in an effort to keep the summit alive.\n(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\u0027GoogleAnalyticsObject\u0027]=ri[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date()a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0]a.async=1a.src=gm.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,\u0027script\u0027,\u0027//www.google-analytics/analytics.js\u0027,\u0027ga\u0027)ga(\u0027create\u0027, \u0027UA-72310761-1\u0027, \u0027auto\u0027, {\u0027name\u0027: \u0027pacontentapi\u0027})ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027referrer\u0027, location.origin)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension1\u0027, \u0027By Josh Lederman, Matthew Lee and Christopher Bodeen, Associated Press\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension2\u0027, \u002717011187-4266-487b-9f54-6cc207d7e8b4\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension3\u0027, \u0027paservice:news,paservice:news:world\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension6\u0027, \u0027story\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension7\u0027, \u0027composite\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension8\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension9\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.send\u0027, \u0027pageview\u0027, { \u0027location\u0027: location.href, \u0027page\u0027: (location.pathname + location.search + location.hash), \u0027title\u0027: \u0027Top North Korean official lands in US for talks with Pompeo\u0027})\n"}]
