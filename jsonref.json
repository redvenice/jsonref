One top forecasting firm projects that revenue from the creative industries will drop by an astonishing £74billion in 2020 thanks to the coronavirus lockdown. More than 400,000 jobs will be lost by year\u0027s end - simply a human tragedy - and the damage doesn\u0027t stop there. Countless more millions in revenue will be lost to the bars and restaurants that complement theatres and concert halls around the country. At the Theatre Royal, Plymouth, we earn 91 per cent of our annual turnover and take only a 9 per cent government subsidy. At a stroke, all our income except that small subsidy has been lost. Many regional theatres have a reputation for developing acting and writing talent. In Plymouth, I gave Michael Sheen his first directing job at our Drum theatre, while David Suchet and Ben Whishaw have also performed there and James Corden, Michael Ball - a Plymouth lad - and Sir Ian McKellen have played our Lyric stage.  It is a virtuous circle of British creative talent that now circulates around Hollywood and the globe. Now all of that is threatened. South Korea shows us what can be done. It may surprise some to learn that Phantom of the Opera is currently playing in Seoul to packed houses. Cast and patrons have their temperatures taken and apply sanitising gel. Masks are worn. But people sit side by side, with no social distancing. At the beginning of the reopening, only half those Koreans with booked seats were prepared to attend. But after a dozen or so performances, the figure shot up to above 90 per cent. This is the sort of bold thinking that will be necessary to save our industry. Large-scale theatres require attendances of 70 to 80 per cent to break even, so social distancing, even at one metre, is a non-starter. In the immediate term, we need a financial support scheme for the whole sector. But equally important is political leadership. The Prime Minister and his scientific advisers must get behind a new regime that will allow theatres to open again. We need to get back to the business of safely delighting people. Adrian Vinken is chief executive of the Theatre Royal, PlymouthTimes letters: Arts still in peril after the lockdown lifts | Comment | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Amber Heard called Elon Musk Rocketman texts","story":"Share this articleShare this articleAmber Heard called Elon Musk her \u0027Rocketman\u0027 in texts while married to Johnny Depp -

the one in Wallace\u0027s stall - according to NASCAR.com. It is not clear who tied the rope that way or when that person did so.  Before the FBI halted its investigation Tuesday and said it was not a hate crime, all 39 other NASCAR drivers rallied in support of Wallace at Monday\u0027s restart, collectively pushing his No. 43 car to the front of the grid in a show of solidarity. Wallace, an Alabama native, became overwhelmed with emotion and fought back tears as his car owner, NASCAR legend Richard Petty, gave him a hug in the moments before the race began. Some people have slammed the investigation over the rope a \u0027hoax\u0027 and saying NASCAR had somehow overreacted over the shocking incident.Wallace hit back at the accusations saying the whole experience was \u0027just short of pure hell\u0027 for him and that the \u0027common denominator is racism\u0027. "},{"url":null,"title":"Coronavirus testing carried parks churches sports grounds","story":"Share this article But latest data from the Office for National Statistics suggests there are up to 3,200 new infections a day or 22,400 a week, suggesting fewer than a third of people are being tested.To further increase uptake, the Department of Health is planning to double the number of mobile testing units from 117 to 236 by the end of July. Officials yesterday said 43,230 people had died after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK, up 149 from the day before.Dido Harding, executive chairman of the test and trace programme, said: ‘Our new walk-through testing sites will be set up in places that are easy for people to get to by foot or on a bike.’The Newcastle walk-in unit is close to an Asda supermarket, Slough’s is in a leisure centre, Rochdale’s is in a town hall car park and Newham’s is located in a community care centre.Officials at the Department of Health say the location of the new sites will be driven by where residents are most likely to use them rather than a ‘national diktat’.They hope the new units will improve the Government’s test and trace programme, which is meant to be playing a crucial role in the safe lifting of the lockdown. But figures from the scheme yesterday showed the numbers of patients handing over details of their close contacts had fallen compared to the previous week.A total of 70 per cent were asked to provide these details for the week to June 17, while the remaining 30 per cent could not be reached. This dropped from the 75 per cent who gave contact details for the week to June 10.Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, said: ‘There are still many questions that need answering before we can be confident that we have a fit for purpose regime, let alone a world class one.’ The retreat of the pandemic has stalled in England and the number infected may even have gone up, figures suggested yesterday.Around one in 1,100 people were infected in the middle two weeks of this month – up from one in 1,700 in the first fortnight of June, findings published by the Office for National Statistics said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f54ed507203aabe0b98e339d917da33deed420fe/43_81_2915_1749/master/2915.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdb19a41fc94e32a182f340d362d7234","title":"prince parade cherry moon jeff katz best photograph","story":"‘I took this on the Cote d’Azur where he was filming Under the Cherry Moon surrounded by megastars. He put some music on and said he was good to go. I didn’t have time to be nervous’Early in the autumn of 1985, Prince’s assistant called me and said: “Prince would like you to come to France to be his personal photographer for the new film he’s making.” I packed my bags and jumped on a plane the next day to Studio La Victorine on the French Riviera, to document the filming of Under the Cherry Moon, Prince’s directorial debut. I was only 25 at the time. To this day, I think it’s one of the craziest things I’ve ever done.It wasn’t my first time working with Prince. A few months earlier, Warner Brothers asked me to help him put together the album artwork for some of the smaller bands he was working with. I was mostly shooting his proteges – not Prince himself – but we got to know each other and I learned what he liked.I had shot a few concerts, some bands, but no real celebrities. Then there I was, in the Cote d’Azur, surrounded by megastars. Warner Brothers had assembled the most star-studded crew you could think of: Academy award winners, the best cinematographers in the world, the best set designers – everybody you could imagine was there.I arrived a week before filming got under way and I was in awe. Being in this place where Truffaut had made a number of his films with some of the leading lights of cinema felt like I was witnessing something legendary.There were some technical things like locations and lighting and sets that were still being worked out, so I thought I’d have time to soak it in. I soon learned that Prince didn’t like his time to be idle. He was constantly at work, whether it was playing, recording, shooting a music video or a photo session. In the first week, his assistant announced that the formal photo shoot would take place that day. Two hours later, I was shooting Prince.I didn’t have time to be nervous. The focus that kicked in was what I imagine people who do extreme sports feel. You know if you falter for even a second you will fail. So I focused, intently, and made sure I got what I needed.He led me towards a huge soundstage and we decided to keep things simple: I set up a white background with some unfussy lighting. I was fascinated by stripped-back portraiture at the time so I knew I wanted an image with nothing getting in the way. Prince let hair and makeup fuss over him, and then sent them all out of the room when he was ready. He put some music on a small boombox, and told me he was good to go. Within three rolls of film, I knew I had the shot.I captured exactly what I set out to achieve: something simple, dramatic and iconic. The way the delicacy of his face offsets the muscularity of his stomach and the drama of his hand gestures makes this photo special for me. It ended up on the cover of his album Parade.It was the start of more than a decade photographing Prince. I’ve worked with people of immense talent throughout my career, but nobody compares to him. Prince was Prince from the moment he woke up to the moment he went to sleep: he was meticulous in his art at every moment. Not once did I see him lose his temper or cause a scene, and working with him over such a long time frame allowed me to witness him in so many different iterations. Every year would herald a whole new reinvention, both in his aesthetic and his sound.We parted ways in 1996. It was an amicable split. I didn’t hear from him for years, but we caught up in the early 2010s about making new work. Then, inevitably, he got swept on to a different project, and we never had chance to reconnect after that.When I heard the news of his passing, I didn’t believe it. It sounds absurd, but I just didn’t believe he would die. The man was so endlessly creative that it was impossible to imagine his death. I spent 11 years of my life photographing him. Now, I hope my archive captures something of his inimitable creativity.• Limited-edition prints from Jeff Katz’s archive of Prince are available from his website, princebyjeffkatz.Trained: BA in film and cinema, Ithaca College, New York State.High point: “Being able to do what I love every day.”Low point: “The death of film.”Top tip: “Slow down, think more about your shot, and make something that makes people stop scrolling.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68ca6b3b594fdbca56109b923a9e4e5954ca1c8a/0_320_5715_3429/master/5715.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64ec5fc8cee6d27981a043504c67df9d","title":"splendid isolation in search of scotlands hermits","story":"Many isolated people have struggled in lockdown, but others enjoy solitude and choose it as a way of life. Here, Elliot Caunce portrays four modern hermits who live off the grid in ScotlandWilliams, 70, moved into his off-grid farmhouse in the 70s, with his then wife and his daughter, Ceilidh, after falling out with his landlord in Aberdeen. When the marriage ended, he stayed on alone, but he is philosophically optimistic about a future relationship: “I was once married and I may well be married again. It’s a big house to be rattling around in by myself.”Down a remote forestry track in Aberdeenshire, his house has no mains electricity, water or conventional sewage system. For a hermit, he is not averse to fame: he featured in the cinema documentary Two Years At Sea by Ben Rivers, appeared on a Frankie Boyle television show and plays folk music at open mic nights.Maitland, 70, is a successful author who writes books about religious fantasy and solitude, informed by her Roman Catholic faith. She spent increasing amounts of time alone when her marriage broke down in 1993. “I went to live in the country. It was here I started to practise solitude and it grew from there. I found I loved it.” She has lived in the remote moorlands of Galloway since 2006.She recognises that living alone in remote countryside could become difficult as she gets older, especially if she becomes unable to drive. She needs a car to fetch supplies and to remove rubbish, as there is no bin collection.McDonald, 65, moved into a tent in 2007, after he was diagnosed with a critical heart condition and told he needed a transplant. He decided to self-isolate on the edge of a loch, to the east of Fort William. “I thought: if I’ve only got a short life expectancy, I’m just going to come out and live in the wild, which is what I was going to do when I retired.” Living in an area without a phone signal or roads, and few hikers, he has become resilient and self-sufficient. Shopping for supplies involves a round trip of 10 miles walking and 50 miles by train.Smith, 74, is known as the Hermit of Loch Treig. He has lived alone in an isolated log cabin, lacking all modern amenities, since 1984. Once a month, he hikes along an active train track to his nearest station, then takes an hour’s ride to Fort William for food and medical supplies. His one concession to modern life is an emergency locator beacon, which he activated in February 2019 after becoming ill – the distress signal was routed via Houston, Texas, to the coastguard and then Lochaber Mountain Rescue he was airlifted to hospital by helicopter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/782f474623b6dcc280562e0b6a7da5adca3e315f/0_14_4680_2808/master/4680.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b1c49ef46a2a05b4dd7cccb56014502","title":"david levenes glastonbury highlights buy a guardian print","story":"From Bono to a bare stage...  photographer David Levene talks through his favourite Glastonbury shots"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f4f48c1fcc2ccad907adbaba837d7a2a7f82c23/0_0_2953_2135/master/2953.jpg?width=480\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d809a905b618f23596d0b0643c23fb22 480w","title":"center parcs to reopen on 13 july in uk and ireland but pools stay closed","story":"Fewer holidaymakers allowed and activities changed because of physical distancingCenter Parcs is to reopen its UK and Irish holiday “villages” on 13 July – but its pools and spas will stay closed.The company, which shut its five UK centres on 20 March ahead of the coronavirus lockdown, said it would allow visitors to cancel new and existing bookings up to six days before arrival and receive a full refund, as it recognised some would want to reschedule because of changes to its facilities.As well as the closure of pools and spas, Center Parcs said there would be a reduced number of holidaymakers at each venue, changes to some activities to ensure physical distancing in line with government guidelines, extra cleaning and a new takeaway service.Martin Dalby, the chief executive, said: “We know how disappointing it will be for some families that the subtropical swimming paradise isn’t open during their break. We have been planning the changes needed to maintain social distancing and we look forward to reopening these facilities as soon as we are able.

Hotels, bed and breakfasts, holiday homes, campsites, caravan parks and boarding houses will be able to open in England from 4 July.

The science may be complicated – but the need for action now couldn’t be clearerThere’s an Arctic heatwave: it’s 38C in Siberia. Arctic sea ice is the second lowest on record, and 2020 may be on course to be the hottest year since records began.For many people, such news induces a lurch of fear, or avoidance – closing the webpage because they don’t want to hear yet more bad news. A few might think “It’s just weather,” and roll their eyes.How can we make sense of such an event? Climate is subtle and shifting, with many drivers and timescales. But we can use this northern heatwave to illuminate the complexity of our planet. We can break this question into parts, from fast to slow.Fast: the immediate effect is to increase wildfires. Siberia has seen “zombie fires” reignited from deep smouldering embers in peatland. This is bad news, releasing particulate air pollution and more carbon in 18 months than in the past 16 years. The immediate cause? Here in the mid-high northern latitudes, we live in unstable weather under the influence of the polar jet stream. This rapid current of air high above our heads drags weather in a conveyor belt from west to east, with alternating patches of cold and warm air, low and high pressure. Sometimes the weather patterns get stuck, creating a stable period of weather, like a heatwave. This is one long, severe example.Does climate breakdown make this “blocking” more likely? Maybe. The jet stream is created by the contrast between cold polar air and the warmer south. The Arctic is warming twice as fast as the global average: that means less north-south contrast, so the jet stream can become more wobbly and meandering. Loops break off like the oxbow lakes of school geography lessons, stranding particular weather patterns in one place.And why is the Arctic warming faster? Because sea ice and snow are so bright. When they melt with global warming, the ocean and land beneath are darker, so they absorb more of the sun’s heat. Their loss amplifies our warming.The current low in Arctic sea ice is itself partly the result of the Siberian heatwave, amplifying the usual year-to-year fluctuations. But the trend is down: the more CO2 we emit, the more the planet’s temperature rises, and the more sea ice we lose. Scientists predict the Arctic will start seeing summers without sea ice by 2050.But it’s not irreversible. It’s not a tipping point. The sea ice would return if we could cool the climate again. Unfortunately we know only three ways to do that: extract vast amounts of CO2 from the air with trees or technology reflect the sun’s rays at a planetary scale or wait, for many generations.This Arctic heatwave is a sharp spike on top of the global warming trend. That’s what makes it more intense, more likely and more of a warning: it’s a taste of the future predicted for Russia, if we burn quickly through our fossil fuels.The real fear around the Arctic for the longer term, I find when talking to people, comes from the idea of “runaway” warming from methane release. Warming could release stores of methane – a strong greenhouse gas – from permafrost or frozen sediments at the bottom of the ocean, which would add to the warming from our own activities. There is more than twice the amount of carbon in the permafrost as in the atmosphere, and thawing has already begun.There are big local impacts – damage to roads and buildings, because the ground can no longer bear so much weight, and an appalling story involving what appears to be anthrax release from thawing burial grounds. Permafrost thaw was even blamed by a Russian mining company for the recent collapse of a fuel reservoir, contaminating the river with 20,000 tonnes of diesel, though other factors were probably also involved.So could this Siberian heatwave, or ones like it, trigger catastrophic warming? I see much fear about amplifying methane feedbacks, including the false idea that climate scientists don’t consider them (we do, just separately to the main global climate models). Yet for several years there has been growing evidence that this risk is less than originally thought. Carbon stored in permafrost and wetlands is predicted to contribute around 100bn tonnes of CO2 this century. That’s a lot, but we add around 40bn tonnes ourselves every year. The methane at the bottom of the ocean would take centuries to release, so as long as we limit global warming we should keep those stores mostly locked up. There are uncertainties, of course, but the stores’ impact on warming is likely to be tenths of a degree, not several degrees.Yet every tonne of CO2 released from permafrost means one tonne fewer we can emit if we are to reach net zero emissions by 2050. Every year’s equivalent of our emissions brings our deadline closer. Every tenth of a degree of warming brings us closer to our target of 1.5°C and makes more permafrost thaw, and the impacts of climate breakdown worse for the most vulnerable people and species of the world.The Arctic heatwave shows us that there are few simple stories in climate change. There is always a mix of natural and human influence, bad news and slightly-less-bad news, and occasionally even hopeful news. So, more than ever, we need to avoid over-simplifying or slipping into easy tropes like “We’re all doomed” or “It’s all weather,” but to try to understand the details. Perhaps there is one simple story though: every bit of warming we avoid will help keep our planet a more familiar and an easier place to live on.• Dr Tamsin Edwards is a senior lecturer in physical geography at King’s College London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fed2f726fc05096ebe176c186145f6ee8bbb9fa/0_353_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a61571ec6f195d247b6a05f1eb20acb7","title":"jenrick desmond uk planning system towers housing","story":"The random luxury towers going up around Britain have everything to do with profits, nothing to do with housingThe law was broken. There is no argument. At a dinner, a planning minister, Robert Jenrick, sat next to a developer who attempted to lobby him to allow a gigantic £1bn project in London’s Docklands. He then reversed a public decision of his own department, and he expedited it to save the developer, Richard Desmond, some £40m in local levy. His party then accepted an admittedly paltry sum of money from Desmond.To be fair to Jenrick, he denies none of this and, on legal advice, reversed his decision with lightning speed.Ministers have resigned for less and have survived far worse. Jenrick’s boss, Boris Johnson, was lobbied by Desmond like mad and backed his scheme. He has since shown he regards sackings as nothing to do with ethics and everything to do with politics. Be loyal and you can do anything you like. In that at least, Johnson is consistent with his own behaviour. To sack Jenrick would be arrant hypocrisy. For Jenrick to go would be merely dignified.The trouble with planning decisions is that they can seem arbitrary, which means merely matters of opinion. Possibly corrupting factors can always be at play. Jenrick’s Labour critics might reflect on an earlier Docklands development, in which a Labour cabinet minister overrode the grade-one listing of the finest historic docks in Europe, London Docks. He outrageously saw them demolished to favour a developer who also owned the (then) Labour-supporting Sun. The minister was Peter Shore, the docks were in Wapping, and the favour was to a certain Rupert Murdoch.There is nothing new in the politics of property. Desmond and Jenrick might ask how the Vauxhall Tower got approved, or the Shard, or the Walkie Talkie, in many cases against strong local opposition. Centre Point was the result of a murky LCC deal over a roundabout. Conrad Hilton threatened Harold Macmillan that he would boycott London if prevented from breaking rules against towers around Hyde Park. Civic vanity is the most potent of planning motives. At present not just London but Manchester, Leeds, Bristol, Middlesbrough and even Norwich are promised random luxury towers that bear no relation to historic setting or social planning, any more than they relieve local housing need. The London property market, in particular, is now chaotic, massively distorted by money laundering and its status as a depository of the world’s spare cash. I am all for a vigorous London economy, but not this way.Such banana-republic antics are why planning has always been layered. It begins with local democracy – now the last real discretion left to local people. Local decisions are no less vulnerable to corruption than national ones, but at least they are accountable locally.Overseeing them is an appeal structure to a Whitehall inspectorate. But this is polluted by ever more intrusive centralised direction, typified by the Jenrick saga. In the case of London tall buildings, it is further complicated by the London mayor being able to overrule a borough decision, even if then overruled by a minister.Either way, this affair has exposed the decay of Britain’s urban planning. Central and local government should long ago have called a halt to the reckless boom in foreign investment, one that had nothing to do with domestic housing supply. Absentee owners should have been stopped from building London properties and leaving them empty. If Jenrick really meant his decision was to get “more homes built”, he would have insisted Desmond ensured they were only for UK occupiers in perpetuity. He did not, as it would have wrecked profitability. So he can’t have meant it. Aesthetic and skyline control should have been established for historic centres.Rumours are now that Jenrick – on the instructions of Dominic Cummings – is proposing to introduce centrally imposed commissions with no local control. It is recipe for planning by legal appeal. The best argument for Jenrick to go is perhaps not what he did, but what he is about to do."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fd8c16a2b8c9ba0d060e12edf74556f27ddcbed/0_348_5218_3131/master/5218.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=2f1a78adf556215a2b14e14f34e5940b","title":"tell us how do you feel about cinemas museums and galleries reopening","story":"We’d like to hear your thoughts about returning to cultural venues in England after the coronavirus lockdown Cinemas, museums and art galleries in England will be able to re-open on 4 July after the easing of lockdown rules.Theatres and concert halls can also open their doors again, but only to show previous works on a screen.

Along with one oriental cuckoo and three other common cuckoos, each fitted with a tiny tracking device, he was about to embark on an epic journey to southern Africa.Last month, he was the only bird to return safely with his tracker intact.Onon has not only amazed conservationists, but gripped social media across the globe. As coronavirus lockdowns brought the world to a virtual standstill, fans followed online updates from the Mongolia Cuckoo Project, watching in awe as Onon cruised across oceans and made 27 border crossings in 16 countries.He returned on 27 May, having become a media celebrity in India, Kenya and Sweden. Back in Mongolia, he appeared on television and made newspaper headlines.Researchers are now studying data from his journey for clues about why cuckoos travel as far as they do, and how they might be affected by the climate crisis.Hewson, who worked on the project with the Wildlife Science and Conservation Center of Mongolia, admits he did not believe cuckoos were such proficient migrators. “Although they’ve got nice long wings, when they’re flying around the breeding site they look slightly ungainly compared to the other birds,” he says. In fact, cuckoos such as Onon, which migrate in search of caterpillars, their favourite food, travel remarkably fast, he adds. Using tailwinds, they can motor for more than 1,000km a day for a week.Caterpillars are most common in places that are sunny and wet and so, in summer, there are plenty in the Khurkh valley, in the south-east of the Khentii mountain range. As the weather changes they go to India for monsoon season, and then, as the wind changes, to east Africa.It’s not an easy journey. The four other birds that set off at the same time as Onon did not make it back. Their fate is unknown – their trackers may have failed or they may have died. One of them, Bayan, is thought to have died in Yunnan province, China, after flying 7,200km in just seven days from Somalia.As researchers compare the flight paths of cuckoos from across Asia, they are exploring why Onon and his peers choose such epic journeys. They could potentially winter in Asia or Australasia south of the equator, but they don’t, says Hewson. “Probably partly because the presence of a competitor species, the oriental cuckoo, makes this less profitable than it would otherwise be.” The very long journey is perhaps easier than it might appear because there’s such an abundant supply of caterpillars on route, he adds. “If you’re finding food when you get there, it’s not such a costly thing to do in terms of energy.” This raises questions over how the cuckoos might manage if global heating or other threats affect the availability of food.“If their stopover sites get lost they will be in big trouble,” says Nyambayar Batbayar, of the Wildlife Science and Conservation Center of Mongolia, who said the project had raised awareness of the need to protect key flyways and the areas where the birds rest and eat. In Mongolia, schools in Khentii province have taken part in the project, helping to name the birds and closely following their journeys.Onon, named after a local river, has also attracted lots of attention among social media users in India, said Terry Townshend, who documented the cuckoos’ journeys through the website and Twitter account Birding Beijing.Twitter followers bombarded the site with questions about the journeys: “Can the cuckoos stop on water?” (they can only pause during ocean crossings if there’s an island) and “How long do they stop for?”(anything from a few hours to a few days).Back in the lush hills and wheat fields of the Khurkh valley, Onon is getting on with life. “He has no time to waste as he needs to set up his territory, defend it from competing males and mate with as many females as possible!” the Mongolia Cuckoo Project has informed his fans.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2da0f196d363461bfa37adbd87e155c78963104/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=20189f29b378ebdb82a4eb8eab2d9160","title":"black in fashion council industry racism lindsay peoples wagner","story":"Council supported by 400 models, executives and editors is latest in a wave of US initiatives launched to create meaningful changeAfter the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police, and in the wake of the ensuing Black Lives Matter protests, fashion has been having a long-overdue reckoning with racism. The Black in Fashion Council, which was announced on Wednesday, is just one of the organisations founded to hold the industry to account and create change.Started up by Teen Vogue editor Lindsay Peoples Wagner and publicist Sandrine Charles, the initiative’s mission is “to represent and secure the advancement of black iniduals in the fashion and beauty industry”.Wagner told industry site the Business of Fashion how the group would move beyond “cancel culture” to “accountability culture”. She continued: “We want to allow people to rise to the occasion of changing.”The organisation is teaming up with LGBTQ advocacy group the Human Rights Campaign to set up an equality index score and will work with brands, media companies, corporations and trade organisations, such as the CFDA (Council of Fashion Designers of America), over at least the next three years to create index scores.As Peoples Wagner explains in Vogue: “The Human Rights Campaign already has a corporate equality index for people with disabilities and the LGBTQ community that companies like Kering are already a part of. This would be a way to continue to give companies a report card of accountability without them feeling like they’re being shamed into it, and giving them the actual resources of what people are saying they want to see changed.”Backed by a coalition of more than 400 black models, stylists, executives and editors, and an executive board that includes GQ deputy fashion editor Nikki Ogunnaike, Shiona Turini, the costume designer responsible for the outfits on the TV series Insecure and the film Queen and Slim, as well as the founder of Harlem’s Fashion Row, Brandice Daniel, it is due to launch in July.The Black in Fashion Council announcement comes in the wake of a number of other initiatives being set up to address racism in the industry. Earlier this week, Law Roach, stylist of Zendaya and Celine Dion, designer Jason Rembert and hair stylist Lacy Redway announced a new not-for profit organisation, the Black Fashion and Beauty Collective. Its website describes it as “a community of fashion and beauty creatives committed to directly influencing progression within the fashion and beauty industries and the black community”.These initiatives led by black professionals come after criticism of the CFDA’s announcement of plans to “create systemic change” in fashion.Kerby Jean-Raymond, Pyer Moss designer and CFDA board member, called it a “watered-down, bubblegum-ass statement that didn’t address the issues”, speaking to Highsnobiety. And a group of about 250 black industry professionals responded with the Kelly Initiative, named after Patrick Kelly, the Grace Jones and Princes Diana-approved black couture designer who became the first American member of the Chambre Syndicale du Prêt-à-Porter in 1988.The Kelly Initiative established a petition criticising the CFDA for not going far enough, saying it had “allowed exploitative cultures of prejudice, tokenism and employment discrimination to thrive” and calling on it to provide “data on the racial makeup of employees at all levels”.Meanwhile, it has been announced that Paris fashion week will go ahead in September, one of the few events not to go digital because of the pandemic. It will be a moment to see if the industry has begun to make some urgent changes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f0a53a5eabd44b4f662b2966839007efed38fd5/0_0_4561_2739/master/4561.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=14f51266c1dcb4c0139caf4613327672","title":"glastonbury is 50 the best style moments in pictures","story":"From Kate Moss’s mini-minidress in 2004 to Lizzo in lilac sequins and Dennis Brown’s 80s double denim, here are 35 great looks seen at Worthy Farm over the years"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46b0a32068157d67249b571dd9ba27182b4f4532/0_69_2000_1199/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6b94c13e79080bcc557b80c97353e37","title":"share your best and worst lockdown baking experiences","story":"Have you been baking up a storm during the pandemic?

Perhaps a moment on this scale deserved a little pause for thought. Time for the sheer disorienting size of the achievement to sink in. Time to reflect on the extreme weirdness of the circumstances in which it was achieved: 200 miles from Anfield, with none of the protagonists present.But history will not recall the fact that their first league title in 30 years was not sealed on their own turf in the Merseyside springtime, but on a baking summer’s night in west London courtesy of a Willian penalty. What it will recall is the scintillating, stupefying brilliance of Jürgen Klopp’s side from front to back. It will, just about, remember the party afterwards. Yes, it turns out a title shorn of all the usual trimmings – players on the field, a crowd in the stadium, a parade on the streets, hugs and high-fives all round – still feels just as sweet.One of English football’s almighty itches – one lasting almost a quarter of the club’s history – has been scratched. Since Kenny Dalglish’s team won Division One in 1990, the roll of honour contains 13 Manchester Uniteds, five Chelseas, four Arsenals, four Manchester Citys, a Leeds, a Blackburn and a Leicester. And now, 2019-20: Liverpool, a team that for six months have been champions-in-waiting, waiting for a rain that has finally fallen.This was a game that both embellished their achievement and explained it. What makes Liverpool’s achievement so formidable is the fact that they have had to clear a higher bar than any team before them has managed: the bar set by Pep Guardiola’s City from 2017 onwards. Yet over the course of the season City’s occasional glitches in concentration have cost them dearly, and here again they made the sort of errors that have finally seen them toppled from their plinth.It was with a certain doomed futility that at 8.15pm, the whistle blew and City’s tropical-yellow shirts set about trying to push back the hurricane with their bare hands. They had picked a near full-strength side, with Bernardo Silva slotting into a front three in the absence of Sergio Agüero, and an agreeable tempo being set by Rodri and Kevin De Bruyne in the centre. Chelsea, meanwhile, settled in for the long haul, Mason Mount and Andreas Christensen particularly effective. Resisting City is as much a test of nerve as technique: let them pin you back in your own third and it might be 10 minutes before they let you out again.Yet for all City’s possession and territory, Chelsea largely held out for half an hour, their only real chances coming from a Riyad Mahrez interception and a Fernandinho header: the first gifted by a slack Kepa Arrizabalaga clearance, the second brilliantly saved by him. Have three minutes ever encapsulated Arrizabalaga better?Meanwhile, every so often something strange would happen: Chelsea would finagle the ball up the field and fashion a decent opening. Ilkay Gündogan was forced into a desperate clearance. Ederson saved brilliantly from Christensen. That seemed to flick a switch in Chelsea: the moment they sprang from their traps, and realised the game was there for the seizing.Even so, as Antonio Rüdiger headed away a City corner on 35 minutes, little immediate danger portended itself. But as Gündogan and Benjamin Mendy casually left the ball for each other, Pulisic stole in and claimed it, galloping past Mendy and placing a low shot past Ederson. Jubilant teammates pursued him to the corner flag. “Brilliant, mate!” shouted Olivier Giroud in what appeared to be a perfect Cockney accent. On the touchline, Frank Lampard urged calm.”We go again,” he said.And they did, but so did City. Bernardo and Rodri made way for Gabriel Jesus and David Silva. Mendy, seeking instant expiation, smashed a shot into the top tier of the Shed. It took De Bruyne, with the help of a needless foul from N’Golo Kanté, to restore a little sanity to proceedings as only he knows how. There was an insouciance, even an indifference, to the way he stepped up from 25 yards and simply pinged the ball into the top corner, as if it were easier to score than miss.So, then, to the thrilling theatrical finish: a game that seemed to hollow out in the middle, as both sides realised the pointlessness of a draw. Raheem Sterling capped a brilliant counterattack by chipping against a post. Walker scraped the ball off the line after Pulisic had rounded the goalkeeper. And finally, the dramatic flourish: a goalmouth scramble ending with Fernandinho twice clearing off the line from Tammy Abraham, the second time – fatally – with his hand. A red card for Fernandinho, a fine penalty by Willian, and a party three decades in the making could finally begin in earnest."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3f828348c7fe4e5f4fc059aad1ba745196176747/0_30_2970_1782/master/2970.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=159297867997752b9c604d3dbced10c9","title":"how liverpool became premier league champions","story":"This was an annihilation. From late summer into spring Klopp’s team seemed to be operating to a different set of physical laws to everyone elseNo asterisks. No caveats. And let’s face it, no contest. For the last few months a theory has been doing the rounds that the ersatz nature of the Premier League endgame, five weeks of press-ganged summerghost-ball, would drain the colour from Liverpool’s first league title in 30 years.Fat chance. Death, plague and economic collapse may have stalked the land, puncturing sport’s ability to pretend the rest of the world is simply a subplot. But sport has many functions beyond simply flag-waving and Liverpool’s success will be deeply felt at a club where, as with every other club, football has always been a bit more than just football.Not least for the players, a group of athletes who have achieved a kind of personal ultimacy in each other’s company, reaching out into the very limits of their own powers, and playing these last 18 months through a kind of fury.Make no mistake, this was an annihilation. Liverpool didn’t just outrun the rest of the field. From late summer into spring they seemed to be operating to a different set of physical laws, marching the Premier League around in a headlock, ruffling its hair, flicking its ears.The high point remains the 4-0 defeat of Leicester City on Boxing Day, one of those rare performances where each component part of a sporting machine appears to be operating with some intimate, shared knowledge of the other pieces. Either side of this there has at times been an air of double take about Liverpool’s run, of things happening that stretch credibility, that verge on some kind of sporting magic realism.Here’s a team that won 26 of 27 league games from August to 28 February that haven’t lost at home in the league in three years a group of world champions whose best player is an unfussy centre-back, whose centre-forward can’t score at home, whose most creative force is a junior right-back, who have spent £92m net on transfer fees in the last five years.This is not the standard version of annihilating success. How to explain it? Certainly, there has been a feeling that Liverpool are in some way cheating, floating above the waves, gaming the system.Which is in fact the case, albeit in plain sight. This is the culmination of a clear and deliberate process, a vision of an industry with its own historic margins of irrationality and incompetence removed.Let’s face it, at times watching English football has felt like a version of the sequence in Spinal Tap where the band perform on stage in front of an 18-inch model of Stonehenge. Tap’s manager blames this disaster on design instructions from lead guitarist Nigel Tufnel, which fatally confused inches and feet.At which point lead vocalist David St Hubbins points out, to general agreement: “But, you’re not as confused as Nigel are you? I mean, it’s not your job to be as confused as Nigel.”The point being in a dopey, daffy, largely irrational world, sometimes high-level competence can be enough. And English football has been run by Nigels, or dragged into a state of confusion by a sub-cast of Nigels for as long as you care to look back.Imagine a version where the industry norm is cut away, where a football club is run to the same standards as any other high-functioning global business, where no one is as confused as Nigel. This has been the brilliance of this Liverpool regime. Where are their idiots? And is this actually fair?In October it will be 10 years since Fenway Sports Group bought Liverpool, John Henry announcing: “We’re here to win,” from the steps of the high court as a deal was forced through. Oh yeah? Liverpool were £351m in debt. A team featuring Paul Konchesky, David N’Gog and Christian Poulsen were in the bottom three in the Premier League. Nobody knew what to do about Anfield.And yet Henry was attracted to Liverpool precisely because they were in this state. Here was a commodity bottoming out, a global brand that was all inefficiencies, all development potential. A club, an industry, a hard-won sporting heritage was ready to be money-balled.It took a while. There was still time to sign Andy Carroll and Charlie Adam, to churn through a cast of minor players, to fail to micro-manage the disastrous Luis Suárez race affair.Things have been steadily fixed. Two competent, sensible managers have been employed across eight years. A data-driven, non-emotive recruitment policy has registered more hits than misses. Players have been coached and improved rather than discarded or indulged.There has even been a disruptive element to Jürgen Klopp’s tactics. In this Liverpool team full-backs are attackers, midfielders are defenders, wingers are goalscorers, centre-forwards chase and counterpress.Physicality has also been key, another margin to be worked, a team where every player is supremely fit and strong, and where opponents have often simply dropped off, exhausted after 70 minutes.The final steps came in a rush from this powerful base. Two years ago Klopp’s Liverpool were still 25 points behind Manchester City. The current season, a title won with seven games still to play, is an achievement that will stand with any team raised in the modern era.But it also feels like a summit, something that, even now, will need regearing to sustain this level. No asterisks. No blind spots. No snags within the machine. And no standing still from here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56678e69dd877f6f76373b6bb47d7743a7d5ec98/0_123_3003_1802/master/3003.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca81c0864e05fca196cc075bc489c797","title":"mikel arteta praises players after first away victory as arsenal manager","story":"Mikel Arteta acknowledged Arsenal have endured “two difficult weeks” after securing his first away win in the Premier League with a 2-0 victory at Southampton.Goals from Eddie Nketiah and a first Premier League goal for his fellow academy graduate Joe Willock ensured Arsenal moved back into the top half of the table with seven matches still remaining, having lost their first two matches after the restart to Manchester City and Brighton. Arteta admitted that he was relieved to end that poor sequence and praised his players for their reaction.“I was concerned with the way we threw the game away against Brighton – it really touched the team and confidence is everything in this game,” he said. “But I could see that the reaction was really positive and we just demanded them to play together and enjoy themselves. It was an important win for us.”Southampton’s Jack Stephens was sent off for bringing down Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang just before Willock extended Arsenal’s lead and Arteta also praised the influence of the former captain Granit Xhaka in midfield. But he also admitted his young side still have a lot to learn if they are to perform more consistently.Nketiah said: “It was a very important three points. I thought we were unfortunate in our last two games and the results didn’t go our way so we knew we really had to roll our sleeves up and fight for the three points.

A tearful Liverpool manager vowed there was more to come from his record-breaking team after Manchester City’s defeat at Chelsea returned the title to Anfield after 30 years, 58 days and a three-month interruption caused by a global pandemic.Klopp and his players gathered at Formby Hall golf club, not far from the German’s home on Merseyside, to watch Chelsea’s 2-1 win at Stamford Bridge and erupted in celebration on the final whistle. The scenes were recreated across Merseyside where, despite appeals from police, thousands of fans congregated outside Anfield and road blocks were set up around the stadium. Fireworks and car horns could be heard.“What can I say? It’s an incredible moment,” Klopp said in an interview with Sky. “I couldn’t be more proud of my coaching staff and all the people in Liverpool since we came in. It’s been a really exciting ride since the first day and it is not over yet. We watched it all together with the boys and it looks like there are still a good few more years left in their legs. It’s more than I ever dreamed of.“It is a big moment, I have no words. It is such a big moment and I’m completely overwhelmed. I never could have thought it would feel like this, I had no idea …” Klopp, filling up with tears, broke off the interview at this point with: “Sorry gentlemen, I’m sealed.”Liverpool’s captain, Jordan Henderson, was also emotional as the scale of the side’s achievement hit home. The new Premier League champions are 23 points clear of their nearest rivals and won the title with seven matches to spare, another record.“I didn’t want to talk about it until this moment,” Henderson said. “It is amazing to finally get over the line and I’m so happy for all the boys, the fans, the whole club, the city. I’m a little bit overwhelmed right now it’s an amazing feeling. I’m so proud of what we have achieved.“When we won the Champions league on the pitch there was a lot of emotion. It was a different experience watching the game tonight. When the final whistle went, being able to be with everyone – staff and everyone together – was amazing really. It is another moment in our lives we will never forget.”Henderson paid tribute to Klopp, the first Liverpool manager to win the title since Kenny Dalglish on 28 April 1990 (when Madonna was number one with Vogue), for his stunning transformation of a club that had endured several near-misses under previous regimes.The midfielder added: “After the Champions League final I said it wouldn’t be possible without the manager and it’s the same with this title. No disrespect to other managers but from day one he came in the door he changed everything, everyone followed him and believed him and so far it has been pretty special and I hope we can continue in this and stay hungry.“A lot of it you see – what you see is what you get – during his press conferences. On the sidelines he’s got a bit more of a personal side with the players. He’s so close with players, he’s got a perfect balance of that.Liverpool’s principal owner, John W Henry, paid tribute to the team’s “magnificent achievement” from Boston, where he has remained because of UK quarantine rules. “This was a season for the ages and for the faithful of Liverpool Football Club,” Henry tweeted. He added that the team’s achievements had “brought respite and joy to so many in a year filled with so much tragedy. LFC has made the beautiful game more beautiful than ever.”Klopp’s team have won the Premier League, Champions League, Club World Cup and Uefa Super Cup within 13 extraordinary months and are on course to demolish several domestic records this season, many held by City.Liverpool have won the Premier League with most games to spare, breaking the record of five held jointly by City (2017-18) and Manchester United (2000-01). They could end with a staggering 107 points, eclipsing the record of 100 set by City in 2017-18, the most victories in a Premier League season (usurping City’s 32 from 2017-18 and 2018-19), most home wins and the biggest title-winning points margin. City hold that distinction in the Premier League with 19 points in 2017-18 but the overall record of 23 belongs to Middlesbrough and West Ham when winning the second ision in 1974 and 1981 respectively.Henderson will have to wait until late July to lift the Premier League trophy and, while the ban on mass gatherings prevents a parade through Liverpool city centre, the club plan to hold a celebration with supporters when it is deemed safe.“It’s much more than I ever thought would be possible,” Klopp said. “Becoming champion with this club is absolutely incredible.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/427cb5658c79558f3c03dc060ea4d12194cc93b9/0_322_4825_2895/master/4825.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=17208955ebbd9ff9b12c692455be745e","title":"liverpool win the premier league title live reaction","story":"This just in from my colleague, Martin Farrer, on the large numbers of fans who gathered at Anfield last night which prompted warnings from police concerned about people flouting social-distancing rules.Merseyside police Asst Chief Cons Rob Carden said the region had been “disproportionately affected” by the coronavirus pandemic and its residents had a responsibility to prevent further cases.Read the full story here:More reaction, if you can handle it, and perhaps some insight into why this team is so far ahead of others (Papa Klopp).Andy Robertson: “As a squad we’re so close.

I love being a part of it.“We’re all kind of brothers and we have a dad figure in the gaffer and he’s the one that leads us in the right direction. Him and his staff have been second to none, to be fair, since I’ve came here. This season they’ve been excellent to us going, keep us hungry, keep us motivated.Trent Alexander-Arnold: “Obviously things are not as we imagined probably a few months ago or even a year ago how we imagined to win the Premier League, but we are not going to complain and make a fuss of. It’s something we’ve always dreamed of. As fans I think it’s something that will always be remembered.”A “completely overwhelmed” Klopp has spoken of the countdown to the final whistle at Stamford Bridge, while watching on from afar. “In that moment it was a pure explosion... then pure... I cannot describe it. It was a really nice moment.”If this moment in history doesn’t call for peace and love from one of the Fab Four, I don’t know what does.Praise is flowing as freely as a bloated Mersey on a rainy day, and as you’d expect it’s a bit of a love-in. Several Liverpool greats have been queuing up to heap praise on Klopp’s side with Kenny Dalglish, Graeme Souness and Mark Lawrenson all acknowledging the job Klopp has done.Dalglish oversaw the club’s last triumph 30 years ago said he would never have expected to have waiting so long for another. “If you would have said that, you would have been arrested and sectioned,” Dalglish told BT Sport. “Sometimes things happen, but certainly the last two years and since Juergen has come in it’s been very positive. He’s been fantastic and epitomises everything Liverpool stand for, he appreciates and respects everyone that works at the club.“Whatever he gets he deserves. It’s not a one-off because last year they came within a point of it, this year they’ve only lost one, drawn two. They won a club world championship, they won the Champions League last year as well. Onward and upwards and I think we’ve got a lot more happy days to come as long as Jürgen’s there.”Souness told Sky: “It’s not just about this season. This is a special team. This is a team that nobody enjoys playing against... They give everything... when you combine that effort and the quality they have... they’re some team.”And Lawrenson was full of praise for Klopp in his column in the Times. “Jürgen has... embraced Liverpool’s past. After all, the past is why he came here. He knew what could be achieved and what is being achieved. It didn’t frighten him ... that the club had been without the title for so long.”You know what they say, “red sky in the morning, Liverpool won the title the night before”.More from Klopp now, courtesy of the club’s official website: the German has dedicated the victory to fans, and picked out several former players and managers. This is why he is loved by Liverpool fans, he gets the club.“The boys love being part of this club, they love being part of the story of this club and the history. It’s so nice how we learned how to deal with the history, how we learned to use the history in the last two years.”Klopp said he had made sure everyone watched the match together.“There was no alternative... we thought about it, shall we do something and then we thought maybe not compulsory, the boys have to drive a bit. Then I said, ‘no, we have to make it compulsory, everybody has to be there,’ because I’m more experienced... I know who will stay at home and watch it alone will regret it for the rest of his life.”And of course he wouldn’t forget his backroom staff, which so many past Liverpool dynasties have been built on. “Thirty years ago… 30 years ago… I was 23, so I didn’t think too much about winning a title with Liverpool, to be honest! I had no skills for that! Thirty years later I am here and because of the great staff I have, it is unbelievable.”Thanks Bryan in New York.

For now though, let’s just enjoy some of the reaction on the streets of Liverpool, while trying to forget there’s still a pandemic raging for just a moment.Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson was at a loss for words on Thursday when prompted to express the feeling of ending the club’s three-decade hoodoo.“I could never in words describe the feeling of winning the Premier League, just like I couldn’t describe winning the Champions League,” the 30-year-old midfielder told the club’s website. “It’s a unique feeling and one that, again, I’m very proud of. I’ve been so honoured to be part of this football club right from the first moment that I came and to go on the journey to be with this manager, this group of players, these fans – it’s been so special. But we’ll enjoy this, we’ll celebrate, but then I know in the next few days they’ll be straight onto the next game, which is City, and finishing the season off as well as we can.“We want to win every game and we want to finish off with the highest points record we can and give that everything we’ve got and then we’ll go into next season and we’ll want even more. So it’s about just keeping that hunger and I’ve got no doubt that we’ve got that because we’ve proved that over the past couple of years.”Asked to describe Liverpool’s motivation to come back even stronger after last year’s historic, doomed title race with Man City, Henderson invoked the club’s hardened constitution while pointing to a future of limitless promise.“I think you can use that as a motivation and that as extra energy to keep going and to want to do it really, to want to get over the line and finish the job off,” he said. “Last season we played so well and were so unlucky, but City were amazing and they managed pip us in the end. We kept going right until the last day and that’s all we could ask for really. Obviously a few weeks later winning the Champions League helped, and then I think we’ve kicked on again and we’ve been unbelievable this season. “For now it’s about keeping on improving, keeping on doing the things we’ve been doing to get to this point but also keep improving, learning even more and if we do that then I’m pretty sure there’ll be more trophies available to us in the near future.”Thousands of Liverpool supporters descended on Anfield Road on Thursday night to revel in the club’s first top-flight title in three decades. While the celebrations were roundly peaceful, the social distancing guidelines in response to the coronavirus pandemic were in many cases all but ignored. That prompted the following statement from assistant chief constable Rob Carden of Merseyside Police early Friday morning:I would like to congratulate Liverpool FC on deservedly winning the Premier League title, and thank the thousands of Liverpool fans across Merseyside who celebrated at home, as they have for the previous games played behind closed doors.The overwhelming majority of fans have recognised the fact that now is not the time to gather together to celebrate, and chose to mark the event safely. They are a credit to this city.Unfortunately, as we have seen throughout the lockdown period, not everyone adhered to the regulations in place. Although the vast majority of celebrations were good natured, a large number of people chose to gather outside the stadium.In the days ahead, we urge supporters to do the right thing and celebrate safely with members of your household and in your social bubble. By doing this you keep yourself, your family, friends and neighbours safe.As we all know, Merseyside has been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and we must all do what we can to prevent further cases and deaths in our communities.We understand people will feel jubilant that Liverpool has secured the league title for the first time in 30 years, and the time will come when fans can return to Anfield to applaud the team and to celebrate their achievement.Please follow the advice of the players, the manager and the club by putting safety first. The club is encouraging fans to share their experiences of watching future games at home with the hashtag #LFCAtHome on social media, and we all look forward to sharing your experiences of celebrating safely.My colleague Andy Hunter has followed up his match report with a sidebar on Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp, who became overcome with emotion in the immediate aftermath of Thursday’s long-awaited 19th top-flight title.“It’s much more than I ever thought would be possible,” the 53-year-old said. “Becoming champion with this club is absolutely incredible.”Klopp and his players gathered at Formby Hall golf club, not far from the German’s home on Merseyside, to watch Chelsea’s 2-1 win at Stamford Bridge and erupted in celebration on the final whistle. The scenes were recreated across Merseyside where, despite appeals from police, thousands of fans congregated outside Anfield and road blocks were set up around the stadium. Fireworks and car horns could be heard.“What can I say? It’s an incredible moment,” Klopp said in an interview with Sky. “I couldn’t be more proud of my coaching staff and all the people in Liverpool since we came in. It’s been a really exciting ride since the first day and it is not over yet. We watched it all together with the boys and it looks like there are still a good few more years left in their legs. It’s more than I ever dreamed of.“It is a big moment, I have no words. It is such a big moment and I’m completely overwhelmed. I never could have thought it would feel like this, I had no idea …” Klopp, filling up with tears, broke off the interview at this point with: “Sorry gentlemen, I’m sealed.”Champions of England, champions of Europe and champions of the world. The latter of which includes such far-flung locales as New Zealand, from where reader Catherine Downes writes in to say: “My husband Maciek playing the Liverpool anthem as we celebrate!”At the time, James’s piece of the team was valued at around $6.5m (£5.2). These days it’s reported to be worth at least five times that much. James, whose Lakers have sat at the top of the Western Conference for most of a NBA season that was postponed in March due to Covid-19, would be the last person to call himself a week-in-week-out Kopite. But the four-time Most Valuable Player, whom some have said is a better rebounder and passer than Michael Jordan, has been known to surface at Anfield over the years for the prestige fixtures.The sun is just going down in New York but Reds throughout the city are raging on into the night. Typically the center of the party would be the 11th Street Pub in the East Village, which is the headquarters of the Liverpool FC Supporter’s Club of NYC, in addition to the six other bars across the city LFCNY works with to accommodate overflow crowd. But the coronavirus pandemic mostly left the group’s 750-strong membership, which Wells estimates are half Americans and half expats, watching today’s match separately while keeping in touch via Zoom and WhatsApp.“Due to Covid most people watched at home, but a few of our bars with outdoor space were able to host small crowds,” LFCNY president Justin Wells tells the . “We’re planning some sort of party at 11th Street when it’s safe.”David Rose, 46, was among the Liverpool natives who took in Thursday’s long-awaited title clincher a long way from home.“We were two wins away from glory when the lockdown happened and I’d been planning on being back in Liverpool for what would surely be a homecoming parade with the trophy, which I watched as an almost annual event as a kid stood on Queen’s Drive,” Rose says. “I wanted to see that so bad. Today watching two teams that weren’t mine, on a janky monitor in my sweaty back room, on the other side of the world, and with only a Stella to keep me company ... I think it was the greatest league victory of them all. Liverpool or Brownsville, it feels like the greatest thing that could happen has happened, and a virus can’t take that away. “You see, there’s this lad from Liverpool called Trent, and he’s only gone and got himself a Premier League champion’s medal.”Liverpool’s dominant season in chart form:It’s 1am in the UK, and I suspecthope the Liverpool players are very, very drunk. I’m going to hand over to Bryan Armen Graham in the US. Thanks for your company and emails on an iconic date in English football history. In 1990, you’d have got seriously long odds on Liverpool winning their next title on 25 June 2020.You’ll all have your favourite memory of the season. There were many more spectacular moments, but I still think this second goal exemplifies the exhilarating brilliance and leadpipe cruelty of this Liverpool side.A bit more from the wiresSteven Gerrard hailed Liverpool’s “incredible achievement” in being crowned champions for the first time in the Premier League era.The Reds were handed the crown on Thursday night as Manchester City’s loss to Chelsea left them 23 points behind the leaders with seven games left to play.Among those marking the achievement was former skipper Gerrard, who won two FA Cups and a Champions League with the club but never claimed a league title.Gerrard, now manager of Rangers, wrote on Instagram: “Congratulations to all liverpoolfc on winning the premier league. Incredible achievement from a fantastic squad of top players.“Lead by a world class manager and coaching team also a special mention for the backing from FSG. And lastly and most importantly the fans who have waited 30 years. Let the party begin.”One of Gerrard’s former team-mates, Michael Owen, tweeted: “Congratulations LFC What an unbelievable season and the best team by a mile!”Liverpool’s current players were also tweeting as they watched events unfold at Stamford Bridge, as footage circulated around social media which appeared to show many of them watching the game together.Full-back Trent Alexander-Arnold wrote on Twitter: “Championssss!!!!” Midfielder James Milner wrote: “30 years Reds! Let’s enjoy it! Honoured to be part of this team \u0026amp this club” Referencing those who died in the Hillsborough disaster in 1989, defender Dejan Lovren wrote: “96 - Dream came true” And posting a screenshot from his phone showing four missed calls from Alexander-Arnold, Andy Robertson joked: “Wonder what he wants” Luis Garcia, a Champions League winner with the Reds in 2005, tweeted: “Congratulations to LFC!! What a fantastic achievement. “Congrats to all the players, staff and board member. I’m not forgetting the Supporters. Enjoy the moment, it’s been a long time but finally is here !!” Another member of that Champions League winning team, Djimi Traore, wrote: “Congratulations to LFC for winning premier league 2019-20. Well deserve trophy for klopp and his team.fantastic achievement for LFC YNWA”Former Liverpool striker John Aldridge posted a video of himself celebrating with an inflatable trophy. Aldridge, who won the league with the Reds in 1987-88, tweeted: “What a wonderful feeling for all LFC fans across the globe!Love it,Absolutely smashed the league to bits”Another past Liverpool striker, Fernando Torres, wrote: “Huge congrats to everyone at LFC on winning the premierleague. Unbelievable squad, magnificent manager, great staff but above all my sincere congrats to every single LFC supporter. You’ve been waiting so long and finally that desired trophy is yours. Very well deservedYNWA”Former Liverpool goalkeeper Pepe Reina wrote: “CHAMPIONS!! Congratulations LFC!! Award more than deserved after an excellent season. 30 years later Today I feel more than proud of having belonged to this great club”Former Liverpool manager Roy Evans tweeted: “Well deserved congrats to jurgen. and the team a great finish we have Waited a long time for this a great team effort from the manager the team and lots of people behind the scenes and of course our brilliant fans. To you all YNWA” From the news wiresLiverpool and Manchester City have set the benchmark for the rest of the Premier League to follow, Chelsea boss Frank Lampard said after masterminding the 2-1 win over City that handed the Reds their first league title in 30 years on Thursday.Lampard, who won three Premier League titles as a player at Chelsea, congratulated Liverpool in a news conference and said it was up to other clubs to match them and Pep Guardiola’s City.“I think for the last three seasons, themselves (Liverpool) and City have been out on their own pretty much, and that’s a lot of work,” he said.“It’s a gap that we want to try and breach, we want to move up towards - they are two of the best teams in the world. Again, credit to Liverpool for what they’ve done,” Lampard added.I’ve been thinking a lot about two people tonight, my colleagues Gregg Bakowski and Scott Murray. Two of the finer blokes and journalists you’ll ever meet, who had to put up with me luxuriating in Manchester United’s title wins of the 2000s, so it’s lovely to see Gregg’s name pop up in my inbox:This is Klopp’s title Rob. He’s made good players into incredible ones and I don’t think they would be so effective under another manager in a different system. His impact at the club has been immense. With apologies to talented people at  Towers, I’d love him to be my boss.A reminder that, though comments aren’t open on this blog, you can have your say below the line on Barney Ronay’s brilliant tribute to the champions.“Hey Rob,” says Tony Barr. “Moved to England from Glasgow in 1977 when my dad needed a job. Who else was I going to support but the new team of my boyhood hero? Things were easy and fun for many years, but Heysel and Hillsborough proved an uncomfortable background to my coming of age.  “I don’t need to tell you about the intervening 30 years, but I will say that it’s not just the fact we’ve won the league, but the manner in which it’s been done that moves me to write. The character of the manager and the team and their perfect relationship with their home city is something you can’t manufacture. Not least of all the stories that make up the success. That Andy Robertson retweet never fails to get me filling up. “I’ve got plenty to do tomorrow but I’m not done reading and watching the highlights yet.” Yeah, that’s a very good point. The background of the players is interesting, and the clubs from which they were signed: Southampton, Roma, Schalke, Newcastle, Monaco, Charlton, Hull, Hoffenheim, Lille, Stoke, Leipzig. They became superstars together. I’m no Liverpool fan but you’d have to be a bit odd not to find them thoroughly admirable.“I used to live Liverpool’s victories from the late seventies through the eighties with my brother and it defined our childhood,” says Ian Copestake. “But life brings amazing changes and I am glad this comes in a different time because it is just as sweet and I have so many other people to share it with including the best  MBMers and MBMees!”We should all meet up sometime. I’ll be on the Kerguelen Islands for the next few years if you’re passing that way.In the 13 years up to May 2019, Liverpool won only one trophy, the Carling Cup or whatever it was called in 2011-12. In the last 13 months, they’ve won the Champions League, the Super Club, the World Club Cup and now the Premier League.“Hi Rob,” says Chris Kempshall. “So I was only six years old in 1990. I understood the natureexistence of football and having watched a Liverpool game previously and been amazed by John Barnes (my hero before I understood heroes) I was a fan, but I didn’t really understand. I watched the VHS of the 8990 season to death but going through the school years as Liverpool withered away was not a great deal of fun.“Looking back on it tonight, it’s amazing just how long it all feels. We’ve had more complete collapses and rebuilds than title challenges. After the 201314 season I did genuinely wonder if it was ever going to happen. Tonight is, therefore, something I’ve basically waited my whole life for. Those 30 years did not fly by...” “Hi Rob,” says Peter Oh. “I don’t know anything about Rockstar by Dababy ft. Roddy Ricch but this is the tune that I’ll remember this day by.”Andy Hunter has a round-up of the reaction to Liverpool’s triumph, including Jurgen Klopp’s emotional interview“I was nineteen back in 1990: fresh-faced and carefree,” says Madge Stapleton. “Never did l think l’d have to wait thirty years to see success again. I have fifteen red shirts (and one yellow David James one) to remind me of the heartache and the near misses and the absolute despair at times. None of it matters now. Klopp is crying, Virg is dancing and I’m nineteen (19!) again.”And Jack Charlton’s Ireland are in the World Cup quarter-finals!Liverpool clinched the title because of Manchester City’s eighth league defeat of the season. That’s a scandal for a team of their quality, and Pep Guardiola surely won’t let it happen next season.“It’s mad how few near misses we’ve had over 30 years,” says Niall Mullen. “1990-91, when we started like a train, is often forgotten, I guess because it happened before modern football. But between losing at home to Coventry in 1997 and Andrei Arshavin scoring four in 2009 we never really got close. 2014 was a bit of an aberration, like the time the beautiful girl goes out with you for a few months before coming to her senses. It’s almost an achievement to have been out of contention for so long.” There’s a bit of a police presence at Anfield, though it doesn’t sound like they are doing much. That particular horse has long since done one.“Got the crisps,” says Ian Copestake.Here’s Barney Ronay on Liverpool’s title triumphMake no mistake, this was an annihilation. Liverpool didn’t just outrun the rest of the field. From late summer into spring they seemed to be operating to a different set of physical laws, marching the Premier League around in a headlock, ruffling its hair, flicking its ears."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af62cd6f3ff2d5057ec68cab0a5172b2d571b981/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=535cd12c61200ec294be13977a014184","title":"pandemic epiphany fitness working out","story":"Ammar Kalia reflects on his transformation after years spent seeing his body as a receptacle for beer and cigarettes In this new series,  writers reflect on what they’ve learned in lockdown. Share your experience in the comment sectionEver since my gym teacher stood, arms folded, laughing at my inability as a four-year-old to tuck myself into a ball and perform a somersault, exercise has been a foreign concept.Team sports were an orgy of disappointment – of realizing I was the weak link leading us to yet another defeat – while inidual endeavors were equally dispiriting. Running made me feel like my lungs were about to explode, I never learned to ride a bike, and swimming made me realize you could sweat underwater and almost drown in the shallow end of the pool.Pre-lockdown, my body was a willing receptacle for pints of beer, cigarettes and sandwiches. My body had become this doughy thing I carried around with me. The only interaction I had with my physical self was the realization that my skin is brown - a fact that set me apart from my largely white social circle. It was something I came to define myself by.When the coronavirus pandemic hit and we were all placed in lockdown, I thought it would be business as usual hours sat at my desk, punctuated by eating, with the added bonus of working from my kitchen where my fridge was in reach. Living alone, though, the lack of human contact soon became punishingly apparent, especially when it came to seeing my best friend.Normally we would see each other at least once a week but now I didn’t know when that would happen again. For him, the outside world had become truly treacherous because he is immunocompromised. Perhaps due to his powerlessness against an invisible threat, he started exercising from home, and the results were immediately apparent. On our weekly video calls I could see him bulking up, filling the picture frame increasingly each time. Each time he would try and convince me to workout with him.Eventually I relented, mainly out of boredom. I balanced my phone on the kitchen table and we started doing pushups, sit-ups and jumping jacks over video call. It was excruciating. Those familiar feelings of exhaustion and inadequacy bubbled to the surface, telling me to quit. Yet, glancing up at the screen and seeing my friend, miles away, sweating with me and cheering me on, it was just enough to keep me going.Soon we were having video call workout sessions at least every other day. I thought I was doing a selfless act, giving him a sense of structure while he was stuck at home, yet a month into our regime I realized I was the one looking forward to the workouts. I was starting to notice myself in the mirror and not feel apathetic about what I saw – I was even enjoying the process that had gotten me there. On one particularly humid afternoon we dragged ourselves through an hour of 1,000 reps, and that familiar exhaustion became something to savor – a badge of honor rather than an aftertaste of failure.Working out had become a vital lifeline to my friend, empowering him in the face of an anxiety-inducing virus. But it had also allowed me to feel embodied for the first time in my life. Exercise had stopped being a vain activity I had condescendingly convinced myself I was above. It was an enlivening reminder of the very stuff of my existence. This brown skin had become a nice place to live in.Now, just to tackle that somersault once and for all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d3eab4723d10ba78b826c1611af7cb1b0b5aaadf/0_89_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=e53e6551cf9a95780b9c38eafade03ef","title":"a new normal how has working from home been for you","story":"We’d like to hear from  readers for a video series about what’s next in the world of work In our video series, A new normal, we ask  readers what they want a future shaped by Covid-19 to look like.

Its lyrics make reference to demonstrations: “Tell the ol’ boys in the white bread lobby  What they can and can’t do with their bodies  Temperatures risin’ cities are sinkin’”.The word Dixie is derived from Jeremiah Dixon, who in the 1760s gave his name to the Mason-Dixon, which came to demarcate the northern and southern states in the eastern US. There is no strict definition of the Dixie region, but it is usually used to describe the 11 slave-holding states that seceded in 1861 to form the Confederacy and were later defeated in the American civil war.There has been no announcement from the group explaining the change, beyond an unattributed quote in a press release: “If your voice held no power, they wouldn’t try to silence you.”The group originally took their name from Dixie Chicken, an album by US rock band Little Feat, when they formed in 1989.Their decision comes amid a reckoning about outdated or racist terminology and imagery in the US, as civil rights movements intensify efforts in the wake of the killing of George Floyd and others.Earlier in June another country group, Lady Antebellum, changed their name to Lady A, as “antebellum” is used to describe the slave-holding southern US before the civil war. In a statement, the group said they were “regretful and embarrassed to say that we did not take into account the associations that weigh down this word”.March March also makes reference to US school shootings, and the anti-gun demonstrations of Emma González and other young activists: “Brenda’s packin’ heat cuz she don’t like Mondays  Underpaid teacher policing the hallways … Standing with Emma and our sons and daughters  Watchin’ our youth have to solve our problems  I’ll follow them so who’s comin’ with me.”The Chicks are gearing up to release Gaslighter, their first studio album since 2006, on 17 July. Their three most recent albums have all topped the US charts. The group received widespread opprobrium in the country music scene for criticising George W Bush in 2003 over the invasion of Iraq, including death threats, and being blacklisted by many country music radio stations."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d229d509db5e27307384832dbec9d2536c91157a/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16369efe30e1d279514f6c50aa5ee61e","title":"from bowie to beyonce glastonburys 50 greatest moments","story":"Although Covid-19 scuppered Glastonbury’s 50th anniversary, organisers Michael and Emily Eavis discuss the moments that made it the world’s greatest festival – from the healing fields to StormzyGlastonbury festival’s first ever booking came from Michael Eavis serenading his cows with the Kinks. “I was playing Lola to them through a sound system in the milking parlour,” he says. “I’d been to Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music at Shepton Mallet showground, wandering in on the Sunday because there was no fence left by then. I was totally inspired. Jean and I had just fallen in love and we were all loved up, among all those bands and millions of people … I’d never seen a hippy in my life before – the boys and girls all looked the same! From that, I was determined to do an event of my own. I had a better site, facing Glastonbury Tor in the vale of Avalon – it was all a bit romantic.“So I phoned the Kinks and booked them for £500. My favourite band coming to the farm! It was an amazing feeling. Then there was a story in Melody Maker that said: ‘Kinks for mini-festival’. The band didn’t like that: they were No 1 across the world, why were they doing a “mini festival”? So they pulled out. I’d already sold 100 tickets, so I felt very guilty. But the same agent said his mates had got T.Rex going down to Minehead Butlins, which is on the route. They did it for the same 500 quid. So I was saved by Marc Bolan, really.”“I attracted quite a lot of trendy hippies,” Eavis says. Two of them were Arabella Churchill and Andrew Kerr, who had read John Michell’s 1969 book The New View Over Atlantis, “which had Glastonbury as the new Jerusalem – he wrote about leylines and all sorts of silly things. A lovely fellow: an Etonian, old-school British with a stiff upper lip, but also a hippy. Andrew and Arabella put the two together: Michell’s book and my farm.” They worked together on a free festival, with David Bowie, Joan Baez and more. “Arabella and Andrew ran out of money so I had to carry the can for it in the end. I was getting more and more worse off.”Eavis hosted free festivals on the farm throughout the 1970s. “The police were bringing all the waifs and strays off the side of the road and into my place as somewhere to dump them, and I didn’t seem to mind, so we had a party every year.” He started the festival up officially again in 1979. “We ran out of money and had to go to the bank to get £15,000 to see that one through,” he says. The bank now had the deeds to the farm, and it would be theirs if he kept losing money. “But I was keen to carry on.”Eavis steadied the ship by joining forces with the anti-nuclear campaigners CND, initially naming the festival after the organisation. “They picked up 300,000 posters and stuffed them into envelopes, so people suddenly knew who we were. We took the costs, CND took the balance, and they ended up with £20,000, a fortune in those days.”Eavis calls this one of his favourite years, for the performances by Jackson Browne and Van Morrison, but also for the growing scale. “Sixty thousand people turned up to that – we were looking at fives and 10s before. The CND thing helped, and I attracted a lot of people who were anti-Thatcher, so I’ve got Maggie to thank for our success in a way. We had out-of-work miners working on the security fence, from Maggie closing down the mines.”The NME’s review of Glasto 83 is wonderfully snooty – the crowd are regarded as “sun-soaking slabs of human tripe” – but even they were entranced by Mayfield: “It took one song from this wondrous man to discover the unearthed treasures of the Pyramid.” One of the most incongruous fashion choices in Glastonbury history came when Paul Weller performed with the Style Council amid mud in a bright white suit. “It seemed a bit at odds anyway, a band like us doing Glasto,” Weller tells me. “There was a post-apocalyptic fashion look, a lot of anarchists. It was just a mudbath, like something out of the first world war, and I had to resort to wellies. We felt out of our depth, so we got straight on the Pernod. By the time we went on I was completely gone. I realised I couldn’t play properly, so I put my guitar down and just sang instead. All the anarchists down the front were chucking mud, but because I was even more out of it than the audience was, I think we won them over. We played Long Hot Summer, which was really taking the piss – it was pouring down with rain – but everyone seemed to see the funny side of it, and it ended up all right. The suit was fucked up, though.”Dedicated to esoteric therapies, the healing fields opened in the mid-80s and are still going strong. In 2019, the  spoke to a couple of gong bath practitioners who had managed to see just one music performance in 15 years.Backed by the then home secretary Michael Heseltine, the police cracked down violently on travellers who organised a free festival each year at Stonehenge, in a confrontation that was later called the Battle of the Beanfield. Eavis gave the travellers refuge as they fled west. “I put them in the field next door and they ran their own thing, with their own music. And it was free, even though I was doing a paying event on my farm. You had all these lovely posh girls from Hampstead coming down, and they all ploughed off to the hippy festival next door.“I quite enjoyed the hippies’ music and they did make me laugh,” he says. “I was just a dairy farmer, but I thought of them as friends. Being a dairy farmer in Somerset, milking and calving cows, some people do get depressed and kill themselves – it’s quite a lonely life, really. So this was an excitement that I’d imported, and they came on board and added a bit of extra spice to it. I was doing the Cure, Elvis Costello and stuff – and they came up with a new dimension in their music.”Those hippies turned out to be extraordinarily creative, and have come to define Glastonbury’s aesthetic. You can see it in the flame-belching creations of Arcadia or the cyberpunk shanty town of Shangri-La, but a large part is down to Mutoid Waste Company, who kicked off in 1987 with their Carhenge installation.Named by Rolling Stone as one of the 50 greatest concerts of the past 50 years, this headline show featured just two songs: CBB and Teacher Don’t Teach Me Nonsense. But what songs. Fela delivered solos on percussion, soprano sax and organ between statesmanlike vocal addresses, all over that inimitably tripping, rolling beat.The cordiality with the crusties dissolved in spectacular fashion. “They were selling too many drugs for my liking,” Eavis says. “I got a security firm from Wolverhampton who were all judo gold medallists, and they confiscated all their drugs. It got nasty in the end.” His daughter and now co-organiser Emily Eavis tells me she remembers “people running past the window with molotov cocktails and burning telegraph poles and blowing up Land Rovers. The fact we’re still here is miraculous.”“But all those people still work for me now, you know,” Michael continues. “They’re a very clever, creative crowd – never got proper jobs – and the things they build every year are unbelievable. And they get paid now – they weren’t paid in the mid-80s. So they’re a lot happier.”Every Glastonbury-goer will find themselves suddenly agog at a daredevil circus act, and the peak for this kind of eccentric performance was the French troupe Archaos in 1990. While they weren’t allowed to do some of their more outré material involving chainsaws and motorbikes, they still wowed with high-wire and trapeze from their base high up at the apex of the Pyramid stage.This festival-friendly addition to the megalithic structures that dot this part of the west of England is technically called the Swan Circle. Its designer, Ivan McBeth, conceived it while living on the Glastonbury site in a portable geodesic dome. “As the full moon rose over King’s Hill, my inspiration arrived,” he writes. “I was to build a stone temple whose prominent stones represented the major stars of the constellation Cygnus, the Swan. I experimented with my star map. It was not possible to make a circle of stones given the positions of the stars, but an egg would fit.” Anyone visiting his ovoid temple, “consciously or unconsciously, will be irrevocably changed by their interaction with spirit. Every year tens of thousands of people – pilgrims all – enter the Swan stone circle and fly on her back through Dreamtime, and experience transformation. Yo!” To be honest, flying on a swan through Dreamtime is positively vanilla compared with some of the stuff that goes on here at 5am on Monday morning.Rave culture reached Glastonbury with this epic dance happening. “It was the first dance field, where Shangri-La is now,” remembers Underworld’s Karl Hyde. “We set up on a two-storey tower in the middle of the field surrounded by a quadraphonic Funktion-One sound system – over two nights, DJs, live musicians and visual artists jammed, only stopping at the point we got taken over by a hardcore rave crew who, thankfully, got booed off by our crowd. Eight thousand people turned up to the last night, when we collectively played for 18 hours straight. By the time they asked us back, we were headlining the Other Stage.”The hippy-heavy crowd at Glastonbury were in thrall to the Levellers: swelled by gatecrashers, this is possibly the biggest-ever Glastonbury headliner crowd, estimated at 300,000 people. “Because it’s dark, you can’t actually see the crowd,” singer Mark Chadwick later said. “Except when they put the lights up between songs, and they look like a field of ploughed potatoes.”The BBC has long had the TV rights to Glastonbury, but it was Channel 4 that first broadcast from the festival, helping it go from hippy curiosity to British cultural heavyweight. An enterprising YouTuber has uploaded VHS-taped coverage, complete with sax-backed Tampax ads.“Hello, I’m Johnny Cash.” With those words, as ever, Cash launched into Folsom Prison Blues and cemented the Glastonbury tradition for legends to play on a Sunday afternoon. “I’ve seen a lot of people who are not like me,” he said in an on-site interview. “That’s all right. Everybody’s got the God-given right to be who they wanna be.” As good a maxim for Glastonbury as any.Having recently left Take That, Robbie Williams turned up to the festival with Oasis for the year that Britpop reached its zenith. Emily had just done her GCSEs and, in typical teenager fashion, was camping out in the fields well away from her parents. “We’d never really had a pop star here before, and there was such a buzz about Oasis too. It felt like a turning point in the festival’s history we captured what was happening in the outside world, culturally and musically.”Drafted into a headline slot after the Stone Roses pulled out due to John Squire breaking his collarbone, Pulp seized their moment and became pop stars with a common touch. “If a lanky get like me can do it, you can do it too,” Jarvis Cocker told the crowd. Emily calls it “one of my real musical turning points – when you’re 15 and standing in a field and watching those bands that mean so much to you, that was Pulp for me. It was a storming, incredible set.”Thanks to what was diplomatically described as “an unfortunate operational error”, the dance tent was flooded in gallons of excrement after the machine that was meant to be sucking up excess water did exactly the opposite. In perhaps the worst year for mud and rain ever, Radiohead hoisted the audience off the soaking ground. “A moment of transcendence: when it becomes something greater than a gig in a field, and turns into something that people talk about for a long time after,” Emily says. “It had this almighty resonance. People were probably feeling a bit stranded – it was Friday night and they had two more days of these extreme conditions tents were already sliding downhill. But this band came on and spoke to them.” Their monitors stopped working, so while it sounded great in the crowd, they couldn’t hear themselves playing. “There was a deep connection with the crowd, because both sides were vulnerable,” Emily says.Guitarist Ed O’Brien recalls: “It was the biggest gig we had ever done and would ever do for years. We were in flight-or-fight mode during the show itself as the monitors weren’t working. It was so emotionally charged up on stage that night and it wasn’t until Thom asked Andi our lighting director, to switch on the lights that we were finally able to get an idea of the sheer size of it. That was the only moment of euphoria. We thought we’d blown it when we walked offstage. But something happened that night.”Just one month before the festival, Jean Eavis died of cancer, aged 60. Michael and Emily led a memorial event during the festival, where a phoenix was burned with a brass acorn inside, and an oak tree was planted where it fell. “We were in a very delicate state,” she says. “But even though it was a sad year it was a real celebration of her life. The festival was due to end in 2000, but the amount of support we had made us think we could keep it going.“In the early days of the festival, it was very unpredictable and wild – every time you walked out there might be a pagan on the doorstep who’d had some kind of brainwave. A melting pot of people, and my mum was the anchor. She even held my dad down – he needed a bit of grounding because he got overexcited, running away with things. Back in the 80s, there were a lot of drug casualties because there were a lot more dealers on site, so after welfare had gone home, my mum would look after them. There would often be people there when I got home from school – she’d be giving them sweet tea, and wrapping them up in blankets. And then parents would call and ask us if we had their children – she would drop them off back to where they needed to go.”“Bowie’s agent, John Giddings, phoned me and said David wanted to play,” Michael says. “So I said: ‘What’s he doing now, can we listen to the stuff he’s playing?’ He was doing a show in Manchester Arena, so I took the kids up. We walked into the box in the arena, and people started cheering below, and I thought: ‘My God, how do they know who we are?’ Turns out Eric Cantona was just behind me. I didn’t really like the show – it was a very experimental stage in his life and he was all over the place. We didn’t know a single song. I thought: ‘What’s the point of going with this?’ I phoned John back and said: ‘Can’t he play some songs we know?’ So he said: ‘We’ll do another show in London for you, then, of all his hits.’ And we loved it – it was so good. I told John I could afford £90,000. John said: ‘Is that all? How are we going to tell David?’ Well, that’s your job, John. And it was a done deal. The whole crowd went crazy on it – it was a wonderful show.”This was a truly feral year, with gatecrashers in record numbers. “I wasn’t prepared,” Michael says. “The fence wasn’t good enough, the security was crap. So I was hauled over the coals by the police, who said: ‘You’ve got to get someone to organise your show. You’re a nice bloke and all that, but you couldn’t arrange something in a brewery, you know the saying?’ I said: ‘Fair enough. At least I can be guaranteed to get 150,000 people at the drop of a hat – I did get the knack of that!’” He hired Reading and Leeds promoter Melvin Benn to sort the operational side. “He used to work for me in the 80s I’d trained him up, in a way. Bless his heart, he convinced the police he could make it a lot better.”“I then had their agents saying the band weren’t ready for it: ‘Can’t they go on in the middle of the afternoon?’ No, they’re headlining. I thought these people were controlling his life, saying they weren’t fit for it. And they were fit for it, and did a wonderful job. And they went from strength to strength after that.”By pairing Hunter wellies with tiny shorts, Kate Moss invents the definitive British festival look – even for men – that is still going strong today.One of the hottest, most enthusiastically queued-for experiences in Glastonbury opens, an ultra-sweaty den of drag, disco and debauchery. “I was there at 5am last year, and I had never seen scenes like this in my life,” Emily says. “An incredible club in New York full of drag queens dancing all night: can this really be happening on Worthy Farm?”Glastonbury already had a Mad-Max-on-perry vibe about it, but was massively enhanced by the arrival of Arcadia. The collective’s Afterburner installation made it debut in 2007 and gradually grew legs and became a 50-tonne spider. “Anatomically, it was very incorrect – real spiders don’t have built-in fire cannons,” its creator, Pip Rush, brother of Mutoid Waste Company’s Joe, told the  last year. In 2019, it was replaced by a fire-breathing crane rescued from Bristol’s docks.The best views, the best secret sets – the Park stage is now a much-cherished gem. “We got a licence for 15,000 more people, so we asked a farmer if we could use a bit more of his land and start a new area,” Emily says. “I wanted the Park to be really random, musically – stuff which you wouldn’t see anywhere else. It’s got its own feel.”“I’m not having hip-hop at Glastonbury. It’s wrong.” This blinkered view from Noel Gallagher teed up one of the funniest moments in Glastonbury history: Jay-Z opening his headline performance with a sarcastic version of Wonderwall. When it segued into 99 Problems and onward, the energy levels never dipped.Under a blue sky turning pink, Leonard Cohen’s Hallelujah was a beautiful moment of secular communion. He took his hat off and held it to his chest, a gesture of awed respect for a Glastonbury crowd that always does singalongs better than any other festival.Emily calls this “a very emotional end to the weekend”, and how: Damon Albarn cried as he led his reunited band into a climatic This Is a Low. “That’s what we dreamed of, that sense of commune – we’d done it,” Albarn later said.“We can get Bob Dylan, and Johnny Cash why can’t we get Neil Young?” Emily thought. “And Springsteen as well. As it happened, they both said yes the same year. Although Jay-Z helped get Springsteen, to some degree, because the festival was a talking point in the US, which it hadn’t been before.“Neil Young walked on stage and looked like he was thinking, ‘Am I going to enjoy this?’ But by the end he was really smiling. It was such an amazing gig, definitely one of our best moments. Springsteen opened with Coma Girl, which is a song Joe Strummer wrote about Glastonbury. Playing that song, it personalised the set, made it different to a stadium show and made people feel like he really understood it. The power of Bruce when he goes for it is like nothing else – we were all blown away.”“We wanted to have a bigger area for late-night entertainment,” Emily says, “instead of just dancing outside a blanket stall.” This was the south-east “naughty” corner and Shangri-La, a kind of post-apocalyptic walk-through rave-cum-art-gallery, turned it into an otherworldly destination. Emily came up with the name because “my dad always called the farm Shangri-La. He didn’t really like going on holiday, and whenever we got back he always be like: ‘Aaah, Shangri-La, the best place on Earth!’”The Park has hosted plenty of big secret gigs, from Pulp to Foals, although the biggest coup of all was an acoustic set from Thom Yorke, with Johnny Greenwood turning up to play piano on Karma Police. The festival had changed enormously in the 10 years since Eavis was hauled up in front of the police – and Benn’s contribution was no longer needed. “Melvin was a marvellous chap but he was a control freak,” Michael says, picking this out as a key, if not strictly great, moment. “We didn’t need him any more, because we knew what we were doing. It was my show, and yet he was doing all the donkey work – he didn’t like that combination and said he didn’t enjoy coming down. I said, well, can we call it a day then? He was unhappy to go – we probably did fall out. But two jockeys on a horse doesn’t really work, does it? We’re best of friends now, though.”Beyoncé’s Vegas-style revue of a set, straddling power ballads, Prince and Etta James covers, a six-song Destiny’s Child medley and a version of Kings of Leon’s Sex on Fire, saw her make sure every single person in the 100,000-strong audience was having a good time. They responded with remarkable vocal dexterity in a raucous rendition of Irreplaceable.“Kate Moss and all those fashion icons were saying: ‘You want to get U2, they want to do it,’” Michael says. “Eventually I had a phone call to my kitchen from their agent, saying the band want to play. I picked the wrong day for the weather it did rain, but they did a wonderful set. Incredibly well-mannered, that lot.”In terms of crowd-pleasing headliners, the Rolling Stones have arguably never been topped. Read Mick Jagger’s memories of the performance here. If Johnny Cash set the trend for the Sunday-afternoon slot, Dolly supercharged it. “She’s the ultimate teatime legend,” Emily says. “So many different tribes came to see her. She talked about her upbringing on a farm and how she had this love for mud, and everyone warmed to her. In person, she was lovely, warm, friendly, and my kids were completely transfixed. Everything about her oozes perfection and grace, with her voice, and accent, and songs – it was like this magical person had arrived.”“The Dalai Lama was turning 80 that year, so we asked him to come,” Emily says. “We were thinking: who could give him a birthday cake? Patti Smith. Her gig was incredible – when she tripped over and said: “I’m a fucking animal!”, the crowd’s reaction was so good. Obviously I was on stage going, who put that lead there? But the energy was so high, she got the audience into a bit of a trance. I was thinking, we’ve got to bring on a birthday cake and the Dalai Lama now ... It was quite a contrast, but it worked really well. I enjoy bringing people in who people wouldn’t necessarily expect to see and giving them platforms to speak. Like David Attenborough, or Pussy Riot when they brought a tank in.”With Dave Grohl doing a Stone Roses and breaking his leg, forcing Foo Fighters to pull out of their headline slot, Florence Welch got called up to the biggest gig of her life. By keeping it percussion-free, and backed by brass and acoustic guitar, her cover of the Foos’ Times Like These kept the Pyramid crowd in a kind of suspended animation.At 78, Paul McCartney was set to be the oldest Pyramid stage headliner ever this year, although that’s still nearly a decade off the oldest person ever to play the stage: Burt Bacharach, aged 87. “To walk on to that Pyramid stage, at the 5pm slot, had to be one of the most exhilarating and nerve-wracking moments of my life,” the now 92-year-old tells me. “Daylight, where faces of so many people just seemed to stretch to foreverland. I’m so grateful for the experience.”On an afternoon battling some of Somerset’s most stinking weather, Mary J Blige gave life back to the Pyramid audience with a performance of physical and spiritual indefatigability, screaming in defiance and doing repeated jumping squats in high heels. It is raining? We hadn’t noticed.“Adele grew up coming to the festival. She’s a proper child of Glastonbury,” Emily says, picking the moment she persuaded the singer to headline as one of her greatest festival moments. “But if she wanted to do 20 stadiums, they would sell out. Some people need a headline slot – she just didn’t need to do it, and doing Glastonbury is a challenge, because of the size, and you’re not playing to your own audience. We looked at the crowd for Kanye from the side of the stage, and it was pretty incredible. I’d gone through a lot of shit to get there, it was stressful it was probably one of the most isive sets we’ve done, but I’m really glad we did it. There was a huge turnout and this really charged atmosphere. The excitement and energy you could feel in the field climbed all over your body – that feeling when you’re in a crowd waiting for something magnificent to happen. I said: ‘Are you gonna do this next year? You’ve got to do this!’ And she said yes, and we shook on it.”There was a dumbstruck mood on the morning after the Brexit vote, though once the music started up, it seemed to be quickly swept away. More than ever, Glastonbury felt like a cocoon from reality, one that people sealed themselves inside with even more determination. (Perhaps there were more Brexiteers than you might expect, too.) But the issue was addressed head on with grace and stunning power by PJ Harvey, who read John Donne’s 1624 poem No Man Is an Island: “Every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main … any man’s death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind.”At a snap general election earlier in the month, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, chomped into the Tory majority and forced them into a minority government. He took his victory lap at Glastonbury, drawing a vast crowd and telling them: “The elites got it wrong – politics is about the lives of all of us.” The “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn” chant sprang up throughout, and it felt like real change was in the air. Of course, it wasn’t to be, but the feeling endures that a whole swathe of young people had a political awakening here.One of the emotional high points of last year was Kylie, who had been forced to cancel in 2005 due to her breast cancer diagnosis. She finally got her moment. Chris Martin and Nick Cave guested, but Kylie’s joy – “I’ll never get you out of my head!” she told the crowd – is what really lingers.“It was such an overwhelming experience,” she says now. “I’ve never seen that many people in my life, let alone had the honour, and nerves, of performing for them. It was sensory overload, in the best way. All of the ‘experienced’ people who had advice for me before the show, they were all right: try to enjoy, feel the love, it will feel like for ever and then be over in a minute. It was, in short, one of the best experiences of my life. To feel that I had done enough in my career to be there in that moment. Also, to have the chance again, finally, after missing my headline opportunity in 2005, made it all the more emotional and a small personal triumph.”Emily offered Stormzy the headline slot back in 2017, after he blew her away on the Other Stage. “I’d never seen a live show like that before. This guy had so much talent and energy: everything we need right now on the Pyramid stage. His agent was like, really? And we said, yeah, definitely.“The 2019 set was a universal, incredible moment. Not only was it his performance, his delivery and how he was connecting to the audience, but the production stakes were high – I’ve never seen so many BMXs at the side of the stage before. It makes it worthwhile running a festival when you can have moments like that.“I walked off to tell him this was incredible – and he had had a different experience. He couldn’t hear himself on stage. People were saying no one could go in and see him. I said: ‘I need to tell him I’ve seen all sorts of gigs at Glastonbury, but I’ve never seen anything like that please let me in, I don’t want him leaving thinking that was a disaster.’ I literally held him, and told him how fucking brilliant it was, and he had to realise that. He wasn’t angry, he was just spinning. But he watched it back, and realised, and started smiling.“Despite all the criticism you get for doing things differently, all the negative stuff from other parts of the industry saying: ‘That’s ridiculous, he’s only got one album, he’s not ready’ – you’ve just got to create moments like that, otherwise it’s pointless, the whole thing. It would dissolve. But it made Glastonbury more exciting than it’s ever been.”• Kylie interview by Laura Snapes"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3095f6032b55f9daaf9696f8475070ece49cf2e/0_279_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?width=300\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d69fb408bec014e50e2842657d0f7995","title":"after a decade of austerity what now","story":"Columnist John Harris has spent the past decade touring the country and reporting on what devastating budget cuts have meant to communities.

I really wanted to make a difference.”Then Covid-19 struck, oil prices crashed, new projects were cancelled and Scotland was laid off. He is now working as a team member at the KFC restaurant in the Haudagain retail park, where he earns the minimum wage.“I earn in a week what I would have made in a day on the rig, but I can support my family and that is the main thing,” said Scotland, whose fiancee is expecting their second child in July. “I appreciate I have a job. Many don’t.”Since the start of the crisis, thousands of workers have been laid off in Aberdeen, which is the centre of the oil and gas industry in Europe. The town was already struggling to recover from a sharp fall in crude prices five years ago, as well as increasing social pressure to rein back on fossil fuels that are destabilising the climate.The pandemic looks likely to accelerate the shift towards renewable energy, but while this raises hopes for a greener future, it also throws up huge concerns about intergenerational injustice. Without government intervention, the young look set to take a double hit from the post-lockdown economic downturn and the energy transition.No age group is immune to the shift, but those closer to retirement are more likely to have a nest egg saved up from the golden era of North Sea oil.Timothy Robinson, 62, a petroleum geologist, has decided to retire early as a result of the coronavirus downturn, which he believes is likely to choke the revival of the oil industry in AberdeenIn terms of the economic fallout from Covid-19, Aberdeen is likely to be among the worst-affected cities in Britain. This is partly because it has so much to lose. The city has grown affluent thanks to its offshore expertise, which is in demand around the world. The population here are highly globalised, and many technicians and consultants fly off for several months of the year to do lucrative contract work on oil fields in Africa, South America or Asia.But a  callout to readers about the impact of coronavirus revealed a huge number of job losses that some say are barely covered in the media.Nicola Gardiner, an Aberdeen resident whose husband works in the oil and gas industry, explained how her once-prosperous home city had been affected. Chatting on wicker chairs in the spacious garden outside her traditional granite house, she said house prices had slumped, people were stuck in negative equity and there were no jobs. Efforts to ersify the local economy by attracting more tourists have been hit by delays to the £350m harbour development. Restaurants and hotels are empty.“It’s a domino effect here as ‘Aber-dream’ turns to ‘Aber-nightmare’,” she said. “There are bleak times ahead. That’s what happens when an industry is dying and a pandemic arrives.”On the seafront, seagulls circle noisily over roads and beaches that are considerably emptier than those along the coastline south of the border. A helicopter buzzes overhead, taking workers out to oil and gas platforms in the North Sea, but the number of such flights is far lower than six months ago. Andrew Duncan (not his real name) used to be a frequent passenger because he specialises in maintenance of drilling equipment. Last week he was laid off after more than five years’ employment at a major oil service company.He believes the Covid-19 crisis is being used by some firms as an excuse to accelerate restructuring plans. “I’m absolutely gutted. They went about it in an underhand, sneaky way,” he said. “I was treated as if I was just another asset, like a piece of equipment.”He asked for his name to be changed because a public complaint could undermine his chances of getting a new job in the close-knit oil town, but he is seething at his experience.He is worried about how he can provide for his wife and child. “This is just the beginning. The oil industry faces a perfect storm of lockdown, low prices and climate change,” he said. Now he is applying for jobs in the wind turbine industry and oil rig decommissioning. “That is the future,” he said. He is encouraged by the Scottish government’s plans to support workers left adrift in the shift from fossil fuels to renewables. “If they could help me with training as a wind turbine technician, that would give me an extra chance.”The Scottish government has gone further than the rest of the UK in preparing its economy and workforce for a shift to renewables. Rachel McEwen is part of the Just Transition commission, which has been advising the Scottish government on ways to shift from high-carbon to low-carbon industry with minimum social disruption. “The opportunities for injustice are endless. We must think where bad things will happen and get ahead of them,” she said.She is also chief sustainability officer in one of Scotland’s leading companies, SSE, which last month announced a £3bn investment in a new windfarm off the Angus coast, just south of Aberdeen. The 1,075MW facility will be the country’s biggest ever privately funded project. McEwen said the numbers would mean little unless there was a positive social impact. “Companies like us have pinned our whole being on finding profitable solutions to climate change. If that transition is unfair, you delegitimise it. So we have an interest in ensuring it is done in a thoughtful and just way.”The potential for wind energy is evident at the Balmedie sand dunes, a short drive outside town. Gusts off the North Sea billow through the marram grass, allow kite-surfers to soar above the breakers and spin the giant turbine blades of a windfarm that sits a short distance away from the coastline. Locals joke that these giant structures were built as close as possible to the Trump golf course to infuriate the US president. But they are part of a broader trend. Aberdeenshire is said to be the largest windfarm in Europe in terms of the number of on- and offshore turbines. This is a major reason why wind is now the cheapest form of energy in the UK and has provided a substantial portion of our electricity during lockdown.Colette Cohen, the chief executiveof the Oil and Gas Technology Centre in Aberdeen, is optimistic there will be more support for energy transition in Scotland.“From industry perspective and from government connections, I would say the only recovery is a green recovery. A lot of people have seen a better world and want a change,” she said. “It’s very exciting. It’s an amazing time to be involved in energy and technology.”Among the likely future developments are more offshore wind in the West Shetlands and the UK’s first hydrogen plant, which is expected within two years.But she warned there was likely to be a dip for between 18 months to three years, as the investment shifted direction. “That is the difficult time. That’s the worry. It is hard to see how we will navigate that effectively.”One element will be managing a generational shift: as boom-era oil workers retire and old rigs are decommissioned, opportunities for the young may be hard to find. Coronavirus has made that challenge even harder because it has shut down the service sector.This week Scotland’s advisory group of economic recovery recommended that the government provide a two-year job lifeline and training scheme for young people as part of £6bn in stimulus spending. “If we don’t intervene radically to transform our economy, inequalities will drastically widen, with long-term scarring for communities across the country and for our young people in particular,” said the chair of the group, Benny Higgins.It is a sensible step in keeping with Scotland’s more cautious – and successful – approach to dealing with the virus itself. The country, which continues with tighter lockdown restrictions than England, has fewer cases relative to its population and a faster falling rate of infections.This prudent approach of acknowledging risk and alleviating adversity may explain why even the worst-affected workers find reasons for hope. Mike Scotland said he was throwing himself full-hearted into his new job at KFC, as well as continuing work on the mental health and environmental charities he founded.“I get it when people say they are having a bad time, but that is not an excuse to give up. I am looking at this as a life lesson, a step outside my comfort zone,” he said. In the long run, he said, he believed his generation would get more opportunities because they were more familiar with technology and more open to new ideas than those who had come before them.“I think there are a lot of people who want to change and are ready to change.

People have had more time to be at home and to think,” he said. “We have to expect the worst and hope for the best.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7f395586547da441e4671d1f8081585df77940f/196_299_1869_1122/master/1869.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d967c7071d7e435751de35073a362884","title":"bluetooth or wifi a jargon free guide to connecting your audio to your smart devices","story":"Technology writer Holly Brockwell explains how to make the most of headphone-free listeningIn the streaming age, it’s easier than ever to connect up your tech so you can listen to all the best music and podcasts wherever you want, without wires trailing everywhere. If you’re one of Spotify’s 286 million monthly users, you’ve probably noticed an icon on your mobile app that looks like a computer monitor behind a speaker – that’s your portal to Spotify Connect, a super-simple way to play music on all your home tech devices, from your smart fridge to your laptop. But how does it work – and how does it stack up against other wireless streaming methods?Since 2018, Spotify Connect has been available for all users, however to be able to connect to every compatible device out there, you’ll need a Spotify Premium subscription. You can use it on your tablet, phone or computer as a kind of remote control to play what you want, where you want it – Spotify offers podcasts in addition to its extensive library of music. And unlike using a Bluetooth speaker, the music won’t stop if you receive a call.Using Spotify Connect is really easy. From the mobile app, choose something to play, then tap “devices available” underneath the song name. Next, tap the icon of a screen and a speaker, and you’ll get a list of all the Connect-compatible smart devices on your home network. You don’t have to add them, they appear automatically if they’re connected to wifi.The process on a computer is pretty similar: play something, then click the icon of a screen and a speaker in the bottom right of the app and choose your preferred device.There’s a vast range of compatible gadgets, so chances are that the device you want to play music on is on the list, but you can check here just in case.Once you’re streaming, you can use your phone or computer as normal: the audio comes directly from Spotify, not your device, so you can take calls and keep the music going. It doesn’t run your battery down, either.Moving the sound around is really straightforward: just tap a different device on the list and the music instantly continues there. This is especially handy when you’re moving rooms, or you need to switch away from the soundbar because someone wants to watch TV, for instance.And when it’s party time (after the pandemic, we might add!), use Spotify Connect to start a group session so that everyone can contribute to the playlist – another feature you can’t get with just Bluetooth or wifi. You’ll see the option to “Start a group session” at the bottom of your Spotify Connect device list, which gives you a code to share with friends so they can add their favourites.Bluetooth is an easy, near-universal wireless method of connecting one smart thing to another. That connection is called “pairing” and is usually simple to do – for instance, on many speakers, there’s a little button with the Bluetooth symbol (a stylised B that looks like a sideways pair of scissors) that you press to start sending out signals. Then, turn on Bluetooth via your phone, or whichever device you’re trying to connect to, scan for nearby Bluetooth gadgets and select your speaker from the list. The instructions vary slightly by device, so check the help files for yours if you’re stuck.Pairing is usually straightforward and only has to be done once – from then on it should work automatically. But Bluetooth does have its downsides too, the more distance there is between the music device and the speaker, the more chance there is for interference and sound drop out – something you don’t need to worry about with Spotify Connect. Thick walls can really mess up the connection too, as you’ll notice if you wander around the house with wireless headphones on.Bluetooth is the best choice for listening to music outside your home, because you can use it for portable speakers, car stereos and so on without needing to be close to a power socket or wifi router. However, it’s a real drain on the battery life of whatever device you’re streaming from.The connection can also be temperamental, varying on some devices more than others. If one of the gadgets you like to listen on often drops out, it’s worth trying a different method.Most devices that can play music, such as speakers, TVs, games consoles and even smartwatches have an app that helps you connect them to your home wifi network, and from there you can link up your streaming source.For instance, a smart speaker such as Google Home gets connected to wifi during setup, using its app. Once it’s ready, you just open the app settings and choose your preferred service for streaming music and podcasts, then start issuing voice commands – such as “OK Google, play Spotify”.The benefit of using wifi rather than Bluetooth is that you don’t have to worry about keeping your devices close together. As long as whatever’s playing the music is connected to wifi, you’re good – and you can use your phone for calls without cutting off the tunes.Spotify Connect runs on wifi, so you’ll see all these benefits, plus the added bonus that it will automatically seek out and connect with compatible devices. So if you are going to connect over wifi, it makes sense to do it via Spotify Connect.Spotify Premium gives you music without the interruptions.

The Banbury shop is an art lover’s paradise, full of watercolour brushes, lino sets, calligraphy pens and more. Upstairs there is a classroom where owner Barry Whitehouse delivers art classes for up to eight students.“My customers range from complete beginners to professional artists and my passion is to make art accessible and affordable to everyone,” says Whitehouse. “I know all my customers by name and many are retired or ‘recycled teenagers’ as I like to call them. It is wonderful to see the positive effects learning art has, such as mindfulness, confidence building and creating communities.”In January this year, The Artery celebrated its 10th year of trading and had been going from strength to strength. Forty different classes were available in the studio space at £12 each, plus there were strong sales from the shop. Whitehouse was also heavily involved in organising community events such as the Banbury art festival.But then Covid-19 hit and by late February he was seeing the effects.“Revenue dropped and so did footfall. My older students started cancelling classes due to health concerns. I needed a new business plan and fast because at that stage I didn’t even have an online shop,” he says.In March, he was forced to close his beloved shop and put his two part-time staff on furlough. Stuck at home like everyone else, Whitehouse started experimenting with streaming his classes online direct from his dining room via closed Facebook groups. The camera was trained on his easel and he offered step-by-step instructions just as he did in the real-life classes.“Those first few weeks were about getting my older students used to new technology,” he says. “For some, my classes were the only outside contact they got all week. It became a special time where they could connect and switch off from the stress of Covid-19 for a couple of hours.”Whitehouse charged a flat rate of £5 a class and by April had seven weekly classes available, covering watercolour, acrylics, drawing, and calligraphy. Initially the clientele were mostly current students but then he started to up his social media presence.He began by offering the occasional free paint-along sessions on the Artery Facebook page. To date those six sessions have now had more than 12,000 views, with his class on painting a bluebell wood in watercolour proving particularly popular. This resulted in new students signing up to his online classes from all across the UK as well as the US, South Africa, Australia and Canada.“I have gone from around 50 students pre-lockdown to several hundred now,” he says. “Some classes have 40-plus people in them. The students have created their own community by sharing their work and words of encouragement.”Whitehouse has also brought his shop online for the first time via a ShopAppy account. You can buy both art supplies and classes here. He is now sending parcels across the UK and sales are especially strong for products such as the watercolour brushes that students need for classes.“I personally deliver all local orders either on foot or in my car and often have a socially distanced chat,” says Whitehouse. “My customers love buying from a small local shop. Support from brands like Visa has been invaluable in raising awareness on shopping local and falling in love with our town centres again.”But now it’s all change again with government news that shops can reopen from 15 June. For Whitehouse though, while he will open up the shutters, it will be far from business as usual.“As the shop is so small, you can only safely have one person in there at a time. We’re opening for click and collect to begin with to keep everyone safe.”And as for the classes, Whitehouse says he will offer them face-to-face again once he is allowed, but they will also always be streamed online too.“The students see the same image and get the same instructions. It has made the classes so much more accessible, plus the recordings can be watched whenever and as many times as needed.”So an unexpected bonus of Covid-19 is that The Artery is actually busier than ever.“I always thought I’d need a bigger bricks and mortar classroom to grow my business. But the online world means my classes have opened up to so many more people across the world. They have become a crucial support lifeline,” says Whitehouse.“It is so wonderful that people are turning to creativity to help them get through this difficult period the world is currently facing and to see my small business grow at the same time has been incredibly rewarding.”Shop local.

Money for the next school year has not been confirmed, however, amid silence from government.The development comes amid continuing controversy over Boris Johnson’s decision not to include gyms and indoor leisure facilities as part of the reopening plans scheduled for England on 4 July.“In recent years the PE \u0026amp Sport Premium has supported primary schools in England to improve PE and sport, getting more young people active and enhancing their health and wellbeing,” the letter reads. “We, the undersigned, are very concerned that the PE \u0026amp Sport Premium funding has not been confirmed beyond this academic year. As a result, schools are being severely compromised in their ability to plan their support for young people’s physical and mental health.“We fear that any withdrawal of support for Physical Education and school sport at this critical time could be catastrophic for a generation of young people who have never needed them more.”The letter was also signed by Clare Balding, Lawrence Dallaglio and Martin Offiah among others and was distributed by the charity the Youth Sport Trust. The organisation had earlier this month written another open letter to the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, calling on him to confirm the premium, but says it received no reply.A lack of communication and clarity has been a consistent theme among the complaints raised by figures across the sporting and leisure industries this week as they were taken by surprise at the lack of announcement on reopening.Several bodies have said they had been expecting approval to reopen on 4 July only to be informed at the last minute that it would not be happening. Since then there have been several calls for more clarity, including from Dame Tanni Grey-Thompson who warned of “catastrophic” damage to physical health and wellbeing if there was no engagement from government.The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said in a statement: “We are continuing to work with representatives from the gym and leisure centre sectors on plans for a safe, phased reopening with the ambition for this to happen from mid-July, subject to public health guidance.“We need to make sure that plans are comprehensive with all risks minimised. We are fully committed to making sure the public can exercise and stay healthy, as outlined in our guidance for outdoor exercise.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “We want to make sure every child gets an active start in life, which is why we launched our ambitious School Sport and Activity Action Plan last year and reinforced the importance of PE and sport in our manifesto. The position for the PE and Sport premium in the 202021 academic year will be confirmed shortly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c5d27169235858917188a34a2f4ebecea7612f3/0_40_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b0bc7a69e961fde9cb0ad412bb9a8626","title":"nascar noose photo talladega bubba wallace","story":"Declaring “the noose was real”, Nascar officials on Thursday released a photo of the rope found in the garage stall of black driver Bubba Wallace that prompted a federal investigation that determined it had been there since last October.The incident has put racism front and center for the stock car series that two weeks ago banned the Confederate flag from its venues and races at Wallace’s urging. It also prompted criticism from some fans that Nascar had somehow overreacted – criticism Nascar has bristled at and cited in releasing the photo from Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama. The image was taken by Nascar security.“As you can see from the photo, the noose was real, as was our concern for Bubba,” Nascar president Steve Phelps said. “Based on the evidence we had, we thought our drivers – that one of our drivers had been threatened, a driver who had been extremely courageous in recent words and actions. It’s our responsibility to react and investigate, and that’s exactly what we did.”Nascar asked officials at every track to check their garages this week. Nascar said out of 1,684 garage stalls at 29 tracks, only 11 had a garage door pull-down rope tied in a knot. The only one fashioned in a noose was the one discovered Sunday by a crew member in Wallace’s No. 43 garage stall.Nascar moved quickly and by Monday, FBI agents were at the track. On Tuesday, authorities said the rope had been hanging there since last fall and thus was not a hate crime targeting the 26-year-old Wallace.US attorney Jay Town and FBI special agent in charge Johnnie Sharp Jr said “nobody could have known Mr. Wallace would be assigned” to that same stall.Wallace never saw the rope. He said Phelps came to see him Sunday night at the track with “tears running down his face.” He also told CNN: “ It was a noose. Whether it was tied in 2019 ... it is a noose. ”Phelps said Nascar had determined the noose was not in place when the October 2019 race weekend began but was created at some point during that weekend,” he said. “Given that timing and the garage access policies and procedures at the time, we were unfortunately unable to determine with any certainty who tied this rope in this manner or why it was done.”Nascar’s investigation is over, Phelps said, and cameras will be added to garages moving forward."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ca010547eaa26557841ed4e2594352f8406fb78/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b42cde843a8f6ae1d1019bc9fac457ed","title":"government publishes roadmap for englands theatres","story":"Industry leaders welcome plan but say they urgently need dates to plan their Covid-19 recoveryA five-stage roadmap to help get England’s beleaguered theatres, concert halls and arts centres back up and running has been published by the government.The performing arts has been one of the sectors worst-hit by the pandemic and will be one of the last to get back on its feet.Crucially, there was no mention of any extra money for the arts in a “roadmap” statement made on Thursday by the culture secretary, Oliver Dowden.Industry leaders welcomed the announcement but said it needed to have dates so the sector can plan for the future.The playwright James Graham called it “a reassuring flicker of light within darkness”, but added: “What is still missing of course is any investment package to be able to actually do it and, without that, we can be in no doubt that the entire theatre ecology is on the verge of absolute and total collapse.”Dowden said: “I desperately want to raise the curtain on live performances in theatres and music venues as soon as we can – they are the soul of our nation and a linchpinof our world-beating creative industries.“We know the challenges – theatres must be full to make money, and performers need to be safe on stage as they sing, dance and play instruments – but I am determined to ensure the performing arts do not stay closed any longer than is absolutely necessary to protect public health.”Dowden pointed to the success of a roadmap to get elite sport, such as football, up and running and said that phased approach would be used for performing arts.“Whilst the challenges facing performing arts are numerous, we must have clear steps to follow and provide as much certainty as we can.”The first two phases of the roadmap are already allowable: physically distanced rehearsal and training with no audiences and physically distanced performances for broadcast and recording purposes.In that second category is a series of performances by Claire Foy and Matt Smith at the Old Vic in the hit play Lungs. From 26 June it will be performed to an empty auditorium and livestreamed to a paying online audience. The theatre, which does not get public subsidy, has described its financial situation as “seriously perilous”.The third stage of the roadmap is allowing “performances outdoors with an audience plus pilots for indoor performances with a limited distance audience”.Stage four is “performances allowed indoorsoutdoors (but with a limited distance audience)”.Julian Bird, chief executive of the Society of London TheatreUK Theatre, welcomed the roadmap but said “it is essential that government gives indicative ‘no earlier’ than dates for stages 3 to 5 now so that the sector can plan for the future”.With no information, theatres and producers “will have to assume a worst-case scenario and plan to be shut for long period. With the rest of the economy reopening quickly, we firmly believe that with the right safety processes in place, we can get back to full audiences in theatres within months. We now need government to confirm this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b941580b6efbc1dd52175b870e39d8e4f4095a96/0_182_3154_1892/master/3154.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=8fc14a7972ec86ecf8cf97f23372e469","title":"hottest front room seats the best theatre and dance to watch online","story":"From live-streams of new plays to classics from the archive, here are some of the top shows online now or coming soon – this page is updated dailyLockdown laughs: where to watch online comedyThe National Theatre at Home initiative has reached a huge global audience, with productions streamed for free online on Thursdays at 7pm and then available for seven days.

Withings Sleep Analyzer records your sleep and heart rate, plus is one of the first devices to monitor sleep apnoea, all without you needing to attach anything to your person.Instead, the £120 Sleep Analyzer is a sensor-packed slim mat that you slide under your mattress. Once it’s there you simply go to sleep as normal.The mat is 637mm long, 190mm wide and only 5mm thick, so easily slides between your mattress and base (including slatted bases), positioned around where your chest lies. It tracks your breathing, heart rate and movement with a pneumatic sensor, and your snoring and sleep apnoea with a sound sensor. It then syncs the data via wifi to your Withings account and the accompanying Health Mate app when you get up.Set up is simple using Health Mate on iOS or Android. Put the mat in place, plug it in, find the mat via Bluetooth in the app and then wait for it to inflate and calibrate. The process takes about five minutes.You can’t feel it in bed and can barely see it, as just a thin USB power cable pokes out from under your mattress, which plugs into an adapter. The cable is long enough to stretch to the nearest plug, even if it’s on the other side of the bed.The tracking is automatic, so all you have to do is get into bed and sleep as you usually would, which is the beauty of the Sleep Analyzer system. You can completely forget about it and just pick up your data when you need it.Your data is securely synced and stored in your Withings account, but can be synced from there with other apps and combined with fitness data such as steps from Google Fit and Apple Health, among others.You get a colour-coded graph showing your periods of being awake, in light, deep and REM (when you dream) sleep over time, an overall sleep score each night out of 100 and a rating in words, such as “restful night”. But you also get data broken down into sections including duration, depth, regularity, the number of times your sleep has been interrupted, the time it took you to go to sleep and the time it took you to get up after waking.Each section has a traffic light system: green dot for good, orange for average and red if it’s been a bad night. They can be expanded for more information, too, such as a range of what was good and bad, comparisons with previous nights and some simple advice.Those are the basics of most sleep trackers and the Withings matches the data from various other wrist-borne sleep trackers including Garmin and Samsung watches pretty well. The Health Mate app presents the data in a way that makes it fairly easy to follow what happened overnight, and gives an average of sleep scores and sleep time over the last week or month. What it doesn’t do is provide much in the way of guidance on how to improve your sleep beyond the most obvious things, such as maintaining regular hours, keeping noises to a minimum in the bedroom and the temperature low.Beyond basic sleep stats, the Sleep Analyzer also measures your sleeping heart rate, with an accuracy matching wrist-borne heart rate monitors, as a good measure of overall health: the lower the better to a point.You can see a chart of your heart rate for the night, but also see the trend over the last quarter. My average sleep heart rate has decreased by two beats a minute over the last quarter, for instance. Here Withings has more advice covering health, fitness, diet and other bits, which can help you find out why your sleeping heart rate might be high.You can also spot things in your own charts. I can see, for instance, when I’ve been ill as my sleeping heart rate is higher than normal across the full night, or when I’ve drunk alcohol in the evening as my heart rate starts higher then tapers back down to normal as the night progresses.The Sleep Analyzer’s killer feature, which few other devices can offer, is tracking of sleep apnoea, something Withings recently got regulatory approval in the EU to implement.Sleep apnoea is a condition where breathing becomes more difficult when you’re asleep due to the relaxation of the muscles in your throat, which can lead to you to stop breathing. The result is a disturbed sleep where you’re often jolted at least partially awake to breathe again.For many this may happen occasionally in the night, but for some it can happen as much as 20 times an hour, which does your sleep no good at all. Many may be completely oblivious this is happening too.Each night the Sleep Analyzer watches for signs of sleep apnoea, recording events as well as snoring, which can be a precursor. The data is then presented to you on a sliding scale of normal to mild, moderate and severe. My highest over the last couple of months has been 11 events an hour, which was rated as normal to mild, but most nights are symptomless. I also don’t snore very often, but when I have the tracker has picked it up reliably.You can view your data over the last day, quarter or year, to keep an eye on it. But if the tracker detects enough sleep apnoea events it will recommend a couple of tests to estimate your risk, give you guidance on the symptoms, advice on how to improve things and lets you share a report with your doctor should medical help be needed.It’s worth noting that some wrist-borne fitness trackers with blood oxygen sensors can also track sleep apnoea events by measuring the dip in oxygen in your blood associated with them.The Withings Sleep Analyzer is a sleep tracking mat that’s simply easy to live with. Stick it under your mattress and go to sleep. It works automatically. You can’t feel it, nor do you have to wear or charge anything.The data it produces is good and the way it’s presented in the excellent Health Mate app is easy to follow and track across days, weeks or quarters. Sleep heart rate data is interesting and the ability to track both snoring and sleep apnoea without having to wear anything is the mat’s killer feature.The app provides some good information around heart rate and sleep apnoea, what it means and how to improve it, but it could do with some more effective guidance on how to turn around a trend of bad sleep, rather than letting the user work it out from graphs and stats.With sleep tracking built into many wearables, you might wonder why you need a purpose-built gadget for it. Really the Sleep Analyzer is for those who, like me, don’t like wearing devices or watches overnight. It’s not cheap, but the Withings Sleep Analyzer works great with the minimum of fuss if you want to track your sleep.Pros: comprehensive sleep tracking, nothing to wear, very easy to live with, fits most beds, tracks heart rate, monitors sleep apnoea, syncs over wifiCons: expensive, guidance on how to improve sleep could be better This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Cases are now rising in 27 US states, up from 22 earlier this week.The CDC’s new estimate that for every diagnosis of coronavirus in the US it is likely that 10 more people are or have been infected is based on serology testing used to determine the presence of antibodies that show whether an inidual has had the disease, the officials said.The officials, speaking to a small group of reporters on Wednesday night, said the estimate was based on the number of known cases, currently nearing 2.4m in the US, multiplied by the average rate of antibodies seen from the serology tests, about an average of 10 to one.“If you multiply the cases by that ratio, that’s where you get that 20 million figure,” said one official.If true, the estimate would suggest the percentage of US deaths from the disease is lower than thought. More than 122,000 Americans have died from the disease since the pandemic erupted earlier this year.The estimate comes as government officials note that many new cases are showing up in young people who do not exhibit symptoms and may not know they have it.Officials said young people with no symptoms, but who are in regular contact with vulnerable populations, should proactively get tested to make sure they do not spread it.“We have heard from Florida and Texas that roughly half of the new cases that are reporting are people under the age of 35, and many of them are asymptomatic,” one official said.The CDC has sent 40 response teams to help deal with the outbreaks, they said.More than 36,000 new cases of Covid-19 were recorded nationwide on Wednesday, just shy of the record 36,426 on 24 April, at the height of the first wave of the pandemic. The rises are concentrated on states that were spared the brunt of the initial outbreak or which moved early to lift restrictions aimed at curbing the virus’ spread.Heavily populated Florida, Texas and California have seen dramatic rises in cases this month.The state has witnessed an alarming jump in cases as communities reopen from lockdown restrictions. Los Angeles county now leads the nation with more than 88,500 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University.Numbers have shot upward in recent days, rising from 4,230 on Sunday to 7,149 by Tuesday, according to public health data. Last week Newsom announced Californians must wear masks in most public settings to curb the spread of the virusMeanwhile as of Thursday morning, Texas is pausing all additional reopening, as the state grapples with a surge of infections.“As we experience an increase in both positive Covid-19 cases and hospitalizations, we are focused on strategies that slow the spread of this virus while also allowing Texans to continue earning a paycheck to support their families,” the Republican governor, Greg Abbott, said in a statement.“The last thing we want to do as a state is go backwards and close down businesses. This temporary pause will help our state corral the spread until we can safely enter the next phase of opening our state for business.”Abbott announced earlier today that all hospitals in Harris, Travis, Bexar and Dallas counties must also stop elective surgeries, as many hospitals report their intensive care units are nearing full capacity.If the current Texas infection rate continues, Houston could become the hardest-hit city in the US, CNN reported. Infection numbers are also rising in Dallas, Austin and San Antonio, Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, told CNN.“The big metro areas seem to be rising very quickly and some of the models are on the verge of being apocalyptic,” he said.Texas officials reported yesterday that they had confirmed 5,551 new cases of coronavirus in the past 24 hours, setting a new single-day record.In contrast, New York state, previously the world’s worst coronavirus hotspot, has kept tight restrictions in place and seen its hospitalization and death rates decline steadily in recent weeks.Meanwhile officials across the US have reacted with alarm to the Trump administration’s plan to end federal support for some Covid-19 testing sites, warning it could cause further spread of a disease and calling the move “irresponsible”.The White House confirmed on Wednesday it will no longer fund 13 testing sites, including seven in Texas and sites in Illinois, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Colorado, at the end of June.Joe Biden, speaking in Pennsylvania, accused Trump of mishandling the US response to the pandemic. “He’s like a child who can’t believe this has happened to him,” Biden said on Thursday. “All his whining and self-pity. Well, this pandemic didn’t happen to him it happened to all of us. And his job isn’t to whine about it. His job is to do something about it.”Biden criticized Trump for continuing to attack the Affordable Care Act as the country grapples with this crisis. The administration, for example, is still part of a lawsuit aimed at overturning the ACA, also known as Obamacare.“If Donald Trump refuses to end his senseless crusade against health coverage, I look forward to ending it for him,” the former vice-president said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/31bb4a39a7f491ff17d9ad4d7179745bf28444e7/0_0_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24bc9dbecf8c6aff4f908fd0e4fb9b79","title":"major incident declared as people flock to england south coast","story":"Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council says services are ‘completely overstretched’ as visitors defy advice to stay awayA major incident was declared after tens of thousands of people defied pleas to stay away and descended in their droves on beaches in Bournemouth and other stretches of the Dorset coast.The local authority, BCP council – covering Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole – said it was forced to instigate a multi-agency emergency response to tackle issues ranging from overcrowding on the beaches, traffic gridlock and violence. Security guards had to be used to protect refuse collection teams.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said on TalkRadio that he had the power to close the beaches if people did not respect social-distancing rules.He said he was “reluctant” to go down that route as “people have had a pretty tough lockdown”. But he added that if there was a spike in the number of coronavirus cases “then we will take action”.The Bournemouth East MP, Tobias Ellwood, said half a million people had flocked to the beaches and said the situation was so overwhelming that the UK government should step in to help the council deal with the crisis.He said: “A lot of people have chosen to be not just irresponsible but dangerous. We’ve made such progress tackling this pandemic. I’d hate to see Bournemouth be the one place in Britain that gets that second spike.”“The irresponsible behaviour and actions of so many people is just shocking and our services are stretched to the absolute hilt trying to keep everyone safe. We have had no choice but to declare a major incident and initiate an emergency response.“The numbers of people descending down here are like those seen on a bank holiday. We are not in a position to welcome visitors in these numbers now. Please do not come.”The council said services were left “completely overstretched” as visitors arrived in huge volumes resulting in widespread illegal parking, gridlock on roads, excessive waste, antisocial behaviour including excessive drinking and fights and prohibited overnight camping.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, threatened to close beaches if physical distancing laws were not adhered to.“We do have that power,’ he told Talk Radio. “I am reluctant to use it because people have had a pretty tough lockdown and I want everybody to be able to enjoy the sunshine.“But the key is to do it with respect for the rules – stay with your household, stay a good distance from other households.“But we do have those powers and if we see a spike in the number of cases then we will take action.”The chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, urged people to follow physical distancing rules in the hot weather or risk causing a spike in coronavirus.He wrote on Twitter: “If we do not follow social distancing guidance then cases will rise again. Naturally people will want to enjoy the sun but we need to do so in a way that is safe for all.”Some motorists had to queue for two hours to get into Bournemouth and car parks were full by 9am on Thursday. BCP council issued 558 parking enforcement fines within a few hours – the highest ever. Families had travelled from as far afield as London and Birmingham to the beaches in Dorset.People queued for 30 minutes at ice-cream vans and refreshment stalls on the promenade as a police helicopter hovered overhead. At one point a dozen police officers and security guards stepped in as tempers briefly flared between two sets of teenagers.Phil Horton, 57, from Bournemouth, who works in the timber trade, said: “The number of people here makes me very nervous, and there’s absolutely no respect for social distancing. It seems like everyone has forgotten we are living in a pandemic.“What can the police do about it? There’s thousands and thousands of people here so they’re massively outnumbered. Good luck telling them to go home.”Rickie Inskip, a sports therapist, unfurled a banner reading: “Don’t be mean, keep the beach clean.” He used a siren and megaphone to get the attention of the beach and told them: “We love the fact you come to our beach but please don’t leave your rubbish because it was in a disgusting state last night. We urge you to keep the beach clean.”The council said refuse crews suffered abuse and intimidation as they attempted to empty overflowing bins on the seafront. Security was put in place to protect them as they collected more than 40 tonnes of rubbish.Extra police patrols were put on. Sam de Reya, Dorset police assistant chief constable, said: “These are unprecedented times and we are urging people to stay away from the area of Bournemouth beach and other Dorset beaches.“The declaration of a major incident allows us to bring agencies together so we can take actions available to us to safeguard the public as much as possible.“We are also reliant on people taking personal responsibility and strongly advise members of the public to think twice before heading to the area. Clearly we are still in a public health crisis and such a significant volume of people heading to one area places a further strain on emergency services resources.”Ellwood said it was a pity the government’s daily Covid-19 briefings had been halted as these could be a way of getting out quick, clear messages when issues like this crop up. He also said warning signs should be set up on the main roads and railway stations to warn people that the resort was already full.He said: “Bournemouth is deluged with visitors and the local authority cannot cope. We have the perfect storm of incredible weather and a liberation of some Covid-19 guidelines and given the wider consequences of a second spike, the government needs to offer assistance and respond to this dangerous event.“When you have mass demonstrations in London the politan police can call on other forces to help and I think this is what needs to happen here. The police locally are overwhelmed, they cannot be everywhere.”Stephen Allen, a resident of Sandbanks, said: “It is the illegal camping that gets us. You see people coming out of their tents in their pyjamas and head off into the sand tunes with toilet roll. It is very unpleasant.“There has been illegal parking happening all over the place. Cars have parked on cycle lanes, double yellow lines and on the pavements. They would happily take a £35 parking fine rather than queue for hours on end.”Along the Dorset coast at Lulworth, Cllr Laura Miller told of the abuse she received when she tried to turn people away. She said: “I have been shouted and sworn at and one guy spat at me.“These are people who have travelled three or four hours in their car, they are hot and grumpy and then they are turned away. Some drivers have ignored our barriers and just knocked them over and driven through.”Police officers also seized music equipment and arrested five people at Formby beach on Wednesday afternoon after young people collected on the sand dunes.Merseyside police said five people were arrested for various offences including drunk and disorderly behaviour and possession of drugs, and a speaker and music equipment were seized.Police remained at Formby beach, as well as Ainsdale and Crosby beaches, parks and beauty spots including Formby nature reserve, on foot, in vehicles and on quad bikes.Ch Insp Andy Rankine said: “While we want everyone to enjoy themselves, antisocial behaviour and criminality will not be tolerated and Merseyside police will take action where necessary.”The local authority and police in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, continued to monitor the numbers at its beach.Cllr Ian Gilbert, leader of the borough council, said: “We are aware of the situation in Bournemouth. Although we are very busy and have our own challenges to deal with including antisocial behaviour and littering, we are not currently at a stage where we need to announce a major incident. However, we are keeping everything under constant review, and liaising regularly with our partners in emergency services.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/27b5187d0a5ef0c9764d461edaeb04b0a4a4a913/0_0_7557_4533/master/7557.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9a4762eb28e3a85d3b7a2cd759e19abe","title":"satellite images show chinese construction near site of india border clash","story":"Images of potential new camp in disputed territory raise fears of further conflict China has added new structures near the site of a deadly border clash with India, according to satellite imagery, raising the possibility of further conflict even as the two sides have pledged to disengage.Images taken on Monday by the US-based Maxar Technologies show what appear to be Chinese structures on a terrace overlooking the Galwan River, close to where Indian and Chinese military engaged in hand-to-hand combat for hours last week, resulting in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers. China has not released its casualties from the confrontation on 15 June.On Monday, Indian and Chinese military commanders agreed to step back from a weeks-old standoff at several locations along the disputed border.However, India acknowledged for the first time Thursday that it has matched China in massing troops in the region.The apparent buildup underlines the possibility that the peace will not hold.Amid the detente, Beijing has continued to blame Indian troops for triggering the clash, while Indian media have reported that the Chinese military attacked Indian soldiers with sticks encrusted with nails.India says the area where the structures have been built are on its side of the poorly defined Line of Actual Control, the de facto border between the two nuclear powers. China claims the whole of Galwan Valley, located at about 14,000ft (4,300 metres), as its territory.The construction includes camouflaged tents or covered structures against the base of a cliff and, a short distance away, a potential new camp under construction with walls or barricades.On the Indian side, defensive barriers can be seen in the latest images that were not visible in pictures taken in May. An Indian forward post appears to have been scaled back compared with images a month ago.China and India fought in 1962 and again in 1967 over the disputed border, but both sides have sought to avoid conflict since then.Indian military officials have said they will be closely monitoring the planned disengagement process and verifying it on the ground. Analysts have said China appears to be hardening its position, perhaps in an effort to distract from domestic problems as the Chinese economy struggles to recover from the coronavirus outbreak.“There is a trust deficit so far as the Chinese are concerned,” said Deepak Kapoor, a former Indian army chief. “So if they are telling us verbally they are ready to pull back, we will wait to see it on the ground. Until then the armed forces will be on alert.”In an editorial on Wednesday in the state-run Global Times, its editor, Hu Xijin, said: “The People’s Liberation Army has taught a lesson to the Indian side, which has always misjudged Chinese people’s determination and advantages.”He added in a post on Twitter: “Don’t mess with PLA otherwise they will teach you a heavier lesson.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8439c431e29d773304ad1d250fff4e05c8089f92/0_33_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=6023e05cdc3573fedcdd27a7a674d528","title":"friday briefing liverpool joy after first title for 30 years","story":"End of drought sparks scenes of wild celebration in the city … Hancock threat to close beaches … Long-Bailey sacking reopens Labour strifeMorning everyone. I’m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories today.Liverpool’s first league title for 30 years has sparked a night of wild celebrations on the city’s streets despite fears of mass gatherings setting off another spike in coronavirus infections. While the players did not have to break sweat to become top flight champions for the first time since 1990 thanks to Manchester City’s defeat at Chelsea, the club’s supporters more than made up for it with a night marked by singing, fireworks and flag-waving. However, police expressed concern that thousands of fans had ignored social-distancing rules by descending on the club’s ground, Anfield, to celebrate en masse. Asst Chief Const Rob Carden of Merseyside police said that while most had “recognised the fact that now is not the time to gather together”, not all had done so and urged people to celebrate safely. Follow the news from Liverpool and around the world, including from LeBron James, at our live blog.In an emotional television interview, manager Jurgen Klopp hailed an “incredible” moment for the club, which dominated English football in the 70s and 80s before being usurped by Manchester United.

The huge influx of people, many of whom were not abiding by social distancing rules, prompted the local council for Bournemouth, Poole and Christchurch to declare a major incident because emergency services were “completely overstretched”. Hancock told TalkRadio that he was reluctant to take drastic action but if there was a spike in the number of coronavirus cases “then we will take action”. He also announced new “walk through” testing centres for Covid-19, although hopes for more antibody testing might be dampened by a study of results in Asia that shows they have far lower accuracy if used within the first fortnight of coronavirus symptoms rather than a week or two later. Brain complications, including stroke and psychosis, have been linked to Covid-19 in another study that raises concerns about the lasting impact on some victims.In the United States, it is estimated that 20 million people have contracted the virus – 10 times more than the official count – according to the country’s disease control agency. On Thursday, 27 states reported a rise in new cases while Texas has paused the next phase of its reopening from lockdown. The famously Covid-sceptic Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro, says that although he has tested negative multiple times he may have had the disease after all. The country recorded almost 40,000 new cases yesterday. Swedes are losing confidence in their government’s handling of the crisis. The country has seen many more deaths than some other European neighbours after it stuck to a light-touch lockdown policy. Supermarkets in parts of Australia have begun rationing key supplies again amid panic-buying brought on by a spike in cases. You can follow all the overnight developments at our live blog.Labour turmoil – Keir Starmer has reignited Labour’s simmering civil war over the issue of antisemitism by sacking prominent leftwinger Rebecca Long-Bailey. The leader’s swift move against the shadow education secretary came after she sent an approving tweet about an interview in which the actor Maxine Peake said the US police tactic of kneeling on someone’s neck was taught by the Israeli secret service. The claim was denied by Israel and Peake withdrew the claim but by then Starmer had fired the woman he defeated in the leadership ballot earlier this year, saying she had shared an antisemitic “conspiracy theory”. There were reports last night that Starmer would meet left-leaning MPs on Friday to address their concerns. The sacking reopens the party’s wounds over the issue and comes after an internal report found that “hyperfactional” hostility to former leader Jeremy Corbyn hampered the party’s efforts to tackle the problem.Met inquiry – Two politan police officers have been arrested after an “inappropriate” photograph taken at the scene of the murder of two sisters in a London park was allegedly sent to a group of people that included members of the public. Nicole Smallman, 27, and Bibaa Henry, 46, the daughters of a prominent female Anglican cleric, were found stabbed to death near Wembley earlier this month. A criminal inquiry is under way into the conduct of the officers.Jenrick questions – Links to wealthy Tory donors continue to dog housing secretary Robert Jenrick after it emerged he met an Israeli businessman who had an interest in the future of a multibillion-pound project that the minister was overseeing. Whitehall records from March 2018 reveal that Jenrick, who was then exchequer secretary to the Treasury, met Idan Ofer, the ultimate owner of the mining company Cleveland Potash. Jenrick was assessing whether to offer state support for a new potash mine being built by a rival company, Sirius Minerals.London clashes – Police officers have been attacked by revellers after attempting to disperse crowds at an unlicensed music event in Notting Hill in west London. Scotland Yard said objects were thrown at officers dispersing the crowd at an event at Colville Gardens. It comes after similar clashes at a street party in Brixton on Wednesday evening, which Downing Street described as “appalling”.Period, period – A New Zealand supermarket chain is ditching euphemistic language such as “sanitary” or “feminine hygiene” products to describe pads, tampons and menstrual cups and replacing them with “period” in what it claims is a world first. No other local or international retailer used the word “period” to describe the products shoppers buy for menstruation, according to a spokesperson for Countdown, a major supermarket chain in New Zealand that operates 180 stores.Columnist John Harris has spent the past decade touring the country and reporting on what devastating budget cuts have meant to communities.

This season, writes Barney Ronay, Liverpool were simply operating on a different level. Elsewhere, Arsenal beat Southampton 2-0 thanks to goals from Eddie Nketiah and Joe Willock as Mikel Arteta’s side won for the first time after returning, while a second-half header from Jay Rodriguez gave Burnley a 1-0 win at Turf Moor that increases Watford’s relegation worries. Andy Murray’s fighting 6-3, 7-5 win over James Ward confirmed the core of his game – bloodymindedness – is firmly in place to reach the Battle of the Brits semi-finals. Sebastian Coe, the president of World Athletics, has warned Christian Coleman not to expect any special deals or favours that would allow him to return in time for the Tokyo Olympics if he is banned for missing anti-doping tests. Nascar officials have released a photo of the rope found in the garage stall of black driver Bubba Wallace and declared “the noose was real”. And the FA’s decision to vote against Australia and New Zealand’s winning Women’s World Cup bid has been labelled disrespectful by Football Federation Australia’s chief executive.Most of the first editions went to print too early to capture the celebrating Liverpool fans although the Times does have picture of flag-waving supporters on its front.

Witnesses said the blast came from the direction of Parchin, a major military site.Defence ministry spokesman Davoud Abdi told state TV the blast happened at a gas storage facility in a “public area” of Parchin rather than the military base. The fire had been put out and no casualties had been reported, he added, but gave no details about the cause of the blast.“Our colleagues are present on the ground and investigating the incident carefully,” Abdi said.Parchin is home to a sprawling military base where Iranian technicians were alleged to have tested high explosive components for a nuclear warhead in the early 200s, a claim Iran has denied.In 2014, the military site was suspected to have been damaged by a fire or explosion but investigations by the International Atomic Energy Agency were hampered by a lack of access.This is a developing news story, please check back for updates."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14bc6aaf3b53ad51f2e19beabd2f0813d8b7087f/0_162_4800_2880/master/4800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd22fc023502df216d3cf060d28ac46f","title":"new zealand supermarket chain countdown becomes first to use period label on menstrual products","story":"Shoppers at NZ supermarket chain Countdown will no longer see euphemistic language like ‘sanitary’ to describe pads, tampons and menstrual cupsShoppers at a New Zealand supermarket chain will no longer see euphemistic language like “sanitary” or “feminine hygiene” products to describe pads, tampons and menstrual cups after the chain said it would be the first in the world to use the word “period” to describe the items.No other local or international retailer used the word “period” to describe the products shoppers buy for menstruation, according to a spokesperson for Countdown, a major supermarket chain in New Zealand that operates 180 stores.“Words like ‘personal hygiene’ and ‘sanitary products’ give the impression that periods, which are an entirely natural part of life, are somehow something to hide to yourself, or that they’re unhygienic,” said Kiri Hannifin, the representative, in a statement. “They absolutely aren’t, and we can play an important role in helping change that.”Countdown’s online shopping platform would reflect the changes, she said, adding that products previously described as “intimate hygiene” would now be categorised as “genital washes and wipes”.Sarah Mikkelsen, a co-founder of the New Zealand charity The Period Place, was “surprised and excited” by the news.“It’s so political at the moment, taking a hardline approach around language,” she said. “So to see a big brand jump on a train that they haven’t really even been asked to jump onto is very cool, very inspiring.”The change follows the introduction of a New Zealand government policy to provide free period products in every high school in the country. The initiative was launched at 15 institutions this month, with all schools able to opt-in by next year.Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister, said at the time that nearly 95,000 nine-to-18-year-olds “may stay at home” during their periods because they could not afford items such as tampons and pads.Countdown is also changing its language used for products previously known as “incontinence” items, referring to them as “continence care” products instead, “to help break down the taboos and barriers that customers seeking out these products have too, particularly men,” said Hannifin, the spokesperson."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e066c47163e66ee19067b2569ff23981add8473/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1abbb10fc0737ede5061eef515ac6ace","title":"swedes rapidly losing trust in covid 19 strategy poll finds","story":"Political parties demand Sweden’s strategy be reviewed before next election in 2022Swedes are losing trust in authorities’ handling of the coronavirus, as the man behind the country’s light-touch approach called lockdowns a form of madness and political parties demanded the Swedish strategy be reviewed before the next election in 2022.“The differences are big enough that we can say with certainty that there has been a real change,” an Ipsos analyst, Nicklas Källebring, told the paper. “The view of authorities’ capabilities has taken a clear negative turn.”Unlike most EU countries, Sweden did not try to shut society down. It closed schools for the over-16s and banned gatherings of more than 50 people, but otherwise relied on Swedes’ sense of civic responsibility to observe physical distancing and home working guidelines. Shops, restaurants and gyms remained open.Authorities argued that public health should be viewed in the broadest sense, saying the kind of strict mandatory lockdowns imposed elsewhere were both unsustainable over the long run and could have serious secondary impacts including increased unemployment and mental health problems.“It was as if the world had gone mad and everything we had discussed was forgotten,” Anders Tegnell, Sweden’s chief epidemiologist and the man behind the strategy, told a Swedish Radio podcast on Wednesday. “The case became too many, and the political pressure got too great. And then Sweden stood there somewhat alone.”But while broadly supported by most Swedes, the policy, which Tegnell has said was aimed not at achieving herd immunity but at slowing the spread of the virus enough for health services to cope, was heavily criticised by many experts as the country’s death toll increased.Sweden’s 5,230 deaths translates to a toll per million inhabitants of 511, many times higher than the corresponding totals in neighbouring Denmark (104), Finland (59) and Norway (47), all of which imposed strict confinements – but lower than the 650 registered in the UK, Spain’s 606 and Italy’s 573.Sweden has also been slow to get its testing programme off the ground, with per capita rates significantly lower than many European countries – although the number of people tested for Covid-19 nearly doubled in June, hitting 60,000 last week.As a result, many European countries now opening up to tourism have barred Swedes from entry until 30 June, while to its considerable annoyance the county’s neighbours have also excluded it from a Nordic travel bubble.Tegnell conceded earlier this month that the country has had too many deaths – particularly in care homes – from Covid-19, should have done more to curb the spread of the virus, and would “do something in between what Sweden did and what the rest of the world has done” if confronted with the disease now.But he has also insisted that “the basic strategy worked well” and “based on the knowledge we had then, we feel we made the appropriate decisions”. Löfven has said the country’s overall approach was right but it had failed to protect care homes, where half of all Sweden’s Covid-19 deaths have occurred.Under opposition pressure, Löfven in May promised a wide-ranging independent review of Sweden’s coronavirus strategy looking into specific failings such as testing and care homes, as well as the general approach and subsequent decision-making.After a meeting of party leaders, the government has now undertaken to ensure the review is completed by early 2022, partly on the grounds that any lessons should be learned fast but also to make sure there was full accountability before the next parliamentary election due in September that year.“The government did the only thing reasonable. There were several parties demanding that this must absolutely be clear before the next election,” said the Moderate party leader, Ulf Kristersson."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af4201478abe45f333400a189a57ccd7d1c5c04e/0_78_2333_1400/master/2333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9614312d68c82cf71aea0dc956b410f7","title":"uk foreign office urged to secure safety of three human rights activists","story":"MPs are calling for intervention as the activists could be at risk from the Covid-19 outbreak The UK Foreign Office has been urged by a cross party group of British MPs to intervene to secure the safety of three prominent Gulf human rights activists, including Saudi women’s rights campaigner Loujain al-Hathloul, who are thought to be at risk from the coronavirus outbreak still present in prisons across the region.The MPs calling for a Foreign Office human rights intervention include the father of the house Peter Bottomley and they see the three cases as a test for the UK human rights policy in the coronavirus era. The letter coincides with the UN international day for victims of torture on Friday, and all three claim to have been tortured.Loujain’s sister Lina, who is based in Brussels, told the  that her family had spoken to her a fortnight ago, and she had expressed fears that she will not be able to speak to them again for many months.The campaigner for the women’s right to drive was arrested in May 2018 and although women can now drive in the kingdom, there appears no prospect of her release, or even proper trial.“One of the charges against her is meeting with a British embassy official in Riyadh, so I hope the foreign office realises it has a special responsibility to do everything to campaign for her,” Lina al-Hathoul said. “Her morale was very low psychologically. The last time she was not allowed to see anyone for three months she was tortured, so it is urgent to do more to campaign for her release.”Caroline Lucas, one of the MPs part of the cross party group, challenged the Foreign Office approach: “By refusing to speak out about the ongoing abuse of these brave iniduals, the government is once again putting its pursuit of preferential trade deals ahead of human rights. Its vision of a ‘Global Britain’ is looking like one where moral values are tossed aside in the name of political expediency.”Brendan O’Hara MP, Argyll \u0026amp Bute, chair of the all party group on Democracy and Human Rights in the Gulf said “with Brexit fast approaching, it is paramount that human rights are at the centre of UK foreign policy”.Loujain has been held in the Saudi Arabia’s maximum security al-Ha’ir prison complex near Riyadh for more than two years. Last year 13 UN experts called for her immediate release. Concern is also being expressed for Ahmed Mansoor,who was handed a 10-year sentence by the United Arab Emirates for “insulting the rank and reputation of the UAE and their symbols” and “disseminating false information to damage the United Arab Emirates’ reputation abroad”. Despite successive hunger strikes, he has been held in solitary confinement and is said to have neither a bed nor access to water.His state of health has deteriorated sharply, his supporters said. New coronavirus cases in the UAE have spiked up to 450 new cases per day and Human Rights Watch has reported outbreaks in UAE jails. Total deaths across the UAE has reached 307.The third activist for which concern is expressed by the MPs is Abduljalil Al Singace, a Bahrain activist sentenced to life for criticising the government. Bahraini activist, Maryam Al Khawaja, whose father Abdulhadi Al Khawaja is also at Jau Prison along with Al Singace, reported that there are confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the prison.King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa of Bahrain is thought to have presided over one of the most effective attempts to combat coronavirus with only 68 deaths, but there was a spike last week with new infections currently running at 550 per day.Partly on the advice of British public health advisers, the king has pardoned 901 prisoners while more than 500 more will be allowed to serve out their sentences outside prison."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f328304c69005ae04e64a48675b2f9c03ac4115/0_0_5624_3377/master/5624.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d713c9105dd136cc6210e5f004d6062","title":"coronavirus live news cases rise in 27 us states as cdc estimates 20m americans may have been infected","story":"Mike Pence to hold first coronavirus task force briefing in weeks on Friday Texas pauses next phase of reopening  Follow the latest updatesMexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Thursday suggested the tradition of women staying at home to take care of older family members was key to battling the coronavirus pandemic, sparking criticism his comments were sexist.This is not the first time the 66-year-old leader has been accused of making tone-deaf comments and lacking empathy towards women.“People want to change women’s role and that is one of the just causes of feminism, but the tradition in Mexico is that daughters are the ones who care the most for parents. We men are more detached,” Lopez Obrador said.Whereas seniors in nursing homes in Europe had suffered with the pandemic, Mexico’s elders were helped by the custom of being cared for at home, he said, adding that the “Mexican family is the most important social security institution” in the country.“Translating the president’s nineteenth century thinking when he says: men are more detached, he means irresponsible daughters take care of their parents, he’s referring to unpaid work tradition refers to machismo feminism wants to change roles, true transformation,” Martha Tagle, a lawmaker with the Citizen’s Movement party, said on Twitter.The hashtag AmloMachista, or sexist AMLO in reference to the president’s initials, was trending.Thousands of jubilant Liverpool supporters have spent the night celebrating the team’s first league title for 30 years, prompting warnings from police concerned about mass gatherings flouting social-distancing rules.As a huge crowd sang songs and let off flares outside Anfield, Merseyside police Asst Chief Cons Rob Carden said the region had been “disproportionately affected” by the coronavirus pandemic and its residents had a responsibility to prevent further cases.Australia will stick with plans to further ease coronavirus curbs, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Friday, despite a spike in infections in the second most populous state of Victoria.“There will be outbreaks and what matters is that we continue to build our capability to deal with those outbreaks,” Morrison told a media briefing in Canberra, the capital.Australia deployed ambulances and mobile test centres in a testing blitz across the southeastern state after a renewed outbreak of the respiratory disease there. On Friday, the state reported its tenth straight day of new cases in double digits.Swedes are losing trust in authorities’ handling of the coronavirus, as the man behind the country’s light-touch approach called lockdowns a form of madness and political parties demanded the Swedish strategy be reviewed before the next election in 2022.Australia’s Woolworths grocery store chain has just announced it will reintroduce countrywide buying limits on toilet paper, as panic buying resumes in some Australian states seemingly in the face of increased infections in the state of Victoria. There are currently no other product limits other than toilet paper and paper towel outside of Victoria. On Wednesday, Woolworths reinstated a purchase limit of two items in Victoria on toilet paper, hand sanitiser, paper towel, flour, sugar, pasta, mince, long-life milk, eggs and rice.The supermarket chain released this statement:Woolworths will this afternoon reinstate a two-pack limit on toilet paper and paper towel in all Australian stores following a recent surge in demand across different parts of the country.The precautionary move is designed to support appropriate social distancing in stores over the weekend and ensure all customers have access to the products they need ...Woolworths Supermarkets managing director Claire Peters said: “We’ve regrettably started to see elevated demand for toilet roll move outside Victoria in the past 24 hours.“While the demand is not at the same level as Victoria, we’re taking preventative action now to get ahead of any excessive buying this weekend and help maintain social distancing in our stores.Here are the key developments from the last few hours:South Korea reported 39 new cases, mostly from the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area where officials have been struggling to stem transmissions amid increased public activity and eased attitudes on social distancing. South Korea was considered an anti-virus success story after containing an outbreak during February and March surrounding the southeastern city of Daegu. However, the country has been seeing an uptick in new infections since authorities moved to ease social distancing guidelines and reopen schools starting in May. The update from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday brought national totals to 12,602 cases, including 282 deaths. Twelve of the new cases were linked to international arrivals.China reported a further decline in newly confirmed cases of the coronavirus on Friday, with 13 cases.Eleven were in Beijing, where mass testing has been carried out following an outbreak that appears to have been largely brought under control. The other two cases were brought by Chinese travelers from overseas, according to the National Health Council.No new deaths were reported and 389 people remained in treatment for Covid-19, with another 107 in isolation. Case numbers both nationally and in Beijing were down from Thursday. China has reported 4,634 Covid-19 deaths from 83,462 total cases.This month’s outbreak in Beijing has seen 260 people infected, most of them with links to the city’s biggest wholesale market, leading authorities to lock down some communities and cancel classes.Since then, 3 million test samples have been taken from 2.43 million people in the city.New regulations on managing risks to prevent additional outbreaks issued by China’s Cabinet, the State Council, include a demand that unreasonable restrictions beyond regular prevention and control measures in localities should be immediately corrected.It warned that measures that cause “vile influence” will be exposed in the media, the regulations state.Virgin Australia’s administrators say they will ask creditors to approve the sale of the stricken airline to US private equity group Bain Capital at a meeting in August.The administrators, partners at accounting firm Deloitte, said they signed a deal with Bain on Friday morning that would retain thousands of jobs and recapitalise the airline.However, neither Deloitte nor Bain would say how much Bain would pay, how many jobs would be kept by the new Virgin Australia or how much creditors owed $6.8bn would receive.The move came after rival bidder Cyrus Capital Partners dramatically quit the race on Friday morning, blasting the administrators for failing to engage with it and return phone calls.Meanwhile in Australia, buying of toilet paper has started again in Sydney, despite no sharp increase in cases, Channel 9 reports:Maybe people are trying to get their dogs’ TikTok careers off the ground?Or their cats’Or their own:Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. This is another tried and true Trump talking point, as he seeks to discourage mail-in voting and undermine its results, sowing doubt about the fairness of the 2020 Presidential election:As my colleague Sam Levine reported this week: In a tweet on Monday, Trump pointed to the fact that Americans have voted during times of war to suggest that Covid-19 was merely being used as an excuse to “cheat”. But members of the military have long voted by mail and there is a long history of expanding access to the ballot because of war, Alexander Keyssar, a historian who has studied elections, told NBC News in April.Trump has continued to attack voting by mail even though he and other members of his administration have frequently used it. On Monday, Business Insider reported that the vice-president, Mike Pence, and his wife, Karen, voted in the Indiana primary this month using the Indiana governor’s mansion as their address. Pence had done the same in 2018.US President Donald Trump is holding a town hall on Fox news at the moment, where he has again claimed that cases in the US are high because the US is testing widely. While, naturally, the number of confirmed cases in any country will depend on testing (because you can’t confirm a case without a positive test result), Germany and the US are testing roughly in the same bracket (though Germany’s figure is lower) in terms of tests per 1,000 people, according to Our World in data, which is run by Oxford University. The US population (328.2m) is much higher than Germany’s (83m) – and Trump’s argument is that this is why there are more cases – but this idea seems to rely on the extremely flawed logic that any given country will have a certain percentage of its population infected with the virus – and, therefore, that decisions taken by leadership in that country don’t really matter (though in other instances Trump will of course claim that his leadership in this pandemic has meant cases aren’t as bad as they could have been). The confirmed cases per million people in the US are 7,194.39 versus 2,292.55 in Germany. Furthermore, when it comes to people dying – the percentage of your population that dies is of course far less important than the number of people – the loved ones they leave behind are unlikely to care much whether that person was equivalent to a percentage figure. In the US, 124,355 people have died so far. In Germany, 8,940 people have died. Another member of PNG’s defence force has tested positive for coronavirus, only the country’s 11th case, but the third in just over a week which can be traced to Port Moresby’s Murray Barracks.The PNG government is considering imposing new restrictions on the PNG capital, concerned by new community transmission of the virus.The ninth case in the country was detected at the end of last week, an Australian defence force officer who had been in PNG since January. That officer has since been repatriated to Australia.The 10th case, of a 27-year-old soldier, came earlier this week as a result of mass testing of staff at the barracks.The latest case is a 26-year-old woman, who is being monitored by health workers in isolation at a sports centre which has been converted into a Covid-19 treatment facility.PNG’s national pandemic response controller, the country’s police commissioner, David Manning said he was considering whether new movement restrictions were necessary in Port Moresby, following two new cases in 48 hours. PNG lifted its state of emergency last week.Manning had said previously that the new cases in the capital were “evidence of local transmission in Port Moresby and the risk is very high that more cases may be identified in the coming days”.“The identification of this case provides Papua New Guineans need to take responsibility and remain vigilant to stop the chain of transmission,” Manning said.“The country needs to work together to apply the ‘Niupela Pasin’ or the ‘new normal’. This will involve changing our old ways of doing things and replacing them with behaviours and actions to reduce the risk of getting infection.”Mexico pushed past 25,000 reported coronavirus deaths and 200,000 confirmed cases Thursday, as the treasury secretary said he tested positive and would self-isolate while working from home, AP reports. The Health Department reported 6,104 newly confirmed infections, one of the highest 24-hour counts so far. That brought the country’s confirmed cases to 202,951. Deaths increased by 736, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 25,060. Only Brazil and the United States have higher death tolls in the Americas.Treasury Secretary Arturo Herrera said he had only minor symptoms and planned to self-isolate as he continued to work from home. It was unclear how recently he was in close contact with President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who refuses to use a face mask and has resumed public tours across Mexico.Herrera is the countrys highest-ranking Cabinet member to be infected so far. Previously, the head of the Mexican Social Security Institute tested positive but later returned to work. Several state governors have also acknowledged testing positive.Charlotte Graham-McLay reports for the  from Wellington:New Zealand has reported one new case of Covid-19 today like all of the country’s current active cases it was diagnosed during the routine testing of quarantined travellers.After reporting just over a week without any active cases of the virus, the number of diagnosed instances has started to increase again as a growing number of New Zealanders return from Covid-19 hotspots abroad. There are 14 active cases in the country, all of them people who were diagnosed at the hotels where everyone entering New Zealand must spend a fortnight in government-managed isolation. They are tested twice during their stay.The latest case, announced by health officials this afternoon, is a man in his 30s who arrived from Kenya via Doha and Brisbane on 21 June. A total of 1,170 confirmed Covid-19 cases have been reported in New Zealand, with 22 deaths. The comparatively low figures are widely attributed to a swift, strict lockdown when the pandemic arrived on New Zealand’s shores."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ffa8f952ea7bbc5bb58ce2825b15dbffe5ba0f5a/0_0_12000_7204/master/12000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2e97e3f288efc213f8e4d19d5fcb0218","title":"podcasting to blogging five tips to help marginalised voices find their platform","story":"In a world where everyone has an opinion, how do you make sure your views see the limelight, especially when it seems that no one is listening? Here, three people who found their voices explain how you can do itIt should, these days, be easier than ever to make a point in public. If you want to tell your story there are places to blog and host videos, there is social media to help you find an audience, and free software and ever cheaper hardware to get you online.But in practice, not everyone finds it easy to push their ideas into a public space. So where do you begin, particularly if you feel as if you’re on the margins? As part of Levi’s Your Voice. Your Way campaign,  Labs talked to three young people who, driven by a burning desire to be heard, found their voices through blogging, podcasts and zines.This is their advice to others who are bubbling with ideas and opinions, who know they have something valuable to say, but may feel unchampioned or underestimated. These are the first steps to getting your voice heard ...1. Stay true to yourselfYou might admire a particular columnist or an influencer, but the world doesn’t need an exact copy of someone else. The world needs you.“I tried lots of voices on for size, but they weren’t really me,” says Jessica Riches, a social media and content specialist. She found her real voice and honed her social media skills during the student protests of 2010 when she became the clearest online voice of the group who occupied University College London in protest at increases in fees.“Politics was where I found myself,” she says. “I was able to learn and explore that side of myself and I found a community of people.”For Raifa Rafiq, a shared interest in books led her to create the Mostly Lit podcast with her friend Alex Reads. “The response we got was phenomenal,” she says of the podcast, which ran for four years, won awards and partnered with Waterstones. “We did something we enjoyed and ended up putting a different face on culture and arts criticism: you don’t have to be an old white man or a middle class white woman to love books or to talk about them.”2. Consider your platform carefullyWho do you want to reach and what are you trying to say? Both of these questions will have an effect on where and how you publish your work. “In terms of social media, this is key,” says Riches. “If you are telling a story that is text based, about news or opinion, then head to Twitter. If you want to draw people in with visuals, use Instagram. This sounds really obvious, but the mistake people often make at the beginning is over-committing. Pick the most appropriate platform and start there, that way you won’t end up disappointing yourself. You can always expand later.”Kirsty Fife has published her work on blogs and also created physical fanzines. “I started out blogging, I ran a fat-fashion blog, Fatty Unbound,” she says. “Blogging did create a space that wasn’t there at the time.” Digitally, she honed her writing and found a community, but decided to begin putting out fanzines when her work became more personal.3. Start creating“Think about what you engage with, what stops your thumb in its endless scroll,” says Riches. “Then think about what’s missing. Write down – privately – what you want your content principles to be. What topics are you going to cover, what are your boundaries? What will you enjoy creating? It sounds limiting, but it’s very freeing it stops you trying to talk about everything at once.”Creating a fanzine, says Fife: “Is still very lo-fi. It’s a Sharpie, sketchbooks, pieces of paper. Although these days I scan everything into my computer and create PDFs to print and distribute. I don’t want any more incidents with things getting stuck in work photocopiers.”The DIY approach has also worked for Rafiq, whose new podcast This Thing Changed My Life launched this month. “Buy equipment and teach yourself,” she says. “Some editing software is free and it might seem scary, but it’s not. YouTube taught me everything, and I started recording in a day. It’s saved me so much time and money.”4. Believe in yourselfThe biggest barriers, however, often aren’t the practical ones. Why, you might think, would anyone want to hear from you?“It’s hard to put something out into the world,” says Fife. “I used to think that anything I made had to be perfectly finished and polished. It will never be perfect, so push through those feelings of anxiety. Put whatever you can out there, don’t wait for validation to start.”“There will always be someone for whom your work is meaningful.”5. Build your communityFife, Rafiq and Riches all agree they have found communities through their creative work. “I found both friends and collaborators,” says Fife.But it’s worth remembering that an audience won’t appear overnight. “It’s a marathon, not a sprint,” says Riches. “And you need to put the work in. Start where you feel comfortable, ask your close friends to like what you’re doing, then expand to other friends. Build.”Riches also points out that finding a community and finding an audience are very closely linked. “Don’t forget that social media is supposed to be social,” she says. “Support other people in your field. Collaborate. Share. Showcase others and make connections.”Before starting to produce her own, Fife bought zines created by others. She recommends looking at zine distros – places that sell and distribute a number of different fanzines. “I go to Pen Fight Distro, Synchronise Witches Press and Vampire Hag. There will be a voice you enjoy out there.”Rafiq proved there was an audience for her work that had been ignored or discounted by much of the culture industry. “Young people do love the arts,” she says. “Arts criticism isn’t just an endeavour for Oxbridge grads. You can be from the inner city, you can be BAME and want this.”The effort is worth it, Fife says. “I’ve had a lot of people reach out to me over the years because they listened to my voice. I don’t have a professional background in writing, art or design, but I made things that meant something to others.”Use Your Voice ...At the heart of the Your Voice.

Photograph: Julien Behal The HSE is to end its €20 million lease of facilities at the Citywest Hotel complex in Dublin which it had been using during the Covid-19 emergency.Minister for Health Simon Harris said at a post-Cabinet briefing on Thursday night that the agreement would come to an end in October.The Citywest complex, which has capacity for some 1,700 beds, had been available for self-isolation and as a step-down facility for Covid-19 patients.The deal is expected to cost the HSE more than €20 million. However, there had been concerns about the level of use to which the facility had been put. The Health Budget Oversight Group – comprising senior officials of the Department of Public Expenditure, Department of Health and the HSE – was told in early May that the occupancy rate at the Citywest Hotel complex was “currently low”. Minutes from a later meeting in May noted “a growing number of questions regarding the occupancy rate of Citywest Hotel at the time and potential alternative uses for the facility”.Mr Harris said he informed the Cabinet on Thursday that it was the HSE’s intention not to extend the lease on Citywest. He said the HSE will discuss in the coming weeks what to use the facility for.Private patientsSeparately it has emerged that no further public patients will be admitted to private hospitals after next Tuesday under the agreement which saw the State take over their facilities during the Covid-19 crisis.No subsequent follow-on agreement has yet been agreed. Private hospitals said on Thursday that talks with the HSE were continuing. The Government decided at the end of May that it would not extend the current three-month agreement covering nearly 20 private hospitals for a further two months. The Cabinet at the end of May decided to mandate the HSE to enter into talks on a new agreement with private hospitals to come into effect from July which would allow the State to take control of 100 per cent of their facilities if it was required to deal with any future surge in Covid-19 cases.Private hospitalsThe Government also instructed the HSE to engage with the private hospitals to secure ongoing access to private hospitals in collaboration with the National Treatment Purchase Fund (NTPF) to address essential needs including delays in public patients obtaining treatment.The association representing private hospitals said on Thursday that the current agreement between them and the HSE would expire next Monday. “After that time we will see the recommencement of normal activity at all of the country’s private hospitals. Continuity of care will remain a priority for any remaining public patients still being treated or recuperating in private hospitals after this date and any transfer of care requirements will be carefully managed by way of locally agreed arrangements with the appropriate hospital group and public hospitals.“No further public admissions will occur after this date under the auspices of the agreement which expires on June 30th. “Talks are still ongoing between the Private Hospitals Association and the HSE in respect of future private capacity requirements in respect of Covid-19 over the medium and longer term.”It is understood that the Government may seek to tackle the growing public hospital waiting lists – which will be exacerbated by the Covid-19 restrictions in the health system, where fewer procedures are likely to take place – by ramping up the operation of the NTPF in the private hospitals.However, under the NTPF model, the State buys packages of care, including private hospital accommodation and treatment for patients by consultants.

Graphic: The Paul Scott How does the voting process work in each party?The ratification processes in Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Greens for the draft programme for government are coming to an end.Votes will be counted on Friday.Fine Gael requires the approval of its internal electoral college, rather than every party member, and only has 700 votes to count.It is expected that its count will begin after lunchtime on Friday and will be relatively short.The Greens’ count will start at noon with a result expected between 6pm and 7pm.The Greens and Fianna Fáil are running one member, one vote ballot and will take longer to count than Fine Gael.Fianna Fáil expects its own count to be concluded around tea time.Just under 2,000 people - 1,962 - are eligible to vote in the Greens’ contest, with around 14,500 in Fianna Fáil. Of those registered to vote for the Greens, 195 are from Northern Ireland.With a large number of Green Party elected representatives from Northern Ireland against the deal, it is expected most of the 195 northern members could oppose the deal.However, the number of those who registered to vote from Northern Ireland was relatively low - giving hope to those in favour of a deal.The Greens initially allowed telephone voting only for members outside the the Republic and Northern Ireland, but this week widened the eligibility to allow anyone who has not received their ballot paper to vote over the phone.Those wishing to do so must email the Green Party headquarters with their name, email, phone number, address, and a suitable time to vote by phone. Party officials will then check that person is eligible to vote.A special code which the voter will need to vote by phone will then be sent by email, and this code must be quoted over the phone when the vote is cast. Postal votes for those who vote by phone will be cancelled.A degree of co-ordination in the announcement of the three parties’ results on Friday is expected but has not yet been finalised.If the three parties approve the deal, what happens next?There will be a full sitting of the Dáil in the Convention Centre, Dublin, on Saturday morning to elect Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin as Taoiseach.The Dáil cannot sit in Leinster House due to the need for social distancing if all TDs are present.The sitting will begin at 10.30am and the proposer and seconder for each nominee for the position of taoiseach will get five minutes speaking time each.This will be followed by ten minutes of speeches from each party or group that has not put forward a nomination for Taoiseach.Votes will then be taken and, when, as expected, Mr Martin is elected, he will then be invited by the Ceann Comhairle to make a brief statement.The House will then adjourn to allow Mr Martin receive his seal of office from President Micheal D Higgins in Áras an Uachtaráin, which is expected to happen at around 12.30pm.The details of how this ceremony - and the later ceremony where the new Cabinet receive their seals of office from Mr Higgins - will operate with social distancing have not yet been finalised.When will the Cabinet be picked?Upon receiving his seal from the President, it is expected Mr Martin would then travel to his new office in Government Buildings where he will appoint the new Cabinet.Fianna Fáil will have six full Cabinet posts, as will Fine Gael, and the Greens three. Leo Varadkar will choose the Fine Gael nominees and Eamon Ryan will choose the Green nominees.The three leaders are expected to meet on Thursday to decide how to configure government departments and allocate inidual portfolios to each party.Each leader, however, will choose their own people for their allocated portfolios without the need to consult the other leaders.When will the Dáil sit again?The House is expected to reconvene at 4.30pm on Saturday when the members of the new cabinet will be nominated for approval by the Dáil. The Taoiseach will make a ten minute speech, as will the leaders of all parties and groups, with 100 minutes in total set aside for speeches on the nominations of new ministers.However, this stage of the process can drag on and could stretch on longer than expected. Votes will be taken at the conclusion of speeches and the new cabinet will travel to Áras an Uachtaráin to receive their seals of office and hold their first meeting.What about the Taoiseach’s nominees to the Seanad?The Government believes a new taoiseach must nominate 11 members of the Upper House in order for crucial legislation to be passed through the Oireachtas, such as the renewal of the Offences Against the State Act.The Government says this cannot be done by Mr Varadkar as acting taoiseach.Of the 11, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael will each choose four and the Greens will get two. The remaining one will be an Independent nominee, most likely from Northern Ireland.The Programme for Government says at least half of those nominated should be women.Mr Martin is expected to nominate the 11 on Saturday, with the fully constituted Seanad then expected to sit on Monday to deal with outstanding legislation.The best news and analysis from the campaign trailStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4288827.1593127734!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ff fg and greens verdicts on proposed coalition to be revealed on friday evening","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Green Party leader Eamon Ryan, Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin, and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar met on Thursday to discuss the structure of the proposed new government. Photograph: Caroline QuinnDamien EagersLeon FarrellPA Wire The verdict of the members of the Green Party, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil on the proposed coalition government will be revealed on Friday evening, either clearing the way for a new government on Friday or precipitating an immediate political crisis and a possible general election.Senior Green Party figures are cautiously optimistic that the deal will be approved by their members, but admit that there is no certainty of a Yes vote.Two TDs both said they felt the “late deciders” had broken for the Yes side, but expected a tight result. But the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar was bullish on Thursday night, predicting that the three parties would vote convincingly for the coalition deal.“My prediction is that the three parties tomorrow will vote to go into coalition with each other, that the Yes vote will be larger than people expect in all three parties and we will have a new government on Saturday,” he said after what is expected to be the final meeting of the outgoing Cabinet.Mr Varadkar said there was no arrangement or Plan B in place if the vote fails. If the vote did not pass, he said he would “reflect on that” over the weekend and arrange a meeting with the party leaders to “see what is possible”.While arrangements are still being put in place, the results are expected to be announced in the early evening, probably about 7pm.New taoiseachIn the event of a Yes vote, the Dáil will meet in the National Convention Centre on Friday and the Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin will be elected taoiseach with the support of the three parties and, it is expected, a number of independent TDs. Mr Martin will then form his cabinet including members from the three parties.Mr Varadkar, Mr Martin and the Green Party leader Eamon Ryan met on Thursday to discuss the structure of the proposed new government, with changes to the make-up of several departments mooted.Sources said agreement was outstanding on a number of issues, and the three men would meet again on Friday. The Green Party is expected to have four TDs at the cabinet table if the party agrees to join the coalition, three full ministers and a “super junior” minister who also sits at cabinet. The party will also get three other junior ministries. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael will have six full cabinet ministers each, plus a super junior minister, and eight junior ministers.

Photograph: Piroschka Van De Wouw EPAPublicity shots of the meeting showed Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte and French president Emmanuel Macron seated happily beside each other at a candlelit dining table set for two.The pair were taking advantage of the recently reopened restaurants of The Hague on Macron’s visit to the Netherlands this week: one of the first physical meetings between leaders in the EU since the coronavirus pandemic shut down normal life.The French leader’s mission was to try to make a dent in Dutch resistance to a recovery plan aimed at rescuing the European Union from deep economic damage caused by the pandemic. And it may take more than a friendly dinner to do so.The rescue plan was pioneered by France and Germany, and has been a subject of debate among the EU member states since it was formally proposed by the European Commission a month ago.It involves borrowing by the EU’s executive and distribution of funds to member states that does not need to be paid back: a generous approach to the downturn and a step towards common borrowing that some regard as a breakthrough in EU unity and a potential redress of one of the structural problems of the euro.But the Netherlands, as the leader of the EU’s so-called “Frugal Four”, has been heading up resistance to the plan, as it opposes anything that involves increased cost to the bloc’s stronger economies or smacks of taking on responsibility for debt incurred by others.The four, including Austria, Denmark and Sweden, have called for a “realistic level of spending” and want member states to be obliged to pay back any funds they receive.For many years The Hague leaned on Germany to advocate tight economic policies in the bloc. But a recognition of the unprecedented nature of the current challenge, a sense that the EU needs a demonstration of solidarity to shore up unity, and an increasing belief that the time for austerity has passed has shifted attitudes in Berlin and beyond.Not far away from where Macron and Rutte spoke stood what may be the plan’s greatest obstacle: the Dutch parliament.The Netherlands is heading for an election due in March next year, and that makes it a difficult time to extract Dutch political compromises.Far-right euroscepticism has long been the tail that wagged the dog of Dutch politics. For two decades anti-immigration and Brussels-bashing politicians have gnawed at the support of the centre-ground in the Netherlands, forcing natural moderates like Rutte into harder positions and mainstreaming a negative view of the bloc, despite the Dutch economy’s profound reliance on the single market.One key element of the recovery plan – the proposal that the European Commission should be allowed to raise its own funds through taxes such as a digital or carbon levy to pay back the rescue funds – would need to be approved by national parliaments.Campaigning opportunityA YesNo vote on an EU issue would be an ideal campaigning opportunity for right-wing anti-immigration parties such as Thierry Baudet’s Forum for Democracy, or the Freedom Party of Geert Wilders, though these days he is very much a weakened force.Baudet was a key campaigner in driving the Netherlands’ 2016 referendum on whether to approve an EU association agreement with Ukraine, a tokenistic topic that was used as a wedge issue to mobilise the eurosceptic base and deliver a bloody nose to Rutte and Brussels with a 64 per cent rejection of the treaty on a razor-thin turnout.The Dutch electorate is anything but uniform. It is fragmented into an array of groups from a party for the over-50s to the famous Party for the Animals, and, in the last election, the EU-friendly D66 and Greens increased their vote share, albeit while still emerging only the fourth and fifth largest parties in parliament.Yet so potent and ingrained is a Dutch grumpiness towards the EU, alongside a British-style conviction that the bloc should remain a quid-pro-quo arrangement of economic advantage rather than a union of broader interests, that even nominally pro-EU parties sometimes temper their positions on the issue.One of D66’s defining positions is its support for the EU. But the party joined the Dutch majority to vote against the idea of euro bonds in April after a group of nine countries including Ireland called for them.The recovery plan, which proposes once-off borrowing by the commission to be repaid by granting the executive body the ability to raise its own money, is not the leap forward in integration that euro bonds would be. But it is a step forward, and the Dutch electorate may not allow their parliament to budge an inch.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Only under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4288806.1593114819!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"limerick man keeps music playing during lockdown at famous london venue","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Artistic and executive director of Wigmore Hall John Gilhooly.  Photograph:  Amy T ZielinskiRedferns\u0026nbspOn the stage of Wigmore Hall, beneath its painted cupola depicting the Soul of Music, a piano tuner in a black apron was bent over the resident Steinway Model D. Towards the back of the hall, a video camera sat on a tall tripod and a third of the way down the left aisle was a small table and a chair.On the table stood an anglepoise lamp, a clock, a pair of headphones, a red light and a bottle of hand sanitiser for use by BBC Radio 3 presenter Martin Handley. When tenor Mark Padmore and pianist Mitsuko Uchida perform Schubert’s Winterreise at 1pm on Friday, Handley will be one of just two people in the auditorium.The other will be Wigmore Hall’s Limerick-born director John Gilhooly, who has brought live music back to London during the lockdown with 20 concerts streamed on the hall’s website (wigmore-hall.org.uk) and broadcast on Radio 3. Friday’s will be the last in the series.“I felt that should be the last concert because it’s the winter journey and this has been a bit of a winter journey, even in the middle of June. It’s possibly not the most positive note to end on, but it kind of reflects the times,” Gilhooly said.He said the popular response to the concerts has been “incredible” with some performers receiving hundreds of messages after performances, many of them from other musicians and a new audience discovering Wigmore Hall. The concert series has drawn comparisons with pianist Myra Hess’s wartime recitals at the National Gallery on Trafalgar Square, which were seen as morale boosters and acts of defiance as bombs fell on London.Tuning in“The first concert, the emotion around that, the amount of people crying when Steven Hough did his own arrangement of the BachGounod Ave Maria as the encore. That was tough and it felt like there was kind of a generator going. You know, you could feel the tension in the hall even though the hall was totally silent. We knew all these people were tuning in but we didn’t know how many and we didn’t know the impact at that stage,” he said.Gilhooly, whose brother Owen is a professional singer who teaches at the Royal Irish Academy of Music in Dublin, comes from a musical family in Castleconnell, Co Limerick. He credits his music teacher Jean Holmes and John Ruddock, headmaster at Villiers School in Limerick, with his introduction to music at the highest level.Ruddock, who was friendly with William Lyne, Gilhooly’s predecessor at Wigmore Hall, brought international musicians to perform at the school and at the age of 10 or 11, Gilhooly was seeing and meeting some of the performers he works with today. A student of history and politics at University College Dublin, Gilhooly trained as a tenor under Veronica Dunne but decided in his early 20s that, although he had a very good voice, he didn’t like being in front of an audience.He joined Wigmore Hall as chief executive in 2000, succeeding Lyne as director in 2005 to become a leading figure in Britain’s music world. He has expanded the hall’s outreach to erse communities across London, running programmes for young offenders and lowering its audience age profile by offering cheap tickets to those under 35.The hall closed, along with London’s other classical music venues, in the middle of March but when Gilhooly was watching a livestream of Mass from on St James’s Church on Spanish Place on Easter Sunday, he saw they had a priest, an organist and a singer.\u0026nbsp“I thought, well if they can do it,” he said.Since the concert season started at the beginning of June, Gilhooly has been up at 5am every day, pitching in with cleaning and ensuring that social distancing guidelines are respected. The camera in the hall is operated remotely from the bar downstairs, where Gilhooly has set up sound and vision desks and other members of the team are working from home.“We actually have the son of one of our staff who’s an undergraduate at Cardiff in music and composition who is reading the score and calling camera shots from Kent. It’s unbelievable,” he said.At the end of Friday’s concert, Gilhooly will make a statement affirming the central role the arts can play in the economic recovery from the coronavirus crisis and asserting the right of every citizen to access the arts and culture.\u0026nbspHe hopes to stage another series of concerts in September, this time with an audience of perhaps 30 or 40 in the hall. But he hopes the lockdown concerts have already served to confirm Wigmore Hall’s role as a national concert hall for Britain, even though it is a chamber hall.“It’s a tiny little port of call, but an essential place where musicians have come to earn their chamber music and recital credentials and then reinforce them. Through the power of music at the highest level, we can reach people in every demographic,” he said.\u0026nbsp“And it’s been a way of showing the government what we’re worth without having to scream about it. The music speaks for itself.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"osama bin laden martyred says imran khan","story":"Imran Khan has sparked outcry after telling Pakistan\u0027s parliament the al-Qaeda founder Osama bin Laden was a martyr.Pakistan\u0027s prime minister had been defending his coronavirus response, when he veered into controversy addressing what he said was America\u0027s insulting attitude during the war on terror.Mr Khan said: “The Americans came to Abbottabad and killed Osama bin Laden. Martyred him,” Mr Khan said. “What happened after that, the whole world abused us. Our ally came here and killed Osama bin Laden without telling us.”Khawaja Asif, a former foreign minister, immediately accused the prime minister of fiddling with history for declaring a man who was once the world\u0027s most wanted terrorist to be a martyr.Mr Khan\u0027s remarks are also likely to anger Pakistani leaders who are desperate to reset the country\u0027s damaging reputation as a hotbed of terrorism and extremism.His remarks are not the first time he has run into trouble discussing Pakistan\u0027s role in the war on terror. While still remembered in the UK as a liberal, cricketing playboy, in Pakistan, his opponents have accused him of a soft stance on militants and given him the moniker \u0027Taliban Khan\u0027.Last year Mr Khan said Pakistan\u0027s army and military spy agency trained al-Qaeda and then maintained links with the militants afterwards. Turning against the militants to back America after the 911 attacks was one of his country\u0027s biggest blunders, he said.Bin Laden was found hiding in Pakistan\u0027s city of Abbottabad in 2011, though the country\u0027s authorities deny they knew he was there.“Imran Khan\u0027s description of Osama Bin Laden as a martyr badly undermines Pakistan\u0027s narrative that it no longer supports terrorists,” said Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia Program at the Washington-based Wilson Centre.“If he just misspoke, one would expect a clarification.  I don\u0027t think there\u0027s been one issued yet. It\u0027s not a good look, no matter how you slice it.”Mr Khan\u0027s special adviser on communications later defended the comments, saying the prime minister had twice said bin Laden had been killed. He accused political opponents of whipping up controversy.Mr Khan made his comments as a new US terrorism assessment said Pakistan had helped America during negotiations with the Taliban, but still hosts the militants in safe havens as they wage war in Afghanistan.The annual State Department evaluation said Pakistan allowed groups targeting both Afghanistan and India to operate from its soil during 2019.The acknowledgement that Pakistan had “played a constructive role” in Washington\u0027s attempts to talk with the insurgents comes after years of complaints Islamabad has played a double game supporting the militants against US troops while receiving US aid.Yet the assessment said Pakistan “continued to serve as a safe haven for certain regionally focused terrorist groups”.The Afghan Taliban and its Haqqani Network faction, as well as groups targeting India including Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) still operate from its territory, the report said.The assessment drew a testy rebuttal from Islamabad, which said it rejected “ any insinuation about any safe haven. Pakistan will not allow any group or entity to use its territory against any country.”The US report echoed a recent Pentagon assessment concluding that Pakistan “has encouraged the Afghan Taliban to participate in peace talks, but refrained from applying coercive pressure that would seriously threaten its relationship with the Afghan Taliban”.Pakistan has for decades been accused of fostering and hosting militants to use as foreign policy tools in its neighbours and the issue has poisoned relations with Delhi.The report said Islamabad had made “modest” steps against anti-India groups on its territory after the neighbours nearly went to war in February 2019 when 40 paramilitary police were killed by a Pakistan-based group.Terrorist leaders like the JeM founder Masood Azhar had still not been brought to justice even though they are “widely believed to reside in Pakistan under the protection of the state, despite government denials”.Pakistan\u0027s foreign ministry said the assessment was “self-contradictory and selective” and did not give the country credit for its role in February\u0027s America\u0027s troop withdraw agreement with the Taliban.“ Pakistan hopes that future US reports will fully acknowledge the entire spectrum of Pakistan’s counter-terrorism efforts and present a fair and correct perspective of this global threat,” a spokeswoman said.More from NewsMore from

found. A third of people in the UK have enjoyed their time spent under the coronavirus lockdown, new research suggests. Adults aged 30-59, those with higher incomes and those living with others have enjoyed the period the most, according to the University College London (UCL) Covid-19 social study.The study showed that 15 per cent of those who earn over £30k have not enjoyed lockdown at all but that this increased to 20 per cent for those earning less than £30k.  The research, funded by the Nuffield Foundation, is the UK\u0027s largest study into how adults are feeling during lockdown.More than 70,000 people have been questioned weekly over the past 14 weeks.Almost half (46 per cent) of the participants said they had not been enjoying the restrictions while 21 per cent reported mixed feelings.Just 4 per cent said they had enjoyed the period very much, compared with 17 per cent of people saying they had not enjoyed it at all.Overall, people in Scotland and Wales have liked spending time in lockdown less than those in England.Lead author Dr Daisy Fancourt, from UCL\u0027s Institute of Epidemiology \u0026amp Health Care, said: Our study shows that the majority of people are either not enjoying the lockdown or have mixed feelings about it.This is especially true amongst groups with a lower household income, who may be living in accommodation which is overcrowded or lacking in outside space, and those living alone, who may be feeling more isolated than those living with others.Of the third of people who report enjoying lockdown, a large number have higher household incomes and live with others or children, suggesting these people may have been less affected by the economic and social restrictions.Asked if they would miss lockdown, 36 per cent said they would not miss it at all, but more than a quarter (26 per cent) said they would miss it more than not miss it.Older adults, people living alone, and people with lower household income were most likely not to miss lockdown, while people living in England, key workers and people living with children were more likely to miss it.Half feel they will overall not look forward to another potential lockdown, while 22 per cent feel they would look forward to another shutdown. The study also looked at behavioural changes, and found that four in 10 UK adults said they have gained weight.It found that young people were found to be more likely to change their eating and diet behaviours than older adults. Meanwhile, a third of smokers said they were smoking more than usual, while 17 per cent of drinkers said they were consuming more alcohol.Cheryl Lloyd, education programme head at the Nuffield Foundation, said: Given that low earners have been most at risk of the negative social and economic consequences of the pandemic it is unsurprising that they have been less likely to enjoy lockdown than those on higher incomes.It is essential the policy response takes steps to reduce inequalities and minimise the longer-term scarring effects of the pandemic on low earners.  mmnMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The

Acts including Static-X, Dope, Bobaflex and Royal Bliss are set to feature.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesOn Twitter, the band wrote: “Nonpoint is not playing the show because of the name of the show.”Since then, the festival’s organisers have removed the original advertising on Facebook, and posted a message which reads: “For the record the venues land can accommodate up to 10,000 occupancy.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.The bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

Residents on the southwest coast, in Plymouth, Devon, also woke to find the detritus left behind in the city’s popular Barbican area overnight – where hundreds of people packed onto the waterfront, ignoring coronavirus social distancing rules.The streets were covered in rubbish this morning, including tampons and used condoms, Plymouth Live reports.Residents were also reportedly faced with people having sex in public, as well as urinating and defecating in back streets.

Today there was also evidence of drug use.  “Thank you to the park rangers who are also working tirelessly to clear the mess around the ground and park generally.”A suitcase, parasol and fridge were among items abandoned on beaches in Durdle Door, Dorset, where volunteers filled more than 30 bags with rubbish. Dorset councillor Laura Miller tweeted: “Is it still ‘iconic’? Just in from volunteer litter picking. 30 bin bags and counting. Nearly in tears at the state of our home.”She also shared an image of what she described as human faeces on pebbles near where her children swim at Lulworth Cove. The Conservative councillor said she was spat at by someone while directing traffic on Wednesday as the roads to Durdle Door and West Lulworth were closed off after car parks quickly filled up. Police imposed a dispersal order at Hove Lawns, in Sussex, after a fight reportedly broke out as hundreds of, mostly young, people gathered on Wednesday evening.Jo Shiner, temporary Chief Constable of Sussex Police, described the incident as “shocking behaviour impacting upon everyone trying to be responsible in challenging times”. She warned: “Sussex Police will take positive action but I would urge young people to think about their behaviour. A criminal record will not help you get a job in the future.” Video journalist Eddie Mitchell shared footage on Twitter showing several police cars lined up along the seafront as uniformed officers herded crowds away.Police in Merseyside also imposed a 48-hour dispersal order lasting until Friday after large crowds turned up at Formby Beach, on the Sefton coastline. Former Love Island contestant Joshua Ritchie, who was allegedly among those who turned up at the beach, was seen carrying a large speaker with friends in a video.Boris Johnson’s official spokesman declined to comment on particular scenes on beaches, but told reporters: “The prime minister and the government’s scientific and medical advisers have stressed the great importance of the public continuing to adhere to social distancing advice.“It is only due to the public’s hard work that we have been able to bring the virus under control, and if the rules don’t continue to be followed and the virus starts to spread exponentially again, we will have to look at having to reverse some of the easements that have been put in place and I don’t think anyone in the British public would want that to happen.”There were hundreds of kids grouped up on the Roath Park Rec earlier this evening. They left A LOT of rubbish and were only dispersed about 10 minutes ago.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Mr Timms told The Independent: “It is puzzling that the department is leaving the announcement so late, with the current arrangements coming to an end in less than a week.I hope they will announce without further delay that the current conditionality easements will be extended for another three months.”Alison Garnham, our chief executive of Child Poverty Action Group, said next week was way too soon to end the suspension of conditionality and sanctions for people claiming universal credit.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The figure rose to more than three-fifths among those on zero-hours contracts.Iain Porter, social security policy and partnerships manager at the independent Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: “As we enter a deep recession, there are already worrying signs that the number of people in work is falling. Job vacancies are in short supply and when the furlough scheme begins to unwind, many more people will find themselves unemployed through no fault of their own.“Universal credit rules must continue to reflect the reality of our dysfunctional jobs market. The government should commit to extending the suspension of job-seeking requirements so that people already struggling from the economic fallout of coronavirus are not pulled further into poverty.” Dame Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said a suspension on job-seeking requirements for people facing particular barriers would be the “right thing to do”, to avoid causing people stress and worry about potential sanctions.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.A horse is washed down at Haydock RacecoursePeople enjoy the hot weather on Margate beachTony Bennett the owner of The Devereux pub in Temple, London.

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them. They are very comfortable to wear.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

Each section features a famous face, including Morgan Freeman, Whoopi Goldberg and Sir Paul McCartney, and is signed by Sir Peter, 87.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesProceeds will go to two beneficiaries, including The Independent\u0027s Help The Hungry Now appeal partner The Felix Project.Today, Ms Lumley said it was an “honour” to be part of the fundraising effort.

It is a fabulous way of making life worth living.”Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mDame Judi said: “How wonderful that Peter Blake’s amazing artwork will have a new lease of life for such good causes. I’m very glad that maybe my left eyebrow has gone to good use.”Italian actress Caterina Murino, who also stars in the work, said: “The world is upside down. We fight for our life, we fight for the life of our brothers, and this is the feeling I have when I contemplate Sir Peter Blake’s masterpiece! A hundred stars that reflect the ersity of our world fighting to help Help the Hungry.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.In the end, perhaps, this wasn’t exactly as Liverpool fans would have dreamed it: with the city’s pubs closed, with the stadium shut up, with their team not even playing.The club won its first football league title in 30 years on Thursday night after rivals Man City lost to Chelsea.But, if it was a slightly surreal climax to a wholly surreal season, it did little to dampen celebrations here.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAn estimated 2,000 supporters turned up at Anfield bearing flags, fireworks and flares, while hundreds more piled into city centre parks and squares. Cars could be heard beeping all across the city. A cardboard cutout of manager Jurgen Klopp was doing a roaring trade in being hugged.They knew, fans said, they were stretching coronavirus lockdown rules to their absolute limits. They knew they were ignoring the calls of both manager Jurgen Klopp and local authorities to toast the success at home. But this was a moment in their city’s history, they argued, that was simply too big to be experienced on the sofa.Watch Liverpool’s players celebrate the moment they won the title“Pandemic or not, mate, I’m 21 and this is the first time I’ve seen Liverpool win the title – so no way am I staying at home,” said Michael Pinnington, a 21-year-old railway worker, four pints in and preparing for a long and loud night. “It’s dampened it a little bit, what’s happened. But ... we’ve won the league. Nothing can spoil that. It means everything to me. I’ve been waiting for it my whole life.”He himself was out with five or six mates. “Can you imagine if this was normal times?” asked one, Jo Stewart, also 21 and a railway worker. “The whole city would be here.”“Fair play, mate,” came the instant reply. “Three quarters of the city.”It was not just Anfield where people gathered. The city’s famously lively Concert Square got so busy as the night progressed that police moved in to move people on – something they did not do later at Anfield – while crowds also took over Sefton Park and Chavasse Park.At the latter, located by the city’s waterfront, groups sat in pre-chalked out socially distanced circles, listening to radios, refreshing Internet feeds, and watching on buffeting mobile screens. Once or twice, they burst into a rendition of ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’. Drinks were sprayed into the air as at news of Chelsea goals.“It’s not exactly the normal, but there’s nowhere else I’d rather be right now,” said Mo Abdul, a 25-year-old research and development scientist. “I took the afternoon off work today just to spend time in the city and soak it up. Days like this don’t come along very often.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailA pause. “Although hopefully they’ll come along more often in future.”The reason, above all else perhaps, that this was so special: the fact it ended that three-decade wait for the title.When Liverpool last won the league, the Premiership did not yet exist, Sky Sports was going by the name The Sports Channel and didn’t show football, and only five members of the current squad had been born. Back then, they were the most successful club in English football history and had finished in the top two every year, bar one, since 1973. Safe to say, no one here – indeed, no one anywhere – saw a sudden 30-year hiatus happening.“It’s been a burden,” said builder Andy Boylett. “I was six when we won that last title. I remember it but only just. And the city has been in the shadow of that ever since.”How so? “Because Liverpool is famous for football – other things too but football – and for having this great club. And, for most of those 30 years, we haven’t been great. That’s hard to deal with. It’s hard to be in the shadow of the past.”The moment, now it had come, he said, was strange, nonetheless.“Obviously, the gap in the season and games being played behind closed doors, it’s not exactly how you’d want it, is it?” he said. “But it doesn’t matter in the end. We’ve won it, that’s the most important thing. It won’t say anything about coronavirus in the history books. It will just say champions.”More to the point, says Adam Lally, with just the hint of a wink, fans got to celebrate more traditionally last year after the club won the Champions League.“Everyone was getting good and bendy in the pubs then,” the 19-year-old apprentice remembers. “The bus parade, brilliant. So, we’ve done that. Tonight, fine, we’ll do it all outside. Glorious weather anyway.”He was, he said, as happy as he could ever remember being. “Mate, I want to say it’s better than giving birth but I’ve never done that. So, until I do, I reckon this might be as good as it gets. It’s boss. Absolutely boss.”His friend, student Aiysha Griffiths agreed. “I can’t put it into word, really. I’m speechless. I’ve had my dad talking about the old glory days all my life. Now, at last, I know how it feels.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Coomes from Platform 3 says he has been driving around his local area dropping beer at houses – sometimes getting an emotional welcome. “When this all kicked off, I was delivering beers to people and they would burst into tears because they hadn’t seen anybody all week,” he tells The Independent.

Until then, one of the landlords tells The Independent it is ”not really feasible” for his establishment – with an inside space of 15ft by 7ft – to reopen, even with the relaxed rules in early July. “We wouldn’t be able to serve a pint on the bar very easily,” Geoff Page from the Bury St Edmunds pub explains.“The member of staff would have to step back from the bar for the customer to get up from the seat on the edge of the pub to collect the pint.”He estimates the pub would be able to fit five single people inside – all sitting on their on their own – under the social distancing rules, which say people must stay at least one metre apart as a preventative measure against Covid-19. “Our unique selling point – the size of us – happens to be the Achilles heel in this particular situation,” Page says. Martin says they have been told they can serve people outside between 10am to 5pm. “Which is great,” she tells The Independent,” but that’s not when I have any business. I have business in the evening.” Outdoor space has been key for The Rake, a small pub in central London, to plan its reopening on 4 July. The establishment in Borough Market has been open as an off-licence throughout lockdown, with people queueing up in their gardens for takeaway beer – with draught beer poured into an open can, then sealed using a machine on the bar, as an option. When will pubs, cinemas, restaurants and hairdressers be open from?Pubs to offer al fresco dining and takeaway pints under new billOne of Britain’s smallest pubs on reopening during coronavirus“Our small garden is going to be used for customers,” manager George Aldridge tells The Independent. ”We are going to be introducing table service and table bookings – which we have never done before.” Mike Hill, the founder of Utobeer which runs the London pub, tells The Independent: “I think if we didn’t have outside space, and somebody told us we couldn’t use outside space, I would probably seriously consider not opening.”The small size of the pub means customers will not be allowed to drink inside, he adds. While some pubs will be planning to welcome back people in a socially-distanced environment on 4 July, others – including smaller ones – have decided to wait a bit longer. Coomes from Platform 3 in Claygate says his tiny pub – which can fit just one person inside – cannot afford the extra costs that would come with reopening during the pandemic, such as having a person manning the toilets. “I can’t justify having someone do that in my micropub,” he says. ”The figures don’t add up for us.”Speaking about pubs being able to reopen on new conditions, the landlord of The Nutshell – which is thought to be one of the smallest pubs in the UK – tells The Independent: “It is not going to change really very much at all for ourselves at all.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Independent Premium.David Frost stamps on idea that\u0026nbspUK could have ability to break free from EU rules – in return for tariff punishment if it takes that pathA proposal seen as the best chance of avoiding a disastrous no-deal Brexit at the end of the year has been rejected by the UK’s chief negotiator.With the talks deadlocked, it was thought the EU could agree to give the UK the ability to break free from its rules – in return for the right to impose tariffs if it chose to do so.The arrangement would have avoided the feared cliff-edge on 31 December, when the UK will crash out of the single market and customs union unless an agreement is struck.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut, in a series of tweets, David Frost, Boris Johnson’s negotiator, announced: “I want to be clear that the government will not agree to ideas like the one currently circulating giving the EU a new right to retaliate with tariffs if we chose to make laws suiting our interests.“We could not leave ourselves open to such unforeseeable economic risk.”Minister won’t comment on chlorinated chicken, claiming US listeningBritish officials had suggested Boris Johnson would consider the compromise, under which the UK would secure the right to deviate from Brussels’ standards in areas such as state aid.The EU was thought to be sceptical – preferring to strike a firm deal, rather than set a path for future conflict in the relationship – but had welcomed what it viewed as new-found flexibility in London.After clashes following recent remote negotiations, optimism had crept up that an agreement could be reached when face-to-face talks resume next week.But, without the proposed fudge – kicking key decisions into the future – the two sides remain at odds over access to UK fishing waters and ‘level playing field rules’ to protect the EU from unfair competition.Created with Sketch.Brexit day: UK says goodbye to EU  Show all 66Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with

The pin ionizes the air around it. When the electrons fall back on an atom, the excess energy is emitted as a photon, which generate the corona glow around the pin. The fuzziness of the pin is because the camera did not actually capture light reflected on the pin but rather the light emitted by the ionized light around it. - Richard Germain69 Calmness of EternityHimalayas mountains, Nepal.

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.He continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPrior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Voting has begun across Russia on proposed constitutional reforms that would allow Vladimir Putin to rule until at least 2036.The vote is being brought to Russians via impromptu polling booths on park benches, on buses, in the boots of cars, in theatres and factories, and even in “hot zones” of Covid-19 hospitals. Voting will continue for an unprecedented seven days, and every day will see a lottery draw, raffling anything from supermarket vouchers to cars and apartments. Authorities insist that such creativity is a necessary response to the challenges posed in the era of the coronavirus. Opponents say the extraordinary measures to increase turnout demonstrate the unpopularity of Mr Putin’s decision to prioritise a power grab during a pandemic. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe vote, which was originally planned for 22 April before being rescheduled to this week, will ask Russians for a yes or no answer on over 200 new amendments to the country’s constitution.The most important of these proposed changes – the resetting of presidential term limits – has been routinely under-emphasised in voting literature, and in one case was even omitted. Official messages have concentrated instead on populist measures such as cementing marriage as a union of man and woman, emphasising the role of God, and guaranteeing indexation of pensions and other social payments. The vote is not a referendum per se the amendments have, in fact, already been passed by both parliaments. Pro-democracy groups say that the unclear classification of the vote is no accident. In a referendum, both sides are officially allowed to agitate for and against, and are entitled to airtime and finance. Not so in this campaign.  “The vote was specially set up to avoid any debate,” says Grigory Melkonyants, co-chairman of the independent Golos election monitoring group. “The government can de facto agitate for a yes vote with their campaign literature, but activists campaigning for a no vote are being arrested as we speak.” There have been several early reports of manipulations. Some of the claims related to age-old techniques: for example, evidence of forced voting at large enterprises, where vulnerable, low-paid workers are asked to vote under management supervision. But there were examples of newer tricks too. Earlier this month, a reporter at the liberal Dozhd television network exposed a fraudulent scheme that registered the details of pensioners on electronic voting websites, with the aim of then voting on their behalf. The reporter was summoned by state investigators for his trouble. In the early hours of Thursday morning, another reporter for the same channel managed to vote twice — electronically and in person. That reporter would be fined 30,000 roubles (£350), election authorities confirmed. No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailThe wide array of voting methods being employed during the week-long vote will make assessing its fairness difficult. Not only is electronic voting possible in two cities – Moscow and Niznny Novgorod – but mobile voting at home and at work is being allowed without extenuating circumstances for the first time. There will be limited scope for independent oversight monitors will only be permitted from regional isions of the Public Chamber, a quasi-governmental organisation. “The vote is deliberately being held in the grey zone,” says Mr Melkonyants. “Those who want to cheat have a huge number of options, and it will be impossible to catch them.” Authorities at all levels, and across Russia’s 11 time zones, understand the importance of securing good numbers for the president. Acceptable figures vary “according to the levels of cynicism” of inidual actors, says Tatyana Stanovaya, director of political analysis firm RPolitik. For some, like Moscow’s mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, the target for yes votes is likely 70 per cent. For others, like Chechen president, Ramzan Kadyrov, the target will be nearer 100 per cent. “Overall, there is a sense that any result below 65 per cent would be a bad result,” Ms Stanovaya suggests.It seems a stretch to believe that the president would reach those figures in an entirely free election. A recent poll by the independent Levada Centre indicated that of those who were sure they would vote, 55 per cent would support the presidential amendments. But that figure drops below 50 per cent when it takes in all voters. Another poll by the same organisation suggested that just 25 per cent of Russians would vote for the amendments if they had a chance to vote for alternatives. Levada Centre is not the only polling organisation to register a haemorrhaging of support away from Russia’s president over recent years. How 20 years of Putin has shaped Russia and the worldAt the peak of his ratings, a year after the annexation of Crimea in June 2015, Mr Putin was supported by nine out of every 10 Russians. The same “closed” question elicits a positive answer from only 59 per cent today, and just 8 per cent of youngsters. In open polling, where respondents are asked to name the politicians they most trust for themselves – in what is considered most indicative of a free choice – Mr Putin was named by just 29 per cent of Russians. Sociologists at Levada registered the biggest falls following Mr Putin’s decision to push through unpopular pension reforms in 2018. Ms Stanovaya, however, traces the roots of an erosion of trust to 2017, when focus groups began to indicate growing disillusionment with the Kremlin’s focus on foreign campaigns in Syria and Ukraine.“The new challenges of the pandemic, low oil prices, and the constitution are catalysts for a process of erosion that began much earlier,” she says. Judging by the rush to get the vote done in the face of the pandemic, the fear among many in power would seem to be that the position is about to get even worse. “This is essentially a special operation from Putin, and special operations are all about reducing risks and mobilising quickly,” says Ms Stanovaya. “Waiting until the autumn would have meant inviting instability, the risk of a second coronavirus wave and social unrest that no one really knows how to deal with.” Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

You can now at last be within ft in of someone outside your immediate household! What’s more, from July , you will be able to eat in restaurants, have a drink and, of course, continue shopping.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesWhat you won’t be able to do, unless you are very fortunate, is to get your children into school, which says something about our national priorities. Make no mistake about it, this is a “national emergency”. Education should have the upfront priority that we rightly give the NHS and saving our economy. The failure since the beginning of March to plan ahead for getting all schools and all youngsters back into the classroom has been reprehensible.I say all schools because the majority have been open for the children of key workers and for children designated as vulnerable.Many teachers have been doing a first-class job trying to keep in touch with children at home, providing them with online tuition, homework and marking. But there is still time to mobilise all the necessary resources to make it possible to get children back to school for at least a couple of weeks before the end of this term.Yes, it would involve finding extra premises for schools with inadequate space. Yes, we would have to appeal to teachers who have recently retired to come back for perhaps a few hours a week. Yes, we would need to employ supply teachers.In addition we could use university students, who won’t be finding summer jobs any time soon, to assist.Of course, we don’t have that reliable summer weather that will allow teaching outside on a regular basis, butDenmark can place many lessons in an outside setting, we can.If the French, Lord help us, can get their schools mobilised and back to full operation, we can. Their trade unions are far more bolshy than ours, and teachers regrettably much less well paid.So we need a combination of creativity, imagination and drive to get pupils back. We need to rebuild the confidence of parents and staff that they are highly unlikely to contract the virus from the children, or of the children passing it on to each other.That way, we can have ironed out the glitches and be ready in September to be absolutely on the ball. Small group tutoring for recovery programmes, mentoring not just organised centrally, but co-ordinated locally.For anyone who doesn’t believe that two or three weeks matter in terms of education, when children have been out of school since the middle of March, then think again. This is about equality, narrowing the gap between the haves and have-nots, and opening a window on the world. But it is also more than that. It’s a place of social interaction, of well-being and of safety. Don’t take my word for it. Take the word of the Royal College of Paediatricians, the people whose whole le is spent on the well-being of children. They are very clear: Schools must , children need each other as well as their teachers.The recognition of the importance of schools was something I was proud to oversee in , when the incoming government’s priority slogan was, “education, education, education”.Don’t get me wrong. The belated announcement last week of a one per cent uplt for all schools and a £million pot for an online recovery programme is extremely welcome. A pity, therefore, that in making a really great announcement, the Government managed not to put any money aside for the  to -year-olds in further education, who are surely the target group we would want to be helping the most.So, thank you to all those who have done everything they can to keep the wheels on the cart over the past dficult three and a half months. But now we need both national leadership and local organisation. To use an old adage, we need to think national but we need to act local. Education trusts, local authorities, teachers’ unions and all those committed to the future of this nation should want to come together to make it work.In the next ten days, while the Government thinks about its advice, others can get on with the job. Take what is working best and spread it.What can work in France or Denmark or Germany can certainly work here. We are not out of the woods yet, but we can take logical, rational and brave decisions. That is what leadership is all about.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But it’s never quite the same.And therein lies the rub when you marry someone from another country.At first your initial attraction and then love for each other transcends geographical or cultural dferences.But when children come along and you’re required to stay in one place, inevitably one of you has to give up more than the other.Meghan tried it, albeit for a very short time, and now Harry is the one living thousands of miles away from his family and the only le he’s ever known.He made the decision to step down as a senior royal and decamp to the US for the sake of his new family — Meghan and Archie — but that doesn’t make it any less tough to see the old one ticking over nicely without him.A couple of years ago, I was in a central London restaurant with a group of other married couples and, much to the annoyance of we wives, the husbands couldn’t take their eyes off a woman sitting at the bar.Wearing the shortest of dresses, her legs were encircled around the object of her affections and her tongue made frequent visits to his ear.I recognised the man as actor Stephen Campbell Moore, ex-husband of The Crown star Claire Foy, and his obviously smitten companion as Sophie Cookson, who played Christine Keeler in last year’s BBC drama about the Profumo scandal.Fast forward to lockdown and this photo, suggests the couple may now be expecting their first child.The fond arrival of which will mean a heavy-hearted goodbye to those late-night, lust-filled liaisons that had the rest of us drooling with envy.Kaiser Chiefs frontman Ricky Wilson says he amuses himself by lying in interviews then changing his Wikipedia page to match his inventions.It reminds me of my stint as a royal correspondent when, after days of being on the road together, we would challenge each other to use silly names in stories.Hence, “Toby Lerone” was quoted in an article filed from the royals’ favourite ski resort in Switzerland, and in another story to do with Italy, “Sam Buca” made an appearance.Daft, I know, but it amused usno one .Mr Pendragon, who refuses to pay to park, says they stopped him from leaving his car on nearby roads.Shouldn’t he have been on horseback Bored by St Tropez, billionaires are reportedly snapping up “expedition yachts” that will take them to more adventurous corners of the globe.The one owned by US billionaire Ray Dalio has three deep-ing submersibles, and converted former Soviet spy boat Olivia is currently on the market for £million.Back home, lock-down quarantine rules have forced a  per cent rise in multi-millionaire Brits splashing their cash on vast private pools.Meanwhile, the rest of us will make do with a boat in the bath and a paddling pool.Sarah Ferguson – aka Prince Andrew’s ex we – is building up quite a following on her YouTube channel, where she reads children’s books such as The Wonky Donkey and Little Red Riding Hood while wearing fancy dress.Her success is no surprise, because on the many occasions I’ve seen her at charity events, she always connects brilliantly with the children in attendance.But personally, I can’t wait for her to get round to the critically acclaimed Idan Hadari book about a boy who wants to be famous.It’s called Andrew’s Claim To Fame.Or, in the Duke of York’s case, should that be infamy Yep. She now looks about .When -year-old Khairi Saadallah started his alleged kne rampage in a Reading park, a young, off-duty police officer ran towards the danger and rugby tackled him to the ground.It was a selfless act of bravery that, according to sources, saved “many more people dying”.Meanwhile, a judge has praised the bravery of PC Andrew Harper, who died after being dragged along by a car as he chased some thieves.Both of these are salutary reminders that, while every police force in the world has a few bad apples, the majority of those working in law enforcement are undeniably courageous people doing a tough job that most of us would shy away from.The latest money-making exercise candle from Gwyneth Paltrow is called This Smells Like My Orgasm.Which, as you ask, is “tart grapefruit, neroli, and ripe cassis berries blended with gunpowder tea and Turkish rose absolutes”. Er, right.Like its highly successful predecessor This Smells Like My Vagina candle – which, for the blissfully unaware, is “geranium, citrusy bergamot, and cedar absolutes juxtaposed with Damask rose and ambrette seed” – it costs£.Clearly, she’s a sales genius who could flog underwear to a nudist, but one suspects any attempt to branch out with a, to put it politely, Smells Like My Winkle range might prove a tougher sell.Hmmm.

The Prime Minister announced that we were at last allowed out of our Great British Hibernation.We can go to the pub, buy useless tat in shops and queue up for plaster lawn ornaments from garden centres. We can have the in-laws round to visit! Yoot!⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesBoris says that his decision was made on good scientic advice. Hmm, maybe. It is true that the infection rate for Covid has been dropping rapidly for some time. But it’s still there, still hanging around with mischief on its mind. All it takes is one person in a gathering of  or  at some pizza joint and that infection rate will be up again quickly enough.In some of the countries that have released their people from lockdown, a second spike has occurred.In Germany the famous “R” rate for infection is well above the dreaded one. South Korea and Spain have seen new outbreaks, too.But the truth is Boris didn’t have much of an option. The public is bored stf and the economy is wrecked.I suspect the decision was arrived at on those grounds, rather than strictly on the science. Everyone wants to go out and spend money. I am not sure why they do.  There were good things about lockdown — and it taught us one or two truths about ourselves.It was a pleasure to hear the birds singing, for example. A real delight to see the roads free from traffic. The skies are full of swts and swallows instead of the incessant airline flights. The quality of the air we breathe improved hugely as a result. So did the water quality of rivers and streams.We went out much, much less. As a consequence, many people saved an awful lot of money because they weren’t wasting it on buying rubbish from shops.People learned to cook — and ate home-prepared meals with their families. The truth is, in normal times, we eat out far more often than is good for us, financially or otherwise. And we shopped locally — the corner stores did a roaring trade — and less often, thus saving carbon emissions.Employers discovered that people could work from home perfectly well. Hopefully this will persuade some to scale back their offices and give people the chance to work from home.Imagine how many homes could be created from disused offices! We wouldn’t have to pave over half the country to sort out our housing crisis. Imagine cutting out the daily commute for ever!We didn’t have to hug people. Indeed, we were barred by law from hugging people. Or kissing them on the bloody cheek, like everyone in the media world does. That, by itself, was a huge bonus for me.My wish is that we take some of that stuff from lockdown and make it the new normal. Live at a quieter, gentler pace. Continue to eat at home — and support our local corner shops. Use the car less. Spend less money on a whole load of b******s we don’t really need. Use aeroplanes not at all, preferably. Right now, the Government has given us licence to go out and do stuff.Here’s my plea. Let’s do a bit less stuff than we used to. Let’s remain kind of half in and half out of lockdown. Whether Covid is still around or not. We’ll end up happier as a result.ONE thing Captain Tom showed us, as he walked around his garden as he approached the age of , is that it’s never too late to make a dference.Bob Dylan is just a young whippersnapper by Tom’s standards.But at the age of  he has just made his finest album in at least three decades, and probably more. Rough And Rowdy Ways is a joy to listen to – and I’d given up on the bloke in the s.If I ever reach  I intend to make a grime album with Rihanna. Get your orders in now.The United Nations has decided to give them to Mauritius. That’s because the islands are nearer Mauritius than they are to the UK. On that basis we could have a good claim to owning Belgium. The islands are important to the UK militarily. And we should keep them. The UN has given us deadlines to hand them over to a country that never owned them. What we should do instead is leave the crooked UN.EXCLUDED from the Government’s loosening of lockdown are Britain’s vibrant community of werewolves and vampires.“It is all very well biting someone’s neck, or ripping their lungs out while howling loudly,” a scientist advising the Government probably said. “But when they do this there is the risk that the virus could be passed on via droplets from the creature’s mouth. Or indeed paws – werewolves do not have a good record of using hand-sanitiser.”By contrast, zombies were praised for their social-distancing technique. “Whenever you see them they are always walking two metres apart with their hands outstretched and bits of flesh falling off their faces,” the same scientist probably added.A spokesman for the National Association of Lycanthropescommented: “This is typical of the prejudice we werewolves face and amounts to discrimination. Actually, I thought I had the virus a few weeks ago. Nasty cough and so on.“But I’m all right nooooowwwwwwooooo.”THE day after the woke ninnies at Warners withdrew the great Hollywood film Gone With The Wind because of “race issues”, guess what happened  Yup, it became the No bestselling film on Amazon. Better still, it reached No in the AppleiTunes chart for TV and film. Not bad for a movie made more than  years ago, huh I suppose it could have been “progressives” buying the film so that they would have something to be outraged about. Or maybe the Ku Klux Klan Film Club has a bigger membership than we thought.More likely though is that people loathe censorship. They don’t like being told what they can and can’t watch. Truth be told it hasn’t been for a good  years. And the process accelerated under Magic Grandpa and his front bench of mouth-breathing dingbats. Now it’s the well-orf who support Labour. And the poor who vote Conservative. But there aren’t enough people called Olly and Poppy in the country, which is why Labour hasn’t won an election for  years. Unless it reconnects with the people it was set up to support, the working class, it won’t win one for another few decades either.A SOCIAL media site had a big hit when it asked people to reveal things they regretted about getting married. The site, Whisper, was inundated with replies. Most were kind of: “I just wish I hadn’t married the fat bastard, full stop.”But some wished they’d had a fling with someone of the same sex first, or felt aggrieved they hadn’t checked out the in-laws first. That was quite a big issue.

The Seventies brought Led Zeppelin and countless rock bands, it gave us heavy metal and punk and Joy Division pretty much all at the same time.The biggest-selling album of the Eighties, Michael Jackson’s Thriller, was actually written by a bloke from Hull, while British greats as erse as Duran Duran and The Smiths ruled the waves.In the Cool Britannia of the Nineties, when Britpop was ringing out of radio networks worldwide, even American stars such as Madonna sought help from British producers such as Nellee Hooper and William Orbit.Then there were the Spice Girls. And Coldplay. Now we’ve got Ed Sheeran and Adele. And it doesn’t stop with artists. Love him or hate him, Simon Cowell’s TV programmes are another British global music phenomenon.But it’s live music where Britain really dominates today. Glastonbury should be taking place this weekend.I’ve played at just about every major festival on the planet, from Coachella in the US to Fuji Rock in Japan, but there is nowhere to touch Glastonbury.It is, quite simply, the greatest show on earth There is a massive ripple effect from Glastonbury. It sets a very high bar for the other  — that’s  — festivals that happen throughout the UK every single summer.And the same crews who build the stages, operate the sound systems, put up the fences and supply the bogs for Glasto are busy for the rest of the summer at other events.Now the independent festival sector is at risk of collapse thanks to the Covid shutdown.Last month, the Association of Independent Festivals , which represents  festivals in the UK, reported that  per cent of its members were facing costs that could ruin their businesses and . per cent were uninsured for Covid- related cancellations.Most of my time these days is spent planning and organising The Big Feastival, which was due to take place here on my farm in Oxfordshire this August Bank Holiday weekend.Of course I’m devastated it won’t be going ahead, but the really sad thing is that it looks like no one is going to hear any live music, new or old this summer.That’s a tragedy for the musicians who rely on gigging to make a living — as well as all the other people whose income relies on live music.The Musicians’ Union says its members have lost more than £million in income during the lockdown. Remember, that most musicians just scrape by at the best of times.Big stars are bigger than ever before, but they are the exception not the rule. When Adele releases another record there is a danger she will become so massive she will collapse into a black hole.But now bands need an audience to play to and also financial support, which used to come from record companies but now is hard to find.Records, or downloads, are basically free these days, so live shows are the only real way to make money.In the same way restaurants were already struggling before lockdown, many of Britain’s smaller live music venues were struggling too.So most of the places I played in the early days with Blur have already dis- appeared. They need to be able to open their doors again, as do festivals.It has to be possible to find a way. Just as with pubs, restaurants and cinemas, you could limit the number of people allowed into a venue.Perhaps more gigs could be seated to ensure social distancing. Not quite the same, but better than nothing.As far as the rest of the planet is concerned, Britain is represented pretty much by the Royal Family, football and music.We must keep our festival circuit alive and nurture new artists.That means we urgently have to find a way for music to be played to a live audience, evenit’s only a small one — so that we can keep meaning something to the rest of the world.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But his determination to do what is right by the children made the real dference.Contrast that with the union militants and council leaders of the Left.

But this is the Government’s vision for our summer as it tries to save businesses while keeping us safe.To which we say: Well, good luck with that. We understand the reasoning.

Wildle department officers plan to lure the creatures into cages and take them to a clinic, where they will be sedated, sterilised and left with a tattoo to mark their neutering.

He said: Im used to seeing them walking around, playing on the street.If theyre all gone, Id definitely be lonely.Narongporn Daudduem from the wildle department acknowledges locals will have to give their consent.

We are pretty sure he was knocked unconscious under the water and he didn’t come back up again. “Ralph and I saw what was happening and we climbed over and started trying to pull him out. “His friend also climbed over and tried to pull him out, he was unconscious. “We were telling them to pull his head out of the water, and Ralph was trying to do that and had a hold of him and was swimming alongside him. “His friend then lost his grip on him and he started getting pushed down the river because of the current. “A fisherman jumped in and helped us to grab him and pull him out to put him on the side of the river. “That was when someone  started to perform CPR on him, the ambulance service were telling them what to do on the phone. “I tried to do CPR but I wasn’t strong enough so I asked for help. “After all of this another one of his friends had tried to save him by grabbing the leguard ring and ing in. “We were all focusing on the first man we didn’t realise the second one had been swept away.“Because my friends and I go there quite a lot we know to avoid the middle of the river because of the hotspots. “But these guys didn’t know where they shouldn’t jump and got sucked into the current.“I’ve been going there for a long time and nothing like this has ever happened before.”Ralph added: “A group of us were at the weir and suddenly I heard the guys screaming, three of them were in the water and one was unconscious. “They were trying to get him out, and when I heard the screaming I jumped in and climbed down the weir and tried to help them pull him out. “His head was really under the water, his friend seemed to lose his grip on him and he went even further under the water. “As he went down the river someone helped us to get him on the bank and then an older guy performed CPR on him. “I’m glad he’s alive, I know he’s in the hospital but I hope he is okay. There was a lot going on at that moment. “The part that they jumped into was probably the most dangerous part of the weir, we did try to find his friend but we didn’t want to risk it when we know what the currents are like. “It’s generally a pretty safe place to go and swim but I don’t think we will be going back there again.”Both boys jumped back in to try to save Syrian refugee Eyad after he had also tried to save his pal. Other members of the Syrian community in West London also travelled to the riverbank after learning their friend, , who lives in Uxbridge, had gone missing.Jacks mum Nicola Thomas said: “It’s heartbreaking for the boys to see all of this, and for the family of the man that it’s happened to. “I didn’t know whether to shout at Jack or hug him at first, because he’s put himself in danger jumping in but I am proud of him. “They definitely saved his le, there is no doubt about that.”The tragedy came as temperatures soared to around C on Tuesday as Britains heatwave continues.Officials from the Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service said crews were at the riverside for almost three-and-a-half hours.A spokesman said: We are urging residents across Berkshire to take care near water.As the warm weather continues, it may be tempting to swim in open water, but there are many dangers involved.One of the main risks when entering the water is cold water shock, eventhe weather is warm.You also do not know what is beneath the surface – there could be unseen currents and reeds, which could pull you under.”LPA Commander for Windsor  Maidenhead, Superintendent Colin Hudson, said: “Officers have been working tirelessly with our partners to locate the man who entered the water yesterday, and have now tragically found a body.“We are grateful for the support we received from both Berkshire and Buckinghamshire Fire and Rescue Services, South Central Ambulance Service, and Berkshire Lowland Search and Rescue.“I would also like to thank members of the public who provided information as well as assistance to my officers.“I would like to thank them for their patience while officers investigated this incident, and we will be leaving the scene shortly.“I am very sorry to have to bring this sad news.“Our thoughts are with both men’s families during this very upsetting time.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Violence will not be tolerated and units are responding appropriately. This gathering is illegal and we ask anyone in attendance to leave.The crowds in Colville Gardens had dispersed by am.Police were also scrambled to break up an illegal party at Streatham Common, South London.Rows of police vehicles were pictured nearby as officers asked hundreds of people to move on. And there are fears of fresh violence at more illegal parties over the weekend as cops beefed up patrols in the capital.It comes after horrying footage showed cops forced to retreat as they were attacked by mobs when a riot flared in Brixton.One thug was filmed brandishing a sword at police while others smashed up a patrol car, as critics rounded on the Met chief.Two police officers needed hospital treatment after being violence broke out at the street party.Last night, police announced they had deployed more officers in London to tackle potential disorder at new raves and block parties.Extra cops are on Londons streets overnight to quell any further disorder at other unlicensed music events, it was announced on Thursday night.And the Met warned it wouldnt tolerate the violence we have recently seen in London.Met commander Bas Javidsaid: This evening people can expect to see a heightened police presence out in areas where we know these events are taking place.This is in direct response to concerns expressed by our communities, many of whom were scared and shocked by the events taking place outside their homes.He added: We cannot accept the levels of violence that were directed towards our officers last night, and the damage caused to public and private property.The additional officers will wear enhanced personal protective equipmentas they patrol the streets.Meanwhile, cops warned revellers to stay away from Hackney, East London ahead of another unlicensed music event.Police slapped a -hour dispersal zone over Hoxton from midday today.The order will allow officers to disperse rowdy partygoers causing anti-social behaviour.Tory MP Andrew Bridgen told MailOnline: Cressida Dick has lost control of the streets to a lawless minority. She has lost the confidence of the law abiding majority of residents in Brixton and the country and by effectively abandoning them to mob rule.Following the Brixton violence, The Met Police Federation said: Police officers are not punchbags. This violence is despicable. We wish our injured colleagues all well.Ken Marsh, chairman of the politan Police Federation, said: No one expects this level of violence and hostility to just erupt at the speed it does towards police. Its horrendousWe are rufty-tufty and can deal with violent disorder but its not pleasant and its not nice to have to go somewhere where someone wants to try and kill you.Footage emerged showing how one thug brandishing a blade at officers in the terrying scenes.Others were filmed screaming as two youths climbed on top of a cop car and started to smash it with a bat.A police car with a broken windscreen was abandoned on the side of the road as the riots descended into chaos.The videos also showed a group of cops having to back away from youths as they storm towards them throwing objects.In a clip, a person can be heard saying: They have run the police out of here.And shocking videos uploaded to social media even appeared to show people involved in a terrying kne fight.Ms Patel slammed the violence, saying: Just last weekend, the whole country came together to praise our heroic police officers for putting their own lives on the line to keep us safe.

I mean, I’ve only been able to see Dear Evan Hansen  times so far.And Christmas won’t be the same without the uniquely British tradition of the winter panto. How will all those former boyband stars fund their showbiz lestyles for another year Sadly, post-Covid restrictions look particularly cruel to the arts.Those dastardly droplets mean singing is banned and the idea of packing out a historic theatre where the tiny seats mean you are virtually sitting on top of your neighbour just won’t cut it.But in the middle of an international health emergency it’s all too easy to dismiss the importance of stage shows, movies, the TV industry, festivals and concerts.The attitude seems to be: “We’re dying, goddammit, the economy is cratering, don’t talk to me about the bloody theatre!”But that approach will mean Britain is cakewalking into a cultural catastrophe that could wipe off decades of creative progress, end our modern domination of the arts and entertainment and see the closure of most historic theatres before the end of the year.If that is yet another horrid consequence of Covid-, a disease most likely spread because of a despicable Chinese wet market, I will be fuming.Dame Judi Denchs warning that theatres may not open again in her letime is as stark as it is horrying.It would wipe out £.billion of annual ticket sales, see , good folk lose their jobs and damage tourism.While the pressure is building by the day on the Government to launch yet another unprecedented rescue package, I think that’s only part of the answer.Entertainment is a big-money industry dominated by super-wealthy moguls who have a responsibility to look after as many of their loyal staff and young creatives as humanly possible.Now is the time for other celebrities and businesspeople who have earned a small fortune from the creative industries to give back.Where are all those Hollywood stars, with hundreds of millions in the bank, who rush to perform on the West End stage to be seen as a real actor, dahling Surely they could donate a tiny portion of their wealth to set up a private rescue fund for theatres For example, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the South Park creators who are behind The Book Of Mormon, are worth a billion bucks.JK Rowling, whose Harry Potter play The Cursed Child is at the Palace Theatre, has a £million fortune.We Will Rock You producer Robert de Niro has £million in the bank, Sister Act producer and star Whoopi Goldberg £million, and West End favourite Dame Helen Mirren £million.I could name a hundred other multi-millionaire stars who have used the West End to enhance their careers who owe it to the backroom staff on the breadline to be part of the solution.Thankfully, the king of theatre — Lord Lloyd-Webber — has, as ever, proved inspirational and innovative.Without being asked, he is putting his money where his mouth is to PROVE to the Government that it is possible to safely reopen theatres WITHOUT ANY social distancing by using enhanced precautions such as temperature checks on the door and face masks for all audience members.The Government must listen to him and embrace his case study of Phantom Of The Opera, which has remained open in South Korea throughout the pandemic with no issues.Otherwise, we risk the curtain coming down for good.BACKING down so quickly on extending Sunday trading hours was a disappointing move forced by Tory backbenchers.While on first glance the idea of allowing supermarkets and other shops to stay open longer on our day of rest sounds unappealing to many workers, the reality is that this change would have probably saved many jobs in the long run.It’s nonsensical that on one day of the week most Tescos can only open for six hours, while international delivery services such as Amazon continue to decimate their business, especially now with social-distancing measures making it even more unappealing to spend time lining up outside.By contrast, the other night I was able to order an Amazon Prime Now delivery to arrive at my house at pm on a Sunday night.I’d ordered an Uber Eats takeaway from McDonald’s two hours earlier.The archaic current trading hours laws were introduced in , the year Jeff Bezos created a fledgling online book store called Amazon.Like it or not, that business has created a dferent world of consumerism.Compromises to allow workers the option not to take on more Sunday work, leaving the additional hours to those who want to earn extra cash, could make the necessary move more palatable.But let’s not avoid having the debate.THE Culture Secretary has so much on his plate that Shirley Ballas used an innovative approach to attract his attention this week – and it worked.Launching an impassioned plea to Oliver Dowden to “safely open” ballroom dance studios on my talkRADIO Drivetime show, the Strictly Come Dancing judge teased: “If Oliver is out there, I don’t even mind having a cha-cha-cha with him to show him it is possible to social distance.”Clearly the power of the Queen of Latin remains undiminished.Within hours, Oliver had tweeted: “Shirley, as a Strictly fan, I’m happy to talk about how we can get dancing going safely again. Great offer on the cha-cha-cha – I’ll get practising.”Expect dance studios to be back in business imminently, then.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Being from the UK, it’s one of those gigs I think everyone wants to do. Hopefully next year.“But no f***ing way am I camping. No way. I’d have to build a house for it to work.“I’ve been to so many festivals with my mates but I’ve not done any camping stuff.“I’ve got the worst OCD so I wouldn’t be camping at all. That’s probably why I don’t have crazy stories from festivals.”Essex-born Jonas, whose real name is Guy James Robin, has cemented himself as one of the biggest names in dance music in the past five years, selling more than million records.Today he’s back with summer anthem Naked, featuring US singer MAX, but it won’t be part of a bigger collection after he decided releasing full albums is no longer for him.Jonas said: “I’m not going to be doing an album any time soon. I really enjoy doing singles. I can move quickly with them, especially in the world that I’m in, because the trends are forever changing.“I’m not planning to saturate the market with loads of records, it’s just about putting Naked out and that being my biggest record to date, I hope.”Jonas hopes the song will be “uplting” for people as we come out of lockdown. But as someone who knows nightclubs better than anyone , he insisted there is no chance they can reopen anytime soon.He explained: “Clubs will not work, how can you tell , drunk people to stand a metre or two metres apart  It’s never going to f***ing work.“It wouldn’t work with meI’d had a few drinks. I wouldn’t even know what two metres is at that point.”SHE is usually a Glasto regular and it’s a good bet you will find her partying into the early hours, but Rita Ora will have to make do with her back garden this weekend.The How To Be Lonely singer shared this photo on Instagram while sunbathing at home in her bra in the scorching temperatures.But she didn’t put as much thought into what she’d be wearing as she would have doneshe was heading to Somerset.She captioned the snap: “Can’t find my bikini.”It must have been a welcome relief for her to get outside though, having spent lockdown working hard on new music.She posted another photo of her home studio, where it was C, and wrote: “Hope you are all having fun outside enjoying the sun, meanwhile we’re cutting vocals with no air con.”Just think about all the tunes you’ll have to perform by the time you hit Worthy Farm next year, Rita.The superstar had said her album would be coming in September but her manager has now confirmed it is being pushed back, partly because the coronavirus crisis prevented her from finishing it.Jonathan Dickins said: “It isn’t coming in September. It’ll be ready when it’s ready.“We’re all in the same boat. You’re doing stuff and then suddenly the world stops.“It’ll come when it’s ready. We have music but we’re still working.”It’s been five years since her third album  was released, while January will mark a decade since her breakthrough record  which sold million copies to become one of the biggest records of all time.If Adele has taught us anything with her music, it’s that it will certainly be worth the wait.LITTLE MIX’s Jesy Nelson probably wouldn’t get very far across Worthy Farm in these shoes.She showed off slippers made to look like her pet pooches on Instagram, amid hopes the girl group could be signed up for next year’s festival.They are expected to have released their sixth album by then and could be a perfect signing for a team eager for more female artists.Jesy said in : “We would love to do Glastonbury, it would be incredible for us to do that. I think we’d be able to get a new audience that maybe we don’t have, people who aren’t too sure about Little Mix. We could prove them wrong, change their mind.”The singer, whose song Blue Jumper is out today, was picked up while supporting the band on tour but almost didn’t get to play for a music boss in the crowd.She said: “I’d gone over a little bit on my set. I was about to do my one hit and the stage director said, ‘You need to finish now’.“The head of Universal had just arrived. Richard ran over and was like, ‘No, let her play another’.”FOO FIGHTERS’ incredible  headline set is among a load of performances stream-ing through iPlayer over the weekend. You can also see Beyonce, David Bowie, Blur, George Ezra, Arctic Monkeys and more.THIS year’s festival was due to be the biggest yet but organiser Emily Eavis has insisted ticket holders are in for a bumper event when it s next year.She said they are hoping to roll over much of this year’s line-up, but had already booked loads of acts for , which may even mean making the festival longer.Emily said: “We’re rolling two festivals together for . We’ve got a hell of a lot of surprises and things that we were planning for the thand we’re going to try to get those things going for next year.“Logistically it’s a little bit complicated because we’d already pencilled in many of the acts for . It was one of those very unusual years where you’re quite far ahead, two years ahead, on the line-up. So we’re trying to work out how much we can fit into next year.“We’ve had lots of amazing letters from people with ideas of how we could make it into like a two-week holiday or run over three weekends. There’s lots of ideas going.”Taylor Swt Kendrick Lamar and Sir Paul McCartney were due to headline this weekend and Emily is hoping they will all be back, especially Beatles legend Paul.She said on BBC  Music: “I really hope he’ll be back next year singing it from the Pyramid and we’ll all be in tears, going, ‘It’s happened, we’re back’.”Me too.SIMON BOYLE - COLDPLAY : THEIR fourth time as headline act and they proved to be one of the greatest ever. CHRIS MARTIN and co won over even the most sceptical festivalgoer and had people in tears with their performance, complete with confetti, light-up bracelets and fireworks.JOE KASPER - DAVE : IT wasn’t just his fantastic performance but meeting his fan Alex Mann, who he got up from the crowd to rap his song Thiago Silva. It was enough to convert workmates I had dragged along to become fans of the Mercury Prize winner and, dare I say, grime.HOWELL DAVIES - LORDE : AT only , she proved to be a cut above when she delivered a standout set, partly from within a huge glass box suspended on stage. The Kiwi’s rousing tracks were lapped up and her visuals included dancers, lasers and clouds of smoke.ELLIE HENMAN - LEWIS CAPALDI : THE moment he swaggered on dressed as Noel Gallagher, I knew this set would be my highlight. At the end he told the massive crowd: “If you haven’t enjoyed it keep it to your f***ing self.” Safe to say, everyone loved it.KESHA has released a tribute to Marc Bolan of T.Rex, who headlined the first Glasto in .

Gradually build up time spent apart.Animals have sensitive noses and using pet-specic cleaning products in the home can be helpful to reduce their anxiety.Making sure there are no harsh smells will lower tension levels and allows your pet to relax. .Keep cat litter trays clean, and for very attached pets, especially puppies, leaving something with your scent on, like a T-shirt or old towel, can be soothing.Playing gentle music at a low volume can help to distract from any unfamiliar noises that may worry them.There are even pet podcasts available.Pets who knew le before lockdown should slip back into previous family routines eventually.Cats are already more solitary creatures, and dogs should cope wellyou prepare them properly.However, puppies that have only ever known lockdown, or dogs that have become too used to your company, may find it more challenging.A good way to help them adjust is by pretending to go back to work. Put on office clothes or a school unorm and act out your pre-lockdown morning routines.Go through the motions of leaving for work. Pick up your car keys, settle your pet, then close the door and leave them, evenyou only go and sit in the garden or take a walk.You might feel silly, but this can be really helpful for your pet, especiallythey have only ever seen you in your “off-duty”, stay-home outfits.When you come back in it’s vital that you wait until your pet is calm before greeting them, whether that takes five minutes or five hours.Don’t join in OTT celebrations or encourage reunion “zoomies”, as long- term this can enhance anxious behaviour and increase stress levels.By taking things slowly your pet won’t find the transition back to post-lockdown le too dficult.However,furry friends don’t seem to be settling well and you encounter signs of anxiety, such as toilet issues, high heart rates, constant chewing or scratching, it’s worth seeking advice from a qualied animal behaviourist apbc.org.uk or your vet.A remote camera can give clues to situations you might not be aware of, such as noises, that could be troubling your pet in your absence.With everyone at home constantly during lockdown, our pets may have struggled to rest properly.Cats famously like to snooze but dogs also need up to  hours of sleep a day and may have found lockdown exhausting.Sometimes pets are actually anxious because our constant company means they are over-tired and over-stimulated and now can’t think straight.For all pets it is up to us to ensure they are not disturbed when they are taking time out.Cats are generally good at taking themselves off to cat nap so just leave them to rest, but dogs often need a bit more help to switch off.Don’t fuss over them while they catch some sleep and help children to understand that when their best friend is snoozing, they need to be left in peace.For dogs in particular, lockdown may have changed their exercise routines dramatically, with some getting more frequent or far longer walks than previously.Start to readjust this now, to correlate daily timetables with your regular routines ing.If you normally walk your dog at specic times of the day, such as before and after work, then resume going for walkies on this schedule.Oryou normally use a dog walker or have help from another person during the day, make the effort to introduce them now, especiallyyou have a pet who hasn’t met them yet.If you are one of the many new pet owners who got a puppy or kitten during lockdown you’ve had a lovely honeymoon period to bond with your new buddy.However, it also means it’s likely your pet has never spent any time home alone.Before leaving you new addition solo, you must do sufficient training to ensure your puppy or kitten understands that being separated from you is OK.With puppies, build up slowly to ensure they are happy and get used to the idea of being handled by other people and socialising with other dogs.You can stay with your pupthey are more confident with you around but don’t allow them to be clingy and always reward positive, confident behaviour.For cats, six months is the ideal age to start training with a cat flapyou plan to use one.Professional help with training is now permitted again under government rules and is strongly advised.A bored pet can be an anxious pet. If they are under-stimulated their minds wander and your home can suffer the consequences – so keep them busy.For dogs, toys stuffed with treats, or scattering snacks into their bed to hunt, will give them something to do.There are also tutorials online for making home-made games and toys.For cats, include circuits and teasers to prevent your furniture being damaged.Rotate dferent ones daily, so there is always something new for your pet to investigate and play with.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And while the Government and pub owners are hopeful that weaposre going to flock back to pubs, it looks like it is going to be a very dferent experience. The Prime Minister has given the go-ahead for pubs, restaurants and hotels to reopen as of next month - albeit with social distancing restrictions in place - while non-essential retail is already free to resume selling. It will be easier for pubs to change how they work It is a bit technical, but it is the change that makes all the other bits possible. The bill will change the way pubs ask local councils for permission on changing how they open. It will reduce the consultation period for applications for pavement licences to from  calendar days to  working days, and grant consent after  working daysthe council does not issue a decision And it lowers application fee for a pavement and street cafe licence to just £.  Get used to being outside With a hard limit on the number of people allowed to be inside a pub at any given time, you wonapost be propping up the bar anytime soon. In fact you wonapost be allowed to - inside people will have to be sat at a table to enjoy a drink. But perhaps the most noticeable change youaposll see at your local under under proposals laid out in the Business and Planning Bill, is that outside seating will become the norm. And to make that easier any outside areas that a pub has control over, like a car park, will be allowed to turn into seating areas.  You can take a pint homeAs part of the plans unveiled on Thursday, licensed premises will be able to serve booze for punters to take away and consume where in efforts to stop drinkers crowding indoors. While some pubs did this before and may have relied on it to keep themselves afloat during the lockdown, more pubs than ever will sell drinks for you to take home or drink off-premises in a bid to keep people as distanced as possible. More drinking space on the pavement outside pubs As part of the bill, Ministers are hoping to change how pubs get permission to set up on the pavements outside their doors. It will let a licence-holder to place removable furniture over certain highways adjacent to the premises. This is a streamlined process to allow businesses to secure these licences in time for the summer and allow these licences to remain in place for a year but not beyond  September   Youaposll also see more outdoor markets Meanwhile, outdoor markets, summer fairs and car boot sales will no longer need planning permission, meaning their hours can be extended without prior approval.

He gave Westferry Printworks, planned by billionaire Tory donor Richard Desmond, the green light on January  - hours before a council levy kicked in that would have cost the developer around £m. Itaposs since emerged Mr Desmond showed the minister a video of the scheme on his phone at a Tory fundraising dinner in November, and texted him asking him to approve it before the deadline. The new messages show that on November , Mr Desmond told him we donapost want to give Marxists in Tower Hamlets council loads of doe for nothing. In an e-mail dated January , a government official then said Mr Jenrick was insistent that decision issued this week ie tomorrow - as next week the viability of the scheme is impacted by the levy. Mr Desmond is not accused of wrongdoing, and Mr Jenrick has insisted that while there could have been an appearance of bias, there was no actual bias. Even so, the minister cancelled his approval to avoid a perception of bias in favour of the scheme. Downing Street today said the Prime Minister still had full confidence in Mr Jenrick, even though Mr Johnson spoke to the minister in recent days.

A radar for the £.billion carriers is  months late and costs for their warplanes have ballooned by £.billion, the National Audit Office said. It published its latest report on the vast “Carrier Strike” project which includes HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales warships. A £.billion deal for three Fleet Solid Support ships to provide the carrier group with food, ammunition and explosives has been shelved amid a row over where they should be built, and whether a foreign shipyard can do it cheaper than a UK consortium.  “The MoD has made slow progress developing three new support ships, which are crucial to Carrier Strike’s operation,” says the NAO. “It has only one ship able to resupply the carriers with the supplies they need, such as ammunition and food. “The MoD has long been aware that this will restrict Carrier Strike, and the cancellation of a recent competition to build new supply ships – because of concerns over value for money – mean they will not be available until the late s.” Defence chiefs are still stalling on ordering all the F- Lightning jets they want, including planes which will fly from the carriers.“Since the NAO last reported in , the approved cost of the Lightning project has increased by % from £.billion to £.billion because of additional expenditure on system upgrades, integration of UK weapons and sustainment costs,” revealed the watchdog. “The MoD is planning to review the number and types of jets it needs, but buying fewer aircraft would affect how Carrier Strike can be used.” And the Whitehall spending watchdog said the new Crowsnest airborne radar system which is a key part of Carrier Strike’s protection – is  months late. It added: “This will affect Carrier Strike’s capabilities for its first two years of operation.” Commons Public Accounts Committee chairwoman Meg Hillier said: The Ministry of Defence has lofty ambitions for the carriers but hasnapost put its money where its mouth is. “Worryingly, it still doesnapost know the full cost of supporting and operating Carrier Strike.It must now ensure that the three frontline commands involved sing from the same hymn sheet. “Otherwise, the Royal Navy will be stuck with a hollowed-out capability and unable to satisfy expectations. Shadow Defence Secretary John Healey said: “This is the latest in a long line of NAO reports to say the Government can’t get its defence equipment budgets or buying right.  “Ministers are letting Britain’s defence down. “For the last  years ministers have left Britain with no capability for ship-launched aircraft to deal with military conflicts or humanitarian relief. “Carrier Strike is Britain’s next generation defence force but despite some progress it is still undermined by the failure to secure sufficient munitions, tactical IT systems and the critical radar system, which will affect Carrier Strike’s capabilities in its first two years. “The Defence Secretary must get a grip of these problems and guarantee this vital part of the nation’s defences.” NAO chief Gareth Davies said: “The MoD has made good progress with the big-ticket items needed to deliver Carrier Strike, such as the carriers, the first squadron of jets and the new infrastructure.

Both are believed to be super-Earths - planets which have a mass higher than Earth but substantially below those of local ice giants Uranus and Neptune. The discovery was made by an international team of astronomers, including researchers from the University of Hertfordshire, The Open University and Queen Mary University of London. The scientists used a technique known as Doppler wobble, which enabled them to find the planets by measuring their gravitational interaction with GJ . As a planet orbits, it causes its parent star to wobble by a tiny degree. Astronomers can see the signature of this effect in the light emitted by the star. The researchers believe both GJ b and GJ c lie close to the inner edge of habitable zone and may be too hot to maintain liquid water on their surfaces. They estimate the surface temperature of GJ c, which takes . days to circle its host star, to be around C. GJ b, meanwhile, is much closer to the star, with an orbital period of . days. But the researchers say GJ  is less active than other red dwarfs, so the newly discovered worlds may be spared from strong stellar winds - outflowing material from the star which can erode a planetaposs atmosphere. Hence, the team are keen to learn more about this super-Earth system. Dr John Barnes, an astrophysicist at the Open University and one of the authors on the study published in the journal Science, said: Close orbiting planets like these have a high chance of being tidally locked to their host star. This means that as the planet orbits its star, the same hemisphere always faces the star. For the planets orbiting GJ , half of the planets would be in perpetual daytime and the other half in perpetual night time. So, it could be much cooler on some parts of the planets than others. The researchers also detected an unconfirmed signal, raising hopes of a third planet with a more temperate orbit. But Dr Barnes is cautious about this finding, saying: If the signal is a planet, it would orbit every  days.

She warned that without an emergency budget to give the national finances a big boost the country faced job losses on a level not seen since the s.In an interview with the Mirror, the top Labour figure pledged to rebuild the party’s battered economic reputation as she takes on Chancellor Rishi Sunak in the months ahead.Ms Dodds, the daughter of a small businessman who really cared about his staff and doing his job well, insisted that she was pro-business.to start your day with Jason Beattie’s email briefing at mirror email - bringing analysis of the political picture straight to your inbox.  She praised the response of the private sector - as well as public services - to the coronavirus crisis and insisted the party under Keir Starmer wanted people to succeed.In an interview with the Mirror, she said Labour had to demonstrate to the public that it could deliver on the security so many people were craving. “We’ve got to be really clear, particularly at a time like now, that Labour is on people’s side,” she said. “We want people to succeed, we want to make sure people are protected as well, in a situation that has been so hard for so many. “They need to feel that Labour can deliver on that need for security that so many people are feeling right now.” She stressed she was prepared to take a tough decisions when colleagues asked to make spending commitments. “We need to make sure that the money that people pay in taxes is properly spent,” she said. “If you want to change people’s situation then you’ve got to demonstrate that you can actually deliver that. “If I don’t think something is a good idea, I’ll certainly say that.” But Ms Dodds, who only became an MP in , stood by some of Labour’s pre-election economic policies.  Asked whether she still supported her predecessor John McDonnell’s plan to raise taxes for the top % of earners, she admitted: “I certainly think we need to have a more progressive tax system. “We’ve just gone through a situation where so many people have made enormous sacrices. “After that kind of a situation we do need to make sure that those who are making a contribution are those with the broadest shoulders. “Some of those suggestions that have been swirling around about generalised tax increases should not be what Government should be aiming at.” She added: “We’ve seen lots of cuts to taxation for the very best off people and I think right now those who can make that bigger contribution, should do.”  The Oxford East MP also suggested Labour could increase corporation tax - saying cuts had “not delivered” the additional investment promised. Calling for a thorough review, she that most small businesses were more concerned about business rates. She suggested sticking to some elements of the controversial re-nationalistation pledge - saying it had become “increasingly evident” that the broadband system wasn’t working. “We don’t have that provision across the country at the level it needs to be. The Government really needs to get a grip on that.”Ms Dodds warned that Boris Johnson ’s Government was in danger of acting too late in its handling of the next stage of the crisis, which has claimed at least , lives and tipped the country towards recession.“If we look at other countries, we have been quite slow with the health response. I’m concerned that we might be too slow with the economic response as well,” she said. She called for the furlough job support scheme, which starts to wrap up from July, to be extended for targeted sectors including pubs and leisure that are unable to reopen fully. “We shouldn’t be having the same approach adopted across the economy... we are going to see additional waves of unemployment unfortunately so Government needs to change that.” she said. There should be more support for those who had already lost their jobs and a nationwide programme to create new ones, which would “not necessarily” cost more but should be aimed at those who need it most. In the interview in Stevenage town centre which she visited with Mr Starmer, Ms Dodds backed the Mirror’s ‘Shop for Britain’ campaign which urges people to support local businesses. “High streets are really critical to communities. You can feel a little bit of the buzz coming back here but where people can be shopping locally it makes such a dference because that means the value stays in our communities,” she said.Brexit trade deal “I’m concerned about no deal because lots of businesses have been through such a dficult period during this crisis. If they have yet another disruption at the end of the year that would be very dficult. The Government has promised it will get that deal so we’re saying please make sure you do, the success of British business depends on it. We need to see what comes out of their negotiations. If they don’t reach that agreement then obviously we’ll try to make sure we don’t end up in a situation where business is harmed further, where more jobs are lost. We accept that our policy around Brexit was not one that persuaded the country.” Black Lives Matter “We’ve seen so many dferent reviews which have shown there is inequality, there is discrimination, so many recommendations about what needs to change and yet what has actually changed  Very little. The Government has announced yet another review but we know what isn’t working. Let’s just get on and fix it. There are big inequalities in the health and economic impact of this crisis. We need to do something about that. People felt that honouring certain iniduals in the way a statue does was deeply offensive, particularlythat suggested some of the practices around slavery were acceptable. I can fully understand that concern. There’s been a long argument around Cecil Rhodes in my own city for a very long time. It’s very clear that there’s an overwhelming consensus in favour of Rhodes not being honoured in that way.” Women in politics “There seems to be a big gap when it comes to engagement in economic questions. Sometimes I’d be sitting in the Commons when we’re talking about financial matters, and it’s not like these issues don’t affect women. What’s critical to me is whether we have leadership that wants to hear from women and represent women - ultimately a leader who is a feminist and I know that Keir is. Social media can be a wonderful thing but because it’s easy to be anonymous the kind of abuse that women can get is really concerning. It really shouldn’t be a barrier to people becoming engaged.” Climate change “We’ve learnt during this crisis that there can be theoretical risks which suddenly affect us very deeply. With the climate crisis we know we’re having record-breaking temperatures with increased frequency. Just last year the heatwaves we had were associated with quite a large number of people dying. I’m an optimist, there’s lots we can do to reduce carbon in our economy which will create highly skilled jobs at the same time. We’ve had a frustrating situation with on-shore windfarms because regulation has been completely choked off by regulation. There has got to be substantial change in aviation but we’ve got to do it in a planned way. It’s so dficult to get around dferent parts of the UK.” The Tories “I’d never focus on inidual personalities but Rishi Sunak has a big challenge now because there’s a very critical question about how we have an exit strategy which works for the country. I‘m appalled by the fact that we’ve had  years where people’s living standards are constrained in the UK. So many people who are working are really struggling.

But, says Phyllis Taylor, the ­moment she walked into the room, ­everything suddenly changed. The -year-old ethical fashion company founder says: “I had an ­incident where I got an email from a well-known high street brand to come in for a meeting, but the energy changed the minute she saw me.” London-based Phyllis, who launched Ghanaian-influenced Sika Designs  years ago, adds: “It’s not clear from my name where I’m from. “But I felt like the minute I entered the room the energy changed, and it just went downhill from there.” The fashion industry has long had a problem with a lack of inclusion for black models and designers, and it is the same for stylists, photographers, writers and art directors. The appointment of Edward Enninful, the first black editor-in-chief at the helm of British Vogue in  was widely welcomed. Andyou’re talking make-up, Pat McGrath, a black Brit from Northampton of Jamaican heritage, is the world’s most in-demand and influential artist, as well as the founder of luxury cosmetic brand Pat McGrath Labs, worth a reported billion. Black designers including Princess Diana favourite Bruce Oldfield, Ozwald Boateng, the first black designer to open on London’s Savile Row, and the late Joe Casely-Hayford who dressed rock stars and prime ministers, have blazed trails in the UK since the s.  And a new crop of talented contemporary black British designers, among them Martine Rose, Grace Wales Bonner and Samuel Ross, is emerging. But the high cost of further education, and accusations that top fashion schools such as Central Saint Martins are elitist, may explain why there aren’t more.In the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of the police, the spotlight has been shone on the systemic racism that affects the lives of black people globally – and fashion has been caught in its glare. In an internal memo to Conde Nast staff, Dame Anna Wintour, American Vogue’s editor-in-chief, apologised to the company’s staff for not finding “enough ways to elevate and give space to black editors, writers, photographers, designers and other creators”. Arguments over cultural appropriation, earnings disparities and a lack of visibility in fashion magazines means being black and working in fashion means fighting for a seat at the table – or having to create your own. Jermaine R Robinson, a music stylist and image consultant from London, says: “I feel like at the moment there’s a huge focus for black brands. “I know a lot of people who want to invest in that but didn’t know what brands are out there.”  Jermaine, , who has worked with American designer Telfar Clemens and recently shared a list of  black designers on social media, adds: “I put a call out on Insta and got flooded with all dferent kinds of brands. I even found a black-led gothic brand.” On the fashion industry having a problem with racism, he says: “Tokenism is highly active. I feel like there is a glass ceiling to how far we can go, I know many black people who are super talented but they just haven’t been given the time of day.” Activewear designer Dami Howells launched DAMIHOWtwo years ago after seeing that there was very little representation of black women in fitness. She says: “I foundyou wanted to buy gym wear that was comfortable, that makes you look nice and motivated to go to the gym to do any type of workout, it wasn’t very stylish.” While she is getting great feedback from her customers about the quality of her products and the company’s customer service, getting exposure has been a challenge. She adds: “When you reach out to non-black influencers to partner with, you don’t get a response.  “We need more support because everyone is used to buying from the brands they already know and they trust.  “But at the same time it’s refreshing for the community to see themselves being represented in a way that hasn’t happened before.” Fashion lover Emma Mathurine, , often feels uninspired by the offerings on the high street, and unrepresented. Emma, an accountant who also designs carnival costumes for Bel Dyes Massays: “A lot of fashion does come from street culture, of ying ethnicities. If you look at London it’s that ersity that gives it colour but that’s not reflected in the mainstream. There’s a massive underrepresentation of people that look like me as a black Caribbean person.

In these unrelenting days, the poet trusted to speak for Manchester in the hours after the Arena bomb attack, once again has given us a place to pause. Three years ago, the writer Jeanette Winterson said Walsh had found “words where there are no words” through his poem This Is the Place, which he read in Albert Square the day after the bombing. Liam Gallagher said it was “the best thing to come out of any Mancunian’s mouth, ever”.Now, in the time of coronavirus, we are lost for words once more, shattered and struggling to make sense of where we are. And Walsh does it again, finding the common thread of humanity in all our vastly dfering experiences.“Some of us are sewing scrubs and some are sowing seeds   Some are stitching fragments into plans   Some are holding Zoom meetings with babies on our knees   Some are holding only lonely hands.” Being Tony Walsh, this isn’t a ­sentimental place to rest. “So some of us are wealthy, healthy some of us are poor,” he writes. “Some of us will… buy a magic pill   But some of us know ‘some of us’ won’t cut it anymore  If some of us are sick, we all are ill.” Speaking to him on the phone at home in Manchester, where he is locked down with his we and mother-in-law, who has Alzheimer’s, Walsh is full of the same passion with which he told Manchester “Choose Love”. “We’ve pressed pause on the world,” he says, “we don’t just have to press play again.” Later, the former council officer and factory worker says: “We can’t carry on how we were. Austerity, inequality, this is part of how we’ve got where we are. UK, Brazil, USA – what’s the common thread between the worst affected countries  “Could it be the right-wing nature of those governments  Yet it’s the opposite ideas – community, socialism, working together, internationalism – that have got us through.” The third anniversary of the Arena bombing on May  has recently passed, taking away none of the pain for bereaved or survivors, or the conflicted sense Walsh feels of forever being associated with that horric moment. ‘Tony Walsh’ was trending across the globe on social media, as his city was still clearing up the broken glass and surgeons were operating. “Three years on, there’s not one day that goes by that it isn’t in front of me,” he says. “I get letters, emails every day about it. I took that responsibility very seriously. It weighed heavily on me. But I know what an absolute privilege it was to be there on the square that day. As a writer you are in the business of conveying truths and creating connections.”  His latest poem was a commission from New Writing North, which supports writing in the north of England. “It started from wordplay – some of us are doing this, some are doing that, that became the Sum of Us, collectively,” Walsh says. “It started from thank you, but it needed to be more. The understanding that as long as the virus exists in the world, we’ve all got it.” As the father of a  and a  year old, Walsh worries particularly about the future for young people. “It’s like when I was , working at the sausage factory after  months on the dole, and we used to greet each other with ‘are you working ’,” he says. “No one was working then. I fear we are heading back to those days.”  As Walsh says: “Everything I work in – theatre, events, conferences, education, all are closed down. All I’ve got left is the scribbling business.” The last few weeks have seen some extraordinary responses from poets. A video of Hollow by Vanessa Kisuule, the Bristol City Poet for -, about the toppling of the Edward Colston statue in Bristol as part of #BlackLivesMatter, has been shared over half a million times. When we have no words, it’s poetry that can speak for us – yet arts organisations are now the drowning ones, without enough le support systems to go around. Walsh has written movingly about this in his poem, Arts and Minds, which will shortly be released as a video.

Figures show , confirmed cases from May  to June  that were transferred to the call centre-based scheme – still missing its vital app – were not reached. Shadow Health Minister Justin Madders said the revelation raises “major concerns”.Prime Minister Boris Johnson had vowed a “world-beating” test and trace system would be in place by the beginning of this month.And Health Secretary Matt Hancock promised an app essential to the scheme would be in action by the middle of May. But the original version of the NHSX app, which £million had been poured into, was scrapped last week after flunking a trial. Mr Madders said: “To have a quarter of those who test positive not contacted three weeks into the ‘world-beating’ system is not good enough and needs to be addressed. “Expert opinion shows to defeat this virus we need a fully ing test and trace system, so these figures raise major concerns the week before lockdown measures are eased further – ­especially without a working app.” The % includes people the service could not reach as there was no response to text, email and call reminders. It also takes in those reached but who refused to give details of close contacts. Another , % of the total, did not provide contact details when tested.  In total, , people who tested positive in England had their case transferred to the system during the first three weeks of its operation, Department of Health figures show. Of these, ,were reached and asked to give details of contacts. Ian Hudspeth, chairman of the Local Government Association’s Community Wellbeing Board, also branded the figures “concerning”. He said: “Those testing positive have a responsibility to help halt its transmission and protect those most at risk.” Mr Hancock has refused to put a date on when a working app will be available. He said on Wednesday: “The app is progressing and we will launch it when the time is right.”  The SAGE advisory group was urging an increase in test and trace using a call centre system similar to the one in place now as early as February. In a development on testing, six walk-in centres will be trialled in Newcastle, Rochdale, Leeds, Slough, and Brent and Newham in London. Sites are not confirmed – but one is understood to be at a basketball court. And there are reports they will use empty shops and car parks. The PM’s spokesman said: “We want to ensure testing is available in places which are accessible and work for the public.” It comes as surgeons called for access to same-day testing. The Royal College of Surgeons of England said a million people were waiting more than  weeks for hospital treatment.

The ONS said that despite the latest figures suggesting the proportion of people with Covid- is slightly higher than in previous weeks , the uncertainty surrounding these estimates means #xCwe do not at this point have evidence that the current trend is anything other than flat#xD.

Kalynn Wangle, , claims to have seen the mythical creature on June  and her sighting has since been confirmed by the Official Loch Ness Monster register.However Kaylnn didnapost see Nessie in real le she said she was watching Urquhart Bay via webcam, the Daily Record reports.The Loch Ness monster enthusiast, from Oregon, US, said Nessie appeared for around  minutes. Exciting footage shows a black dot floating near the surface of the water.  It begins to move left across the bay, occasionally ducking under the waves. Kalynn said this is her second sighting with her first being recorded on  April and lasting around seven minutes.A video taken from the webcam on this occasion apparently shows Nessie submerging and re-merging as it nears Urquhart Bay.Posting about the footage, Kalynn said: “Why is this sighting super epic you ask  Well, this object surfaces for more than seven minutes. “It moves closer to the shore, it constantly changes shape and splashes about and is not a boat as it just shows up in the middle of the loch. It also appears to be quite large.“This second sighting clearly shows a black object moving across the Loch from right to left.“The object changes shape and goes under the water and comes back up again.Splashing also seems to be visible.”Speaking today, Kalynn said: “Every time I see something unusual on the Nessie cam, I get really excited.It feels unreal every time.I always watch the whole encounter before I go back and record it just to make sure Iaposm seeing what I think Iaposm seeing.“When I first started watching, I was honestly never sureI would ever see anything, so the fact that I have seen and recorded it as many times as I have actually blows my mind.While the black objects I have recorded seem to change speed and shape and will sometimes disappear from view as though it has gone back under the water before it shows up again.“Given the distance of the camera from the water, for something to be that visible from that far away, I would imagine it would have to be quite large.Ruling out the possibility of it being an otter, or seal or even a log really.“Unfortunately, I have not been to Scotland yet, so I have yet to see Nessie in person.I hope to visit Loch Ness one day, as I have always wanted to go there ever since I learned about it and Nessie.Itaposs number one on my list of places to visit."},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown brits use store cupboards","story":"NewsLockdown Brits use store cupboards and bathrooms to get peace and connect to WiFiA study of , people found Brit adults have had to improvise while working from home, using store cupboards and bathrooms to get peace and quiet and rearranging rooms to make them look nicer on video callsShareCommentsBySteve RichmondJoseph WilkesReporter:,  JUN NewsWorking from home can make it harder to get some peace and quiet \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Officers fear that strict social distancing rules will cause tensions to flare up as boozers gear up to open their doors for the first time in nearly four months. July  - or Super Saturday - will see pubs across England welcoming customers back with new safety measures as the coronavirus lockdown is gradually relaxed. These include no dancing, staying at least a metre apart from other customers, keeping voices down and ordering drinks through table service or mobile phone apps rather than heading to the bar.Punters will also be asked to leave their name at the door to help with contract tracing in the event of a coronavirus flare-up.For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here Amid fears that disputes could break out as staff try to ensure customers stick to the new rules, officers have argued that pubs should have been re-opened on a weekday.According to Steve Kent, the chair of South Yorkshireaposs Police Federation, the combination of hot, sunny weather and weekend crowds could create a perfect storm of disorderly behaviour.I think we’re going to have a couple of weeks of New Year’s Eves, he told the Independent. Meanwhile John Apter, chair of the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, has warned that Super Saturday will without doubt add to pressure on already-stretched police, paramedic and wider NHS services. He added that although the economy must get moving after months of lockdown, some were seeing July  as a countdown to party time. “There are worries about alcohol consumption leading to drunken and irresponsible behaviour, and there’s also the concern that people who can’t get into pubs because of restrictions that are still in place may cause conflict, he said. The public have shown support for their key workers during lockdown they can continue to give support by behaving sensibly now that the restrictions are easing.” Lockdown measures in England are set to be signicantly relaxed on July . Pubs, restaurants, hotels and hairdressers will be allowed to re-open and people will be able to gather in slightly larger groups.  For the first time, two households of any size will be able to gather inside - with social distancing. The two-metre rule will also be cut to one metre plus mitigations like face coverings, where two metres canapost be maintained. It comes as Bournemouth council was forced to declare a major incident today after thousands flocked to the seaside town. Overwhelmed police urged day-­trippers to stay away from beaches after the scenes of sunseekers flocking to resorts in the C heat sparked fears of a second coronavirus wave. Bournemouth Council leader Vikki Slade described scenes at the seafront as appalling after extra police were also drafted in amid reports of anti-social behaviour, fights, littering and abuse being hurled at council crews.

Storms are expected to bring heavy rain, lightning and hail - a big dference from yesterdayaposs weather. Two yellow weather warnings for thunderstorms are in place for much of the UK from Thursday to Saturday, warning of disruption due to flooding, lightning strikes, hail and wind. It comes after a heatwave hit the country earlier this week, with highs of C registered in parts of the UK. Yesterday was the hottest day recorded so far in . Under eased lockdown restrictions, Britons can enjoy the heat and visit parks, beaches and, when adhering to social distancing measures, see friends and family. Speaking about the reasons behind the hot spell, Met Office Chief Meteorologist, Dan Suri said: “We quite often see warm, southerly air from the continent bringing these high temperatures to the UK in summer, however this week, the air across the UK has arrived from the Atlantic. This Atlantic air will descend and warm up as it moves across the UK and this in combination with clear skies and strong late-June sunshine, we’re seeing temperatures rise.”  However this could change soon as temperatures are set to drop by about C in some areas of the country. Met Officer forecaster Alex Burkill told : Friday will be another hot day, but less hot than yesterday in many places.The Met Office has two thunderstorm warnings out which cover pretty much all of the UK because of a risk of torrential downpours - with hail, frequent lightning and heavy rain expected. Mr Burkill said: This marks the transition to something more changeable as we go into the weekend.  We are going to see spells of rain, stronger winds and temperatures are going to be less hot. The forecaster said some places will see temperatures dropping by C - remaining mainly in the low-s.  Today: Early showers and thunderstorms in western and southern parts extending north and east with some torrential downpours, lightning and a chance of hail. Sunshine between. Remaining very warm in the west but still hot and humid across much of England.

A trip to the seaside was all the more appealing after three months of lockdown. The vast majority behaved responsibly and continued to observe social distancing rules. Unfortunately, a thoughtless minority let the sun go to their heads. Bournemouth had to declare a major incident after being overwhelmed by visitors.Other resorts saw staff abused and their beaches strewn with litter and detritus. Photographs showed there were frequent breaches of the two-metre rule. There are now fears the behaviour of a selfish few could cause a second Covid wave. Mixed messages from the Government have not helped but this is not solely the fault of ministers. The successful easing of the lockdown requires everyone to act responsibly. The more we respect the guidance, the quicker le canto normal.Taking standKeir Starmer yesterday showed what decisive leadership looks like. Having promised a zero tolerance approach to anti-Semitism he was as good as his word with his sacking of Rebecca Long-Bailey. Allies of the former Shadow Education Secretary feel she has been hard done by and the move could reignite isions in Labour. But the party leader should be applauded for taking a firm stand on an issue that has become a stain on his party’s reputation. It stands in contrast to Boris Johnson’s failure to dismiss Dominic Cummings or Robert Jenrick. Unlike Mr Starmer, the PM has been exposed as weak and unprincipled."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/06/8jstwinter2_4065841.jpg ","title":"an inspiration to everyone tributes to the late dundee dance teacher doreen winter","story":"A Dundee dance teacher who taught generations of city youngsters over more than six decades has died only weeks after being diagnosed with a terminal illness.Dozens of tributes have been paid to Doreen Winter of Dundee#s Dorwin School of Dancing, who died last Friday, aged .Doreen, who would have been  on July , taught dancing in Dundee for  years and was teaching up until  a week before lockdown.Her daughter, Linda, travelled from her home in Perth, Australia, five weeks ago to be with her mum and said she would be very sorely missed.#This is the end of an era.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

single dose, astudy in pigs has revealed.The ChAdOx nCoV-vaccine -developed by the University of Oxford - is currently undergoing human trials and it is hoped an effective vaccine could be ready later this year.Previous research indicated that macaques were protected against lung disease after a single immunisation.Now the Pirbright Institute, working with the University of Oxford, has shown that two doses of the Covid- vaccine might produce a greater immune response in pigs and therefore be a more effective approach to developing a protective response.What did the study find In the study, researchers saw a marked increase in neutralising antibodies, which bind to the virus in a way that blocks infection.It is not yet known what level of immune response will be required to protect humans against SARS-CoV- .Researchers said the finding in pigs is important as it suggests that two doses of the new vaccine could potentially give signicantly more protection in humans than a single dose.But they said further research in humans is required.What has Professor Bryan Charleston said Professor Bryan Charleston, director of the Pirbright Institute, said: ldquoThese results look encouraging that administering two injections with the same vaccine boosts antibody responses that can neutralise the virus, but it is the response in humans that is important.ldquoThe pig has proved to be a valuable model for testing human vaccines for other diseases to give an indication of the type of immune response induced and testing dferent doses.ldquoPigs are more physiologically similar to humans than some other animal models ndash for example, their body weight and metabolic rate ndash and are more accessible than studies using non-human primates.In the research, the pigs were split into two groups, with both receiving an initial dose of the vaccine, and one group receiving an identical booster immunisation on day  of the study.Latest developments are very encouragingProfessor Simon Graham, the lead author of the study, said: ldquoWhile it remains to be determined what immune responses are required to effectively protect people against Covid-, the demonstration that ChAdOx nCoV- induces both neutralising antibody and T cell responses is very encouraging.ldquoIt is likely that a combination of these responses would act in synergy to prevent and control infection, as we and others have recently shown in the context of experimental flu vaccines.What has the reaction been to this update Dr Stephen Grfin, associate professor in the school of medicine, University of Leeds, added: ldquoThe work done at Pirbright is an encouraging advance in support of the Oxford vaccine on three important fronts.,params: .pushldquoFirst, it has been conducted in a large animal model, namely pigs, which we know recapitulate human-like responses to influenza vaccines better than many other systems.ldquoSecond, it shows that a second dose of the vaccine, a so-called lsquoprime-boostrsquo strategy, gives rise to far better responses than a single inoculation, which might allay concerns arising from some of the earlier work on this and other spike-targeting vaccines.ldquoThird, it shows that the prime-boost strategy may well be achievable using the same vaccine rather than having to switch to an alternative  for the second dose, which could conceivably delay roll-out of the vaccination programme.ldquoWhilst these studies will need to be repeated within human subjects, and the precise nature and longevity of the responses might require further investigation, this is a heartening study that can be built upon and ideally followed by other potential vaccine s for

Itrsquos only such a huge part of my le because of other people.ldquoItrsquos instinctive for people to turn around and look, but it doesnrsquot take away from the fact that it makes me feel uncomfortable and embarrassed over something that I cannot control.It was not only the tics that made Jack stand out from the crowd during childhood.As a gay teenager, he says he struggled to make any male friends because of his sexuality, which he has never hidden.And the struggles, although manesting in dferent forms, have continued into young adult le.As a result of years of relentless twitching and involuntary leg movements, Jack is battling chronic muscle pain and nausea.Cognitive behaviour therapy reiki reflexology ndash Jack has tried everything to relieve the pain but to little avail.He is prescribed strong painkillers, and at times has had to keep his neck in a brace because of his tics.When attempting to enter bars or nightclubs, bouncers sometimes reject him because they believe he is under the influence of illegal drugs.Alcohol consumption can trigger his tics, making them more prominent and frequent.Even in university lectures, he sometimes must call out people for continually turning around and staring at him, despite knowing his condition.Jack insists that suffering from Tourette syndrome has given him a ldquothick skin\".He has always felt fully supported by his parents but has chosen to be independent from a young age, refusing to let his condition prevent him from doing the things he wants to achieve.Attending doctors appointments on his own from the age of , Jack preferred to handle everything by himself.In his third year at Peebles High School, Jack ran a public campaign and was successfully elected as a Member of the Scottish Youth Parliamentfor the region.He said: ldquoI ran because Irsquove always been interested in social issues and wanted to meet like-minded people, which I sometimes felt starved of growing up.ldquoI think I would be a really confident, extroverted guy without my tics ndash they are the one thing holding me back.Since his darkest days battling anxiety and depression, Jack has made friends, had part-time jobs in bars in Peebles and Edinburgh, and a recently ex-long-term boyfriend.Mental health struggles may have stolen parts of Jacks childhood ndash and he continues to live in the spotlight of Tourettersquos ndash but it hasnrsquot stopped him embracing student le."},{"url":null,"title":"bournemouth-major-incident-thousands-pack-beaches-south-coast","story":"A MAJORincident has been declared after thousands of people flocked to the beach in southern England.The sun-seekers - defying official advice -descended onBournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council beaches on the hottest day of the year so far.A multi-agency emergency response has now been activated to co-ordinate resources across the area.Council leader Vikki Slade said: ldquoWe are absolutely appalled at the scenes witnessed on our beaches, particularly at Bournemouth and Sandbanks, in the last - hours.\"The irresponsible behaviour and actions of so many people is just shocking and our services are stretched to the absolute hilt trying to keep everyone safe.\"We have had no choice now but to declare a major incident and initiate an emergency response.Services were left completely overstretched as visitors arrived in large volumes resulting in widespread problems of illegal parking, excessive waste, anti-social behaviour, gridlock on roads and prohibited overnight camping.BCP Council issued  parking enforcement fines ndash the highest on record ndash and responded to many reports of cars parking and causing an obstruction.Roads in and out of the area were heavily congested into the early hours.Crews received widespread abuse and intimidation as they attempted to empty overflowing bins on the seafront.

we knew that losing your sense of smellwas a signicant symptom of the disease.Now, after months of reports, both anecdotal and more rigorous clinical findings, we think we have a model for how this virus may cause smell loss.One of the most common causes of smell loss is a viral infection, such as the common cold, sinus or other upper respiratory tract infections.Those coronaviruses that donrsquot cause deadly diseases, such as COVID-, Sars and Mers, are one of the causes of the common cold and have been known to cause smell loss.In most of these cases, sense of smell s when symptoms clear, as smell loss is simply the result of a blocked nose, which prevents aroma molecules reaching olfactory receptors in the nose. In some cases, smell loss can persist for months and years.For the novel coronavirus , however, the pattern of smell loss is dferent. Many people with COVID- reported a sudden loss of sense of smell and then a sudden and fullto a normal sense of smell in a week or two.Interestingly, many of these people said their nose was clear, so smell loss cannot be attributed to a blocked nose.For others, smell loss was prolonged and several weeks later they still had no sense of smell. Any theory of anosmia in COVID- has to account for both of these patterns.This suddenof a normal sense of smell suggests an obstructive smell loss in which the aroma molecules cannot reach the receptors in the nose .Now that we have CT scans of the noses and sinuses of people with COVID- smell loss, we can see that the part of the nose that does the smelling, the olfactory cleft, is blocked with swollen soft tissue and mucus ndash known as a cleft syndrome.The rest of the nose and sinuses look normal and patients have no problem breathing through their nose.We know that the way SARS-CoV- infects the body is by attaching to ACE receptors on the surface of cells that line the upper respiratory tract.A protein called TMPRSS then helps the virus invade the cell. Once inside the cell, the virus can replicate, triggering the immune systemrsquos inflammatory response. This is the starting point for the havoc and destruction that this virus causes once in the body.Initially, we thought that the virus might be infecting and destroying the olfactory neurons.These are the cells that transmit the signal from the aroma molecule in your nose to the area in the brain where these signals get interpreted as ldquosmell.However, an international collaboration showed recently that the ACE proteins the virus needs to invade the cells were not found on the olfactory neurons.But they were found on cells called ldquosustentacular cells, which support the olfactory neurons.We expect that these support cells are likely to be the ones that are damaged by the virus, and the immune response would cause swelling of the area but leave the olfactory neurons intact.When the immune system has dealt with the virus, the swelling subsides and the aroma molecules have a clear route to their undamaged receptors and the sense of smell s to normal.So why does smell notin some cases This is more theoretical but follows from what we know about inflammation in other systems.Inflammation is the bodyrsquos response to damage and results in the release of chemicals that destroy the tissues involved.When this inflammation is severe, other nearby cells start to be damaged or destroyed by this ldquosplash damage. We believe that accounts for the second stage, where the olfactory neurons are damaged.Recovery of smell is much slower because the olfactory neurons need time to regenerate from the supply of stem cells within the lining of the nose.Initial recovery is often associated with distortion of the sense of smell known as parosmia, where things donrsquot smell like they used to.For many parosmics, for instance, the smell of coffee is often described as burnt, chemical, dirty and reminiscent of sewage.Physiotherapy for the noseOlfaction has been called the Cinderella of the senses because of its neglect by scientic research.But it has come to the forefront in this pandemic.

ldquoOne of the main problems in this case is one of supply.ldquoThe substance can feel quite easy to get hold of, but this is absolutely no indicator that it is safe.ldquoIt is extremely dangerous,

This involves welfare, becoming a statistic for the first time, trusting and hoping the place of last resort, that of social security, will be there in the hour of need.Applying for welfare is a very daunting experience and for many it is alien, because for most who join the workforce, there is no need to familiarise oneself with the ins and outs of the welfare system, that is for others. So this will be a whole new chapter and one that will be daunting.The current system of welfare involves applying for Universal Credit and your article highlighting the research by Bath and Oxford Universitiescertainly exposed the downfalls of this system. It pointed to an unfair and thoughtless system of payments, and ndash confirming what opposition MPrsquos have been telling the Government for years ndash the view that Universal Credit should be reviewed, even replaced, with immediate effect. Perhaps two million new applications for Universal Credit, consequences of Covid-, will once and for all expose the shortfalls of this system to a Government at Westminster who must tackle this sector of the economy going forward.Catriona C Clark, Falkirk."},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Rosemary Goring  I look like a Holby City cast member in my mask","story":"Normally I pick up litter.

Artists are doubtless already photographing bandit-style objects dangling from trees or trapped in drains, compiling a photo-montage of Covid detritus, to look back on in years to come.Now that face coverings are obligatory on public transport, and recommended in smaller shops and confined spaces, the day is coming when most of us will carry some form of protective gear in our pocket. This is meant to make us, and others, safer, yet the sight of bus passengers earlier this week, hidden from chin to eye, was anything but reassuring. It reminded me of cattle trucks, where all you can see between the slats are the animalsrsquo eyes, rolling in fear as they head for the abattoir.Some of my friends have been covering up for months others would rather head for the hills and ride out the storm like outlaws than comply. But like it or not, I suspect this latest accessory will be with us for the foreseeable future. The days when we used to stare in bemusement at Oriental tourists wearing what looked like BQ dust protectors are long gone. In some places, especially cities, it seems face coverings are already de rigueur, so much so that fashion houses are producing their own lines, to complement their designer range. This could either be seen as a definition of sad, or defiantly le-affirming.How did it come to this  In a text exchange with a friend, we were comparing styles, and recommending ones we liked, when a shudder went through both of us.

Will there be a member of transport police on every service or at every station, or a rapid response squad within hailing distance What about those who suffer from asthma or other respiratory complaints that mean they cannot trap their noses and mouths  Confronting public anger or filthy stares as they appear to flout the rules will be bad enough but how do they convince officials that their condition is genuine  The mere prospect of having to prove their credentials, or to run a gauntlet of jibes and stares, will deter many from even attempting to hop on public transport.Of course we will eventually get used to swaddling ourselves, just as wersquore now programmed to reach for soap after every foray beyond the front door, and to keep a cowrsquos distance from neighbours. Yet the potential hazards of facial wraps are fiercely debated. The main concern is that people will feel a  sense of security behind their personal protective barrier and neglect to wash their hands. Nor, Irsquove read, is cloth very effective at preventing the passage of small contagious droplets. When you add to this the likelihood that the discomfort of prolonged use leads to constant tweaking and touching, it seems their health benefits might be less assured than wersquove been encouraged to believe.All of this suggests the psychological signicance might be as important as the medical purpose. Seeing a sea of veiled faces around you reinforces the message of pervasive threat. Visors, in whatever shape, are a visible reminder that each and every one of us presents a potential risk to others. They are symbols of our collective duty to be seen to be taking precautions by wearing them, we signal willingness to help lower anxiety and alarm, and to play our part in the communal effort to defeat this disease.Will we ever feel relaxed under these circumstances  I can cope with the prospect of covering up while heading off on holiday but once at my destination, how easygoing will a cafe or gallery, beach or bar feel when you can only see waitersrsquo and bartendersrsquo eyes, and art lovers or bookshop browsers look like the cast in Holby City  Holidays are about escaping the everyday, and switching off.

If you were looking for an archetypal hard-bitten tabloid hack who embodied the highs and lows of the trade, then Iain Calder was your man.The former Daily Record reporter was something of a star in Scandalous! The Tabloid that Changed America, a look at the rise and plummet of the National Enquirer. Cynical, sharp, bursting with stories ndash had you requested him from central casting you would have sent him back for being too much of a cliche.But that was the Enquirer, according to this superb Storyville documentary: always too much for its own good.Mark Landsmanrsquos -minute film swung between two attitudes to the paper and what it had brought to journalism.The first, typied by Carl Bernstein, was censorious. The Enquirer should be looked at in the realm of popular culture rather than journalism, snfed the Watergate warrior by way of an introduction.But then the story of its origins and early operations began and the film was off to the races, half awed by the tale and more than a little amused.Bought in the s with mob money , the title was owned outright by Generoso Pope Junior, the son of an Italian newspaperman. Legend has it that ldquoGene was driving along a highway when he saw people rubbernecking an accident. The Enquirer had found the first of its specialisms: gore porn. Circulation went up to one million but Pope wanted  million. To do that the paper had to go where readers went, into the supermarkets. Out went the gore and in came celebrity news, gossip, dogs, medical oddities, psychics, UFOs and general wackadoodle doo. Stories were to be ldquoexploded, sensationalised, and for that Pope needed the best, some might say worst, in the business: Fleet and McFleet Streetrsquos finest.Calder led the exodus. By age  he had worked on the Falkirk Sentinel, the Stirling Journal, Falkirk Mail, and the Daily Record . Unable to find the skills and attitude he wanted among the American media, Calder recruited from home. It was a second colonisation of America, and the locals reacted about as well as they did the last time the Brits came.The main change ushered in by the Enquirer was that it paid for information. From this, the film argued, the rot set in. Irsquom not sure American journalism was always that holier than thou hitherto, but the Enquirer certainly encouraged others to follow its methods and madness. Why  Because it was phenomenally successful. The edition with a photo of Elvis in his coffin sold seven million.Some scandals were filed away, as when a female reporter found out about Bill Cosbyrsquos many infidelities. Calder spiked the story to get softer interviews from the star. ldquoI was making trades that would make our readers happier, said Calder today.For a time, where the Enquirer led the mainstream media followed, particularly on OJ Simpson.But when it got it wrong it got it dreadfully wrong, as when the paper ran a picture of Dianathe day before the Princess died in Paris. From there it was a quick slide into further infamy. And then The Donald showed up. The paper, under new ownership, began to ldquocatch and kill stories, a lot of them unfavourable to candidate Trump as he became. The cover up, says Bernstein, was the ldquoultimate corruption.Terric use of archive, a dream cast of talking heads, and a solid, clear narrative made Scandalous this weekrsquos must see documentary.The Enquirer would not touch The Great British Sewing Bee with a metre stick. The reality show, which reached its final last night, has been far too nice to attract tabloid attention. Why, these contestants even helped each other outthere was a problem.While it was short on anything approaching real drama, the GBSB had enough going for it in genial host Joe Lycett, a worthy winner in s enthusiast Dr Clare, and judges, Esme Young and Patrick Grant, who knew their stuff. I particularly enjoyed Young reminiscing about sitting on a window ledge with Bowie watching the Notting Hill carnival go by.

Itrsquos a master class in political cynicism. So forgive meIrsquom cynical in .Many parents were angry that their children werenrsquot going to get the education they need. Home learning has been disastrous with some teachers reporting only a handful of children turning up for online lessons. Many other parents worried schools might not be safe enough for .Teachers busied themselves getting their classrooms ready for social distancing. Head teachers devised complicated timetables which would see groups of children in school on alternate days or weeks, or dfering times of the day.However, the SNP came under pressure over this worrisome and confusing policy. Angry parents and opposition MSPs made le dficult for Nicola Sturgeonrsquos government. As a result, on Tuesday, the policy changed.Now the plan is for schools to reopen full-time in August without social distancing. Why  Whatrsquos changed  Apparently, according to Swinney, when it comes to the pandemic, ldquothe picture looks more positive.Forgive me,I donrsquot believe this. Only a fool would think that this country ndash along with many other nations which have handled coronavirus much more successfully ndash isnrsquot heading for a second wave. Surgeons, nurses and GPs all fear a second wave.Countries which have eased lockdown are experiencing spikes and clusters. France recorded  new cases of coronavirus in  hours and is investigating five new clusters, bringing the total number of clusters in the country to . The country eased out of lockdown, opening bars and restaurants from early June but continues to see hundreds of new daily cases.Italy has recorded  new cases of coronavirus. Therersquos been clusters reported in Spain and Germany that have led to new restrictions being imposed. China fears a second wave.Scotland has handled the pandemic little better than the UK. Therersquos been more than  deaths here. In the UK, therersquos been more than ,. Scotland has roughly a tenth of the UKrsquos population. The figures speak for themselves.How is this a ldquopositive picture as Swinney claims  Understandably, parents are even more worried now. Before, it seemed that it was just their childrenrsquos education which would suffer. Now, parents worry about ato school without social distancing measures. Theyrsquore also more confused than ever. Swinneyrsquos announcement clashes with much of the information theyrsquore receiving from schools about their childrenrsquos education.Teachers are also worried. Theyrsquore genuinely scared. Theyrsquore being asked to go into their classrooms unsuregovernment guidance is sufficient to protect them. Nobody should be expected to go to work fearful. Teachers also feel used. They worked hard to put the \"blended\" model in place ndash now thatrsquos gone. So, itrsquos little wonder that teachers are angry with the SNP.The SNPrsquos dithering, confused messaging on education appears simply cruel when it comes to teachers, parents and children.But the most repellent aspect of the whole fiasco is the crowing and gloating and politicking by our MSPs and their party apparatchiks. Once Swinney switched from the blended model to a straightforwardto school, opposition MSPs were up on their hind legs bragging about a \"u-turn\". They had won. The SNP had been humiliated.The SNP, of course, said it wasnrsquot a u-turn. The blended model remained as a contingency planthe infection worsened. There were caveats, the nationalists said, so therersquod been no volte faceHerersquos the truth: it was a u-turn ndash but nobody cares. The SNP did cave in to pressure from parents and opposition parties, and wersquoll all have to wait and seethat capitulation was safe and sensible. To claim this isnrsquot a u-turn is to reinvent the concept of geometry, and political language.However, outside the incestuous bubble of Holyrood no-one gives a damn. Parents care about their children. Teachers care about their safety and their pupils. Who would spare even a thought to the pride and ego of the political class And this is what sickens most of all. Our politicians think that moving the debate from the future of our childrenrsquos education to the issue of whether they got a political win out of this or not is acceptable. It shows how deeply these people are out of touch with the rest of us.Party politics in inimical to the interests of the people. Political parties take a position, their rivals take the opposite position, and they dig in. It doesnrsquot matter whatrsquos good for us. Like generals in the First World War, they draw their lines and the casualties are the little people, the rank and file.The only issue that matters is that our children get a good education, that parents feel their children are safe and prospering, and that teachers feel protected at work. Thatrsquos all we should care about. Politics should be inconsequential.Parents, teachers and, most of all, children are being failed by our political class. But then the only lesson to be learned from this entire fiasco is that Scottish politics itself is a failure.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

He grew up in Yorkshire and signed for Hull when he was . He might then have stayed on at Hull and had a great career there, but he left, and played in America, then came to Scotland where Kilmarnock wanted him, then went off to Canada and lots of other places and none of it ever felt very comfortable for him and a big part of the reason for that was his sexuality.But now, this week, Thomas has gone public, making him only the second male professional footballer in the UK to reveal hersquos gay. Without doubt, itrsquos an important step for sport and for LGBT equality, but because Thomas retired in , it doesnrsquot actually change the fact that there still isnrsquot a single out gay man playing in the professional game in Britain. There was Justin Fashanu in the s, but thatrsquos it.The fact Thomas has waited until now to talk openly is understandable: when, who, andgay people reveal their sexuality is up to them, but the problem is that the football industry was, and is, unwelcoming for gay men. Watfordrsquos captain Troy Deeney said the other day that every football team is likely to have a gay player. The fact that not a single one of them is public tells you everything you need to know.The problem boils down to three parts: players, management, and the fans, and the pressure they are exerting, possibly unconsciously, on players to stay silent. Right across the game, people are making assumptions about what football is and what masculinity is and how the two interact and gay men are picking it up from a very early age.Take the players first. Thomas Beattie says that when he signed as a youth professional with Hull, the senior players took him to a strip club as an initiation. The other players assumed Thomas would enjoy a strip club they had assumed he was heterosexual. He also says he heard gay slurs in the changing room, although he doesnrsquot think the players were being malicious ndash they were saying it because they assumed there was no one in the room to be hurt or offended.Management is also a problem. Thomas says therersquos still an assumption that a gay player would disrupt the team, in the same way that the British Army used to assume a gay soldier would lead to the army losing wars because it was too gay. Thomas also believes that, because society generally is getting better, managers assume homophobia isnrsquot an issue in football either and therefore do nothing.Then therersquos the fans. Can we be confident thatThomas had stayed on at Kilmarnock or Hull or any other team and had come out as gay that he wouldnrsquot have faced abuse from the fans  Thomas says he felt like society was telling him the world of being gay and being a footballer were enemies andyoursquore a football fan, it might be worth asking yourself what assumptions you make. Have you ever thought, for example, thata man is gay he probably canrsquot kick a ball All of these assumptions played their part in making Thomas unhappy and, although they donrsquot necessarily translate into outright abuse, they do the job just as well. You canrsquot be gay and a footballer. Being gay will be bad for the team. Yoursquore a footballer therefore you love the ladies.The solution is for everyone in the game to check their assumptions. Thomas puts it this way: be conscious of the environment yoursquore creating and whether it lets everyone feel included. When a new player joins the team, do not assume theyrsquore straight. Maybe a few players will be offended by this, but gay players will feel more welcome and more able in the long run to go public.Everyone should also listen to what Thomas Beattie says about the longer term consequences of football failing to change. ldquoDo not fear the day where a gay athlete is wearing the badge on your shirt, he says. ldquoFear the prolonged period of time when there isnt. In other words, football could be missing out on great players, but even worse than that: as society and other sports progress, football is going to look more out-of-date on the issue of sexuality and ndash letrsquos just say it ndash homophobic.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

We want children back in school full-time in August.ldquoBut everybody recognises that has to be done in a way that is safe.

When the survey was carried out in , the figure was %.According to NRS figures there are now , humanist marriages, compared with , Christian marriages and , marriages of other religions.There were also , civil ceremonies conducted by registrars in .Humanist Society Scotland chief executive Fraser Sutherland said: \"These new official statistics show again how humanist ceremonies have become a mainstay of Scottish public le. The new figures also show that Humanist Society Scotland celebrants have solemnised the biggest percentage share of total weddings we have ever had - showing that more couples are opting for a meaningful humanist ceremony than ever before.\"This is a reflection of the trend we have seen in Scotland where - particularly since the mid th century - each generation has become less religiously observant than their parents.\"There are a huge iety of reasons behind this but improved scientic literacy in schools and a reduction in parents bringing children up in a faith are two major factors.\"Indeed I would say the parenting one is the biggest factor as the majority, though not all, of people begin to form their religious beliefs in childhood. This is backed up by research such as the social attitudes survey which show over half the population now consider themselves non-religious with younger age groups most likely to have no religion.\":Coronavirus: Nicola Sturgeon denies school restart plans are half-bakedHumanist and all other atheist agnostic unions, are not legally recognised in England and Wales ndash unlike in Scotland or Northern Ireland.But its has not stopped increasing numbers of couples from opting for humanist marriage ceremonies south of the border.Such weddings are estimated to have risen by more than  per cent in the last  years.And Mr Sutherland said the figures put more pressure on the UK Government to relent and legally recognise humanist marriages in England and Wales.\"The claims there is no demand for such ceremonies are blown out of the water by these new Scottish figures,\" he said.The HSS campaigned for years for an amendment to the MarriageAct  to allow legal humanist wedding ceremonies but in the end it was a decision by the Registrar General for Scotland that allowed the change.He made the decision after considering Article  of the European Convention on Human Rights on \"freedom of thought, conscience and religion\", which includes non-religious belief.A spokesman for the Church of Scotland said: ldquoChurch of Scotland weddings are deeply personal and as unique as the couples being married.ldquoMinisters are called to a community precisely so that they may get to know and live within their local context.ldquoThat means that over time they develop deep relationships with local people who often come to their minister because of friendships than can span generations.ldquoThe minister, who does not personally charge a fee for their service, draws on the strength of those friendships to create with the couple a unique experience tailored just to them and this can include music, format, style, vows and venue amongst other things.ldquoThe Christian God is a God of love who delights in people and a Church of Scotland wedding is an opportunity for a couple to pledge their love before God, among the circle of friends and family who will support their union throughout their lives.ldquoWe would encourage anyone considering marriage to visit their local church and speak with someone about the many options available to them to mark their very special day."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11522217.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scotland-records-hottest-day-year-temperatures-sore-30-c","story":"The mercury rose to above C in Prestwick, recordinga new record for June of .C.

Ma Stewart, being of a certain age, had to stay at home and avoid the grocery store so Ive been doing her shopping every week since the lockdown. In the run up to Easter, little extras appeared on the shopping list, such as yellow food colouring or baking powder.Id almost entire forgotten I was due a birthday until, about three weeks before, icing sugar was suddenly requested. Each ingredient meant for a celebration cake, buried in the list weeks in advance.Back in March, as it became clear that something momentous was afoot, items began disappearing from supermarket shelves. Among the many things seared in the national memory from this extraordinary time will be the Great Loo Roll Rush of .Tinned items soon followed. Beans, soup, canned tuna - good luck to you. Soap, hand sanitiser, bleach. Practical items for people planning to be stuck at home with mouths to feed and germs to kill.If the whole toilet paper panic was inexplicable, what came next was logical but still a bit of a surprise. Where was all the flour The supermarkets had none, and when they did get some in stock there was a frantic rush on it. People were sharing tips in community Facebook pages about where had a supply in stock and offering to trade it, like a finely milled currency.Ditto yeast. Photographs of sachets of yeast appeared on these social media pages too, offers to post it out at inflated prices or do contactless handovers in odd places in exchange for a bag of self-raising.Twitter became one long thread of sourdough starter discussions. How to get them going, how to keep them going, how to move on when the frothing stopped and the starter ended.There were people giving names to their starters , posting photos of them on social media, even creating Instragram accounts solely for their off-white pots of yeast.Even simple homebaking has an air of performance in the age of social media but then, people are bored at home and a few tweets is as decent a use of time as anything .As bulk buyers left the baking aisle bare, millers were working around the clock, genuinely milling flour  hours a day, seven days a week, to keep up with demand. Usually, two million bags of flour are produced every week but during lockdown this doubled to four million.Interestingly, it wasnt the lack of flour that was the problem: it was the lack of packaging. There werent enough small bags to keep up with demand and not enough capacity to pack them.In my local supermarket things came to such a pass that, not only were the flour shelves bare, the shop eventually removed the shelves too so there was an empty cavity where they had previously been.Perhaps this was to quash quickly any rising anticipation that maybe some flour existed tucked away at the back.As the baking trend continued to rise, supermarkets innovated. Some sold kg bags of flour and, incredibly, people bought them. Other stores decanted the kg sacks into smaller brown paper bags and let shoppers have them for p or so.Of course, local corner stores had flour all along, as well as all the other staples wed been scrambling to grab in the big stores. A friend would come to my local shop for his flour and leave with several bags of self-raising only after standing through a lecture in Middle Eastern politics from the chatty shopkeeper.Lockdown has meant an increase in time and an increase in time has meant the ability to use local shops, a trend we should hope continues.But the baking thing. What was it about  Time, again. Our lives are built now around work. Where my grandmothers generation of women would routinely be at home with the children, and where baking was an everyday staple, our economic model now depends on both parents working and those kitchen skills have slid away.Baking bread or cakes, once a chore to work through, has become a romanticised task - all about self-care and mindfulness, as much as the basic need for sustenance. Keeping a sourdough starter alive takes work and commitment, regular feeding. AndInstragram is to be believed, regular conversations with your frothing paste.A sourdough loaf must be done in strict, timed stages, giving shape to the day. Eventhats all you do from morning til night, those otherwise wayward hours are structured.Baking bread takes mental and physical focus, kneading, folding, a patient wait for rise. Folding again. The smell of baking bread as the chemistry of heat does its thing, an edible science experiment. You are in control of transforming a selection of basic ingredients into something wonderful, something solid when all  is shting and unpredictable.I have always enjoyed baking. It is a small act of love to create something delicious for someone  and, while I do resist the notion of self-care, being a grizzled old cynic, its satisfying to bake yourself a treat.This has been quite a boon of lockdown easing - friends keep showing up with home baking. Early on there were brownies left on my doorstep. Ma Stewart has made me beautul cakes with her carefully squirrelled away ingredients. My friend Dan dropped me off a picnic for my birthday with two fresh baguettes hed made, another lockdown baking convert.Another birthday gt was an extraordinary ice cream cake, three flavours wrapped in a giant chocolate chip brownie casing. Ive been gted several fresh loaves from neighbours who overestimated what they needed.To bake and be baked for are both basic and exalted things at once. Before, it was a question of fitting baking into our busy lives. Now we structure days around baking. As le s to normal, hopefully people will keep up their new-found old ways.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

A storm in  showed something strange in the sand at the Bay of Skaill and the Laird, William Graham Watt, went on to excavate part of a , year old village. After reading the original reports, I now know that this isn’t true. The real story is more interesting.The Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, has three papers on Skara Brae. The first was by Samuel Laing, who visited the site in autumn .“Two chambers have been completely excavated, together with the passage and parts of the entrances to other chambers by Mr William Watt, a relative of William Watt, Esq of Breckness, residing at Skaill, to whose zeal the scientic world is indebted for the discovery and exhumation of this interesting relic of antiquity.#When I saw the credit being given to a relative of William Watt Esq, rather than the man himself, I remembered my father, Peter Leith, telling me that his father, also Peter, had told him that a dferent William Watt, known as Black Willie, had been the man responsible.In the  Census, I found the Laird living at Skaill, aged , with a son William, aged . His son and heir, William WG Watt was  and living at Kierfiold, so there were two sons called William.In James Irvine’s  book, ‘The Breckness Estate’, I read that William G Watt had a natural son, William, who in  was given £ a year and free board, “so long as he chose to remain a clerk in the house.”The story then turned into a neat circle. I followed up a reference in the book and found it was an Orkney Herald article written by my grandfather. It was about Hugh Miller’s book ‘Rambles of a Geologist’, in which Miller recorded his visit to Orkney in .My grandfather had written: “Another interesting person, who has already been mentioned, was William Watt of Skaill. This was not, as some readers may suppose, the laird of Skaill, but a distant relative who made his home there. He was well-known to everybody as “Black Willie” from his dark hair and complexion. Like Miller, he was a self-taught geologist, he always carried a little bag with a hammer and chisel to dig out any fossils he came across. He brought some of his more interesting specimens for Hugh Miller’s inspection and they had an interesting discussion. When Skarabrae was first dug into in the ’s, it is certain that Black Willie took an active part in the work and saw to it that anything found was safely preserved.”I looked up the references to William Watt in the book and found that Hugh Miller had come with a letter of introduction to him and described him both as an intelligent geologist and an intelligent palaeontologist. He showed Watt, along with Dr Garson of Stromness, where his famous discovery, the Astrolepsis fossil, lay.To read about the second and third papers on Skara Brae and what Patricia found out, see page  of this week#s edition of The Orcadian.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a strong interest in social history.

Transport operators continue to play a key role in supporting essential travel and in ensuring passenger confidence in public transport while maintaining physical distancing. The use of face coverings forms a fundamental part of gaining that public trust.“We are asking people to take personal responsibility to do the right thing. Wearing a face covering while on public transport means you are playing your part in the collective effort to prevent the spread of coronavirus and reducing the risk to your fellow citizens.”In line with this, the council is asking people to provide their own face coverings when travelling by ferry, bus, plan, taxi or private hire cars. People who are not able to wear a face covering for specic medical reasons will be exempt, as will children under five.Orkney Ferries timetables are currently being revised in consultation with Community Councils in the North and South Isles. It is hoped that an enhanced service can be provided after Monday, June .Further information about this will be provided next week.In the meantime, the Council is asking public transport users to please be patient and consider others needs when planning future travel – and thanking people for their help and co-operation with this.Advice on face coverings, including how to make one and instructions for using one, will be available on the Transport Scotland website. This advice is being updated to include full details of the applicable exemptions.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Caravans and self-contained accommodation which does not share services to be permitted, with caution to respect rural communities and the islands.July  — Outdoor restaurant and dining services and beer gardens to open.July  — Extension likely to be made to socialising with other households. Further details to follow in coming days.July  — Outdoor sports to resume and shopping centres to reopen.July  —  Meeting  indoors with up to two other households to be allowed, with physical distancing and attention to hygiene indoor learning and childcare service to resumeholiday accommodation, museums, galleries, monuments, cinemas and libraries to reopen . This will NOT include theatres, bingo halls and casinos.Pubs and restaurants will also be able to reopen indoors, on limited basis. But before you head for a drink, you#ll be able to get that much-needed chop at the hairdressers or barbers.Ms Sturgeon explained that other Phase Three plans, such as communal gatherings including weddings and funerals, will require further consideration. Changes to guidance around this is unlikely to take effect before July .The First Minister also confirmed Scotland#s aim to move away from blanket guidance for all shielding people, with hopes instead of more tailored advice.She said: #Our challenge, which is not an easy one, is to manage all of this change while keeping this virus firmly under control.#If, at any stage, there appears to be a resurgence, our path out of lockdown will be halted — and we may need to go backwards.#To avoid that, we must get as close as possible to elimination of the virus now.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is important that we face our fears and do not avoid them.“The enjoyment we might get from moving more freely outside, travelling and meeting friends and family is tempered when we are worried about the spread of infection. By sticking to the rules during the gradual lting of restrictions, we can be confident that risk won’t rise. Less virus around us can be matched with less restriction.“Although there are practical things we can do to help ourselves cope over the coming weeks, remember that help is availableneeded.  We’ve never had to deal with a situation like this before, so be kind to yourself and to others, and reach outyou need to talk to someone.  Support is there.”For practical tips, you can visit clearyourhead.scot.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Lets hope I am proved wrong for the greater good of everybody  The way that poll is set up will skew the result in favour of the wind farm.WIth respect, a #gas-fired power station# on its own is not a possible option since a substantial amount of renewable energy is already installed and it won#t be going away, any time soon. Renewable energy, of course, must have a grid link and a fully-specied standbyplant to cover cable failures. Having two options involving a gas-fired power station obviously splits the vote for that option.Firstly:I am really confused about what this poll is supposed to achieve at this stage in the process and why,it#s important, the Shetland Times didn#t hold it  years ago.It seems that the Shetland public have already voted to reject the Shetland Times# wording of this question so I think it#s time to withdraw the poll and re-launch a new one.Might I suggest that the ST editors consult John Tulloch and an equally well qualied renewables engineer over the wording of the new question so that the public can vote on TWO clear options that are technically feasible, otherwise, it is a wasted exercise.

pupils, including ensuring every current probationer teacher who meets the standard for full registration having a teaching post for the year ahead.Education Scotland has also agreed to work with

While NIE Networks staff will still not be entering customers’ homes to obtain a meter read at this time, they will call at customers’ doors and ask them to read their meter while they wait. Meter readers will be able to take readings from meters located in outside positions as normal.NIE Networks is urging customers to protect its meter readers and themselves by continuing to observe social distancing protocols. Ben Cupples, Meter Reading Manager at NIE Networks, explained the importance of recording a precise meter reading for the customer.“Providing a precise meter reading will ensure that your electricity bills accurately reflect your consumption,” he said. “Our meter readers will call to your home and will record the reading you provide while we wait.“If you are unable to read your meter for any reason oryou are not at home when we call, we will leave a card with information on how to submit your meter reading online via the NIE Networks website, via email or over the phone.”Mr Cupples explained that while meter reading activity would resume it would only be carried out with the health and safety of the public and meter readers in mind.“The safety of our employees and customers is our utmost priority. “If you see our meter readers out and about, we would ask that you please help them by standing at least two metres away. Likewise, we will stand at least two metres from customers’ doors at all times.“We are continually reviewing how we undertake our meter reading activities in light of COVID- and we are looking forward to being able to resume our normal way of working with customers at some stage, but we will only make that decision when it’s safe to do so.” NIE Networks is reminding customers that you only need to submit your reading to either NIE Networks or your supplier – there is no need to do it twice. Customers unable to submit a meter reading will receive an estimated bill from their supplier based on their usage history.If a member of the NIE Networks team arrives at the door, they will always show identication.

Victor Leonard, chairman of the international youth football competition at which Rashford was twice a winner with Manchester United, has always been impressed with the manner in which the young England international striker has handled himself. As Rashford vowed to continue helping those in need after successfully forcing the government to reverse its decision not to provide free school meal vouchers during the summer, Mr. Leonard described the footballer as an inspiration to everyone. He added: “We first came across Marcus in the Manchester United squads that came across to Northern Ireland to compete in our tournaments. “He was a smash hit as United went on to win the Premier section in  and  but you could not help but admire the way, even at a young age, Marcus conducted himself. “We have been across to United many times and it was always very clear how highly regarded he was as a player and a person.” Rashford came off the bench in United’s  final victory over County Tyrone at Ballymena Showgrounds and started when the Red Devils triumphed  months later against defending champions Vendee from France. Victor added: “I think he is an inspiration to everyone. He has been so passionate about this issue but gone about attempting to bring change in a highly commendable manner. “He is a credit to his family and his club and we at STATSports SuperCupNI are privileged that he is one of our tournament graduates who has gone on to achieve greatness in his football career and also through his campaigning for something in which he believes so fervently. “Hopefully he will continue to be an inspiration to all of us.” Rashford has raised about poundm to supply around three million meals to vulnerable people while working with charity FareShare UK during the coronavirus lockdown. In an emotional open letter to MPs, Rashford drew on his own experience of relying on free school meals and food banks growing up. He said his story was all too familiar for families in England.

Photo by Kelvin Boyes  Press Eye.Claire McNeillyTwitterEmailJune   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailPrices in hairdressers, hotels, cafes and pubs are set to rise in post-lockdown Northern Ireland.Despite promises to keep them at pre-pandemic levels, key industry figures have warned customers of imminent hikes, to reflect increased costs and reduced capacity - and because they will struggle to offer deals across a range of services.Hairdressers said the price of a blow-dry, cut or colour was likely to rise by at least £ as salons offset extra costs.Belfast publican Willie Jack, owner of the famous Duke of York, the Harp Bar and The Dark Horse, said that punters can expect the price of a pint to rise to £, while Botanic Inns boss Stephen Magorrian warned that the cheapest wine on the menu could cost just under £ a bottle.Cafe owner Karen Grace, of Gwyn#s Cafe and Pavilion in Londonderry, said cafes may have to raise their prices to offset all the new health and safety costs.And while none of the hoteliers contacted by the Belfastadmitted there would be price hikes, Janice Gault from the Northern Ireland Hotel Federation indicated there are challenges ahead.There are additional costs for business: sanitation, new operational procedures and new equipment, she said.There are also issues around reduced capacity which brings into question the viability of some activities. Meanwhile, a number of income streams are effectively cut off as hotels are still unable to stage weddings and spas are restricted.Strict social distancing controls are likely to be reduced soon by the Executive from two metres to one, after Prime Minister Boris Johnston relaxed the rules in England earlier this week.It follows repeated calls from the hard hit hospitality, services and tourism sectors, as the roadmap to reopen the region gathers pace.Northern Ireland#s food-serving pubs, restaurants and hotels are gearing up to reopen on July , while hairdressers will have their scissors at the ready on July .Ken McClure, vice president of the Northern Ireland Hairdressers Association, said most salons would find price hikes unavoidable.Prices will have to go up by around £ per person to offset the additional costs we#ll incur to reopen safely, he told the Belfast .Owners will need to provide personal protection equipment , hand sanitisers, perspex screens and take other safety measures.Mr McClure, who owns Kenneth Michael International Hair and Beauty in east Belfast, said they would have to spread out appointments so that there will be fewer clients at any one time to comply with social distancing rules.There will be a very limited waiting area and we#ll be asking people to come alone, he added.We#ll also have to consider putting up extra pegs for clothes and wash gowns after every use.Colin Neil of Hospitality Ulster said it is hard to predict what effect increased costs and social distancing will have on pricing.He added: Pubs are looking at new business models and trying to work out how they break even.Mr Jack, a renowned publican, said the price of a pint will increase.I can see prices going up because of the cost of security required to keep numbers below a certain capacity, he said.The Duke of York and Harp Bar are both busy non-food, live music venues and I#ll have to operate at somewhere between % and % capacity.A pint might increase from £. to £. That#s also to avoid dealing with change. A glass of wine will probably stay the same price.Any publican who reopens will probably be losing money for the rest of the year.Mr Magorrian, whose bars include the hugely popular Northern Whig, said he was reviewing all prices both to reflect increased costs and for safety reasons.We need to move away from £. and £. and go to £. or £ to cut down on the level of change we#re carrying, he said.The cheapest bottle of wine in the Whig is £., whereas a glass is up by p to £. or £.He added: The major thing we#ll be doing is avoiding deals such as two courses for a set price mid-week, or kids eat free on a Sunday, or cocktail happy hour.Julie Hastings, marketing director at Hastings Hotels, whose portfolio includes The Europa and Grand Central in Belfast city centre, said prices will stay static.Prices at each of our seven properties are being kept very much the same as pre-lockdown to encourage as many bookings as possible, she said.Hospitality chief Michael Stewart, who co-runs House Belfast hotel, bar and restaurant, said it#s inevitable that a lot of venues will have to increase prices to sustain the costs they incur.He added: For hotels it#s a moving feast so nobody knows. If the Chancellor reduces VAT in the next budget it will give us room for manoeuvre on prices. Ms Grace, of Gwyn#s Cafe and Pavilion, said that price hikes are likely, although she pledged: I won#t be putting up mine.She added: Others may have no option but to increase their prices given all the extra costs incurred in complying with the new safety rules.

She has been on the front page of every local newspaper and appeared on all the TV bulletins.She has watched as hundreds of volunteers, maybe even thousands, have combed theand breadth of north Belfast.But still nothing.On Thursday afternoon, the investigation into the disappearance of the -year-old schoolboy from south Belfast remained intense and urgent.Police ers were continuing underwater searches close to the train tracks running alongside Crusaders# Seaview stadium on the Shore Road, not far from the last reported sighting of Fiona#s only child.PSNI Chief Constable Simon Byrne stopped by at one point to talk to members of the ious police teams, as specialist officers carried out their exhaustive and painstaking work.The gravity of the situation remains palpable, although it was noticeably quieter on Thursday - the hottest day of the year so far - than it has been since the teenager went missing on Sunday evening, June .That is the upshot of the PSNI and Community Rescue Serviceasking members of the public to pull back from the frenzied activity of earlier in the week and leave the searching to the specialists.Just across the road from Seaview, refreshments are still being provided at The Hubb Centre for those people keen to help out it is no reflection on them that they will no longer be directly involved. Standing outside the building, father-of-six Darren Steele told me his nephew Owen Goodyear was Noah#s best friend.Owen sat beside Noah in class at St Malachy#s, he said.He#s completely devastated by all this. He#s been out looking for Noah with my brother Paul, Owen#s dad, since Monday.I#ve been out searching every day for Noah myself. What has happened to him is a real mystery ... Everyone is getting very worried at this stage because there hasn#t been a single sighting of him for so long.Mr Steele added: We all want to find him. Everyone who has children can only imagine what Fiona Donohoe is going through at the moment.Ironically, and as distraught mum Fiona told me on Thursday morning, had it been another child who was missing, Noah would probably have been the first one out searching for him or her himself.In that scenario, she would have been the one at home, waiting for news - any news - and imagining what the missing child#s parents were going through.Now, however, she is the devastated mother in everybody#s thoughts, just like her son, whose now instantly recognisable image - a smiling, fresh-faced young boy, wearing his school unorm - pops up at bus stops along the Shore Road, reminding people that he is still out there somewhere.Social media traffic about Noah has also been substantial, the intention being that somebody#s memory will be jogged into providing the crucial, breakthrough details that could lead to his safehome.As people in the Shore Road area mentioned to me on Thursday afternoon, however, some aspects have been counterproductive, with unsubstantiated rumours masquerading as facts and threatening to muddy the waters.But for members of the CRS team, who have been working tirelessly all through the night and will continue to do so, the main objective remains clear.Regional Commander Sean McCarry said they are focused on finding a young boy whose so-far unexplained disappearance has affected so many in north Belfast and beyond. The longer it goes on, the more worrying it gets, but Mr McCarry and his colleagues remain optimistic that this frightening, virtually unimaginable tale will have a happy ending.We have found people three or four days after they#ve been reported missing, he said. The weather has been very good over the last few days. Noah is a young, fit, healthy boy.We still believe he may have gone into an empty building, or a shed or even into someone#s housethe door was open.Remember, he could have sustained a head injury and may be disorientated and that#s why we#re still asking everyone in the north Belfast area to check their homes, gardens and outbuildings.If you live in the north of the city and have not done this already, now is the time to start. If you have already done it, please do it again.Andyou have anything that might lead to Noah being reunited with Fiona at their south Belfast home, please come forward with it.It may appear trivial, yet could be the key to solving this most vexing of puzzles.Fiona on Thursday expressed her gratitude to those who have tried to locate her son. Hopefully she will get the opportunity to thank the person who succeeds.Belfast Most ReadNoah Donohoe: Police say investigation still #very much a missing persons enquiry#Northern Ireland hairdresser in plea to public over £ quoteNoah Donohoe mum pleads: I want my son backMalachi O#DohertyOpinionMichelle O#Neill said to know Bobby Storey was to love him.

The NICS employs just over , workers.More than halfof all staff, however, missed no days last year due to illness, while some .% had absence spells of five working days or less.Compared with the private sector, NICS absence levels are much higher, with the average private sector worker losing an average of . days due to illness.Staff who have served less than two years with the NICS also recorded lower sickness absence rates than those who had served longer - . days and . days.TUV leader Jim Allister said sick leave is unacceptably high in the NICS.“Among the plethora of statistics two strike me most. One, how sick levels among probationers is substantially lower - suggesting the stricter sick leave regime operated for probationers works, he told the Belfast .Two, the contrast with the private sector again suggests a dferent culture at play in the public sector.”Anxiety, stress, depression and other psychiatric illnesses accounted for the most absencesand, within this category, work-related stress accounting for around a third of the days lost.Looking at absences across each Stormont department, the Department of Justicehad the highest sickness absence rate with an average of . days lost, while the Executive Office had the least at . days.A DoJ spokesperson said: “The Department of Justice continues to take a proactive approach to the management of sickness absence including application of NI Civil Service policies and procedures such as written warnings, dismissals and ill health retirements where appropriate. A high priority is placed on the health and wellbeing of staff and a range of support services are provided. The vast majority of DOJ staff operate in front line roles, which creates particular pressures.”The figures, covering the  months to the end of March this year, also show that Covid- accounted for .% of all NICS sickness absences. These absences occurred between January and March.Looking at gender, women had a higher rate of sickness absence than men, with an average of  days and . days lost, respectively.The largest cause of this disparity was pregancy-related illness and, when this is excluded, the absence level for females dropped to . days.Some .% of staff had at least one long-term period of absence, with all long-term absences making up % of the total amount of working days lost. The average long-term absence was . working days.The Department of Finance handles civil service personnel. A spokesperson acknowledged that the NICS has more work to do in addressing sickness absences across departments.The sickness absence reasons highlighted by the report, particularly in relation to absence due to anxiety, stress, depression and psychiatric illness, reflect the prevalence of mental health issues across society, they added.Arrangements are in place within the civil service to quickly identy staff experiencing stress and offer support. In many cases there is an immediate referral to the Occupational Health Service and trained Welfare Officers will make contact to offer support and signpost staff to more specialised supportthis is required.  The NICS offers a comprehensive range of interventions to help and support staff including a welfare support service, access to a free,  hour counselling service for staff and their families as well as well-being and mental health awareness training for staff and managers.Belfast Most ReadNoah Donohoe: Police say investigation still #very much a missing persons enquiry#Northern Ireland hairdresser in plea to public over £ quoteNoah Donohoe mum pleads: I want my son backMalachi O#DohertyOpinionMichelle O#Neill said to know Bobby Storey was to love him.

Mr Maskey wrote: If the Assembly passes this resolution to enable the commission to develop any new determination, the commission is mindful of the need to ensure that any provisions both comply with wider good practice and ensure value for money in the use of public resources. Rigorous processes will continue to be in place to ensure that members demonstratethat all expenditure is in accordance with the rules regarding such allowances before they are reimbursed. Mr Maskey added these are complex matters which the commission considered in detail. The commission believes that this approach will retain the core principle of decisions on members# salaries and pensions being decided independently, while allowing some of the dficulties members have experienced in providing constituency services over recent years to be addressed, he wrote.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bfa-df-f-a-fbdbefab_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bfa-df-f-a-fbdbefab_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bfa-df-f-a-fbdbefab_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bfa-df-f-a-fbdbefab_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bfa-df-f-a-fbdbefab_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandProposal for Stormont body to set MLA expenses to be consideredA proposal for a Stormont body to set expenses for MLAs is being considered.Most ReadNoah Donohoe: Police say investigation still #very much a missing persons enquiry#Northern Ireland hairdresser in plea to public over £ quoteNoah Donohoe mum pleads: I want my son backMalachi O#DohertyOpinionMichelle O#Neill said to know Bobby Storey was to love him.

Lavey Parish pooled their energies to raise almost pound, to contribute to the recent work on St Mary’s Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much. At the end of the lockdown period I think we were all, kind of, looking for a lt of some kind and it certainly gave us all a great lt. “I want to say a sincere thanks to everybody who was involved - everybody who was at the organising end of it, and particularly to the groups that took part.” The fundraiser received huge community support, with local sports clubs in the area all taking on a specic challenge to help with the chapel’s restoration. Erin’s Own GAA’s underage footballers and hurlers ran km each, while their senior counterparts ran a collective km. googletag.cmd.push Termoneeny Hill Walking Club had originally pledged to walk a collective km, but upped their target to ,km during the course of their challenge. Termoneeny Cycling Club members each cycled km, while the Erin’s Own camogie players each clocked up at least km. -year-old Harry Boyle’s remarkable contribution saw him cycling around all the townlands in the parish, while Fr Graham and his parochial team got involved by running in their Lavey gear. The challenge was not just limited to Lavey, though, and their diaspora throughout the world got involved via social media, sharing photos of them completing their contribution. The club have raised almost pound, to date and donations can still be made via the Lavey Parish Just Giving page.

Patrick McGonagle, , whose address was given as Old School Lane in Shantallow appeared in court on June  charged with breaching his bail conditions on June  by ‘intentionally exposing his genitals’. The defendant had been released on bail on June  after being charged with common assault, namely throwing bread at a woman and attempting to grab her, and disorderly behaviour in a public place. A police officer said that on June  the PSNI became aware of a video circulating online showing a man acting in an ‘indecent manner’. googletag.cmd.push It was brought to the attention of police by community representatives and family members of children who witnessed it. McGonagle was identied in multiple reports. The officer said the incident took place at Old School Lane where the -year-old was seen ‘defecating in view of children’. A -year-old recorded the incident. The officer added: “He used chip shop wrappers to wipe himself. He was extremely intoxicated.” Police located the defendant at Old School Lane and he charged straight away. Objecting to bail, the officer said on June  McGonagle was warned about his behaviour and not to be intoxicated in a public place. googletag.cmd.push The court heard the -year-old has  previous convictions and two suspended sentences. There is an ‘extremely high risk of reoffending’, the officer added, ‘this man is incapable of not being intoxicated in a public place.’ Defence barrister Stephen Mooney said his client pleaded guilty to the offences before the court on Monday at the first opportunity and it was adjourned for a pre-sentence report. McGonagle was not in a position to be interviewed by the police due to his level of intoxication. Mr Mooney told the court that back in   the -year-old spent a ‘very signicant’ period of time in custody on remand. He was then found ‘unfit for trial’ because of his mental capacity and the prosecution was discontinued. The defence barrister said it is not so much a ‘fool’s pardon but a street drinker’s pardon’ as he is a well-known street drinker. His alcoholism is being criminalised because of his inability to stay sober, he added. Mr Mooney asked for bail to be granted with strict conditions attached. District Judge Peter King said ‘you’re absolutely correct’ and any bail conditions would have to include a prohibition on alcohol which would set him up for ‘spectacular failure’. He added that McGonagle may upset the ‘wrong person or group of people and find himself facing more dficulties’. The defendant was remanded in custody due to a ‘clear risk of reoffending’ to appear by way of video link on July .

Hannah Richardson has grown up in Derry and is well-known in the local rock music scene as lead singer guitarist in three-piece rock band CHERYM. Her mother is a white Irish woman and father a black Sierra Leonean. Until now the -year-old has found the topic of racism dficult to address. But she felt duty-bound to speak out following the Black Lives Matter protests and subsequent stories in the Derry News. Nurse Beverly Simpson addressed the rally in Derry on June  then shared her family’s experience of racism in the city. googletag.cmd.push Last week, pharmacist Nkele Mushapho said she has been subjected to racism in the workplace with people requesting an ‘Irish pharmacist’ and constantly questioning her advice. Ms Richardson was ‘shocked’ that people commenting underneath those stories seemed unaware of racism in the city and were in some cases denying its existence. She has encountered racism since the age of  in nursery school and can’t understand the dismissive attitudes of some people. “There are a lot of people who are in denial about the fact that racism exists here,” she said. “I’ve lived here my whole le, it is a lovely place to live, the people here are fantastic. googletag.cmd.push “However, yes, there are a lot of racist people that live in Northern Ireland and Derry as well. “Racism is so common that I now have a tendency to just get on with it because you know it’s going to happen again the next time you go out. It becomes normal.” She was raised by a white mother and all her friends are predominantly white. Until now, she has never felt the need to make public her views. But the experience of Ms Mushapho struck a chord and she couldn’t believe people were disregarding her account. “I was reading those comments going, ‘seriously, you don’t know how bad it is’. I know that not all people from here are racist, or have anything against black people, but a lot of people are ignorant to the idea of racism. “A lot of people here find it acceptable to use racial slurs or casual racism because there’s never really been that many black people about to correct them or tell them otherwise - that ‘yes, that is offensive’.” COMPASSION Ms Richardson has natural afro hair which has attracted negative attention in the past: “I used to be fine with wearing it out, loud and proud and happy days, but recently every single time that I would wear my natural hair as opposed to having weaves or wearing a hat, somebody would say something about me. “Whether it be, ‘are you on your holidays or where are you from ’ “I was walking through Foyle Street recently when some boy came right up to me and screamed Mo Salah in my face. “It’s every weekend, every single day I leave the house with my hair like that I would say it happens. “It’s really, really tough. So, it is shocking to see people being so dismissive of other people’s experiences because I assumed everybody knew that it was like this but they clearly don’t.” The -year-old believes that now is the right time for everyone to have conversations about race. She was dismayed by comments underneath a post by former politician Pat Ramsey a number of years ago in which he shared a story of racist abuse directed at a group of black people visiting the city. On nights out people are ‘the worst’ because they see a group of black people and approach them, she said. At times it can be positive but on other occasions ‘slurs are thrown about’. Looking back, Ms Richardson ponders whether she should’ve engaged with people commenting under Pat Ramsey’s post. However, the most recent comments with people saying Ms Mushapho was ‘lying’, ‘Derry is not like that’, ‘Irish people have history of oppression and wouldn’t act in such a way’ couldn’t go unaddressed, Ms Richardson said. “Your own experience of oppression should not ever take away from the experiences of black people,anything it should make you more compassionate towards another minority suffering from racism. “Is it because people can’t relate to black struggle that they have to turn the oppression back on themselves. “We need to take a look at what’s going on under our noses.” PROGRESSIVE In her view, it is right to shine a spotlight on injustices everywhere but she believes it is wrong to overlook what is happening in the city by directing comments at Ms Mushapho such as ‘racism exists in South Africa too’. “That’s like saying, ‘your experience doesn’t matter to me, take a look at your own people’”, Ms Richardson added. She despises use of the word ‘coloured’ saying it is completely inappropriate when describing a black person. Experts on racism say it is regarded as a highly offensive racial slur which recalls a time when casual racism was a part of everyday le. In the US, because of the countrys era of racial segregation, it is among the most offensive words for describing a black person. Ms Richardson believes some people in Derry are intentionally racist but many others are completely unaware, they lack a basic understanding of what terms are racist. She explained: “A lot of us are ignorant on the subject, you might have made racist remarks in the past but you yourself might not be racist. “As long as you learn from that racist remark, take what you can from it and accept you may have offended someone then that’s a good progressive way to be.” Reflecting on the way forward, she concluded: “Does racism exist in Northern Ireland  Totally. “Does it exist in Derry  Aye. “Don’t be afraid to ask questions, to ask other black people “Stop disregarding people’s experiences of racism. “Let’s think about what can we do to make sure Derry is anti-racist, as opposed to just being against racism, what can we do to make this a better place ”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Of their seven titles, Fergal Moore was involved in five, while Conrad McGuigan, their  winning captain, has six winners medals. Michael McMullan spoke to them about their memories. ***If you build it, they will come. The ghostly words inspired Ray Kinsella to build a field of dreams in the middle of his Iowa corn field in Kevin Costners  film of the same name. Craigbane also built for the future. A sharp left turn off the Slieveboy road and Gerry Crossan Park edges into view at the foot of Glenrandel brae. A state-of-the-art hall and gym. A fully floodlit pitch and one with training lights. A running track and a windmill spinning in the background. Its well used, worth every penny and the hours of planning. googletag.cmd.push Gavin Conwell, Ulster winning captain in , is the clubs Youth Officer and is passing on his knowledge to the next crop. Alfie Dallas, George Sharkey and Brian Conway also used the hall to the max. The future is in safe hands. Former senior manager Kevin Moore and Kieran McElhinney manage the minors. Ryan McDaid is involved with the Us. John Oacuteg Donaghy is Chairman. Former goalkeepers Paul McLaughlin and Gerard McLaughlin are on the committee. Its their turn to put a dferent stamp on the club. Next month, Craigbane will continue their rebuilding process in the unfamiliar surroundings of junior, almost  years since they were fingertips away from knocking Ballinderry out of the  Derry championship. The same season the Shamrocks ended as All-Ireland champions. googletag.cmd.push The last decade ravaged Craigbanes senior team of physicality and experience. Year by year, the youth has been thrown in. Now, theyre finding their feet. St Columbs Derry and Cathair Dhoire school teams have emerged with a Craigbane imprint. When St Patricks and St Brigids Claudy school team, under the guidance of current senior player Brian Rainey, there was also a strong Craigbane core.  Craigbanes  U championship winning team All coming from their U championship winning team of , when they beat a fancied Kilrea. “We, as a club, needed it,” manager Conrad McGuigan said after the game. “At the start of the year they beat us by  or  points, but I saw something in our boys in the second half – they didn’t lie down.” By September, they overturned the Pearses to land the silver. *** After early signs of football in the area during the s, St Josephs Craigbane wasnt founded until  and after a Division Three title, the  reserve success was their first championship. “We were starting to get to finals at that time,” Conrad McGuigan remembers of the beginning. “In , it was the th year of the Dr Kerlin Cup, it was our first final and we won it.” McGuigan, not yet , was beginning to cut his teeth in the senior team. After an appearance in the semi-final, he didnt play in the final against Loup. “The team included more of the older hands, it was a very settled team,” McGuigan outlines, before rattling off some of the names. “Noel Moore, Gerard McLaughlin, Shane Lynch, Harry Roe McLaughlin, Paddy Cartin, George Sharkey, Dermot Gormley and Damian OKane. “There were four Gormley brothers, Peter, God rest him, Colm, Leo and Brendan,” he adds. With the clash of green, Loup played in Ballinderry colours and Craigbane purchased a set of Down jersies for the game. “I also remember Loup taking home Martin OBrien from England for the game,” Conrad recalls. “He was a big player for them and that was the worry. Loup were favourites, but it worked out okay for us in the end.” With a first championship in the bag, McGuigan also hails Paul Dixon as being a huge influence on the team. He had ed from a stint with Burnley and was playing with Glentoran at the time. In , it took a replay to get over reigning junior champions Greenlough in the semi-final. Injury to Peter Gormley and his brother Colms sending off robbed them of their midfield pairing, remembers goalkeeper Gerard McLaughlin. Gerry McElhinney came home from England to answer the call. Craigbane found themselves seven points down in the latter stages of the final to Claudy. Earlier in the game, Dixon missed a penalty and turned down the chance to take Craigbanes second penalty. Nobody  fancied it and up stepped McGuigan and his goal sparked their comeback.  The Craigbane team pictured before the  replay win over Claudy Still Claudy held the upper hand and it look a last throw of the dice, Conrad remembers. “There was about two minutes left and I put a ball into the square, it was more of a Hail Mary and hepunched it into the net. The goal earned a replay, which Craigbane won, - to - and retained their title, leading to a four-year stint in the senior championship. Away from the clubscene, McGuigan played in St Marys Belfasts  Sigerson Cup win over UCC. He was also playing with Derry Us and Tommy Diamond had called him into the senior , where he saw some initial action. While success followed his career path, so too did injury. If two leg breaks werent enough, a dislocated elbow and putting out his shoulder a few times added to the woe. *** Tyrone has played a central part in Fergal Moores le. As a corner forward, he played up front with Geoffrey McGonigle on the Derry minor team, beaten by the Red Hands at Omagh in . Married and living close to Errigal Ciarans home in Dunmoyle for the last  years, saw him faced with a  milejourney to train and play with Craigbane. Despite being approached by the Tyrone giants to transfer and the lure of senior championship football, he stuck with his roots. “We wouldve been training twice a week and maybe three times coming up to championship,” Moore outlines. “I was asked to joinbut I never really thought about it. If Craigbane didnt have a game, I would go and watch Errigal.” Loyalty to home club was too much, though he has helped coach his daughter Michealas ladies team. “I have been at Tyronegames, but I have just been shouting her name,” he jokes. “Youll not get me cheering come on Tyrone or anything like that.” After starting on the Craigbane senior team as an U in , it was  before he made his championship debut, coming on as a sub in the final against Magilligan. “It was easy enough in the finish,” he outlines of Craigbanes win. Through the minors, he was corner forward, but after Leo Gormley hung up the number three senior jersey, Moore stepped into the berth he would hold during Craigbanes golden era. An influx of young players came through, inspired by the teams of the s. “Everybody came in around the same age and everybody was battling for places then.” Fergal remembers. “A lot of the young boys in thephotographs, or that were mascots were now breaking into the senior team,” adds Conrad McGuigan, who was named as  senior captain. “Boys were saying I want to play with our senior team and it was a spur for the parish.” Gerard McLaughlin, Conrad McGuigan, Kieran and Eddie McElhinney, Kevin and Fergal Moore gave a solid spine of experience. “The boys who came in, Alfie Dallas, Jude Dooley , Damien and Gary McLaughlin, they all had pace. At that stage, we wouldve given anybody in the county a good game for it,” McGuigan stresses. By the end of the decade and up in senior football, they clapped county champions Bellaghy on the pitch before drawing a game they couldve won. Later that year, only for uncharacteristic slip from Kieran McElhinney on a wet night, to allow a  to slip to the net, they had Ballinderry beaten before their   All-Ireland campaign even got off the ground. The whirlwind story began against Banagher in the  final. First of all, they needed to survive a storming Limavady comeback in the semi-final and Craigbane were lucky to hang on for a replay, which they navigated without any fuss. “It was a wake up call for us going into the final,” McGuigan states. Banagher had only been relegated from the first ision, and were billed as favourites. The cream against the second ision team. “There were families with cousins involved in both clubs and the rivalry was unreal. A lot of us grew up in Craigbane and had moved back into the new housing developments in Park,” he adds. After the influx, it raised the contentious issue...was Park in Banagher or in Craigbane  In the league, Banagher had won close games between the clubs and it was little surprise when an attendance of nearly , flocked to Drum for the final. “We knew it would take a good display from them to beat us,” Conrad continues. “We were a hard team to beat when the championship came along. Self belief was starting to seep into the team and you felt you were never going to lose. “Another influence at the time was Paddy Cassidy, who wouldve been Derry Citys fitness trainer. Francie Deeney, who was managed the team with Eddie McElhinney, got him in. “It was a new voice and it was a more dedicated approach to training and it all just started to gel.” Within minutes of the throw-in, Gavin Conwell had blood gushing out of his nose and Craigbane had a penalty, which McGuigan missed. Eddie McElhinney, who came on for Conwell, slipped home a th minute goal to put them in the driving seat.  Paddy Cassidy and Maurice McElhinney help Gavin Conwell from the pitch during the  final Banagher lost Patrick ODonnell to a shoulder injury and when McGuigan tagged on three points, Craigbane were on track for victory. “It was close in the end, but it didnt reflect our superiority,” McGuigan adds. Banagher grabbed a late goal, but Craigbane held on for a - to - win and title number four. “I just remember the supporters going mad and streaming onto the pitch after the game,” was Fergal Moores memory of winning the game. “Going into those games, at that time, there was excitement, you knew there wasnt going to be much in it and everything was left on the pitch.” “The boys went over to Farahsafter the game and probably drunk the place dry,” McGuigan recalls. “It wouldve have been the main place,. The craic was great and there was always a Monday club,” Fergal Moore adds. There were no trips back to Tyrone on county final nights. *** The  chapter was dferent. Craigbane were in five finals and lost all five by a point. In the same week of the Dr Kerlin Cup defeat to Banagher, they overturned the result to beat them in the championship, before going down to Faughanvale in a replay. By , Craigbane were top dogs again. After securing the Dr Kerlin Cup, it was like a fair day in Farahs. The story at the time was about the situation at Drumcree and local police resources were stretched. The bar was buzzing and it was the daylight hours before revellers spilled out on their way home. There was an interesting angle in the championship final that season. Alfie Dallas, Craigbanes  winning manager, was now in charge of Claudy. Low and behold, they met Craigbane in the final, with his son, Alfie junior, in fine fettle with seven points to his name in a comfortable win. “I have more memories of beating Banagher, because it meant more to us and we had already beaten Claudy,” Conrad McGuigan commented of the  success.  Sean Crossan, Shane Lynch, Gergal Moore and Gavin Conwell look on as Conrad McGuigan lts the  championship It was  before the next championship title, again under Deeney and McElhinney. They needed a stroke of luck in the last minute against Slaughtmanus in a topsy turvy round one game. The sides were level when Sean Currans shot hit the crossbar and came out, only to be greeted by the final whistle. “We shouldve been out,” Fergal Moore admits. “They were straight through,it had went over the bar, we were out.” A suspension kept Gavin Conwell out of most of the championship. A re-fixed semi-final to a Friday night, hours before his ban ended, ruled him out of the win over Claudy. Fergal Crossans alsofor the final, after a summer in Chicago that saw him win North American Player of the Year and later a call to the Derry senior team. Victory over Newbridge in the final, who had just dropped down from senior, took Craigbane to six on the roll of honour. Before the official Ulster championship, Clontibret ran Ulster tournament and this was Craigbanes first venture following delay because of foot and mouth. “I remember us going over the border and having to go across a sheep-dip type thing, where everything had to be washed,” McGuigan remembers. It was new ground, new teams, food on the way and a bus journey to the game. With every round, they grew as a team. “We beat Belcoo, Termon, Beragh and Inniskeen,” came the list of the teams rolling off Fergal Moores tongue, of their passage to glory. “Inniskeen was a right hard game,” he remembers of their - to - win. “We beat Beragh - to five or six points. The Tyrone teams were always good and Beragh werent long down from senior...it was probably the easiest game we played.” Fergal retired five years ago from reserve football at the age of , having picked up a fth medal and a second Ulster in , as part of a  managed by his brother Kevin and containing nephews Lee, Ryan and Rory. Conrad finished up in , aged , but after having a great innings, he has a regret not to have hung on longer for the clubs seventh championship. “I had played a bit of reserve football. The legs were starting to go, my game was based on pace. I was so lucky and looking back it was the right time for me to stop. I wouldnt have been playing , but just to be part of it and missing the the buzz of being involved when the club is on a run.” Now, it is all about the next generation and McGuigan, like many around the club, is confident. If they can avoid a swathe of emigration, the future is bright. “There is enough talent within our club,we can get over the next few years, to win something at another level, whatever grade that might be.” When Gavin Conwell lted the Ulster Cup on a magical  night in Omagh, he called for a gathering the next day in the clubhouse. So all the young weans could see all the cups. It sounded impulsive, but it wasnt. It was time to strike when the iron was hot. A decade on, those youngsters are now the tools to build Craigbanes next team to challenge for a championship. FEATURE- Newbridges championship success of  through the eyes of Hugh Gutty McGlone.punched it into the net.The goal earned a replay, which Craigbane won, - to - and retained their title, leading to a four-year stint in the senior championship.Away from the clubscene, McGuigan played in St Marys Belfasts  Sigerson Cup win over UCC.He was also playing with Derry Us and Tommy Diamond had called him into the senior , where he saw some initial action.While success followed his career path, so too did injury.If two leg breaks werent enough, a dislocated elbow and putting out his shoulder a few times added to the woe.*** DROP CAPITAL ***Tyrone has played a central part in Fergal Moores le.As a corner forward, he played up front with Geoffrey McGonigle on the Derry minor team, beaten by the Red Hands at Omagh in .Married and living close to Errigal Ciarans home in Dunmoyle for the last  years, saw him faced with a  milejourney to train and play with Craigbane.Despite being approached by the Tyrone giants to transfer and the lure of senior championship football, he stuck with his roots.“We wouldve been training twice a week and maybe three times coming up to championship,” Moore outlines.“I was asked to joinbut I never really thought about it.If Craigbane didnt have a game, I would go and watch Errigal.”Loyalty to home club was too much, though he has helped coach his daughter Michealas ladies team.“I have been at Tyronegames, but I have just been shouting her name,” he jokes.“Youll not get me cheering come on Tyrone or anything like that.”After starting on the Craigbane senior team as an U in , it was  before he made his championship debut, coming on as a sub in the final against Magilligan.“It was easy enough in the finish,” he outlines of Craigbanes win. Through the minors,he was corner forward, but after Leo Gormley hung up the number three senior jersey, Moore stepped into the berth he would hold during Craigbanes golden era.An influx of young players came through, inspired by the teams of the s.“Everybody came in around the same age and everybody was battling for places then.” Fergal remembers.“A lot of the young boys in thephotographs, or that were mascots were now breaking into the senior team,” adds Conrad McGuigan, who was named as  senior captain.“Boys were saying I want to play with our senior team and it was a spur for the parish.”Gerard McLaughlin, Conrad McGuigan, Kieran and Eddie McElhinney, Kevin and Fergal Moore gave a solid spine of experience.“The boys who came in, Alfie Dallas, Jude Dooley , Damien and Gary McLaughlin, they all had pace.At that stage, we wouldve given anybody in the countya good game for it,” McGuigan stresses.By the end of the decade and up in senior football, they clapped county champions Bellaghy on the pitch before drawing a game they couldve won.Later that year, only for uncharacteristic slip from Kieran McElhinney on a wet night, to allow a  to slip to the net, they had Ballinderry beaten before their   All-Ireland campaign even got off the ground.The whirlwind story began against Banagher in the  final.First of all, they needed to survive a storming Limavady comeback in the semi-final and Craigbane were lucky to hang on for a replay, which they navigated without any fuss.“It was a wake up call for us going into the final,” McGuigan states.Banagher had only been relegated from the first ision, and were billed as favourites.The cream against the second ision team.“There were families with cousins involved in both clubs and the rivalry was unreal.A lot of us grew up in Craigbane and had moved back into the new housing developments in Park,” he adds.After the influx, it raised the contentious issue...was Park in Banagher or in Craigbane In the league, Banagher had won close gamesbetween the clubs and it was little surprise when an attendanceof nearly , flocked to Drum for the final.“We knew it would take a good display from them to beat us,” Conrad continues.“We were a hard team to beat when the championship came along.Self belief was starting to seep into the team and you felt you were never going to lose.“Another influence at the time was Paddy Cassidy, who wouldve been Derry Citys fitness trainer.Francie Deeney, who was managed the team with Eddie McElhinney, got him in.“It was a new voice and it was a more dedicated approach to training and it all just started to gel.”Within minutes of the throw-in, Gavin Conwell had blood gushing out of his nose and Craigbane had a penalty, which McGuigan missed.Eddie McElhinney, who came on for Conwell, slipped home a th minute goal to put them in the driving seat.Banagher lost Patrick ODonnell to a shoulder injury and when McGuigan tagged on three points, Craigbane were on track for victory.“It was close in the end, but it didnt reflect our superiority,” McGuigan adds.Banagher grabbed a late goal, but Craigbane held on for a - to - win and title number four.“I just remember the supporters going mad and streaming onto the pitch after the game,” was Fergal Moores memory of winning the game.“Going into those games, at that time, there was excitement, you knew there wasnt going to be much in it and everything was left on the pitch.”“The boys went over to Farahsafter the game and probably drunk the place dry,” McGuigan recalls.“It wouldve have been the main place,.The craic was great and there was always a Monday club,” Fergal Moore adds.There were no trips back to Tyrone on county final nights.*** DROP CAPITAL ***The  chapter was dferent.Craigbane were in five finals and lost all five by a point.In the same week of the Dr Kerlin Cup defeat to Banagher, they overturned the result to beat them in the championship, before going down to Faughanvale in a replay. By , Craigbane were top dogs again.After securing the Dr Kerlin Cup, it was like a fair day in Farahs.The story at the time was about the situation at Drumcree and local police resources were stretched.The bar was buzzing and it was the daylight hours before revellers spilled out on their way home.There was an interesting angle in the championship final that season.Alfie Dallas, Craigbanes  winning manager, was now in charge of Claudy.Low and behold, they met Craigbane in the final, with his son, Alfie junior, in fine fettle with seven points to his name in a comfortable win.“I have more memories of beating Banagher, because it meant more to us and we had already beaten Claudy,” Conrad McGuigan commented of the  success.It was  before the next championship title, again under Deeney and McElhinney.They needed a stroke of luck in the last minute against Slaughtmanus in a topsy turvy round one game.The sides were level when Sean Currans shot hit the crossbar and came out, only to be greeted by the final whistle.“We shouldve been out,” Fergal Moore admits.“They were straight through,it had went over the bar, we were out.”A suspension kept Gavin Conwell out of most of the championship.A re-fixed semi-final to a Friday night, hours before his ban ended, ruled him out of the win over Claudy.Fergal Crossans alsofor the final, after a summer in Chicago that saw him win North American Player of the Year and later a call to the Derry senior team.Victory over Newbridge in the final, who had just dropped down from senior, took Craigbane to six on the roll of honour.Before the official Ulster championship, Clontibret ran Ulster tournament and this was Craigbanesfirst venture following delay because of foot and mouth.“I remember us going over the border and having to go across a sheep-dip type thing, where everything had to be washed,” McGuigan remembers.It was new ground, new teams, food on the way and a bus journey to the game.With every round, they grew as a team.“We beat Belcoo, Termon, Beragh and Inniskeen,” came the list of the teams rolling off Fergal Moores tongue, of their passage to glory.“Inniskeen was a right hard game,” he remembers of their - to - win. “We beat Beragh - to five or six points.The Tyrone teams were always good and Beragh werent long down from senior...it was probably the easiest game we played.”Fergal retired five years ago from reserve football at the age of , having picked up a fth medal and a second Ulster in , as part of a  managed by his brother Kevin and containing nephews Lee, Ryan and Rory.Conrad finished up in , aged , but after having a great innings, he has a regret not to have hung on longer for the clubs seventh championship.“I had played a bit of reserve football.The legs were starting to go, my game was based on pace.I was so lucky and looking back it was the right time for me to stop.I wouldnt have been playing , but just to be part of it and missing the the buzz of being involved when the club is on a run.”Now, it is all about the next generation and McGuigan, like many around the club, is confident.If they can avoid a swathe of emigration, the future is bright.“There is enough talent within our club,we can get over the next few years, to win something at another level, whatever grade that might be.”When Gavin Conwell lted the Ulster Cup on a magical  night in Omagh, he called for a gathering the next day in the clubhouse.So all the young weans could see all the cups.It sounded impulsive, but it wasnt.It was time to strike when the iron was hot.A decade on, those youngsters are now the tools to build Craigbanes next team to challenge for a championship.\"More...

Manager John McEvoy has stated he will respect the club window and is happy his players will be getting three or four games, to help their preparation for a showdown with Down. Feargal McGill. Director of Club, Player and Games Administration, told the County Derry Post of their plans for the unplayed league games. “It is definitely our intention to finish the leagues, the league finals in hurling and the remaining two rounds in football,” he commented. Derry hurlers are unbeaten so far this season, thanks to a late Conor Kelly point in their - to - draw against Kildare on Sunday, March . They will play Down in the Division B promotion final, hoping to go one better than last years defeat to Wicklow. googletag.cmd.push In football, Rory Gallaghers senior squad would need results to all fall for themthey were to gain promotion from Division . Derry, on five points, are two points behind Down and Longford. They would need Paddy Tallys men to lose both games to bottom of the table Leitrim and Louth. Derry hurling boss McEvoy also admitted that preparations after the lay-off will be a challenge. “We had a decent league and we were happy with the progress. We brought seven new guys into the setup. They added a lot to it,” he told the County Derry Post. McEvoy also felt that the break gave injured quartet Paddy Kelly, Mark Craig, Eamonn McGill and Darragh McCloskey time to recover, while he hopes they can get through the -week club championship period unscathed. googletag.cmd.push “We are going to respect the club window,” he stressed. ”All the players are going to be playing a lot of matches. Thankfully they are going to be getting three or four matches each, before they get into semi-finals and finals. “We have to look at this as a positive, they will be back hurling and their club managers will be working with them in terms of hand to eyeand doing lots of ball work. “When we get the green light in mid-September, well start back working with them and looking forward to that. It will be a short lead into the league final but there is nothing we can do with it.” This weeks release is also expected to have dates for the ious championships, including the Christy Ring Cup. “Im hearing dferent things about Joe McDonagh and Christy Ring, that they are going knock-out,” McEvoy stated. “Given the window, that wouldnt surprise you and that can go with you or against you. “I think they would play the threematches and thats what wed prefer, but at this stage I just dont know.” RELATED- Derry hope to make championship draws this weekMore...

As more and more companies continue to get back to work, we look at how the financial support is helping firms across the nation to adapt, innovate and protect jobs. Here is an example of how companies have been helped, and what support is available.

Robert McCullough has taken on the important role. Speaking last month, he said: “Since the beginning of March, Danske Bank has provided poundmillion in overall business lending, including poundmillion through the UK government-backed Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme and poundmillion on the Bounce Back Loan Scheme.” The UK Government’s Bounce Back Loan Scheme grants finance of up to pound, to small and medium-sized businesses, interest-free for the first  months. Meanwhile, for companies with a turnover of up to poundmillion, the UK-wide Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme allows them to access up to poundmillion where the UK Government will pay interest and any fees for the first  months. googletag.cmd.push Danske Bank has also been able to provide relief of up to poundmillion to large businesses via the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme. As the largest bank in Northern Ireland, Danske Bank supports companies in a wide iety of sectors, such as retailers Lunn’s Jewellers, manufacturers The Signature Works and in tourism, family-run bus company Airporter.  poundM LENDING: Danske Bank’s Robert McCullough Robert said: “Businesses in some industries have managed to adapt quickly to a new reality of remote working and social distancing, while others have regrettably seen trade grind to a halt. “The unprecedented measures announced by the government will help a lot of companies to survive and we are hopeful the majority will ultimately recover.” The bank was able to launch each of the Schemes on day one, the majority of applications being approved through an easy, automated process. “Getting this financial support in place in Northern Ireland was the result of a huge effort from teams across the Danske Bank and we continue to work hard to make sure the process is as good as it should be and that we can get money to our customers quickly. “There is no doubt that we have an important role to play in the weeks and months ahead to get Northern Ireland moving again. “We have the commitment and the capacity to continue to support customers, the community and the wider economy.”  FINDING A SOLUTION: Staff working at the Sunamp site in East Lothian When the Covid- pandemic arrived the chief executive officer of East Lothian firm Sunamp, knew the company could respond. Andrew Bissellsaid: “A week into lockdown I woke up in the middle of the night and just thought ‘we have to do something that makes the business relevant in this crisis’.” Mr Bissell turned to Sunamp’s innovative technology, developed in partnership with the University of Edinburgh. The company has led the way in the manufacture of heat batteries that store heat energy rather than electricity like conventional batteries. The applications of the technology span several industries, but the company’s focus has so far been on offering a product that replaces the hot water tank in heating systems with something smaller and more efficient. Recognising the potential of the technology in the context of Covid-, Sunamp was one of more than , companies to apply for grant funding from Innovate UK, the UK Government’s innovation agency. In April, Innovate UK launched the Fast Start initiative, with poundm of funding available to companies responding to the pandemic with some form of innovation. In the end, Sunamp was one of  companies to secure a grant.  The pound, award is being used to develop mobile handwash units that can be installed in locations where people lack access to hygiene facilities that can help prevent the spread of Covid-. Mr Bissell said: “You don’t need hot water to wash your hands, but it is much more comfortable. “Right now, we’re dealing with the virus in the summer time, but as we head into winter,you have to wash your hands outside a railway station or supermarket or vaccination centre, it will be much more pleasant to have warm water.” The idea has gained traction with Sunamp’s clients, with inquiries coming in rapidly even though the finished product is still in development. Mr Bissell said: “Covid- is a global problem so there’s widespread interest. “Sunamp has partnerships and licensing arrangements with businesses all around the world through which it sells its heat batteries, so the ambition for the mobile units is international.” For Mr Bissell, the appeal of the project is that in addition to its obvious commercial potential, there’s a real societal benefit. “There is no minimising the negatives of Covid-,” he said. “But there are many people stepping and doing amazing things.” Working with everything from gas boilers to solar and heat pumps, Sunamp says its Heat Batteries deliver hot water with efficiency and proven savings of up to  per cent on utility bills in residential, commercial or industrial settings. The types of support on offer to help your company… Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

With handsanitiserat the door to every store, one-way systems, contactlesspayment, and limits on customernumbers, the new normal might take a while to get used to. Around half the shops in Foyleside Shopping Centre were open on Tuesday morning, with Dunnes Stores attracting the biggest crowds. Staff in Marks and Spencers and Boots, which have remained open throughout the pandemic, were glad to see a bit more hustle and bustle in the centre And with sales on in Debenhams, Dunnes and Marks and Spencer, many shoppers remarked on how happy they were to be out spendingagain. googletag.cmd.push But while the shops are open, cafes and coffee shops in the shopping centres remain closed for now. Mary McLaughlin, who hasnt been shopping in the city centrein over three months, said shewas glad to be back. This is my first day back up the town and Im all hyper with it, she said. I havent been up thetown since way beforeSt Patricks Day Its been awful not being able toget up the town, butas long as we are all healthy thats the main thing. Its just great to get out again. Ive been looking forward to it. Self-confessed shopaholic Geraldine Deery has been yearning for the social side of shopping. googletag.cmd.push Im ashopaholic and its been drivingme crazy, she said. I missed going up the town and meeting people and having a chat. And I really miss going in for a cup of coffee with my sister. Ive gone abit crazy buying things, Im making up for losttime of the weeks I missed. The management at Foyleside, The Richmond Centre and Debenhams have clearly put a lot of timeand effortinto establishingand marking out one-way systems and there are plenty of signs in place reminding people to keep to the two metre social distance rule. You do be a bit nervous because youre looking at the floor, trying to make sure you are going the right way, said Mrs McLaughlin. Everything is well spaced out and the floors are all marked out. Although Im glad I came out early because its quiet at the minute. Derrys small independent retailers are also slowly getting back to business after getting the go ahead this week, David Thomas, whose jewellery shop and workshop Thomas Goldsmith has operated from Pump Street for over  years, has been surprised that some of his fellow small traders havent reopned yet.  Ive just been for a walk round and Ive noticed that a large number of small independents arent openat the minute. This is the second dayinto it and they are taking their time to get back to work. Maybe thats their own choice. It surprisedme because to rebuild businessagain is important. For a lot of them who have furloughed staff and who are self employed as it were and are receiving payments they are thinking I wont risk it because theres a safety net there. But obviously that safety net is going to start disappearing. Business has been quite slow this week, but MrThomas is hopeful that shoppers will be back. We arecompleting the work we werent able to complete in March after the guillotine came down and we werent able to finish. And then we were hit by problems in the supply chain but that has started to ease up. In the last two weeks it has relaxed and things are filtering thoughnow. Were now able to complete things we should have done in March so weve stillgot that momentum from then, but in terms of work coming through its going to be a bit slow. There are a lot of people are being made redundant or who havent been able to claim grants and things like that. But on the other hand there are people who were furloughed and had to stay at home and werent able to spend money and they should have a fairly healthy bank account and they are desperate to get out and buy stuff. Mr Thomas has made changes to the way the shop operates in order to comply with the new regulations. Only one customer is admitted at a time, staff are usingfacemasks and hand sanitiser, and jewellery that has been tried on is being cleaned before it goes back on th shelf. People are understanding and respectful, remarked Mr Thomas. He feels that lockdown has given people time to reflect on their work le balance and lestyle. People are saying it will never be the same, he said. We were all chasing our tails a bit, workingvery hard. Does it have to be like that  Can we take things a bit easier  Do we have to be rushing off to Portugal on cheap flights  It has been strangeto sit at home in the garden and look up and see the skies totally clear. Many of Derrys charity shops have also reopened their doors, with Oxfam, Kinship Care, the Red Cross and Cancer Focus back in businessearlier this week. However, the three month closure has meant some stores are struggling with low stock levels. Deborah Tracey is the manager at Cancer Focus on Shipquay Street, which opened in May .  The shop reopened last Friday after a week of cleaning and preparation and have been busy ever since. Inside there is hand sanitiser at thedoor and a one-waysystem in place. Most people have been using the hand sanitiser before they come in, said Ms Tracey. We have been busy with people bringing stuff in and buying stuff too. People seem to feel confident coming out to shop now and theyare glad toget back to a bit of normality. Cancer Focus has amanager and deputy manager but all the other staff are volunteers. Some of our volunteers have been worried about coming back because they are older and more at risk, said MsTracy. So weare lookingfor newvolunteers now. We provide everyonewith shields, masks and gloves for their safety. Cancer Focus has also launched an appeal for donations. Any donations to the shop must be quarantined for  hours when we receive them, said Ms Tracy. We are looking for donations of clothes, bric-a-brac, shoes, bags and books. If you would like to make a donation to Cancer Focus or to enquire about becoming a volunteer telephone .

At present, hospitality businesses have to adhere to strict licensing laws in terms of serving outdoors. However, local councils have been encouraged by the Northern Ireland Executive to take a flexible approach to the situation to support the sector as it emerges from the coronavirus lockdown. Derry City and Strabane District Council is currently looking at ways it can help local businesses. They have launched a short survey asking for peoples opinions on the matter. The survey can be filled in here -https:bit.ly eohTnm googletag.cmd.push A council spokesperson said: The hospitality and retail industries have been some of the hardest hit in terms of lost revenue during COVID-. They will also be one of the last to fully emerge from the lockdown. With the impact of the pandemic and the resulting social distancing measures that must continue when businesses reopen it is essential that we start to reimagine how theservice industries can adapt and operate in the current circumstances.New business models and taking hospitality and trade outdoors will play a signicant part in the survival of the service industry locally. Using private and public spaces such as pavements, car parking spaces and events spaces such as Guildhall Square, Waterloo Place and the Canal Basin in Strabane could be part of the solution. googletag.cmd.push To achieve this, Council and key stakeholders including Department for Infrastructure and the Department for Communities will be adopting a flexible approach that seeks to facilitate innovation - whilst ensuring appropriate controls such as Insurance, disability access, enforcement and public health are in place.

Dean O’Neill, from Drumsurn, died suddenly last week and mourners at his funeral yesterday heard how the news had left the community in shock. “The church would be absolutely packed todaythings were normal,” said Fr Seamus Kelly, officiating at the funeral. “The tragic news that spread throughout the area on Thursday morning stunned the whole community. “He was one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge in Drumsurn in recent years and it was lovely to see all the young people with their shirts on as his remains were being carried in.” googletag.cmd.push  Dean, known around the community as ‘Floater’, excelled on the sports field and Fr Kelly described him as ‘one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge from Drumsurn in recent years’. In the colours of St Patrick’s College, Dungiven, he was outstanding and won a Derry vocational schools’ All-Star award in . He represented St Matthew’s GAC and Kevin Lynch Hurling Club and carried his talent with modesty. Fr Kelly recalled how he deflected praise after a notable victory at minor level. “He covered every blade of grass in defence and attack but didn’t want any great glory,” he told the congregation. googletag.cmd.push “When Drumsurn and Drum amalgamated as St Patrick’s at minor level a few years ago, he gave an exhibition of football as he dragged his team back into contention and eventually saw them defeat Glenullin having been nine points down at half time. “He declared humbly, ‘sure Micheacuteal Archibald deserves praise more than me’. He loved sport and played Gaelic, soccer, hurling and basketball with distinction for the school.”  Dean in the colours of Kevin Lynch Hurling Club. Off the pitch, Fr Kelly told mourners how Dean had a great sense of fun and spoke of his great love for his family and friends. “He tortured friends and relations with pranks and jokes. He was very close to all his cousins and friends and kept in touch with them,” he said. “When his brother, Justin, go married, he was best man for him and was godfather to their first child, Taylor. He absolutely doted on her, as indeed he did on all his nephews and nieces. “I know how proud Justin and Jordan were of their brother Dean, but they all have wonderful memories as have Gertie, Rory and wider family and friends. “He met a lovely girl in Amber and it looked like they would settle down for good. Of course, he was not known as Dean, it was just ‘Floater’ to all his friends who loved him so much. “In recent times, he had settled a lot and went to live in Dungiven, although, he always insisted, he was a Drumsurn man.” Fr Kelly spoke of the great sadness within the community following his passing. “I’m well aware that Drumsurn is in a state of mourning, as Dean was so well-known and loved here,” he said. “However, we have a promise that death is not the end, but another step on the journey to eternal le. “Everyone who knew him, or even met him, loved him. He had an amazing personality that endeared him to all and had a relentless sense of fun. “To young and old, he was a legend. It has been the most common remark uttered over the past few days. What a character.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Void Gallery is ‘delighted’ to announce artists Alan Phelan and David Beattie as the recipients of the Plinth Commissions for  and . The Walker Memorial Plinth was built in  - a  metre high column topped by a five metre high statue of the Reverend George Walker who was Governor of the city during the siege of Derry in . The column and statue were blown up by the IRA in . googletag.cmd.push The remaining plinth and its historical signicance have meant it has been a contentious space in the city. Funded by the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Plinth Commissions is a collaboration between Void Gallery, The Siege Museum and Friends of the Derry Walls. The ambition of the commission is to reclaim the space as a public area for collaboration and collective participation. Through an open call, artists both North and South of the border were invited to propose a project involving the community that surrounds the Plinth, creating sculptural interventions as part of the collaboration. The first commission by Dublin-based artist Alan Phelan will launch in September . googletag.cmd.push Phelan’s project is a crowd-sourced sculpture made by inidual participants in isolation, then assembled together to create the final artwork. This collective making process acknowledges and commemorates the COVID- crisis. The sculpture will be of a hyacinth flower using the red, green and blue colours with petals made in papier-macirccheacute, based around a small similar work due to be exhibited at Void Gallery as part of Phelan’s exhibition ‘echoes are always more muted’ which launches at the same time. Alan Phelan commented: “I am delighted to be part of the Plinth Commissions for . “My idea is to work with the community to mark this strange time we have all experienced and harness the people power of socially distanced activity to make this public sculpture. “I look forward to working with Void Engage and bringing people together by staying apart, as they say, for this project.” Launching in , David Beattie proposes a project that will unfold as an invitation to the community to collectively examine the River Foyle as an interconnecting body of water, a richness of bioersity, and a measure of perpetual time. Participants will be invited to connect with the river through a series of engagements that record their experiences and allow them to rethink their relationship with the river and their natural environments. The project will culminate in a sound recording that will be played from the Plinth and will mark the high and low tide of the river, bringing awareness of the rhythm of the river, and movement of time to people within the city. David Beattie, who is also from Dublin, said he was delighted to be selected for this unique commission. “It feels extra special to be supported to produce new artwork during a precarious time for artists and art workers. “I look forward to working alongside the team at Void and the communities on both sides of the River Foyle to realise the project for the Walker Plinth.” Void Director Mary Cremin added: “We are very excited about this public art programme that we have been developing in partnership with The Siege Museum and the Friends of the Derry Walls. “It is a signicant moment to have this plinth reclaimed as a public space when you consider how contentious public monuments and memorials are in this current moment in time,” added Ms Cremin.

A spokesperson for St. Columb’s College encouraged people to get involved today. “Both of these young men are sadly missed by staff and students at the College. “Oran was a pleasant young man - a true gentleman in the making.

Outside of school, he played an active role in his local GAA club and enjoyed socialising with friends when not working on cars with his father. googletag.cmd.push “Oran showed extreme courage and faith throughout his illness and his loss has left its mark on those who remember him fondly. “Aodhaacuten was such a genuine, lovely person and brought a smile to everyone he was around. He was a dream of a young fella. He was a fantastic hurler and loved representing his club and county. Family, friends and team mates held him in high esteem and he is sorely missed by us all.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

St Marys Grammar School, Magherafelt, confirmed they intend to use the transfer test, known as the GL Entrance Assessment. In a statement, the school said they are aware of the unprecedented circumstances of this year. After y consideration of the issues, the Board of Governors of St Marys Grammar School intends to use academic selection in its admissions criteria for pupils wishing to transfer to the school in September , it read. The GL Entrance Assessment will be conducted in accordance with the most up-to-date Public Health Agency guidance available to schools at that time. googletag.cmd.push The school are part ofa group called the Post-Primary Transfer Consortium , who have taken measures to mitigate some of the disruption caused by Covid- this academic year. The group released a statement claiming marking and standardising approaches will ensure comparable outcomes to previous years. It will not, for example, be harder to achieve an A grade this year, it read. Every year, regardless of how many pupils sit the Entrance Assessment or of whether the papers prove to be slightly easier or more dficult than a previous year, the marking and standardisation processes ensure that similar proportions of pupils will achieve similar grades. googletag.cmd.push St Marys added that they have a contingency plan in the event of the Entrance Assessment not being able to take place. They said: Should it be required, the implementation of this plan will include alternative admission criteria, the details of which will be published for parents at that time. Any change of circumstances would have to be considered in the local context, acted upon and communicated to parents at the earliest possible date. St Columbs and Thornhill in Derry city are among a number of schools that have opted against asking prospective pupils to take the transfer test this year. Both are also members of the PPTC. Another County Derry member, Rainey Endowed in Magherafelt, are yet to publicly announce their arrangements, but astatement from the PPTC is available on their website, detailing information about transfer arrangements.

The Unity of Purpose group was in the news earlier this month when it called for the postponement of a Black Lives Matter rally which was held in Derrys Guildhall Square on June . In a statement, which was issued through the City Centre Initiative in Derry, the group said they understood and supported the reasons for the rally, but added that they believed it should be called off due to public safety concerns in relation to the coronavirus pandemic. However, despite the appeal, the rally went ahead and police subsequently issued  fines to people taking part in the protest. googletag.cmd.push In its recent statement, a spokesperson for theUnityofPurposegroup said it consists of local MPs, MLAs, the Mayor and statutory and business leaders within Derry. In the wake of the Black Lives Matters rally,Shaun Harkin and Eamonn McCann, People Before Profit councillors on the local council, criticised the stance of the Unity of Purpose group and called for the group to disband. The Unity of Purpose group did not respond to the councillors criticisms. Speaking at todays monthly meeting of the council, independent councillor Gary Donnelly accused the group of being very very selective on what they comment on. There have been a lot things that have happened in this city during the time that this group has been about and they have issued no statements. he said. googletag.cmd.push My concern is that they are not accountable, they dont respond and there is a council connection that I am deeply concerned about. I have seen photographs with councillors and I have seen photographs with council officers and I want to try and get some clarication on that. I want clarication on funding. Do we fund them directly or indirectly  I know there is a link to them through the City Centre Initiative. Far from saying what they say they do on the tin, their actions have led to people becoming more marginalised and excluded, added Cllr Donnelly. Speaking at todays meeting, Councillor Eamonn McCann described the Unity of Purpose group as a faceless organisation. He said it was unusual that there no inidual names attached to the recent statement issued by the group. Does this group have a policy document that we can look at  Does it have a constitution  Does it have a set of aims or a mission statement  Becausewe dont see that we are unable to work out in what way the opposition to the Black Lives Matter rally comes within their remit, said Cllr McCann. Cllr Donnelly proposed that the council carry out a report into connections between the council and the Unity of Purpose group. The matter was put to a vote and the proposal was carried, after  councillors voted to support it. Six councillors voted against the proposal.

While a more defined timeline is now in place, clubs should onlywhen they are ready to do so,saidIRFU Rugby Development DirectorColin McEntee. We have already seen a handful of clubs put a Covid- Club Health  Safety Plan in place and resume with reduced activities and we are delighted to see players being active again and reconnecting with their clubs. Given the restricted nature of these activities, we don’t see any clubs being left behind as we continue to work towards ato competition in September. I encourage all clubs to plan for that time with the highest safety standards in mind. PLAYER WELFARE  INJURY PREVENTION Workload volume and activity should be strictly controlled throughout these stages. This will be critical in terms of injury prevention as well as minimizing the risk of COVID- infection. IRFU Medical DirectorRod McLoughlinsaid: We must remember at all times that COVID- has not been eliminated from this island. It is critical that clubs continue to minimise risk and adhere to all public health measures in place. Rugby will onlyin a meaningful waywe adopt the right behaviours that will keep ourselves, our teammates and our club mates safe. He also urged clubs to take extra care with injury prevention measures for players. It has been over  days since any club player has been involved in competitive rugby and we have seen from other team sports that have ed earlier than rugby that there is an increased risk of injury. That means clubs will have to be extra cautious around the training loads they are putting in place. Player welfare still applies around injury prevention just as much as it does in terms of Covid-. PAPERLESS PRE-RETURN TO RUGBY PERSONAL ASSESSMENT DECLARATION FORM Clubs can avail of a new paperless Pre-Return To Rugby Personal Assessment Declaration Form week commencing theJuly th.The online version of the form will be available as part of the new RugbyConnect system. The form is an essential document in Covid- Health  Safety Planning. It confirms that a club member is not suffering from any Covid- Symptoms, been in close contact with anyone who is self-isolating or has travelled from another country in the past  days. PPE SUPPLEMENTARY KITS FOR CLUBS The IRFU will issue supplementary PPE Kits to clubs to assist in the implementation of their COVID- Club Health  Safety Plans. Each club can expect to receive a PPE Kit to their designated COVID- Club Safety Officer contact from the week commencingth June.

While a more defined timeline is now in place, clubs should onlywhen they are ready to do so,saidIRFU Rugby Development DirectorColin McEntee. We have already seen a handful of clubs put a Covid- Club Health  Safety Plan in place and resume with reduced activities and we are delighted to see players being active again and reconnecting with their clubs. Given the restricted nature of these activities, we don’t see any clubs being left behind as we continue to work towards ato competition in September. I encourage all clubs to plan for that time with the highest safety standards in mind. PLAYER WELFARE  INJURY PREVENTION Workload volume and activity should be strictly controlled throughout these stages. This will be critical in terms of injury prevention as well as minimizing the risk of COVID- infection. IRFU Medical DirectorRod McLoughlinsaid: We must remember at all times that COVID- has not been eliminated from this island. It is critical that clubs continue to minimise risk and adhere to all public health measures in place. Rugby will onlyin a meaningful waywe adopt the right behaviours that will keep ourselves, our teammates and our club mates safe. He also urged clubs to take extra care with injury prevention measures for players. It has been over  days since any club player has been involved in competitive rugby and we have seen from other team sports that have ed earlier than rugby that there is an increased risk of injury. That means clubs will have to be extra cautious around the training loads they are putting in place. Player welfare still applies around injury prevention just as much as it does in terms of Covid-. PAPERLESS PRE-RETURN TO RUGBY PERSONAL ASSESSMENT DECLARATION FORM Clubs can avail of a new paperless Pre-Return To Rugby Personal Assessment Declaration Form week commencing theJuly th.The online version of the form will be available as part of the new RugbyConnect system. The form is an essential document in Covid- Health  Safety Planning. It confirms that a club member is not suffering from any Covid- Symptoms, been in close contact with anyone who is self-isolating or has travelled from another country in the past  days. PPE SUPPLEMENTARY KITS FOR CLUBS The IRFU will issue supplementary PPE Kits to clubs to assist in the implementation of their COVID- Club Health  Safety Plans. Each club can expect to receive a PPE Kit to their designated COVID- Club Safety Officer contact from the week commencingth June.

Those behind the ambitious project are confident that the ious stories will appeal to both locals and visitors alike.Other interpretative  will tell of the emigration of families from Saintfield to the United States over the last  years, using the example of the three Maffett brothers who left Leggygowan for America, the first in , followed by a further two brothers in .It is one of their descendants, David Moffett, who has made this precious community asset possible.Saintfield Development Association officials, who played a lead role in securing the new community centre, approached the owners of the Windmill Road field and began protracted negotiations to secure the site, with the all-important funding to acquire the land obtained through Mr Moffettrsquos generous donation.A successful business executive with a well-known company in America, his family had links with the area dating back to the early th century, with Mr Moffettrsquos ancestral, family including James and Isabella Maffett and their children, buried in the graveyard at Saintfield Parish Church.Explaining the background to the heritage park proposal, a spokesman for the Development Association explained that a successful funding bid was submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund for money to carry out necessary feasibility studies on the field.ldquoThese studies have since been completed to the satisfaction of the funder and have shown that there are no impediments for the field to be developed as a community heritage park, he explained.ldquoThese studies will also provide evidence for the necessary planning application for the change of use of the field from agricultural to community use.The spokesman also confirmed that consultants who carried out the feasibility studies of the field also compiled a list of proposals for the development which include measures to obviate as much as possible any disruption or annoyance to neighbouring residents through noise or anti-social behaviour.Public consultation on the proposals will be undertaken once the current pandemic restrictions are sufficiently eased and, following this process, the Development Association intends to raise the funds needed to implement the agreed proposals by applying for suitable grants.There will also be community fundraising.In addition, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has been asked to approve a new link being created between the community centre and proposed heritage park. The issue was under discussion prior to the coronavirus pandemic.Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess has praised all those involved in the project and hopes that the remaining pieces in the development jigsaw fall into place.ldquoThis is a terric development that not only local people can enjoy, but one which visitors to the town can also enjoy and learn so much about Saintfield and its people, he said.ldquoWe are fortunate to have the new community centre up and running and developing a new heritage park would represent further success for the town. Great credit must go Saintfield Heritage Society and townrsquos hardworking Development Association.Cllr Burgess added Saintfield was ldquovery fortunate to have extremely committed community iniduals who have the town and its people very much at heart.Full details of the proposes heritage park proposal are available at discoversaintfield..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Butler look after royalty and presidents  ","story":"FRANCIS McBriar has been a butler to four generations of the Royal Family, served US and Irish presidents and Northern Ireland Secretaries of State.However, he has only one mantra in his mind every time he dons his smart unorm mdash and that is he treats everyone the same.The farmerrsquos son who lives just outside Saintfield with his we Heather has butlered for  years. For those in the know, hersquos the man to reach out foryou have a special occasion or dinner event coming up.Regularly employed by the Earl of Erne at his Fermanagh residence, Crom Castle, Francis was recently featured doing what he does best in the RTE food series, Lords and Ladles.The  year-old was introduced to Hillsborough Castle, the Royal Familyrsquos official residence when they are in Northern Ireland, by the castlersquos late and highly regarded former house manager, David Anderson.ldquoI wouldnrsquot be where I am today without David Anderson, itrsquos as simple as that, said Francis.ldquoWe met through First Saintfield Church which David joined when he moved into the area. We were part of a group looking after senior people of the congregation and we would have worked together hosting dinners and bus outings and so on.ldquoOne day David turned to me and said, lsquoFrancis you are a very adaptable person, you could be a great help to meyou would like to bersquo.ldquoI was invited up to Hillsborough Castle to work with him and things just took off from there. I enjoy working with people and always went out with the intention of helping others and to make sure that they enjoyed their day, or their dinner. I also always found it easy to chat away to people.At that time, Francis was working as a distribution manager for a group of fashion shops and was the father of three young children with no thoughts of a future career in butlering.Today, he works mostly at Crom Castle and, closer to home, at Montalto House in Ballynahinch, but also looks after an American family when they travel to the British Isles.They take Francis wherever they go, sometimes to the Scottish Highlands and hopefully inSeptember to their Dorset property.ldquoIrsquom hoping that it still happens, admits Francis, whose work, like many others, has been affected by the Covid- pandemic.ldquoI really enjoy it and I love to travel. It doesnrsquot bother me being away from home for maybe several weeks at a time. My family are grown up with families of their own and I think my we is quite content to see me going out and about as she gets her head showered.He and Heather have three children, Robert, Anita and James, and a grandchild, George, who will be one year old soon. A second grandchild is due any day now.Having, in his words, ldquolooked after the late Queen Mother, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, their children and Prince Charlesrsquo children, the likes of President Bush, Irish presidents Mary McAleese and Michael D Higgins, Francis admits his disappointment at missing out on meeting Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge.He said: ldquoItrsquos been lovely to look after the Royal Family and a few years ago I was invited up to look after Prince William. I was so looking forward to looking after the couple but unfortunately that was the day the Duchess announced she was pregnant with Prince Louis and couldnrsquot fly over. So I missed that opportunity and would have loved to have met Kate.He believes that having served royalty, he can serve anyone and his nerve has never let him down so far.ldquoI think perhaps once you have attended to the people at Hillsborough Castle, it takes any nerves away, said Francis. ldquoYou think wellI can serve the Queen, then I can serve anyone. No-one is better than anyone  in my eyes. I just go in and do my best for whoever Irsquom looking after.For most people, the role of butler is quite rare today but in the days of stately and larger homes a bulter was the head male servant in a large household and his job was to manage the work of all the other servants.Francis agrees that his role is similar to that of the most famous butler in recent times, Carson, from the hit TV series and movie, Downton Abbey.ldquoThe whole point of being a butler is be unobtrusive but close at hand in the backgroundyou are needed. You need to judge when not to overstay your welcome when you are at the table.ldquoWhat happens there, stays there. I suppose I have developed a reputation for being discreet and I try to be. I would never tell others the conversations I hear around the table. As far as Irsquom concerned, everything is private.ldquoI treat everyone the same, no matter what their position in le, These people are paying my wages. I believe that nobody is better than anyone . If they are there at the table, then Irsquom there to look after them.Unlike Carson, who had to extract Lady Mary out of a number of compromising situations, Francis has never come across anyone who was the worst for wear for drink or found in an embarrassing situation.ldquoI must admit that in the circles I would be in, Irsquove never come across anyone over-indulging. My job is really to be able to turn my hand to anything and to look after people. The butler is really in charge of the household. When I go to work at Crom Castle, the Earl tells me lsquoFrancis, yoursquore in charge, itrsquos over to yoursquo.Working with some of the best chefs around, Francis admits that hersquos been treated to some delicious dining experiences through his work.ldquoI honestly donrsquot see what I do as work.

It must seek to bind together the town centre with the outlying housing developments and consequently look to improve the economic and social wellbeing of the local community.Cllr Curran agreed that the Irish Street site offered a ldquounique opportunity for the development of business, employment and tourism.He thanked council committees and Department for Infrastructure for supporting the project.He said: ldquoThe Irish Street project represents the single biggest change to the town centre in a generation. It has the potential to transform Downpatrick and itrsquos vital everyone works together to make the regeneration proposal a major success.ldquoThe planned redevelopment is one of the most important projects ever proposed for Downpatrick and it is vital to make the most of the opportunities it presents.

However,we use DNA technology to catch dog owners who allow their pets to foul public areas, their identity will be made publicthey end up in court, he continued.ldquoDog fouling problem is a highly contentious issue and, without doubt, one of the single most complained about problems across our district. It is something that we have not yet to got to grips with, but perhaps the new initiative under consideration will change that.Cllr Walker said it was important to remember that the overwhelming majority of dog owners across the district cleaned up after their pets, but there was a hardcore who did not.He added: ldquoWe have talked about this issue for years and the problem has not diminished in any way. People are looking to politicians and the council for leadership and it is vital that we do everything we can to address this problem.Another Rowallane councillor, Kathryn Owen, has welcomed agreement to pursue the DNA issue, explaining that while this particular suggestion had been been brought to the council many times in the past, it was always rejected.She said that going down the route of DNA testing would remove the need for CCTV cameras to be erected to capture video evidence or the need for witness statements to nab offenders.Cllr Owen said that despite the refusal to examine DNA testing in the past, there is now a ldquochange in tone and acceptance to explore this particular option.She added: ldquoI was delighted to support this course of action proposed by Cllr Patrick Brown as something drastic needs to be done.ldquoIt is a terrible shame that it has come to this.

to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than , visitors.Hundreds of people took part in marches in  to oppose the dam.NRW released its draft Outline Business Case in February  and a consultation period with the local community took place.Hundreds of people attended a meeting in February to oppose the dam and they wrote to NRW, with their views, during the coronavirus lockdown.Chairman of Save Dinas Powys Woods  Protect Homes From Flooding, Peter Smith said the group welcomed the announcement that NRW will not develop a dam in the Dinas Powys Woods.ldquoLocal people recognise the flood risk in the village, but are overwhelmingly in favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally unfriendly dam, Dr Smith said.ldquoOur proposals will slow the flow of the rivers upstream thus reducing the risk of flash flooding, and by removing obstacles improve flow downstream.ldquoWe now look forward to working with NRW and The Woodland Trust to design an effective NFM scheme.ldquoBoth have expertise in this area, and, having made funds available for NFM projects, we know that the Welsh Government is keen for Wales to become an exemplar of good practice. community involvement and support will remain key features of our campaign.He added: ldquoWe are grateful to people far and wide who have supported our campaign, including the Woodland Trust, our local community councils, and county councillors.ldquoWe extend our particular thanks our local MS, Jane Hutt, for her advocacy and support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and towards Barry, he said.ldquoThe public has said that the NRW must improve monitoring of flows on the Cadoxton River, implement natural flood management measures and improve flow at Cardf Road bridge where the stream passes under the A to reduce flood risk.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquolsquoFollowing our meeting on May  Sir David Henshaw chairman of NRW wrote to me on May  to say that NRW received almost  responses to our consultation on the Outline Business Case with the vast majority being opposed to the upstream storage option on the Cadoxton Brook.NRW chairman, Sir Henshaw said: ldquoWhen

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females. Signicant dferences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Despite the fact she admits she hated running, she decided to undertake a huge challenge when the lockdown started – km in  days.The -year-old wanted to do something to motivate herself, improve her emotional wellbeing and remind people that the service centre was still there for children even during the lockdown. Importantly, it would also raise much needed funds for NSPCC Northern Ireland’s Childhood Day.The service centre where Michelle works, is based at Carn Drive in Craigavon and delivers NSPCC’s Letting The Future In and Turn the Page services.Letting the Future In focuses on helping children and young people recover from the traumatic and negative effects of sexual abuse and to rebuild their lives, while Turn the Page helps children and young people overcome the experiences and feelings that have led tothem displaying harmful sexual behaviour towards others. Covid- has caused huge dficulties for the team in Craigavon because it is vital to maintain contact and the all-important relationship between the treatment workers and the young people but face-to-face contact wasn’t possible because of the lockdown. The centre has adapted to the situation by keeping in touch with appropriate apps and video calls which offer young people an opportunity to access support in their own environment but still maintain relationships with their workers.Michelle also has her own personal reasons for wanting to raise funds for NSPCC Northern Ireland.She said: “As a survivor of sexual abuse myself, I realise that the lockdown is a particularly dficult time because it can trigger traumas from the past such as the feelings of powerlessness, fear of threat to le and being ‘held captive’ by the virus through isolation and reduced connection to other people.“It can be hard to get motivated during such strange times so I decided to do something positive that would improve my overall emotional wellbeing whilst also raising money for NSPCC Northern Ireland and creating awareness of some of the work we do.“As a child I benefited from support from The NSPCC at a time when no one  believed in me and this has given me a real passion for the work I do now. It is so important that children who have been affected by child sexual abuse get all the help and support they need to help them recover and I can see that the staff at NSPCC still carry the same belief that children can and do survive the trauma of sexual abuse.”Michelle’s event has been a huge success.She said: “I have to admit, it has been tougher than I thought initially. As someone who hates running and has done very little, I think I underestimated it! However I have noticed a big improvement in my emotional wellbeing and sleep since beginning the challenge. I have definitely felt motivated by the support and all the generous donations and this has really spurred me on.“Above all, I just wanted to give something back to NSPCC as I believe I wouldn’t be where I am today without their support in the past. I also wanted to raise awareness about the taboo in our society surrounding sexual abuse and topromote our belief that children can and do recover with the right support.“Joanne McMaster, Supporter Fundraising Manager for Northern Ireland, added: “We are hugely grateful to Michelle for undertaking this wonderful fundraising initiative for NSPCC’s Childhood Day. “This is NSPCC Northern Ireland’s third Childhood Day and is taking place on June  and in the run up to the day, we are asking peopleto stand with us and support our work - there are lots of fun and simple ways toget involved. “This year, Childhood Day is encouraging the peopleto ‘Be a big kid’ and raise money to help us be here for children. This could include organising a childhood themed quiz night, getting sponsored to dress up for the day or holding a mini sports day in your back garden but in all cases, remembering to follow the latest social distancing rules. There are lots more ideas on how to get involved and suggestions for fun events on our website www.nspcc.org.uk childhoodday“Funds raised by the day could not come at a better time because we are growing increasingly concerned about the number of children who will experience abuse or neglect due to the impact of coronavirus, with families struggling with lockdown, job losses and school closures. By supporting Childhood Day you are raising awareness and crucial funds to enable us to keep children and young people safe.”If you would like to contribute to Michelle’s fundraising, go to www.justgiving fundraising Michelle-Duffy For further information on how you can get support NSPCC’s Childhood Day, visit www.nspcc.org.uk childhoodday or contact the NSPCC Northern Ireland Team at northernirelandappeals@nspcc.org.uk or   .--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

meeting by Deputy Lord Mayor, Councillor Kyle Savage and was seconded by Councillor Sam Nicholson.It read: “That this Council supports, where possible, our local producers and businesses within the procurement process of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council.“This will complement the current ‘SHOP LOCAL’ initiativesupported by Council and will provide much needed investment to the Council’s area.“We would ask that a report on this matter is brought forward urgently with a view to supporting our local economy.”Addressing the chamber, the Deputy Lord Mayor said as a local farmer he understands the important social and environmental responsibilitiescouncil has.“We as a Council have a responsibility to our producers and our local businesses in our Council area,” said the Deputy Lord Mayor, Councillor Kyle Savage.“I believe that we have a duty of care to our producers in ensuring that they get a fair share of the profit throughout the food chain.“We also need full traceability on all foods that is used within Council property and at Council events and consideration must be given to the environmental impact caused by food miles.”He also called on Council to adopt the shop local initiativeand look at how Council’s procurement regulations can be adapted to help support local food producers and businesses.“Cost is always an issue but we as a Council have to take our environmental responsibilities into account,” said the Deputy Lord Mayor.“For example, this council is currently buying flowers from outside Northern Irelandbut we have a number of large nurseries within our own borough.“We should also bear in mind that that transport and energy costs are major contributesto green house gas emissions.“We need to look at the wording of framework for contracts and to be more proactive in encouraging local companies to apply for contracts.“As a farmer, I can see first hand the pressure that is facing our industry with the AgricultureBill andthe prospectof food imports of chlorinated chicken and hormone beef which are illegal to produce in Northern Ireland.”The motion was adopted by the Chamber and a report on the issues will be brought
