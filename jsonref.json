If you get the injection, your arm may be sore, too, or you might experience a slight fever or aching muscles for a day or two afterwards. Serious side effects with both the jab and nasal spray are extremely rare.HOW WILL MY CHILD BE VACCINATED AGAINST FLU?Most children will be vaccinated at school, but those who have not started yet, or who are in a high-risk group, can also get it from their GP.I\u0027M PREGNANT – IS IT SAFE TO GET THE COVID AND FLU JABS?Yes – both are safe for pregnant women, and it\u0027s important to have both if eligible. There are more risks for you and your pregnancy if you contract Covid-19 without the vaccine, and the flu vaccine will also help protect your unborn baby.If you catch flu when pregnant, you\u0027re at risk from complications such as bronchitis and it could cause your baby to be born prematurely, have a low birth weight and may even lead to stillbirth.If you are pregnant, you can get a free flu vaccine from your GP, pharmacist or through your maternity service.  ◼ To check your eligibility for the flu vaccine and Covid-19 booster vaccine or to find a service, visit nhs.ukwintervaccinations ■ This article is part of a paid-for partnership with the UK Government"},{"url":null,"title":"Philately night fever Bee Gees star Barry Gibb gets honoured stamps native Isle Man","story":"Share this article He added: ‘I was born and bred on the ancient, mystical, magical Isle of Man, and I have very fond memories of growing up there.’The stamps will raise money for music therapy charity Nordoff Robbins at the request of Sir Barry."},{"url":null,"title":"Britains Covid cases coming Notoriously gloomy study admits infections fell 5 week","story":"Covid infection rates fell in all but 10 per cent of English councils during the half-term week, official data today revealed after hopes were raised that cases have peaked for 2021.UK Health and Security Agency (UKHSA) statistics show cases fell in 132 out of 149 local authorities in England in the week ending October 31. North Somerset in the South West — the region where cases have been highest — saw the biggest drop off (35.2 per cent).Meanwhile, separate data from one of the UK\u0027s largest surveillance studies showed Covid cases in the UK fell five per cent in a week. King\u0027s College London scientists who run the research have been saying for months that cases were consistently soaring — despite official numbers painting a more mixed picture. Last week the study found Britain was getting \u0027worryingly close\u0027 to 100,000 symptomatic cases per day, while Government dashboard data found that they were falling to below 40,000.Now the KCL team estimate there were about 89,000 new symptomatic infections every day last week, down on the 93,000 they forecasted the previous week. It marks the first time the surveillance project found a sustained week-on-week fall since before schools went back in September.Professor Tim Spector, the epidemiologist behind the survey, said the country is probably over the \u0027last great peak of Covid\u0027 for the year.The distinguished scientist has softened his stance on the UK\u0027 coronavirus situation after last month pleading for the Government to take a more cautious approach because the country was \u0027really in trouble\u0027. His symptom-tracking study, ran alongside healthtech firm ZOE, relies on people coming forward to report their result, which experts say makes it susceptible to bias.  The ZOE findings are in line with the downward trend reported in the daily Department of Health statistics, which have fallen in 10 of the last 11 days. Scientific advisers told No10 the epidemic could shrink naturally without curbs because of a combination of the booster vaccine rollout and growing natural immunity in children, who triggered an explosion in cases.It comes as ministers are expected to reveal in the coming days that NHS won\u0027t have to get a Covid jab this winter to keep their jobs — one of the measures they were considering to keep the pandemic at bay. But the \u0027no jab, no job\u0027 rule will come into play from April, Whitehall insiders say.Meanwhile, the first at-home antiviral pill used to treat Covid was approved by the UK\u0027s medical regulator.           ‹ Slide me ›    Covid infection rates fell in all but 10 per cent of areas in England during the half-term week, data from the UK Health and Security Agency\u0027s weekly Flu and Covid Surveillance Report shows Share this article"},{"url":null,"title":"UKs Covid vaccine booster drive going right pace stave Plan B scientists claim","story":"Share this articleShe also spoke of problems with the current vaccine rollout, saying: \u0027Local residents are contacting us saying they can\u0027t get the boosters they so desperately need. \u0027One lady in her 70s who has underlying health conditions went to her pharmacy and called 119 just to be told she wasn\u0027t eligible for a booster. \u0027She has now finally got one booked for December but had to rely on her daughter to book the appointment for her because she doesn\u0027t use the internet.

He kept paying the rent as the city’s permitting process dragged on. He bought cabinets and other equipment as he waited. And waited. Sick of waiting, he’s selling all that equipment and giving up his lease. Inaction by the city is forcing him to give up his dream, he says. “It’s killing business owners,” Anderson says. “All the air has been let out of me.” In November 2016, Californians voted to legalize recreational cannabis. But nearly five years later, the state and many of its cities and counties are still figuring out how exactly to regulate the industry. The challenge has been particularly frustrating for Black entrepreneurs like Anderson, who were promised a leg-up getting started, but have seen little movement in that regard. Following regulation, several cities and counties in California created social equity programs to help entrepreneurs in communities most harmed by the war on drugs. Black people have borne the brunt of marijuana criminalization in the US over the past 20 years. They’re nearly four times as likely as white people to be arrested for pot violations, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, even though the two groups use marijuana at roughly the same rate. The equity programs were supposed to help people of color and those formerly incarcerated for cannabis crimes get licensed to run all types of cannabis businesses: cultivation, manufacturing, delivery, retail. The programs created big expectations, but implementation has been much trickier. But Democrats and other voting rights advocates hope that this time is different. They never really expected 10 Republicans to sign on to the bill and advance it. Instead, they hoped to use the vote as a final chance to show the West Virginia senator Joe Manchin and Arizona senator Kyrsten Sinema, two of the staunchest filibuster defenders, that there is no hope of passing a voting rights bill while the filibuster remains in place. It’s a development that significantly escalates pressure on Manchin, specifically. The voting rights bill Republicans blocked in late October was one he personally helped write and sought GOP input on. The measure Republicans blocked on Wednesday, which would have restored a critical provision of the Voting Rights Act, is one he supports. Manchin has said that “inaction is not an option” on voting rights. But now Republicans have made it clear that while the filibuster remains in place, inaction is the only option. So where do things go from here? To start, I think we’ll begin to see a lot more explicit language from Chuck Schumer, the majority leader, about changing the rules of the filibuster. While Schumer has repeatedly said “all options are on the table” when it comes to voting rights, he’s stopped short of outlining specific changes he’d like to see or calling out Manchin and Sinema in particular. Schumer has only recently begun talking about the need “to restore the Senate as the world’s greatest deliberative body”. I expect we’ll also see some increased pressure from the White House. Schumer continued that rhetoric on Wednesday after the filibuster. He described it as a “low, low point” in the history of the Senate, and questioned whether some of Congress’s greatest legislative accomplishments would have been able to overcome the filibuster if they had been proposed in today’s Senate.  A congressional aide familiar with the probe shared the information with Reuters.  The most recent filibuster came on Wednesday, when Republicans blocked a bill that would have restored a key part of the Voting Rights Act that required states with repeated evidence of voting discrimination, including Texas, to pre-clear voting laws with the federal government before they go into effect. Nineteen states have passed 33 laws this year restricting voting access, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. This is the second major voting rights suit Biden’s Justice Department has filed this year. It sued Georgia over its sweeping new voting restrictions in June. “Prohibiting assistors from answering voters’ questions, responding to requests to clarify ballot translations, and confirming that voters with visual impairments have marked a ballot as intended will curtail fundamental voting rights without advancing any legitimate state interest,” DoJ lawyers wrote in their complaint. “Conditioning the right to cast a mail ballot on a voter’s ability to recall and recite the identification number provided on an application for voter registration months or years before will curtail fundamental voting rights without advancing any legitimate state interest,” the complaint says.The suit takes aim at two specific provisions in the Texas law that deal with providing assistance to voters at the polls and mail-in voting, respectively. The first measure restricts the kind of assistance people can provide at the polls to voters, blocking them from explaining how voting works or breaking down complex language on the ballot. That violates a provision of the Voting Rights Act that guarantees that anyone who requires assistance because of “blindness, disability, or inability to read or write” can receive assistance, the justice department said.  The complaint targets a second provision that requires voters to provide identification information on mail-in ballot applications as well as the ballot return envelopes. The new Texas law says that election workers have to reject the ballots if there are discrepancies in the identification provided. The Justice Department said that violates a provision of the 1964 Civil Rights Act that says someone can’t be blocked from voting because of an error on a paper or record that is unrelated to their qualifications under state law to vote. “Laws that impair eligible citizens’ access to the ballot box have no place in our democracy. Texas Senate Bill 1’s restrictions on voter assistance at the polls and on which absentee ballots cast by eligible voters can be accepted by election officials are unlawful and indefensible,” Kristen Clarke, the head of the Department’s Civil Rights Division, said in a statement announcing the suit.Igor Danchenko now faces charges as part of the investigation by John Durham, the special counsel appointed by the Trump administration to examine the origins of the FBI’s investigation into links between the Trump campaign and Russia. Danchenko collected much of the intelligence behind Steele’s dossier during three trips to Russia in summer and autumn 2016. He was the chief source behind its most incendiary allegation: that Trump was compromised during a trip to Moscow in November 2013 for the Miss Universe beauty pageant. Trump has vehemently denied the claim. Last summer, however, a report by the Senate intelligence committee said that the FSB spy agency presided over a network of secret cameras inside the Ritz-Carlton hotel where Trump stayed, including in guest bedrooms. An FSB intelligence officer was permanently on site, it said. The five-page indictment released on Thursday accuses Danchenko of lying repeatedly to the FBI when interviewed in 2017 – a criminal offense. These include over his dealings with an unnamed US PR executive with close links to the Democrats. The executive’s information found its way into some of the dossier’s memos, a fact Danchenko allegedly concealed. Here’s where the day stands so far: Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned.“I blew it,” Patrick Murray, director of the independent Monmouth University Polling Institute, which is based in New Jersey, writes in a new op-ed, published by NJ. “The final Monmouth University Poll margin did not provide an accurate picture of the state of the governor’s race. So, if you are a Republican who believes the polls cost Ciattarelli an upset victory or a Democrat who feels we lulled your base into complacency, feel free to vent. I hear you. “I owe an apology to Jack Ciattarelli’s campaign — and to Phil Murphy’s campaign for that matter — because inaccurate public polling can have an impact on fundraising and voter mobilization efforts. But most of all I owe an apology to the voters of New Jersey for information that was at the very least misleading.” Since 2016, when polling largely failed to forecast the election of Donald Trump, pollsters and reporters have been grappling with questions about the accuracy of polling and the amount of faith the public, campaigns and the media should place in them. That uncertainty, Murray says, has led some organizations like Pew and Gallup to stop conducting election polling altogether. He wonders the same. “If we cannot be certain that these polling misses are anomalies then we have a responsibility to consider whether releasing horse race numbers in close proximity to an election is making a positive or negative contribution to the political discourse,” he writes.  “Most public pollsters are committed to making sure our profession counters rather than deepening the pervasive cynicism in our society. We try to hold up a mirror that accurately shows us who we are,” he concludes. “If election polling only serves to feed that cynicism, then it may be time to rethink the value of issuing horse race poll numbers as the electorate prepares to vote.”But the House speaker has not yet given any clear indication as to whether the chamber will vote on one of the bills tonight. Pelosi told reporters earlier today, “I’ll let you know as soon as I wish to.” And now some of the centrist members of the House Democratic caucus are suggesting they would not support a vote on the reconciliation package tonight, per CNN: During his campaign, Virginia gubernatorial candidate Glenn Youngkin warned of the dangers of CRT -- a theory that recognizes how racism has shaped American laws and institutions -- even though it was not taught in the state’s schools. “Republicans are lying. They’re not being honest,” Jean-Pierre said at the daily White House briefing. “They’re not being truthful about where we stand, and they’re cynically trying to use our kids as a political football. They’re talking about our kids when it’s election season, but they won’t vote for them when it matters.” This is the second long-term grand jury in the case, gathered to hear evidence about the financial practices of former president Donald Trump’s business empire, the Trump Organization, and potentially to vote on criminal charges, unnamed sources with knowledge of the matter have told the Washington Post, the paper reported this afternoon. The Post notes that DA Cyrus Vance declined to comment today and the newly-elected (as of this week) Manhattan DA, fellow Democrat Alvin Bragg, had remained mum on the matter while he was campaigning. Vance is due to depart the office at the end of the year.

Photograph: Nick BradshawStudents will be able to view courses ranging from apprenticeships to university degrees for the first time under a revamped CAO website, which goes live at midday today.Minister for Further and Higher Education Simon Harris said the move aims to ensure the full range of third-level options will be visible to school-leavers on a single platform.“This will change the conversation at kitchen tables across the country – one that reflects education is for everyone and there is no right or wrong choice, just different ones,” he said.However, while the CAO will include prominent links to further education and apprenticeships (www.cao.ieoptions), all applications for these courses will continue to be made through the traditional channels. Applications for higher education will be made, as normal, through the CAO.Mr Harris said it was the first of many steps the Government intended take to make the third-level sector more inclusive.“Across the country over the next few months, Leaving Cert students will be considering their next steps in life. We have so many industries offering erse and interesting careers and there are so many ways to get there,” he said.About 70 per cent of school leavers currently progress to higher education, which is one of the highest rates in the world.Skills shortagesThere are concerns among policy makers, however, that not enough students are opting for apprenticeships and further education courses in areas where there are acute skills shortages, such as construction and other sectors.Andrew Brownlee, chief executive of Solas, which oversees further education and training, said the changes represent a significant milestone for the sector given the focal point the CAO holds in the minds of school leavers, parents, teachers and guidance counsellors.“Getting all of these options on the table alongside higher education choices when young people are discussing their next steps after leaving school can only help in making smart, rounded choices based on their skills and interests,” he said.“It is also important that school leavers understand that further education and training, and apprenticeships, present new pathways into higher education.”Meanwhile, potential higher education applicants are advised to read the CAO Handbook, which is available to view and download online (www.cao.iehandbook), to ensure their applications meet all the requirements.CAO communications officer Eileen Keleghan said applicants could practise their application in advance with an online demo application facility available on the website.“It is a good idea to enter some course choices at this stage. However, applicants can log into their account to add, remove or change the order of their courses as many times as they like up to February 1st for no extra charge. There is no reason to delay registering with CAO.”The CAO website goes live at 12pm on Friday.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Government has unveiled its new €125bn climate action plan. Here are the main points across five key areas.ElectricityAn increase in renewable electricity, wind and solar, up to 80 per cent by 2030. This will entail investment of tens of billions of euro.To deal with the challenge to targets posed by data centres, the government will review its strategy on data centres to “ensure that growth of such users can only happen in alignment with our sectoral emissions ceilings and renewable energy targets.”A new offshore renewable energy plan will be completed to quantify the offshore renewable energy potential in Ireland’s maritime area. The development of carbon capture and storage by 2030 - which takes carbon out of the atmosphere - could remove further emissions from the system. The Government says it will develop a policy framework and roadmap for its use. A support scheme for micro-generation allowing homeowners to generate their own electricity and sell what they don’t use back to the national grid.A separate small scale generator scheme for farmers, business and communities to generate electricity and sell to the grid.Overall plan is to reduce emissions from electricity by 62 - 81 per cent from 2018 levels.The plan also commits to delivering three new transmission grid connections or interconnectors to Northern Ireland, Great Britain, and the EU.It also commits to completing the phase-out of coal and peat-fired electricity generation.HomesA cornerstone of the plan will involve finding ways to meet the target of retrofitting 500,000 homes and will see citizens offered a new low cost loan scheme to retrofit their homes with new tax incentives also on the cards.A new National Retrofit Plan which will involve a new Residential Retrofit Low-cost Loan Scheme .Blending low-cost loans with SEAI grants to make retrofit affordable.Opening three more training centres for retrofit upskilling.Introducing a programme to decarbonise the heating and cooling sectors by 2050.Phasing out use of fossil fuels for space and water heating in all new buildings.Promoting the use of electric heat pump or other low carbon technology in new and existing residential and commercial buildings.Completing 500,000 residential retrofits to achieve a B2 BERcost optimal equivalent or carbon equivalent.Installing 600,000 heat pumps in residential buildings (of which 400,000 to be installed in existing buildings).TransportTransport accounts for approximately 20 per cent of Ireland’s greenhouse gas emissions. The transport sector has been the fastest growing source of GHG emissions, showing a 100 per cent increase between 1990 and 2020. The plan commits to:Enabling 500,000 daily sustainable travel journeys by 2030 through major public transport projects such as BusConnects and Connecting Ireland.The expansion of rail services and cycling and walking infrastructure.Increasing the use of biofuels in transport.Expanding electrification of bus and rail fleets with 1,500 electric buses by 2030.Increasing the number of EVs to circa 1 million by 2030.Updating the public transport and public fleets to low emission alternatives.The aim here is for a 42-50 per cent reduction in emissions.AgricultureAgriculture represents the largest source of emissions, or some 37.1 per cent of total national emissions in 2020.Significantly reduce chemical nitrogen fertiliser use to 325,000 tonnes per annum.Improve animal breeding and feeding.Increase organically farmed land almost five-fold to 350,000 hectares.“Manage” emissions from the dairy herd and transform the model of beef production.Overall the aim is reduce emissions by between 22 per cent and 30 per cent by 2030.In terms of land use the plan is to:Increase afforestation with a new forestry programme to launch in 2023.EnterpriseThe report warns that companies and sectors that fail to decarbonise will become increasingly uncompetitive. The biggest share of enterprise emissions comes from a small number of large companies in the manufacturing sector, mostly in alumina, food processing, beverages and cement. The plan commits to launching an online Climate Toolkit 4 Business which will include a simple carbon calculator and will generate a tailored company climate action plan for each business. The IDA will seek to attract businesses to invest in decarbonisation technologies. The plan commits to facilitating the use of alternative fuels and non-recyclable wastes in cement kilns. It also says the Government will develop corporate climate action plans with key clients for their Irish sites.The aim here is to reduce emissions by between 29 per cent and 41 per cent."},{"url":null,"title":"climate action plan readers respond to coalition agenda","story":"‘I had already started some zero-waste practices, like   doing more recycling.’ File photograph: Getty Even with the world’s eyes on Cop26 and the promises of what nations can deliver to drive down global carbon emissions, the onus on personal responsibility remains strong. In Ireland, as the Government publishes sweeping plans to do its part, there is still room for the all important inidual action.From scraping together enough money for electric car upgrades to cladding our homes with modern insulation, we asked our readers what they might have to do or already have.Here are some of the responses we received. Some entries have been edited for length.“Never visiting the petrol station again is a relief to my pocket as well as my conscience.” – M McMahonI have not taken a flight in over three years. I bought an electric car and find the high cost of purchase is offset against the very low running costs. I have changed my electricity supplier to 100 per cent renewable. I recycle and make my own compost. I plant pollinator friendly plants in my garden and use long-life energy bulbs and switch off as much as possible, leaving no pilot lights on. I buy very little meat, eating mostly plant-based foods and fish.I am willing to do whatever it takes to ensure that this planet is handed to the following generations in a healthy state. I believe that the struggle against climate warming should be on a war footing, to focus minds on what needs to be done. The commitment and ingenuity of the next generation is a source of hope but leadership from their elders must come first.“If we all start to make changes in our lives, soon companies will follow where consumers lead them.” – Susanna DowlingLiving in Sydney in 2019 I got a sense of what the future may hold for us. The crippling years-long drought followed by a devastating bush-fire season turned the country into a smouldering wasteland. We drove from Sydney to Melbourne at Christmas, driving through smoke for seven hours. The previously lush green landscape was dried and burned.I looked at what I could do to play my part in doing less to contribute to climate change. The number one thing an inidual can do is to eat less meat and dairy, so our family switched to a plant-based diet. Once we got over the initial adjustments we now find it easier and cheaper to eat this way. I had already started some zero-waste practices which I upped, doing more recycling, composting and donating and creating minimal landfill waste – our waste is now a quarter of what it used to be.We made the decision to come back to Ireland so that we could reduce the flying involved with living on the other side of the world. Ultimately, I believe that we can have a smaller carbon footprint here. In the future our goal is to get all our energy and heating from renewable sources and the next car we buy will be electric. It’s going to take all of us to turn this ship around.“For short journeys we use our bikes.” – Jean SwiftOver the years we have insulated the house on the interior, and later we had a complete external wrap. About 2015 we changed our boiler for a more modern gas boiler. In 2017 we had PVC panels installed and in 2018 we bought an electric car to replace a 14-year-old BMW.We have done everything possible to minimise our carbon use in the house. I am very disappointed and indeed angry that the Government’s plan is so lacking in ambition. It is saying to the voter: don’t worry your head, we will do all the work and you won’t be inconvenienced and in any case it’s all for tomorrow. I am fed up listening to the Government saying there will be a shortfall in 2022 but we will make up for it in later years.I propose a few simple starting points from next January: ban all private vehicles inside the canals in Dublin and tax private parking lots including those attached to business offices within city limits. These simple measures would call for leadership and courage, leadership we unfortunately lack.“My retrofit was funded via savings, mortgage and SEAI grants.” – Pauline Conway\u0026nbspObviously governments and the private sector have to fulfil their major responsibilities in combating climate change and do the heavy lifting. In 2011-2012 I refitted my 1960 semi-detached house to NZEB, A3 BER standard.It was the first Irish retrofit to meet the standards of the German Passive House Institute. I’m now planning to replace the small gas back-up boiler with a heat pump and to change my water heating solar panel to enable micro-generation. To achieve the Government’s Climate Action Plan targets, making private retrofits more affordable and accessible, and providing large scale retrofit funding for local authority, social and rental housing is essential.“For several years I have been aware of the personal benefits of improving my home.” – Kieran WalshHaving limited resources for what I thought would be a large task, I kept putting the idea on the (very) long finger. I have been assisting a family member putting external insulation on his house. I am impressed by the system used by the contractor and his efficiency. The benefits are already apparent, even before the contract is complete.On the other hand I have a comprehensive description of an upgrade to a smallish house which included external insulation and the installation of an air-to-water heating system. I have serious doubts about the potential of the heating system and consider the total dependence on public service electricity and its ever-creeping costs to be an unproven concept. To receive the available grants, the householder had to remove all chimneys. That is very questionable. My research will continue, particularly in the light of upcoming Dáil proposals for grants and loans.“If the Climate Action Plan is to succeed grant levels must be reviewed.” – Patrick O’SullivanWe had planned a large retrofit but when we had our property examined we found prices were crazy. Even with SEAI grants the total was approximately €58,000 and our home is in good condition. The SEAI grant is approximately €6,100. Low-cost loans are not a benefit it’s still an amount that has to be repaid.“It is difficult to go beyond a certain level as an inidual. It requires bigger steps to be taken at local and national government levels.” – WillWe have cut back on plastics and cut out single use items. We cycle more to avoid car use and take the train whenever possible. It is up the chain where changes are needed though. Plastic wrapping in supermarkets needs to be banned. Plastic bottles should all be returned and re used. Public transport needs to be made free (or for minimal charges) and car parks need to be built at train stations, and congestion charges in cities introduced.“We have an area of our garden left to grow wild as an ‘ark’ though I do fear the neighbours think we’re just lazy!” – Susan We are now a two-electric vehicle household. We have solar panels installed and got new windows and insulation on our home. We have cut back on our red meat intake hugely and eat vegetarian meals a couple of times each week. I’ve started shopping in a zero waste shop, buy all my fruit and veg in the greengrocers (no plastic waste) and we recycle as much as we can. I use palm-free soap rather than shower gels and try to avoid products with unnecessary packaging. I line dry most clothes and only use the tumble dryer for towels (or emergencies!).“Holiday at home for the next five years so the domestic tourist market can develop and flourish.” – Tom McElligottEven though I don’t believe iniduals can mitigate much against climate change in the absence of industrial and government policy, we can change the mood music, particularly for our kids’ sake. First off only buy the food you will eat every week. Second, limit car journeys and cycle instead. Last but not least become a digital subscriber to every periodical that you read. There is simply no excuse for printed material that ends up in a recycling bin that most likely will cause even more carbon pollution when it can be read online.“It seems to me the debate over climate has focused on getting everyone to ‘do their bit’ but the reality is that those who emit the most are doing the least.” – Mia GallagherI have been reducing plastic, meat, fish and petrol consumption steadily over the last four years. Appalled by David Attenborough’s documentary on ocean plastic, I started off buying as much loose food as possible, then began making my own cosmetics (ridiculously easy), and I now buy next to nothing in plastic wrapping. One thing led to another.I reduced driving to one day a week max – sometimes on rare occasions twice – and now cycle pretty much everywhere.

Photograph: The  The shift in tone is obvious: this is not the Government’s reaction to a distant threat, it’s the national response to human-influenced “climate breakdown” already derailing the planet that risks imminent catastrophe.It is full of bold actions. Ireland is to become “a leader in electrifying transport in the EU”, all new fleet purchases in the public sector to be zero-emission vehicles, no new fossil-fuel heating systems to be installed from 2023 in public buildings, a mass retrofitting programme of 500,000 homes. History suggests all this will again fall short as we continue to be among countries with the highest per-capita carbon emissions in the world, yet the level of detail provides some assurance that a course for decarbonisation over coming decades is finally set out.It’s more than double the ambition of the 2019 climate action plan drawn up by former Fine Gael minister for the environment Richard Bruton the first government plan of substance after a lost decade in addressing what was clearly an unfolding crisis. Critically, the kind of cross-party consensus needed to begin transforming not only the economy but also society had emerged through a landmark Oireachtas climate committee report.EnhancementsThe new plan has obvious enhancements with more rigorous targets tied into what the science is indicating and much more detail on how they will be achieved. The overriding driver of action is the 2030 target of halving emissions in line with seeking to contain global temperature rise to within 1.5 degrees. Electrification will be the great workhorse, though associated grid infrastructure is urgently needed.The €125 billion package behind it was apparently the main stumbling block among Coalition parties. The climate imperative demands this kind of spending – and more. There will be considerable upfront costs for the current generation but it is the quickest route to sustainable prosperity.Until legally-adopted sectoral ceilings are put in place under the carbon budget process, “indicative reduction ranges” on emission cuts are applied. Analysis by Hannah Daly of MaREI energy institute in UCC indicates only the upper end of all sectoral ranges would get us to 51 per cent.There are obvious blockages to progress too, which if not addressed will impair momentum and exacerbate risk associated with justifiable backloading big emission reductions towards the end of the decade. The standout areas requiring most attention are:Transport: A radical shift to public and active travel (cycling and walking) within a nine-year period is probably the biggest ask because of the level of embedded car use with poor public transport in most areas outside of major cities. The shift to EVs has begun but the high cost of vehicles and poor charging infrastructure make a target of a million by 2030 extremely challenging.Agriculture: Farming is about to undergo immense changes because of the need to halve levels of methane globally by 2050. This requires no less than a complete rebalancing of agriculture – and land use – whereby farmer holdings capture carbon through forestry, exploit bioenergy through routine use of anaerobic digesters, enhance bioersity and, most of all, have the most sustainable dairy and beef production systems in the world. A 22-30 per cent emissions cut being applied by the plan confirms direction of travel. The most reliable science indicates this cannot be done without a global shift towards plant-based diets. Based on current technological solutions, it cannot be done in Ireland without reducing livestock numbers. If the transition is supported at every turn – arguably the biggest task of the new climate justice commission – and with unprecedented innovation, it is achievable. Increased viability of family farms will be the long-term reward.Planning shortcomings: The planning system is not fit for purpose in rolling out major infrastructure in a timely manner – especially renewable-energy technology, upon which the report is heavily reliant. Confirmation that Norwegian company Equinor, one of the world’s leading energy companies, is pulling out of the Irish market over concerns about the regulatory and planning regime will undermine confidence in the renewables sector. Huge private capital – essential to achieving ambitious targets – needs certainty and reasonable timelines.Doing the right thing: Going green in Ireland is frequently a lot harder than in many other countries, whether embracing EVs, deep retrofitting a house or switching to public transport. Compounding matters are affordability issues, whereby the sustainable option is often more costly, and bureaucracy all too often undermines missionary zeal.There is no sugar-coating the appalling vista looming this century. The science has provided shocking clarity: based on current emissions we are facing an average 2.7 degree rise in coming decades, making for a planet incessantly hostile to human life. The latest scientific verdicts on this issued at Cop26 confirm that view.Government pledgeSo what has been promised by the Government in this latest climate plan is probably not enough to help avoid that unfolding scenario. There is not enough concerted effort to force down emissions quickly while getting off fossil fuels, insufficient funding and targeting of supports to make it all happen and not enough communication – with honesty – to a worried public. That it is still all achievable together and reassurance we are not about to go over a cliff in 2050.That does not mean the plan is fundamentally flawed it is a roadmap for climate action at scale. But nothing less than full implementation, relentless focus on delivery of targets across all sectors, having learned the lessons of past dismal failures, is required after systemic blockages are cleared. Increasing ambition further through annual climate plans will be essential to bridge gaps.If in 2030 Irish emissions are halved and we are on our way to achieving net-zero by 2050 at the latest, having fully embraced carbon budgets and the discipline they impose, and follow this plan, then we will be regarded as a people who did their bit in fixing the planet."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: Young protesters in Glasgow for Cop26 will have much to fight againstStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"households and private sector to bear most of climate action plan cost","story":"Tánaiste Leo Varadkar, Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Minister for Climate Change and Transport Eamon Ryan at the publication of the Climate Action Plan at Government Buildings in Dublin on Thursday. Photograph: Julian BehalPA WireMost of the massive €125 billion cost of the new Climate Action Plan will be borne by private iniduals, households and the private sector and not by the State, the three Coalition leaders have confirmed.The far-reaching and radical plan, published on Thursday, sets out 475 separate actions to halve Ireland’s greenhouse emissions by 2030, including extensive offshore wind power, retrofitting 500,000 homes and putting a million electric vehicles (EVs) on Irish roads.At a press conference in Government Buildings, Taoiseach Micheál Martin predicted it would require people to accede to “a profound change” in lifestyle over the coming decade. He said it would mean adaptations to homes and that workplaces and communities must all adapt and change. However, he added that if successful it would benefit this generation, and future generations, of Irish people.However, Mr Martin, and the other two party leaders in the Coalition, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar and Minister for Climate Change and Transport Eamon Ryan, emphasised that the bulk of the funding would come from business and from the pockets of iniduals and households. They insisted it would involve spending that would happen in any instance but it would now be repurposed because of the plan.Grid upgradesHe said that the largest portion of public finance would be spent by the ESB and EirGrid in upgrading the grid. He also said that the National Development Plan published last month had committed €35 billion of public money to transport and almost €13 billion to climate change during this decade.Mr Martin said that with EVs, most of that cost would be borne by the motorist though there would be grants and some supports. “Likewise, with retrofitting there will be a balance between grants and support from the State balanced with some private-sector funding,” he said. No details have been outlined as yet of future grants. Mr Varadkar said the previous government had considered introducing a scrappage scheme to encourage people to buy EVs. He said no such scheme was included in this plan but it might be considered in future. He said nobody was going to “coerce” people to buy EVs and retrofit homes but the plan would put the “right incentives and disincentives” in place to tip the balance in favour of those decisions.The Green Party leader accepted that transport’s aim of having a million EVs on the road by 2030, made it the sector that would find it hardest to meet its targets.National herdThe 200-page plan outlines ambitious targets for energy, electricity, transport and the built environment but modest cuts for agriculture (between 22 per cent and 30 per cent). The primary focus in that sector will be a sharp reduction in the use of chemical fertilisers and an increase in organic farming. There are no specific proposals for how the national herd will be stabilised.Mr Martin said there was “an obsession with the issue of the herd”. He said food production was important and argued “agriculture would play its part in terms of the reduction of emissions”.Sinn Féin described the plan as high on rhetoric and short on detail and would place unfair burdens on ordinary people. Its spokesman on climate, Darren O’Rourke, said the party supported the Climate Action Bill and carbon budgets but in a way “that is fair and which has social justice at its heart”. The party has opposed all increases in carbon tax since 2019.The Environmental Pillar spokeswoman Karen Ciesielski said if the Government met only the lower range in each sector, it would not achieve the 51 per cent cut by 2030. However, she added: “There are definite welcome developments including the promotion of organic farming, the proposed drop in nitrogen fertiliser and proposals for the circular economy.”"},{"url":null,"title":"midlands bogs to be restored as part of climate strategy","story":"The largest plan in the history of the State to restore thousands of acres of bogland in the midlands will form a core element of the Government’s strategy to cut the State’s carbon emissions in half by 2030.Once restored, the lands will include peat-forming bogs and a mosaic of wetlands, grasslands and native woodlands, enhancing bioersity and contributing to the target of making Ireland carbon neutral by 2050.The plan will be backed by €108 million from the State and €18 million from Bord na Móna, and the lands will be restored using a wide array of engineering and ecology works to encourage and accelerate natural processes, the climate action plan says.Returning peatlands to a natural state will protect the existing storage of 100 million tonnes worth of carbon, while restoration will ensure that 3.3 million tonnes more of carbon will be stored in the bogs than would otherwise happen.EU backingWork will be begin on restoring 4,400 hectares of protected raised bogs in the midlands, backed by €10 million of European Union funding that will seek to show to local people the benefits to be won from protecting the bogs.A seven-year project will also be launched to engage the community with the benefits of peatland restoration, while a Peatlands Knowledge Centre of Excellence will lay down best practices.Green industries will be encouraged across the midlands, including the creation of renewable energy hubs. Support for biomass and anaerobic digestion in the midlands through the Just Transition Fund is promised, too.Meanwhile, a major effort will be made to encourage opportunities to develop tourism, outdoor and recreation amenities, partly drawing on the region’s green credentials created by the bogs.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics sinn fein a party preparing for government","story":"At Sinn Féin’s ardfheis in Dublin last weekend, a motion in support of the non-jury Special Criminal Court was passed, representing a considerable shift in position and removing a significant hurdle to the party’s ambitions to lead the next government.

All that money, all that tech, all that firepower. But battle scenarios – even in training, with simulated casualties and simunition (paintball tip bullets) – require far more than just force. They need tactical intelligence, psychological strength and supreme fitness levels too. The US Marines Corps who were forced to surrender in the Mojave Desert this week, just days into a training exercise against their British equivalents, now know that all too well. The British commandos who “dominated” them into asking for a “reset” halfway into a five-day war fighting exercise, on the other hand, will be elated at having another feather in their famous cap.I started Royal Marines training at Lympstone in 2005, and nine months later earned my green beret. I’d go on to spend almost six years in the Royal Marines, working in Iraq, Somalia, Egypt and Afghanistan. Training exercises with our US counterparts were fairly regular and they generally ended the same way: with the British coming out on top in just about every area. The US Marines contains some outstanding soldiers and some outstanding regiments (ask anybody from the SAS or SBS and they’ll tell you the elite special forces units in the US military are as good as anybody) but, compared like-for-like, the Royal Marines tended to be fitter, more tactically intelligent and, most importantly, able to push themselves far further than their US Marine counterparts. The first time I experienced a US-UK exchange it was our turn to host, so we took them to Scotland for mountain training, which included a trek up Ben Nevis in full kit. Halfway up, we had to start carrying the Americans’ kit – they just couldn’t handle it. In some ways, the US philosophy is: “Why would we need to walk anywhere when we could just get a helicopter or vehicle?” Well, we haven’t got that luxury, so we train for the worst and make sure we can do it without hardware as backup. A couple of weeks later, it was time for the return trip – we knew they’d try to humiliate us by throwing us in at the deep-end, just as we’d done to them. In Virginia, they duly welcomed us by having us attempt their “E” (endurance) course at the hottest point of the day. Two of our boys instantly broke their all-time record. Later that same day, they put us on their “O” (obstacle) course. Again, one of us broke their record. It wasn’t anywhere near as difficult as what we were used to at home.In that same trip we took them on in a battle situation, much like what happened in the Mojave Desert this week, and cleared a “village” in 14 minutes – which was quicker and more efficient than almost any US military force had done it, leading the American commanders to debrief with our commanding officers to find out how we do things so well. The differences, broadly, are psychological. We are taught to think outside of the box and speak up if there’s a better way of doing things they are taught to follow orders and keep quiet. We are taught that the body will do anything the mind tells it they are taught there’s always a vehicle nearby if you need support. We are taught that you need to go to “the dark place” in training to be ready for anything in the real situation they don’t seem to embody this same capability. And we train for 32 weeks they do 13. The result is that the Royal Marines are not just physically ready for anything, but capable of going anywhere mentally, too. We get to a point where things become instinct, knowing what to do without needing to shout an order or stop and think about it. It makes them quick, ruthless and efficient.This week was just a training session. We don’t know exactly what happened out there in the desert. But take away the kit, the tech, the money and there’s no comparison between the US and UK marines. The US learned that again this week – and the British commandos will be revelling in it.As told to Guy KellyMore from NewsBonfire Night 2021: the story of Guy Fawkes, gunpowder, treason and plotSchoolchildren encouraged ‘rewild’ their neighbourhood for new Duke of Edinburgh-style awardUK’s youngest gun killer, 14, convicted of murdering schoolboy in gang attackDoctor banned from social media in ‘masks do nothing’ row takes his case to High CourtMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britains grey seal population boom man made miracle","story":"Over half term, we took the kids for fish and chips at a restaurant overlooking Brixham harbour. Below us, gambolling about in the slate-coloured waters of the fishing port, were four grey seals: two adults and two adolescent-looking pups.Grey seals are rare enough, globally, to be on the international red list of endangered species. Hunted for centuries for their warm, velvety coats, and culled by fishermen to reduce competition for the catch, their numbers had dwindled to crisis point by the early 20th century. In 1914, by which time there were only 500 left in Britain, they became the first wild mammals ever to be protected by Parliament.Today, there are more than 120,000 grey seals in Britain: almost 40 per cent of the global population. Isn’t that incredible? A piece of legislation passed by men in top hats and starched collars, on the eve of the First World War, has rescued the fortunes of this charismatic species – and led directly to the existence of the four sleek pinnipeds playing in Brixham harbour.Britain has become the most important breeding ground for grey seals in the world. Every year now, from October to January, great stretches of beach in Norfolk, Lincolnshire and the Orkneys are transformed into landscapes of undulating flesh, as thousands of seals haul themselves onto dry land to give birth and mate. The first of this year’s pups were spotted in Blakeney and Horsey this week: soft white crescents of implausible cuteness, rolling and yawning among their giant kin. It’s the kind of exotic spectacle that demands a voiceover by David Attenborough. What a thrill, what a man-made miracle, that it should be happening right here.Those far-sighted Edwardians can’t take all the credit. Subsequent parliamentarians and environmentalists have done much to nurse the grey seal back to health. Cleaner rivers, the ban on harmful PCB chemicals and the introduction of protected breeding areas have all contributed to the ongoing population boom.Throughout my whole Seventies childhood, I never saw anything but jellyfish in the English sea. My parents used to tell me about the seals and dolphins and basking sharks that swam alongside their boat when, in their youth, they sailed around the Scottish islands. But I took these almost for fairytales, they seemed so unlikely.My own children, by contrast, have seen more seals than I can count. We spent much of this summer on a perfectly ordinary sandy beach in Norfolk: buckets and spades, families huddled behind wind-breakers, the smell of deep fat frying carried on the wind. Almost every time we got into the sea, an inquisitive speckled head would pop up nearby. Sometimes two heads, or even three. The children would stop their splashing and gaze in awe at these smiling emissaries from the wild. And then the seals would turn away and vanish back under the waves with a curl of their glossy flanks.It isn’t often, these days, that one can point to something that is better than it used to be. Which makes it all the more important to pay attention to such outliers. The chorus of environmental pessimism that has accompanied the Cop26 talks may be understandable. But those delegates in Glasgow need the impetus of hope, as well as fear. That’s what the grey seal gives us: a story of hope, through legislation.More from NewsBonfire Night 2021: the story of Guy Fawkes, gunpowder, treason and plotSchoolchildren encouraged ‘rewild’ their neighbourhood for new Duke of Edinburgh-style awardUK’s youngest gun killer, 14, convicted of murdering schoolboy in gang attackDoctor banned from social media in ‘masks do nothing’ row takes his case to High CourtMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid cases may have peaked year says kings college london","story":"Covid cases in the UK have peaked for 2021, real-world data from King\u0027s College London (KCL) suggests.Researchers behind the Zoe Covid Study from KCL said there are currently 88,592 new daily symptomatic cases of Covid in the UK on average, according to test data from up to five days ago – down 4.7 per cent from the previous week.But the World Health Organisation warned that, despite the positive data, Europe is on track to see 450,000 deaths by February as it again becomes the epicentre of the pandemic.Countries including Germany, Croatia, Russia and Slovenia have reported record numbers of new cases, while hospitals in Romania and Belarus are on the brink of collapse amid a surge in new Covid admissions. Eastern Europe is being hit hard by a combination of the highly infectious delta variant, lifting restrictions too soon and having low vaccination rates.However, the number of daily new UK cases is showing a clear decline among those 18 and under, with most other age groups showing signs of levelling off – although cases among 55 to 75-year-olds are climbing.Prof Tim Spector, the lead scientist on the study, said: It\u0027s great that we\u0027re finally seeing cases start to come down, and hopefully we\u0027re over the last great peak of Covid in 2021.This is driven in large part by declining cases in children who have been on half-term holidays and by high rates of previous infection, but we\u0027re hopeful that the trend will continue.The Zoe data is always a week ahead of other surveys and is often seen as an early warning signal for Covid incidence in Britain. Prof Spector said booster jabs, coupled with face masks and social distancing in high-risk areas, were our way out of the pandemic.Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said: The suggestion that Covid cases have probably peaked for 2021 is likely to be correct.As was reported in the past few weeks, most but not all of the models for Covid presented to Sage have suggested that the epidemic would peak in late Octoberearly November before declining towards the end of the year.More from NewsBonfire Night 2021: the story of Guy Fawkes, gunpowder, treason and plotSchoolchildren encouraged ‘rewild’ their neighbourhood for new Duke of Edinburgh-style awardUK’s youngest gun killer, 14, convicted of murdering schoolboy in gang attackDoctor banned from social media in ‘masks do nothing’ row takes his case to High CourtMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"dont press paws button tv dogs","story":"A television channel for dogs may conjure visions of Fido sitting down to The Great British Bark Off, Woof Hall and the Canine O’Clock News.But DogTV is launching in the UK as a serious proposition, aimed at alleviating separation anxiety and loneliness for pets left home alone. The channel founder has described it as “HBO for dogs”.It is a timely launch, as workers return to the office and the puppies they bought during lockdown face adjusting to spending time alone in an empty house.The founders of DogTV say that their programming is based on academic research into the animals’ psychological and physiological needs.Shows are classified as “stimulating” or “relaxing”, offering images and sounds catering to dogs’ senses.Prof Nicholas Dodman, a British canine behaviourist and DogTV’s chief scientist, said the programming “is an excellent resource for dog owners to help alleviate some of the behavioural problems that can arise when dogs are left alone.“With numbers of dog owners rising over the pandemic, and owners now returning to work, DogTV helps canines to feel relaxed and comforted until their owners return home.”The channel also has the backing of Victoria Sitwell, a dog trainer who presented the television show It’s Me Or The Dog. She said: “People think that DogTV is a bit of a weird concept at first, but when I tell them the amount of research that has gone into this - that this TV channel can help their dogs while home alone, improve their lives considerably and help with different stresses and anxieties - they get it.”DogTV was founded in Israel in 2009 and launched in the US three years later, before expanding to other countries. It will be available in the UK from Monday via an app on smart TVs, Android and Apple devices.In an interview with Haaretz, the Israeli newspaper, its creator, Ron Levi, explained that his first idea had been to develop a television service for cats. He had a pet cat, Charlie, which he left home alone while he went to work.However, as he conducted more research, Levi realised that dogs were needier animals and his cat probably didn’t care that he was out.“There’s an essential difference between dogs and cats. A cat is not considered a social animal. It doesn’t need human company to feel good. So, despite how I felt when I left Charlie home alone, our research showed that most cat owners have no problem leaving their cats by themselves,” he said. Dogs were unable to watch television properly on old analogue sets - they had a 60Hz frame speed, while dogs see at a frequency of 70-80Hz. However, flat screen TVs have a much faster frame speed.The channel also has special colour contrasts tailored to the fact that dogs have red-green colour blindness.Mr Levi said many pet owners leave the television on all day while they are out to soothe their animals, but this would not help.“A channel like Animal Planet, for instance, is all about animals, but it’s meant for humans. There’s a lot of talking going on. And what happens when there’s a commercial break and the volume goes up? The dog gets stressed. And if you put on CNN and suddenly you hear bombings in Iraq? The dog gets stressed.“Or you put music on MTV - that kind of music isn’t good for a dog. So we decided to create quality content for canines.”Gilad Neumann, chief executive of DogTV said: “For pet parents who are out of the home for extended periods of time, DogTV is a lifesaver. Satisfied customers report less pet drama - less barking and chewed-up furniture, and calmer pets.”Last autumn, the RSPCA warned that its centres were being inundated with unwanted dogs acquired during lockdown, as their owners returned to work and realised that they no longer had time to care for their pets.More from NewsBonfire Night 2021: the story of Guy Fawkes, gunpowder, treason and plotSchoolchildren encouraged ‘rewild’ their neighbourhood for new Duke of Edinburgh-style awardUK’s youngest gun killer, 14, convicted of murdering schoolboy in gang attackDoctor banned from social media in ‘masks do nothing’ row takes his case to High CourtMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"get vaccinated wear face masks take weekly tests joe biden tells","story":"Workers in America have been told to get vaccinated by January 4 or face having to take weekly tests and continue to wear face masks.The plans from Joe Biden, the US president - which cover all healthcare workers and businesses with more than 100 employees - aim to push tens of millions of people into getting Covid-19 vaccines.The new regulations will affect more than two-thirds of the country’s workforce, according to the Biden administrationMr Biden said: “Vaccination is the single best pathway out of this pandemic. And while I would have much preferred that requirements not become necessary, too many people remain unvaccinated for us to get out of this pandemic for good.”It comes as ministers in the UK prepare to announce compulsory jabs for healthcare staff.But on Thursday night, health chiefs claimed the policy would fuel a staffing crisis which would leave the NHS unable to clear record backlogs. Up to one in five NHS staff at some hospitals are not fully vaccinated, official figures show.Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents hospital managers, said: “There are 93,000 vacancies across the NHS and at a time of increased demand for healthcare services, we simply cannot afford to see staff leave or be removed from frontline care.“The Secretary of State has made it clear that tackling the treatment backlog is his key priority but if he is not careful, this policy could end up restricting the NHS’s ability to continue to do that effectively.”A record 5.7 million people are currently on NHS waiting lists.Latest figures show that more than 100,000 NHS workers have yet to have a first jab, while 146,000 have not had their second.Mr Taylor, who recently called on ministers to implement Plan B, urged ministers to publish their risk assessment of making jabs compulsory, and to set out how it would mitigate problems caused by short-staffing.Latest NHS data show that at some major hospitals in London and Birmingham, as many as one in five healthcare workers are not fully vaccinated.The Government recently held a public consultation on making jabs mandatory, which said such a move would protect patients and doctors during winter.But on Wednesday, The  revealed that ministers are considering delaying enforcement until March 31.Discussions over the spring timetable come despite warnings that rising cases could see the public put under greater restrictions.The new data shows that across England, one in 10 healthcare workers have yet to have both jabs, while seven per cent have had neither.Barts Health Trust in London, Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health Foundation Trust and North Middlesex University Hospital trust are among the major hospitals where more than 20 per cent of staff have yet to have both jabs.Similar figures are seen at Barnet, Enfield and Haringey Mental Health trust, Sandwell and West Birmingham Hospitals Trust, East London NHS Foundation Trust, Birmingham Community Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust and King\u0027s College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust.On Thursday, campaigners for the elderly said patients should be given the right to know if the medics treating them had been jabbed.Dennis Reed, from Silver Voices, a campaign group for the elderly, questioned why patients were not given the right to know if their medic had been vaccinated.He said: “I think there is a really strong case for this: the public should have a right to know whether they are being treated by someone who is more likely to infect them.”Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary, has said he was “leaning towards” making jabs compulsory for NHS staff, with an announcement expected next week.The measure has already been introduced across the care sector, and will take effect from November 11.When a public consultation was launched in September on compulsory jabs for NHS staff, the need to protect staff and patients in winter was emphasised.However, ministers are understood to be discussing plans which would delay implementation until March 31.Mandatory jabs were announced for the care sector five months ago, and since then, the uptake of vaccines has risen sharply. When the announcement was made, just 71.4 percent of such staff had received both jabs. Latest figures for the week ending October 14 show the figure is now 88.9 per cent. But this still leaves more than 60,000 care workers - more than one in 10 - without a second jab ahead of the deadline next Thursday.

It allows visits only if the holidaymakes leaves the country no more than 180 days after their second dose.Travellers can enter the country if they have “received a booster dose and at least 14 days have passed by the day of entry into Israel,” the rules state.As a result, many triple-jabbed British travellers face being excluded – though people who have proof of recovery from Covid within the previous 190 days, or six months, will be allowed in.Paul Charles, the chief executive of travel consultancy The PC Agency, believed other countries could follow Austria and Israel’s example. “It’s likely countries will continue to ensure we are fully jabbed. By fully jabbed that means being up to date. We are seeing countries starting to align,” he said.Another travel chief warned the disparate strategies of different countries were undermining the revival of flying. “There’s going to be alignment problems around countries’ vaccine approaches,” he said.“There needs to be international agreement around this. The Government talked about having an internationally agreed approach at the G7 earlier this year but we have seen nothing come from that.“It is a relatively strange approach that these countries are taking on the booster jab but what we are seeing is that disparate strategies on vaccines are undermining travel.”He cited the US approach to vaccination, where it had introduced jabs for children aged 12 to 18 earlier than most other countries – and was now requiring unvaccinated children to take three Covid tests which could add at least £70 to the cost of a transatlantic flight.In updated travel guidance, Washington stated that unvaccinated under-18s would have to take a post-arrival test between days three and five, when flights restart on Monday.This is in addition to the pre-departure test in the UK that must be taken by all travellers within three days of flying to America. UK rules mean another test must be taken by day two on arrival back home.More from NewsBonfire Night 2021: the story of Guy Fawkes, gunpowder, treason and plotSchoolchildren encouraged ‘rewild’ their neighbourhood for new Duke of Edinburgh-style awardUK’s youngest gun killer, 14, convicted of murdering schoolboy in gang attackDoctor banned from social media in ‘masks do nothing’ row takes his case to High CourtMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"james bond book written woman first time","story":"A James Bond novel is to be written by a woman for the first time after the Ian Fleming estate authorised an “expansion” of the spy’s fictional universe.Kim Sherwood would produce a trilogy of “audacious, pacy, sexy and irresistibly entertaining” stories which are “respectful of Fleming’s original genius and yet refreshingly modern”, the publisher said.The books are not continuation novels in the vein of those previously written by Sebastian Faulks, Anthony Horowitz or Jeffery Deaver.They do not focus on Bond but instead feature a erse cast of new-generation 00 agents. In the first book, Bond is missing – presumed captured or killed – and the younger agents are tasked with finding out what happened to him.The publisher, HarperCollins, declined to say whether Bond would appear in the books at all.Sherwood is the author of one novel, Testament, and is a lecturer in creative writing at Edinburgh University.She said: “James Bond has remained an evergreen symbol for Britain because he changes with us. It’s incredible to have the opportunity to bring the books into the 21st century and create new heroes for our time.“My Double O agents are a erse ensemble tasked with fighting today’s global threats, identifying a mole in MI6 – and the small matter of finding James Bond, who is missing in action.”The 32-year-old said Bond had been “one of the enduring loves” of her life since she first watched Pierce Brosnan in the 1995 film GoldenEye.“As a teenager, I chose Fleming when my English teacher asked us to write about an author we admired – I still have the school report. Since then, I’ve dreamt of writing James Bond.“It’s rare that dreams come true, and I am grateful to the Fleming family for this incredible opportunity. I feel honoured to be the first novelist to expand the Bond universe through the Double O sector, bringing life to old favourites, and fresh characters to the canon,” she said.Accusations of misogyny have long surrounded Bond, and having the stories told by a female writer is a significant change.Jonny Geller, the agent who negotiated the deal on behalf of Ian Fleming Publications, said: “It is amazing to think a woman writer has not – until this point – entered the heart of James Bond’s world to tell a story of the 00s around him.”A spin-off trilogy about M’s secretary, The Moneypenny Diaries by Kate Westbrook, was published in the 2000s.Sherwood has a personal link to the Bond films. Her grandfather was George Baker, the actor, who played Hilary Bray in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service and Captain Benson in The Spy Who Loved Me.More from NewsBonfire Night 2021: the story of Guy Fawkes, gunpowder, treason and plotSchoolchildren encouraged ‘rewild’ their neighbourhood for new Duke of Edinburgh-style awardUK’s youngest gun killer, 14, convicted of murdering schoolboy in gang attackDoctor banned from social media in ‘masks do nothing’ row takes his case to High CourtMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"labour might have had upper hand today not sentencing claudia","story":"The only thing we can say with any certainty about the shape of the next parliament is that it is unlikely to include anyone named Claudia Webbe.The Leicester East MP was found guilty last month of harassment following evidence that she made a number of phone calls to a female friend of her partner, threatened to release intimate photos of her and even use acid on her.Webbe intends to appeal her conviction, which comes with a ten-week sentence, suspended for two years, and 200 hours of community service.Winning such an appeal represents her only chance of remaining on the green benches of the House of Commons, where she has been since 2019. She was suspended from the Labour Party as soon as her conviction was confirmed and now sits as an independent but naturally could regain the whip – and her title of official Labour candidate at the next general election – only if the verdict is overturned.If she fails in that effort, she will then be subject to a recall petition in her constituency. One senior Labour MP this afternoon suggested that such a petition could attract the necessary ten per cent of electors required to trigger a by-election “in the space of an afternoon”. Which seems harsh, even if true.If Webber’s appeal does indeed fail, we face the prospect of four by-elections, two to replace late MPs David Amess and James Brokenshire, one to replace Owen Paterson after his sudden and dramatic decision to come to his senses this afternoon, and a fourth (perhaps) in Leicester East.So, in summary: not parliament’s finest week.Webber’s sentence comes at a very inconvenient time for her party, which had found itself, for once, with the upper hand over the government after ministers’ cack-handed attempt to rewrite standards rules in order to save Paterson’s skin, followed by the swiftest U-turn in either political history or light entertainment.But it will be ever so slightly more difficult for Labour to maintain its customary morally superior stance when one of its own stands convicted of having ambitions to be an acid-throwing thug. It remains to be seen what the public disapproves more of – MPs using their status and position to earn a few grand on the side, or MPs harassing and threatening life-changing injuries on people they don’t like.Of course, the natural response would be “A curse on both your houses”. And it’s true that both parties need desperately to look again at the processes used to select their candidates. Webbe secured the nomination for Leicester East after her predecessor, Keith Vaz, was forced to stand down after an embarrassing encounter with a washing machine salesman. Or something.Under Jeremy Corbyn, of whom Webbe was a strong supporter, there were many untried and untested candidates parachuted into nominally safe Labour seats in an attempt to shift the balance in the Parliamentary Labour Party in his favour. It’s early days yet but I think we might conclude that this experiment was ineffective and was accompanied by some drastically unforeseen and unexpected consequences. Even in the Labour Party, threatening constituents with acid is not considered a desirable campaigning tactic.Now, such hubris on the part of Corbyn has been shown for the folly that it was. True, all Labour leaders seek to parachute favoured sons (and daughters, but it’s usually sons) into safe seats as the nomination deadline approaches, but Corbyn’s regime paid far too little attention to the qualifications and reputations of such people, whereas those advanced by the patronage of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were at least well known in the upper levels of the party.A sensible starting point for Labour would be to start selecting candidates who were unlikely to go to jail. This would have the happy result of making it easier for constituents to contact them, for a start.Now, as government ministers are caught in a pincer movement by the opposition and the media, as they squirm in embarrassment about the totally unforced errors of the last 24 hours, they will be relieved to see the Webbe fiasco being extended as we wait for her appeal to be heard, probably in the next few weeks. Only after that matter is disposed of can a recall petition be opened in Leicester East.As if Keir Starmer’s embarrassment at these developments was not enough, there are rumours that Vaz himself fancies his chances of a return to the Commons in any subsequent by-election. That will not happen, obviously, for the leadership has the final say as to who is allowed onto a shortlist of candidates. The fact that the former chair of the Home Affairs select committee is even a power in Webber’s constituency suggests that this particular soap opera is far from over.Parliament – or, more accurately, the House of Commons – has hardly covered itself in glory this week. And there’s more to come.More from NewsBonfire Night 2021: the story of Guy Fawkes, gunpowder, treason and plotSchoolchildren encouraged ‘rewild’ their neighbourhood for new Duke of Edinburgh-style awardUK’s youngest gun killer, 14, convicted of murdering schoolboy in gang attackDoctor banned from social media in ‘masks do nothing’ row takes his case to High CourtMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tories behaving like tired government dying days","story":"Boris Johnson recently hosted a dinner in No 10 for Tory MPs past and present who, like him, entered Parliament in 2001. To his surprise, David Cameron accepted the invitation. As they all sat down for dinner, the ever-competitive Prime Minister thought he’d have a bit of fun at his predecessor’s expense. He was about to launch a window-sill insulation scheme, he said – and he thought he’d call it “Greensill.”When Cameron’s turn to speak came, he said that he ran No 10 in the glory days when there was food on the shelves and Tories who actually cut taxes. A decent joke. But Boris’s was better.No one forgets a lobbying scandal. Cameron won two elections, he transformed both welfare and secondary schooling. But he will spend the rest of his days tainted by his lobbying for the now-collapsed Greensill. Sir Malcolm Rifkind, Stephen Byers and Neil Hamilton all ended up with similar stains on their reputations. When Owen Paterson accepted £9,300 a month from corporates – far more than his MP’s salary – scandal was sure to follow. A scandal now magnified several times over by No 10’s ineptitude, with career-ending effect.Like so many political misjudgments, this started with an attempt at decency. Johnson likes to stand by his friends and allies even (perhaps especially) when that means taking fire. When Priti Patel’s former civil servants were accusing her of bullying, he asked MPs to “form a square around the Prittster” to defend her.He thinks Paterson was wrongly accused of breaking lobbying rules by a biased Westminster sleaze watchdog – one who was, once, out to get him. He felt a particular sympathy for Paterson whose wife had taken her own life as this investigation dragged on. His majority meant the Tories could change the rules, which would create a fuss. But then again: so what?It is not clear how much thought was given to all of this. It seems to have followed the Richard Branson logic of “Screw it: let’s do it” – or, as Jacob Rees-Mogg later put it, “Let justice be done, though the heavens fall.” Various Tory MPs pleaded with the whips not to go through with this madness. Whatever the details of the case, they said, people would just see a Tory caught with his snout in the trough, then let off the hook by his fellow Conservatives. How could they vote for what would be seen, by the public, as a stitch-up?As with the National Insurance tax rise, the Conservatives were given no time to think – or rebel. They were given their orders and obeyed, knowing it would be another Charge of the Light Brigade. It was bound to fail. And even the attempt would cause permanent damage, making it easier to cast Tories as cheats and liars: dodging sleaze rules, reneging on manifesto pledges. They were doing it because a Westminster victory was guaranteed: they are up against a Labour Party so inept as to be a danger only to itself. Sir Keir Starmer actually had the votes to defeat the Government over the Paterson affair, but failed to organise his own troops on time. Only public outcry forced No 10 to change its mind.Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely – and a majority of 80 gives the Prime Minister the kind of power that turns a brain fart into law within 24 hours. There is pitifully little scrutiny or questioning. No one to point out that this demented plan would fail because all parties needed to agree any changes to a parliamentary watchdog. No one to point out that, like the expenses scandal, this isn’t about the technicalities but a wider principle. About trust in politics.Most of the expenses transgressions were within the rules. The helipad maintenance, the moat-dredging and even the sleazy video – all were approved by the relevant authorities, bought at the taxpayers’ expense. Perfectly legal, but still outrageous. The distinction between the two was lost on politicians so settled in the Westminster bubble that they could not see how all of this looked to people outside it. Back then, Johnson – as Mayor of London – was one of those who grasped this at once. He still teases Michael Gove about the “financial origins” of his £331 Chinon chair.I am among Paterson’s admirers: he is a man of energy and tenacity. But on this issue, his judgment failed him. The rules might have permitted him to double his salary by shilling for corporates, but should he have done so? To accept £100,000 a year for advising any corporation was always going to raise questions about where his loyalty lay. The Prime Minister ought to have known this. As he wrote in these pages at the time, the expenses scandal showed that “the public is utterly fed up with politicians who seem to be actuated by their financial circumstances”. True then, and true now.Much of this is classic overcorrection in No 10. This time last year, what the Prime Minister thought was seen as an almost peripheral issue in a machine run by Dominic Cummings. Now, what he says is enacted at once – even if it’s sure to end in disaster. Mark Spencer, the Chief Whip, assured Downing Street that the mission to save Paterson would be fine. Even the Tory party machine was not consulted.So within the space of a few weeks, the Prime Minister went from needling Cameron about lobbying scandals to plunging the Tories into a scandal of his own. Had he sought advice, he would have told Paterson to take his punishment quietly and be back by Christmas. The watchdog could have been reformed a few months later, in consultation with Labour, at a time when neither party would have anyone under investigation. The Johnsonian impulse, this time, ended up crushing the man he intended to help.Thoughtlessness, arrogance, complacency, being tone deaf to public opinion – in the past few days, the Tories have exhibited the traits of an exhausted government in its dying days. And that’s before the inflation that the Bank of England now expects to eat away any rise in wages for the next two years (if it doesn’t tip the economy into another crash). The difference from the 1990s is that there is no Tony Blair to capitalise on these errors. But now, as then, it’s becoming easier to see how a Tory government ends.    More from NewsBonfire Night 2021: the story of Guy Fawkes, gunpowder, treason and plotSchoolchildren encouraged ‘rewild’ their neighbourhood for new Duke of Edinburgh-style awardUK’s youngest gun killer, 14, convicted of murdering schoolboy in gang attackDoctor banned from social media in ‘masks do nothing’ row takes his case to High CourtMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"wont broadcast media accept covid cases going","story":"On Covid the good news just keeps coming. Relative to seven days before, official cases have fallen for 11 straight days and the seven day average is now down about 18 per cent from its peak. Cases in kids started falling at about October 18th (a full week before half-term started) as now confirmed not only in the official cases data but in the REACT survey just out – which tests people at random and hence is unaffected by any changes in testing with schools out). And a new treatment, molnupiravir, has been approved, which, if given soon enough after symptoms start, cuts the risk of being hospitalised by about half. The SAGE epidemiological modellers now expect cases and hospitalisations to fall this winter. Indeed, in some of their models cases fall as low as 5,000 per day. Those who, even just a couple of weeks ago, were demanding an immediate shift to plan B have been proved demonstrably wrong.Yet if you watched the main television channels you would have precisely the opposite impression. Yesterday, CNN released an interview with the Prime Minister in which he was challenged on why plan B had not been implemented given that, as CNN’s Chief International Anchor Christiane Amanpour tweeted: “Case numbers are spiking”. On Sky News, Economic Secretary to the Treasury John Glenn was interviewed on the basis that, Sky tweeted: “With the UK\u0027s coronavirus epidemic escalating by the day, it\u0027s no longer a case of if Plan B will be triggered but when, say experts” and since Plan B was inevitable, didn’t the government owe the public some indication as to when it would be coming in?On BBC Breakfast, England’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam was asked “Why are schools not putting masks in place, with cases rising in school age children?” The fact that cases in school-aged children are not in fact rising – indeed, on a seven day average basis they are currently down 39 percent from their peak – is apparently of no relevance.I find this incomprehensible. Early on in the epidemic, when data was difficult to come by or even when it was more abundant but non-specialist journalists had not yet learned to find it one could have understood. But it has been 20 months! Every serious broadcaster must know how to obtain timely data.Obviously I’m not saying that journalists should react to every up-and-down fluctuation in the numbers, such that if cases rise for two days they should demand a lockdown and if they fall for two days they should demand an end to testing and travel restrictions. But cases have fallen, relative to the week earlier, for eleven straight days. The amount of that fall (18 per cent so far) was probably a bit exaggerated by half-term, and it’s not inconceivable we could yet see a few days of rising cases as testing fully normalises. But the overall trajectory is clearly down, not up, and journalists should not be reporting otherwise.More from NewsBonfire Night 2021: the story of Guy Fawkes, gunpowder, treason and plotSchoolchildren encouraged ‘rewild’ their neighbourhood for new Duke of Edinburgh-style awardUK’s youngest gun killer, 14, convicted of murdering schoolboy in gang attackDoctor banned from social media in ‘masks do nothing’ row takes his case to High CourtMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"grandad wins three lottery jackpots","story":"Grandad wins THREE Lottery jackpots in the same draw - tripling his winningsSeventy-two-year-old Ken plans to share his Peoples Postcode Lottery winnings with his daughterthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will auto-play soonCancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror video peoples-postcode-lottery-reveals-prizes-,customFields:,enableJWPlayer:true,jwPlayerSiteID:hPpIvH,jwPlayerMediaID:VnCNXd,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,pubmaticVideoPrebidEnabled:true,monitizer:true,navWithArticle.enabled:true,prebidTestLibrary:,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,disableOzoneScriptOnDragonfly:true,pubmaticIdDisabled:true,fbia.mantisRecommender:true,RRET-.cutOffDate:--T::,partner.quicklinks.bar:true,enableSlideInSkinnySignUp:true,justpremiumDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,videoPlaylistEnabled:true,domain:mirror,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,publicationId:aeed-a--bac-edf,lotameLightningTagV:true,ampVideoCacheBuster:true,pubmaticDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,deleteAccountFromProfile:true,adHiddenLoading:true,adslotsFixedSize:true,sovrnDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,video.header.bidding.enabled:,chatEnabled:true,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,enableAboutTopics:true,converse.widget.enable:true,viafouraComments:true,adMobileBottomSlotLarge:true,video.jwplayer.playerId:DxFYnOv,flagsFromDataLayerForFBIA:true,collectiveDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,fbia.converse.enabled:true,irisClientToken:,disableAHS:true,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,openxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,globalTrayEnabled:true,manualReconsent:,mpulse.enabled:true,nobidDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,og.image.for.section.and.topic:https:s-prod.mirror @trinitymirrordigital chameleon-branding publications mirror img logo-mirror-socialsharing.png,publicationName:Mirror,video.jwplayer.enabled:true,loadIrisManually:true,delayAdsUntilCMP:true,disableAdvertMaxHeight:true,preloadFonts:true,viafouraEnabled:true,PWA.enable:true,readNextEmbeds:true,removeSSO:true,chartbeatHeadlinePageTypes:[ home , channel , topic , section ],felix.endpoint:https:felix.data.tm-awx ampconfig.,breakingNewsPull:true,nobidVideoPrebidEnabled:true,adFixedMobileBottomSticky:true,magniteDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,footerNewsletterConfig:,xandrDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,consentText:We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Former climate change minister Lord Duncan took the most domestic flights of any minister -  in total since the  election.Chancellor Rishi Sunak, who slashed taxes on domestic flights in last month’s Budget, is in second place with  trips.And ministers at the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategytook the most flights of any department, with  in total, including two by Alok Sharma, who is now President of the COP climate summit.It comes after the Mirror revealed Boris Johnson had taken a private jet back from the summit, so he could attend a dinner with climate change sceptic Lord Moore.The Prime Minister’s spokesman today defended Mr Johnson’s journey. He said: “The Prime Minister as you know was travelling from the G in Rome, where the UK helped deliver commitments to end international coal financing, to COP, where we secured landmark pledges on cutting carbon, on methane emissions, halting deforestation, advancing green technology. “The plane itself uses sustainable aviation fuel and the flight is offset. I think as you know the aircraft’s base is at Stansted, where the plane was required tofrom Glasgow as well. “It’s important to say that our approach to achieving Net Zero is driven by scaling up technology so that our planes and indeed cars as well can be used in line with our Net Zero ambitions.” Research also revealed former Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab charted a private jet to attend the G summit in Cornwall at a cost of more than £, to the taxpayer.Liberal Democrat Climate Spokesperson Wera Hobhouse said: We know that domestic flights are one of the most carbon intensive forms of transport. “So it’s sheer hypocrisy that Tory ministers continue to rely on planes for journeys within the UK, when there are cleaner alternatives readily available.  Figures disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act reveal Lord Duncan took ten flights between London City Airport and Edinburgh for meetings. On a commercial flight, each  hour and  minute journey would release . kg of CO into the atmosphere. The same journey would have taken around six hours, but would have released just a quarter of the carbon dioxide.  Most long-distance trains have on-board wi, allowing passengers to work during the journey. The Treasury disclosed nine flights taken by Mr Sunak since December , but refused to give details of the trips citing security concerns. Only a handful of the flights would have been impossible by less carbon intensive modes of transport. They included flights to Belfast and back, taken by Mr Sharma and aides, and a flight from Glasgow to the Isle of Islay by Amanda Solloway, who was then a science minister. Mr Raab declared one flight - a privately chartered trip from London to Cornwall to attend the G leaders summit at a cost of £.. The Scotland Office disclosed four flights taken by Secretary of State Alister Jack - three between London and Scotland, and one to Cardf for a meeting. The Department for Work and Pensionsdeclared two flights, the Housing department three flights, and the Ministry of Justiceone.  But the Justice department only gave figures up to July this year, stating later flights would be part of a regular publication. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairsand Department of Health and Social Caredeclared no flights for any of their ministers. And the Cabinet Office refused to disclose details of the flights, claiming they are “reasonably accessible by other means.” While the Cabinet Office regularly publishes details of ministers’ overseas flights - including those made by the Prime Minister, the Mirror has been unable to find details of domestic flights. The Cabinet Office was approached, but did not respond. Ms Hobhouse added: “When the Prime Minister jetted back from Glasgow this week he was in good company, as many of his own ministers have done the same thing. “This, combined with their recent decision to slash air duty on domestic flights, actively undermines our efforts to tackle the climate crisis. Liberal Democrats are calling for all internal flights to be zero carbon by  and for greater investment in modernising railways across the UK to support more sustainable transport.”A UK government spokesperson said: “Officials are required to make domestic and international trips to conduct government business. “We are setting the world’s most ambitious climate change target to reduce emissions by % by  compared to  levels. “This follows the recommendation from the Independent Climate Change Committee and puts us on the right path to meet net zero by .” A BEIS spokesperson said: “Ministers and civil servants are often required to travel for government business and whilst the majority of journeys are by train, flights are sometimes necessary.“Almost all these trips were to offices in Belfast or Aberdeen, the heart of the energy sector in Scotland –journeys which cannot reasonably be done in a day other than by plane.Comment MORE ON Conservative PartyThe TreasuryLiberal DemocratsDepartment for Work and PensionsMinistry of JusticeLondon City AirportG summitDeclan DonnellyBoris JohnsonRailwaysClimate changePrivate jetsPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

An inquiry last year by Lord Evansapos predecessor as independent investigator of ministerial standards, Sir Alex Allan, found that Ms Patel breached the ministerial code. He said the Home Secretary was behind behaviour that can be described as bullying and had not consistently met the high standards expected of her.But Sir Alex resigned after Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the ultimate arbiter of the ministerial code, refused to back his findings and did not sanction Ms Patel. She later apologised for any upset caused but has always denied bullying. It followed the resignation of the Home Office’s top civil servant Sir Philip Rutnam, who accused Ms Patel of a “vicious and orchestrated briefing campaign” against him. Sir Philip, who threatened to take Ms Patel to an employment tribunal for unfair dismissal, later reached a £, settlement with government, including £, for his legal costs. But Labour has said Lord Evans should now urgently review the case. It comes after the Government was forced into a humiliating U-turn over a bid to dismantle parliamentaposs anti-sleaze system.  MPs tried to change the standards process and let senior Tory Owen Paterson off the hook over a suspension from parliament, after the standards commissioner found he made an egregious breach of lobbying rules. Mr Thomas-Symonds told the Mirror: “Yesterday we saw unprecedented moves by the Conservatives to change the rulebook to block the suspension of one of their own found to have broken the rules. “Only days earlier, a damning standards watchdog report called for tougher rules to stamp out the crony culture of Tory Ministers breaking the rules. “This report must not be ignored and makes an urgent case for independent review of cases of misconduct. This must include inquiry into the egregious case of Home Secretary breaking the Ministerial code through bullying– especially considering the use of £, of taxpayer’s money. Yet Priti Patel has not faced any consequences for these actions.  “It’s time that that the watchdog takes a fresh look into this so that this cannot be repeated in the future and to make sure that the Home Secretary is properly held to account. A Whitehall source underlined that Ms Patel had already faced an ethics investigation and that a separate watchdog oversaw government accounts. Departmental accounts are already scrutinised by the National Audit Office, the source said.

As many as  MPs currently list payments for such jobs, with some banking many times their parliamentary salary They include Owen Paterson, who was paid more than £, a year by two companies - testing firm Randox and sausage-maker Lynn’s country foods. Mr Paterson was one of two sitting MPs to declare more than £, a year for consultancy or advisory work. There are no rules against MPs being paid for advising external businesses, provided they record it in their register of interests, but they must not lobby the Government on behalf of those businesses. The highest paid is former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell, who receives £, per year for . days working for firms including investment companies Investec, SouthBridge and Kingsley Capital Partners, along with accountants Ernst  Young and consultants Montrose Associates. Other MPs paid more than £, per year for consulting work include former cabinet minister Chris Grayling, who is paid £, annually by Hutchison Ports Europe, and Chief Whip Julian Smith, who receives a total of £, per year from three companies.  Mark Garnier, a former international trade minister, earned more than his £, annual parliamentary salary for consultancy work. He is paid £, by two companies in the space sector - Laser Light Communications and Shetland Space Centre. Some MPs also operate their own consultancy firms. Sir Bob Neill is the sole director of RJMN Ltd, which advanced him an interest-free loan of £, in the   financial year, according to its most recent accounts. Mark Pritchard also owns a consultancy firm, Mark Pritchard Advisory Ltd, which made profits of £, in the   financial year and paid idends of £,.

Labour pressed Grant Shapps to immediately insist that hard shoulders are restored to smart motorways after a report from MPs raised further issues.But Mr Shapps cautioned such action could put more drivers and passengers at risk of death and serious injury. He added he has an -point plan, backed with cash, to get smart motorways sorted out. Concerns have been raised following fatal incidents involving broken-down vehicles being hit from behind. A report by the Commons Transport Select Committeesaid there is not enough safety and economic data to justy continuing with smart motorways. It described the Governmentaposs decision in March  that all future smart motorways would have all-lane-running - where the hard shoulder is used as a permanent live traffic lane - as premature.  Controlled smart motorways - which have a permanent hard shoulder and use technology to regulate the speed and flow of traffic - have the lowest casualty rates of all motorways and major A roads in England, the report said. Speaking in the House of Commons, shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: Itaposs been  months since I asked the Secretary of State to reinstate the hard shoulder immediately. No action followed and instead he ploughed ahead with smart motorway rollout. Since then whistleblowers have come forward confirming our worst fears: broken equipment, a lack of monitoring and ultimately lives being placed at risk. This failure has had a devastating impact on peopleaposs lives. Now the Transport Select Committee has published its damning report and the families of those who lost loved ones on smart motorways were forced into Parliament Square this week to protest. Will he do the right thing and immediately insist that the hard shoulder is reinstated today  Mr Shapps replied: We all share the passion and desire to make sure our roads are as safe as they can possibly be. Sadly , people die a year on our roads. It is important we do everything possible. The Transport Select Committee, who he quotes, did not in fact say quite what he said. They actually say the evidence suggests that doing so - in other words, simply putting the hard shoulder back in - could put more drivers and passengers at risk of death and serious injury. It was Lord Prescott who started to introduce smart motorways. As far as Iaposm aware, Iaposm the first Secretary of State - and there have been  since - who has actually been working consistently with an -point plan and £ million to get them sorted out.

Mum-of-three Keira O’Mara, from Birmingham, had been running her business Mama Designs for more than a decade when she started to research single-use plastic in sanitary products. “I’m obviously aware of environmental issues and I’ve always recycled, but I wouldn’t say I was an eco-warrior by any means,” Keira, , told The Mirror. “But the statistics shocked me and really opened my eyes. I couldn’t believe the amount of pads and tampons that were being flushed down the toilet every single day.” On average, around , panty liners, . million tampons and . million sanitary towels are flushed every day in the UK. One pad can take up to  years to break down. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here Keira said: “These were habits I’d had for most of my adult le. Thousands of people are doing the same thing, unknowingly, every day. “Every pack of sanitary pads contains the same amount of plastic as five carrier bags. We’ve all stopped using carrier bags, so why are we still using these ” Although Mama Designs had been making reusable breast pads and wipes from bamboo products for several years, Keira wanted to expand to find sustainable solutions for period products too. “People didn’t really talk openly about periods for a long time,” she said. “They were happy to make the switch to washable breast pads and wipes, but with periods it was still a bit taboo and people were a bit more squeamish.”  Keira added people had preconceptions about reusable period pads being unsanitary - admitting she initially shared these concerns. But after doing her research, she was convinced the only way to prevent an influx of period products being dumped in landfill was to create reusable pads. “I understand people might think, ‘It’s not for me’, but actually the benefits hugely outweigh anything . It’s a really nice product to use, as well as having massive environmental advantages,” she said. Keira began working on reusable sanitary towels with a factory she was already partnered with - and which had already been making reusable period products for some time. In May , Mama Designs launched the reusable pads for the first time, with huge success. “Lockdown really helped us because people were looking at their habits and how they could become more sustainable. “The response blew me away.” Keira reckons the company has sold , pads since they were first launched. “That’s everybody from young girls about to start their periods to a lady in her s who contacted me, who uses them every single day as she has a bladder weakness,” she said. The mum and entrepreneur also noted a lot of mums are buying the pads for their daughters who are approaching puberty - which she thinks is a really good sign for sustainability among future generations. “What’s amazing is how open to reusable products the younger generation is. They’ve grown up being far more eco-aware than we are, and a lot of that is down to habit. “If we give them these pads to use, they’ll accept that as their norm.” She has even set some aside for her own -year-old daughter for when she starts her period. Keira’s reusable pads work much like disposable sanitary towels. They are clipped into your underwear with poppers rather than sticky pads, and can be kept in for twice as long as disposable pads. When you change the pad, you can fold it up and put it in a ziplock bag until you get home to wash it - which can be done in the washing machine or by hand. There’s a range of seven sizes, from light to heavy flows and dferent sized women, and they retail from £ for a pack of three. “It might seem like a lot at the time, but reusable pads can last for five years, and sometimes even longer. “Overall, it’s a huge saving.” Comment MORE ON Periods\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A nationwide study found that case rates almost doubled in England from September to October this year, hitting .% of the population infected between October  to October . That means one in every  people had the bug during that period. Some areas were even worse hit, with the rate reaching one in every  people in the South West. The virus continues to rip through schools, the React- study found, infecting .% of five to -year-olds, and .% of  to -year-olds. In January this year, after the Delta iant took hold and the country was plunged into a strict lockdown, the prevalence was estimated to be .%. Paul Elliott, director of the React programme at Imperial College London, said that the spike in cases among young people coincided with half-term. We do know that we saw a very, very similar pattern in round six at the same time last year, where over the half-term period the rates dropped, he said. And then actually they rebounded and went up again. So I think watching what happens in the next week,  days, is going to be really critical. The alarming figures come as the Prime Minister continues to insist that no further measures to limit transmission are needed.Askedhe could guarantee a good Christmas at the end of last week, Boris Johnson said: I see no evidence whatever to think that any kind of lockdown is on the cards.The option to instigate Plan B - which would see aof mandatory face mask wearing and working from home, among other measures - remains available to the government. Mr Johnsonaposs optimism is at odds with the outlook of Professor Johnathan Van-Tam. Englandaposs deputy chief medical officer warned that Covid is running too hot and that there are dficult months ahead. The rates are still very high at the moment, Professor Van-Tam told BBC Breakfast and BBC Radio  Live.They are higher than in most of Europe. And we are running quite hot - I think thataposs the right expression. And, of course, itaposs of concern to scientists that we are running this hot this early in the autumn season. And so, from that perspective, Iaposm afraid itaposs caution, followed by caution, and we need to watch these data very carefully indeed over the next days and weeks.Britain has about , daily cases of Covid, according to the latest seven-day average.That total is second only to the roughly , a day in the United States, which has five times more people.  Ten worst hit local areas in EnglandCheltenham Stroud Swindon Gloucester Cotswold South Gloucestershire Wiltshire Tewkesbury Bath North East Somerset and City of BristolCoronavirus prevalence per personSouth East: .% from .% North East: .% from .% North West: .% from % Yorkshire and the Humber: .% from .% East Midlands: .% from .% West Midlands: .% from .% East of England: .% from .% London: .% from .% South West: .% from % While the vaccine has weakened the link between Covid cases and deaths,  people died across the UK each day of the last week on average, while more than , coronavirus patients are currently receiving treatment in hospital.The startling high figures have left already beleaguered hospital staff feeling anxious and exhausted as the winter period approaches. Intensive care nurse Dave Carr said: We are dead on our feet physically. We are dead on our feet mentally. I donapost know how to get out of this mess. I canapost walk away because of the guilt of leaving my colleagues.Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association, is one of many medical professionals calling for the government to act to ease pressure on the NHS. We do not understand why the government has removed mandatory mask wearing in transport and in indoor settings like shops because that doesnapost actually stop the economy ing – but it would reduce infection, he said. The government clearly believe these simple measures do make a dference, yet theyaposre failing to act by not making these a requirement.  Without other preventative measures put in place now, the challenges coming our way could go from being achievable to totally insurmountable. It is hoped that the high Covid rates experienced at the end of October will begin to ease as more children take the vaccine. Data suggests the uptake has been slow so far. Helen Ward, professor of public health at Imperial College London, said: We know that vaccination uptake in children, the -plus-year-olds, is not very high and thataposs where weaposve got most infection. And then thereaposs the question as yet undecided as to whether or not even younger children might be vaccinated.  Children are one group where it is continuing to circulate and therefore with to school following half-term you would expect there to be more transmission going on there. And the parents of those children are the other age group that we saw higher increases in, and are also the age group that are not yet eligible for booster doses. And sothere is signicant waning in the effectiveness of the vaccine after four or five months, that would overlap with that age group. So that is why itaposs really important to continue monitoring whataposs happening in both the whole population but particularly those age groups that may become vulnerable again. Around % of the positive samples examined in the React- study were a mutation of the Delta iant - AY.. - and officials have said they are monitoring the spread of the so-called iant under investigation. Commenting on the study, Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said: Although the number of hospitalisations and deaths remain lower than in previous peaks, these findings are a powerful reminder that the pandemic is far from over and remains a serious threat to health and wellbeing. This new data strongly reinforces the need for all eligible age groups to get vaccinated and to take mitigating measures such as wearing a face covering in crowded places and ensuring good ventilation indoors. This is particularly urgent for older people whose immunity may be waning given that several months have passed since they received their jabs. I strongly encourage everyone who is eligible for a third dose or a booster shot to come forward without delay.Health and Social Care Secretary Sajid Javid said: Todayaposs report sends an important message that we need to stay vigilant as we head into the winter months.Vaccines continue to be our first line of defence against this disease and it is crucial we all get jabbed to keep the virus at bay.

The long list of fatty orders with extra sugar caused her to reach a massive st and lb. The -year-old admitted that in one sitting she would gorge on a large pizza, garlic bread side and a desert, or sometimes a curry, five nights a week.Carlie would also plunge her hand into the biscuit barrel up to  times a day, and scoff up to five on each visit. She said the bingeing on food created a vicious cycle of exhaustion and overeating. As she got tired from carrying all the weight around, she would then order take-out in the hopes of getting some energy. Among her favourite meals were fry ups, Chinese meals, fish and chips, Indian food or a pizza with a batch of cookie dough to finish.Size  Carlie became overweight during puberty and has suffered gastroesophageal reflux, the cause of extreme heartburn. Doctors recommended the gastric bypass surgery to help ease her symptoms. With the help of the weight-loss op and a new mindframe to ditch her unhealthy habits, Carlie lost an enormous amount of fat to shrink down to st lbs and a streamlined size . Carlie - who works as a picture framer - was so self-conscious about getting into a swimming costume she avoided holidays altogether for six years. But now sheaposs fitting into slinky numbers, and with an upcoming skin removal surgery, she canapost wait to showcase her new curves on the beach. Carlie says since having the weightloss surgery in November , she says sheaposs been given a new lease of le. Now instead of feeling sluggish all the time, sheaposs able to be more active with her six-year-old daughter, Betsy, and -year-old partner Leon Sinclair. Carlie is due to have excess skin removed to complete her new look in April  and the family are looking forward to their first family holiday next year where Carlie plans to wear a bikini for the first time in years. Though sheaposs no longer spending massive amounts on food, she is having to fork out on constantly updating her wardrobe. Among the new dishes she cooks are batch-cooked chillis and stews, and breakfasts that she canapost finish due to her egg-sized new stomach. Carlie said: Now, for breakfast I have one slice of French toast with blueberries and strawberries andI canapost finish the toast, I concentrate on the fruit.

The elderly woman said that when she explained her age and that she lived alone, they offered to put up her bed for an extra £.  The gran, who has two children, two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren, said: I bought an expensive bed, I thought I might as well - it will be the last bed I buy at my age wonapost it. They said they drop the bed in the bedroom and thataposs it. They said aposdue to the covid problem we arenapost assembling anythingapos. If theyaposre coming in and simply dumping the bed you would have as much chance of getting the virus from that as you would to make it up. They said itaposs simple to make it up, itaposs only about four screws. I said aposlook Iaposm , I live alone and thereaposs no way I couldapos. She added: Thereaposs no way I could lt the heavy head board and lt the mattress. I donapost think anyone living on their own could. They then said aposjust a minute, well for another £ we can come and do it later in the monthapos. Itaposs not that Iaposm squabbling about £ - itaposs the fact I wasnapost told when I purchased the bed. The woman said she asked for the bed to be delivered when her son and grandson were visiting the area, but claimed Barker and Stonehouse said it was not possible. She explained the firm suggested taking back her £ delivery fee and asking a relative to hire a van so they could pick the bed up and put it together, which she described as absolutely ridiculous. The woman said her newly decorated bedroom now has furniture in it but there is an empty space as the bed has not been delivered yet. Fortunately, she lives in a three-bedroom property and has beds in the other rooms which she can sleep in. She said that her family are unable to help her put it up on the next available delivery date so she has been left in limbo. The woman, who is still considering whether to pay out the extra cash, said: I think itaposs silly. Iaposm a very fit -year-old but there could be some that arenapost. They could have delivered it and they wouldnapost know what to do about the bed just dumped in the room. It could be very dficult for somebody in the same position as me. A spokesperson for Barker and Stonehouse told Teesside Live they were incredibly sorrythe additional delivery charge was not communicated at the time of purchase and that the issue was not resolved quickly and easily. They said they will waive the assembly charge and arrange a time to deliver and assemble her bed as soon as possible. The Mirror has contacted Barker and Stonehouse for comment.

It took almost a year, but she was finally reunited with themDelilah was about six weeks old when she was found by Kelly Walker Image: Kelly Walker   SWNSByMellissa DzinziDoug WhitbreadChiara Fiorillo:,  Nov | comments A hairdresser has spent almost £, to bring two feral cats she found in Turkey to her home in the UK.Kelly Walker, , visited the seaside resort of Antalya in November last year and during her trip she came across the felines, Delilah and Harriet. The woman, from Barnsley, South Yorkshire, started setting up feeding stations to try and win the catsapos trust and eventually brought them to a local vet for medical attention.She told Yorkshire Live : This vet looked at me like I was stupid. He said [of Delilah] aposshe’s only about six weeks old.She’s got parasites and sheaposs got all these dferent issues. She might not even live because she’s quite close to deathapos.  Kelly paid £, upfront to get Delilah and Harriet vaccinated, neutered and looked after at the veterinary surgery while she ed to England using cash she had saved up for a home deposit. She said: I’d saved up to buy a house. That money wasn’t just for spending on nothing but I just couldn’t leave these poor little souls like that with nobody to help them. I thought, aposwell, it’s not that badapos. People in this lockdown have been buying dogs for like thousands of pounds and Iaposm actually helping two cats. Kelly planned to fly to Romania on January , then to Istanbul, and finally to Antalya, where she would collect the cats from the vet and take them to the UK with her. However, due to strict lockdown rules in Turkey, she was now allowed to leave Istanbul Airport for days. While trying to find a solution to leave the airport, she slept on the terminalaposs seat, with no shops or restaurants open where she could buy food. Eventually, she ed to the UK and was advised to either let the kittens back onto the streets or put them to sleep. Luckily, Kelly found a pet hotel where Delilah and Harriet were looked after for a fee while she waited toonce more to Turkey. On October  this year, Kelly was finally reunited with Harriet and Delilah for the first time in nearly a year in Antalya after flying out to take them home.When she went to the airport, however, she was prohibited from flying again due to strict export protocols on live animals. Kelly said: I went to the airport with the cats, obviously, to get myself back to the UK, and I was told point-blank, ‘This is not possible. You cannot fly these into the UK from hereapos. I’d spent £, by that point so I was just totally defeated. I went from one airline to the other airline asking, and basically, getting the same reply. Kelly ed to the UK without the cats, then contacted an animal rights group that operated an international pet courier service from Turkey via Bucharest. The journey took place from October  to October , when she received confirmation the two cats were arriving at her home. Kelly said she does not regret spending her house deposit on Delilah and Harriet as she feels like she has done the right thing. She explained: I absolutely love animals. They’re my passion. I know that I spent that money, and I don’t make a lot of money. I’m only a hairdresser - but it made me feel like Iaposd done something worthwhile.

The dynamic duo have now won the GMB Young Fundraiser Pride of Britain Award Image: CollectByMatt RoperFeatures writer:,  Nov | commentsThe Pride of Britain audience was captivated by best friends Hughie Higginson and Freddie Xavi, who together have raised more than £, for the Manchester Children’s Hospital. The incredible feat began after Hughie, ten, was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia last September and began three years of treatment at the hospital. To say thank you he signed up for the hospital’s charity’s fundraising walk, but on the day was too ill to take part, so pal Freddie, , devised his own fundraising challenge, running km every day in the  days before Christmas. The two boys, both from Manchester, were joined on stage by Good Morning Britain’s Ben Shephard and Susanna Reid, who asked Freddieit was hard to keep going with his running challenge. “I knew that Hughie was going through a harder time. What I was doing was nowhere near as hard,” he replied.  “The bond between us is unbreakable, we’ll be friends forever,” said Hughie. The pair shared another unforgettable moment when Ben, knowing how Hughie loves singing and is a fan of YouTube star KSI, asked the youngster to sing one of his songs in front of Simon Cowell and Alesha Dixon. As he started singing, KSI himself sneaked up behind and surprised him. “I just want to say how proud I am of both of you. You are both strong-minded, strong willed and all you have been through, it’s so inspiring,” said SKI, who was joined by his own pal, Olympian Mo Farah, to hand over the award. Speaking after leaving the stage, the excited boys - who KSI had just invited to play a game of FIFA with him - said they would be taking their Pride of Britain award into school on Monday. Hughie said: “It amazing, it’s an honour to even be here never mind to get the award, it’s so good.” Mo said: “It’s incredible to see how much running, the courage and the commitment they have at that age. To do it for one of his best friends, theres no words to really describe it.

Manager, Keiran Leach, has challenged those to eat the mammoth steak in  minutes - or fork out £. for the entire meal. So far, the feast has only faced one challenger, who was thrashed by the spread. Keiran said: I think he did well, but the fact that he did well and only got that far shows how hard it would be to complete because you do have to finish everything.  I think it would be one in a million for someone to be able to with the size it is. This is not Kerianaposs first rodeo with a dinner competition, after he previously hosted a oz Tomahawk steak challenge. He and the pub owner finished that steak challenge victoriously. But the failure of his first ever challenger at the oz steak has certainly not lured away any interest. Calls have been made from across the country - as far as Stoke, Cumbria and Scotland - to grab a chance at defeating the mighty meat feast. Many on social media have voiced their support of the challenge, but some voiced their concerns about it being seemingly wasteful and unhealthy.  Kieran said: I understand the point of it because it is a considerable amount of meat for one person, but itaposs them that are choosing to do that. From a business point of view weaposre trying to get publicity but we do understand itaposs a lot of meat for one person. If any hungry munchers want a chance to complete the epic steak challenge, they have until the end of November to try it out.

Carol said: “The night will be a proper celebration.” Here, we reveal some of this year’s inspirational winners...Letime Achievement – Rosemary Cox, , WolverhamptonSuccessfully campaigned to set up the first Organ Donor Register in the UK, helping to save thousands of lives.  After their -year-old son Peter died in  following a brain tumour, Rosemary and John Cox saw the need for a register for people who wish to donate their organs. Peter had asked before his death for his organs to be used to help others and his sacrice saved or transformed the lives of  people.Have your say on this story in the comment section But his parents found that although patients in need of a transplant were listed on a central NHS computer, there was no equivalent register for potential donors.Over the next five years, the couple from Wolverhampton and their daughter Christine launched their campaign, travelling the country fundraising, lobbying politicians and creating awareness for their cause.Their efforts culminated at the  Conservative Party Conference when Christine made an impassioned plea from the  for a register of donorsapos wishes.Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley pledged there and then to set up an NHS Organ Donor Register, which launched on th October .  Today the number of people who have registered their organ donation decision on the NHS Organ Donor Register has reached over  million or % of the UK population. Meanwhile, since the register was established on the th October , over , people have donated their organs after their death and over , deceased donor transplants have taken place. Rosemary is now . Her husband John passed away in , but their son’s legacy lives on and she continues to campaign to promote the benefits of organ transplantation. When the NHS marked the register’s th anniversary in , it was revealed it had saved or transformed , lives. And over the last  months, NHS Blood and Transplant facilitated nearly , transplants. Special Recognition – Rob Allen, , NorthamptonFounded Sands United, an inspirational network of football teams where men who have lost babies and young children can come together to grieve Rob and his we Charlotte’s third child Niamh was stillborn, days before her due date in . They were helped through their loss by the stillbirth charity Sands, but at one meeting, Rob counted  women and three men. Realising that grieving dads were finding it dficult to reach out for help, he organised a charity football match to raise funds for Sands, but also giving men an opportunity to come together and talk about their loss. The one-off game, featuring bereaved fathers, grandfathers, uncles and brothers, raised £,, but the emotional benefit for the players was even more signicant.  And so, Sands United was born, and entered a local league in Northampton. But Rob’s impact has spread far wider. Inspired by his example, there are now more than  Sands United teams across Britain. E ach team’s kit is embroidered with the names of the babies they have lost, and hundreds of men, and their families, have been empowered to open up about their loss, and support each other through sport.This Morning Emergency Services Award – Stephen Warton, , CumbriaPart-time firefighter risked his le to e to the rescue of a teenager who had been submerged in icy waters for more than  minutes. Kacper Krauze, , had been attempting to swim across the River Eden in Appleby-in-Westmorland in February .The weather was unseasonably warm, but the icy water sent his body into shock, and he sank to the bottom of the river.Appleby fire and rescue officers, who are retained with full-time jobs including butcher and mechanic, were the first emergency responders on the scene. Crew manager Stephen, a painter and decorator, and firefighter John Bell went into the river, supported by colleagues David Anderton, Michael Dowding, Bradley Hall, James Wood and Neil Aitken from the river bank.  After a short search they located Kacper under two to three metres of water. Unable to e down and reach him due to his safety gear, Stephen went against protocol and took off his flotation equipment and helmet so he could e fully and bring the boy to the surface. Kacper had been underwater for about  minutes, and when Stephen brought him to the bank, he was in cardiac arrest and severely hypothermic.

The six men and women representing Prof Sarah Gilbert’s team received the loudest and longest standing ovation of the night, as the audience applauded them for nearly two minutes. The team throughout lockdown, fitting in -hour days around home-schooling to create the world’s most potent weapon against Covid in record time. By the end of July , more than a billion doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine had been delivered to more than  countries worldwide. The team received their gong from TV icon Stephen Fry, who said he “would have walked  miles over broken glass barefoot to present the award”.  Afterwards, Stephen said he was the one who was starstruck. “I couldn’t believe I was going to speak to them,” he said. “I’m never going to meet Edward Jenner, who gave the first smallpox vaccinations, or Fleming who discovered penicillin, but these people are of an equal status. “It’s extraordinary what they did.” Dr Catherine Green said: “It’s lovely to have the recognition of the British public. We are just doing our job but to be recognised for doing your job under extraordinary circumstances feels really momentous.” Comment MORE ON Gee WalkerPride of Britain AwardsEducationLoveSchoolsTeenagersOn Instagram\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Our Pride of Britain newsletter brings you awards news and inspiring stories - dont miss out!Sign me upInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

To plough on. But as soon as I arrived in Basel, Switzerland, it felt clear that the Swiss have a very dferent approach to death. They are practical and pragmatic, but compassionate. Assisted dying has been legal there since . And when I asked Lecircle’s president Dr Erika Preisig why Switzerland is the only country in the world which allows non-residents to travel there to die, she replied simply: “Because it is a human right.”Dr Preisig’s foundation helps around  people per year to end their le and people travel from across the globe to die on theirown terms. The fear is that the day-to-day work of helping people to die would make you detached or callous to the enormous responsibility that comes with facilitating someone’s death. However, it never felt like this was something the team at Lecircle undertook lightly. Indeed, Dr Preisig herself was acquitted of murder in  over assisting the death of a woman in her s with a psychiatric condition but was found to have violated the handling of the drug Sodium Pentobarbital. An appeal court upheld her acquittal this year, but the case could still be appealed again in the Swiss federal courts. You could see the weight of the court case on Dr Preisig. Yet despite the personal risks, her commitment to Lecircle and her belief in assisted dying remains unchanged. She even invited Dawn, her friends and I to her home for dinner on the night before she died. It is hard to know what to say to someone on their last night alive and I was feeling ill-prepared for dinner table conversation. Part of me expected to see some kind of release in Dawn – some freedom that comes from knowing you have nothing left to lose. But she had no grand plans for her last night on this earth and seemed quiet and reflective. On the short walk from the car back to her hotel, Dawn stumbled, wincing in pain, as her hip failed her. So the following morning when I watched her struggle slowly up the steps to Lecircle it was moving to think these were the last few steps she would ever make.  Lecircle is laid out much like an apartment – art on the walls, a big sofa, a table and a bed in the corner. It is not sterile like a hospital, but never-the-less as I stepped into the room it was strange to consider how many people died there. I confess at first I found Dawn’s choice harder to understand than some others. She did not look like a woman at death’s door and her complaints were ied and complex.  But I have never walked a day in her shoes and it was clear to me that she had fought to get the death she wanted. The assisted dying debate is serious and complex. It is high time it was given proper scrutiny by UK lawmakers. Leaving seriously ill Brits feeling they must travel abroad – sometimes before they wish – is not a long-term solution.Comment MORE ON HospitalsCourt caseHuman rightsAssisted suicide\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Now, still seriously ill, shes encouraging people to get vaccinated after meeting her daughterSaskia first got to hold her daughter Betsy Mae Blackman weeks after giving birth to her in a medically-induced coma Image: Caters News AgencyByCally BrooksLaurie Churchman:,  Nov | commentsA young mum who gave birth in a coma after contracting Covid has finally met her daughter – nearly a month later. Saskia Lane, , became seriously ill with Covid in August and was admitted to intensive care. She was eight months pregnant, and had to undergo an emergency caesarean while in an induced coma. Doctors at the Princess Royal Hospital in Haywards Heath decided to keep Saskia in an induced coma during the birth so sheaposd have the best chance of survival. After three weeks, Saskia was woken up. She and met her daughter Betsy Mae Blackman met for the first time on September . Saskia was also reunited with her partner Lee Blackman, .  Saskia, from Partridge Green, Sussex, is now urging other pregnant women to have the Covid vaccine after she initially decided to turn it down. Saskiaaposs mum Becky Knight, , explained: Saskia was diagnosed with gestational diabetes whilst pregnant with Betsy and decided not to have the vaccine initially after worrying about the impact it could have on Betsy. I encouraged her to get the vaccine but unfortunately, she had her first jab a few days before contracting Covid so it wasnapost effective. She initially felt worn out and tired but eventually, she began experiencing breathing dficulties and on her third trip to AE, they admitted her to the intensive care unit. The doctors decided that Betsy should be delivered immediately to help her body have the best possible chance to beating Covid and she was aware of this. But after putting her to sleep, doctors decided to keep her in an induced coma to allow her body to rest and recover. We were all absolutely devastated - we couldnapost go in and visit her because she had Covid and Lee wasnapost able to meet Betsy until she was a few days old. When she was finally woken up, she was extremely confused and didnapost understand what had happened, so I reassured her that Betsy was fine and healthy and we gave her, Lee, and Betsy the chance to meet for the first time privately.  Betsy was born healthy and weighed lb oz. Saskia is still at Guyaposs Hospital in London receiving treatment after severe damage to her lungs. She was transferred to three dferent hospitals as medical staff battled to keep her alive. Saskia was put on a le support machine at St Thomasapos hospital in London for two and a half weeks – and her mother said this ultimately saved her le. Becky said: Sheaposs been in intensive care for nine weeks now and we canapost wait for her to come home. Her lung has collapsed so itaposs only half the size of a normal one.She also has sepsis in her lung and has had a total of six drains put into her lungs, as well as a tracheotomy which left her unable to speak for three weeks when she woke up.Becky added: While she was in a coma, we were able to see her only through video calls and it was devastating seeing her in that state. Saskia is now terried of going home because she doesnapost want to catch Covid again. Itaposs traumatised her, Becky said. Saskia wants to encourage everyone to get the vaccine following her experience. The family praised the hospital staff who have cared for Saskia, saying the nurses and doctors went above and beyond to look after her and save her le. Saskia is also a mum to Eliza Blackman, whoaposs nearly two years old. The family are fundraising to support Lee and Saskia once she s home from hospital.

Lesley and fiancé Giuseppe Salamone were making plans to marry and wanted to hold the big day later this year.  Giuseppe also took time to look after his ill partner and their -year-old daughter, Mia.Giusseppeaposs brother Luca, said : Lesley started chemo but she was throwing it all up and it had to be stopped because of complications.She couldnapost eat and eventually couldnapost drink so the only option was radiotherapy. Luca said despite the struggles, they received a phone call from Lesley just weeks ago, with positive news that the cancer was shrinking and felt her throat was finally opening up. However, Lesley suddenly deteriorated and after being admitted to hospital, doctors identied a chest infection and clot on her lung. Sadly she died on October . Luca said: We had a glimmer of hope. They found a chest infection and they were going to sort it. But then suddenly, within days, she was gone. We really thought she would come threw it, at least in the short term, so in that sense it came as a big shock. Due to the struggles over the last year, Luca, who lives in Buckley, said his brotheraposs family has aposdebts racked upapos and himself and his we Sally decided to take action to help. A fundraiser was launched to help cover the funeral costs, which surpassed the £, target within days. He added: Their backs were up against a wall. You can be surprised at how nice people are when they see someone in need. I wasnapost expecting the target to be reached within days. Lesley was very strong willed, probably the worst patient the hospital had ever seen. It was like she didnapost take it seriously, she thought it would be a blip in the grand scheme of her le. She was so tough.  She just carried on. She was a hard worker, ambitious and very honest. She has always done things for people in need, was always there to help. They were going to get married this year so my brother is also mourning what could have been.The fundraising page has already raised over £, to help towards the funeral costs.Luca wrote on the page: May I ask for anyone who knew Lesley, to come forward and donate even the smallest amount to help raise money for her funeral. Giuseppe and Mia donapost want anything extravagant , but just enough to give Lesley a dignied and memorable send off. When I visited Lesley at hospital a couple of months ago with Giuseppe and Mia, we sat in the car park and planned in our heads for the future. Lesley said something like In a few months, we can all get away somewhere and have a good laugh, forget about all this silliness! I hope youaposre somewhere special Les. Pour yourself a glass of red and weaposll all be there with you soon enough, for that family getaway. We all love and miss you dearly.

Despite this, her caravan is one of  motorhomes on the Manor Park site that have fallen into a dangerous state of disrepair. The “appalling” living conditions include condemned gas boilers, no insulation, extreme black mould, holes in single glazed windows and collapsing floors and walls. Deborah suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary lung disease and described how her living conditions compromise her health, as well as that of her sonaposs, Alex Lendrum, who also resides on the site and suffers from mental health problems.  She said: “In winter, I wake up with a wet mattress and sheets from the damp in my room, so I have to sleep in the living room area. You can see your own breath, itaposs that cold. That can’t be good for anyoneaposs health. My son suffers from depression and he is raising his -year-old daughter here. His caravan is worse than mine. “I take a lot of pride in my home, and it’s one of the better ones, but you feel like you’re fighting a losing battle when the wallpaper keeps falling down due to mould. “Everyone is living in fear. It is a very tense and worrying time. Not only have we been living in awful conditions but we now face being made homeless before Christmas. People have families, pets and responsibilities. It’s our whole lives.” The site was recently bought by Shadwell Parks Limited, who employed PLL Management in October to manage it on their behalf. They are due to be inspecting all units this week. Any that have deteriorated beyond reasonable repair will be condemned as unfit for private residence. The residents in condemned properties will be served a  days’ notice to vacate. The company that now owns the site says it is in the process of acquiring more units.  A spokesman from PLL said: “We are seeking to resolve the issues Shadwell Park has inherited from the previous site owners. “Unfortunately, due to the current post-Brexit climate, it is proving extremely challenging to secure reliable, professional and experienced contractors for emergency call-outs. Additionally, the industry is experiencing ious shortages in unit and building materials. “Shadwell Park is in the process of acquiring new second hand units for the site which should be available in December .” When contacted, the previous site owners, Hills Brothers Residential and Leisure Parks, said: We have nothing to comment.

Susan Williamson, , ended up in hospital with salmonella infantis. After a number of follow-up tests, she was diagnosed with heart failure. She has now instructed public health experts at Irwin Mitchell to investigate whether her heart condition was linked to her illness. She said: “The last few months have been an absolute nightmare. It doesn’t seem to be coming to an end anytime soon. When I fell ill after eating the pork scratchings, I thought it might make me a bit sick and off colour for a few days.  Never did I ever imagine that it would lead to salmonella and I would still be suffering two months on. She added: I’m still very unwell now and have been told I’ll need medical care for a long time. Susan, of Blackhall Colliery, Co Durham, bought a multipack of five bags of pork scratchings on Aug. . She fell ill on Aug.  and started to suffer with sickness and diarrhoea and her symptoms also included hallucinations. On Sept. , she attended hospital where she was given a chest X-ray. An ECG established that she had suffered heart failure and she was readmitted to hospital.  She had been due to go on holiday with husband Paul but two motorhome trips were cancelled because of her illness. The Food Standards Agency recalled packs of Mr Porky, Jay’s and The Real Pork Crackling Company, all Tayto Groupaposs products, which expire before February, . The cases of salmonella were reported between Sept.  and Aug this year, the agency said. The illness usually causes fever, diarrhoea, and abdominal cramps. Symptoms typically resolve themselves. But they can be more severe and lead to hospitalisation, especially in the very young and those with weakened immune systems.  Irwin Mitchell is representing eight people who fell ill after eating the snacks. Clare Pearson, their specialist public health lawyer, said: “Susan is among those diagnosed with Salmonella Infantis and other illnesses after consuming pork scratchings. “Not only is salmonella a serious bacterial infection, it can often lead to long-lasting health problems, and even death. Salmonella has been known to have the ability to lead to cardiovascular complications. We’re now investigating whether Susan’s heart failure is linked to her salmonella infection. Snack giant Tayto said they took safety of their products aposvery seriouslyapos and swtly halted production, issuing a product recall. “Since then, with the relevant agencies, we have conducted a detailed investigation and implemented changes before restarting production, said a spokesman. “We have been in touch with a number of consumers directly and are working closely with them to resolve their concerns.

Producing a vaccine normally takes  years but the dedicated staff put in -hour days – and lived off Mini Cheddars and Bounty bars – to turn it around in just  months. On Saturday, their hard work was ­rewarded with the Special Recognition prize. Six members of the -plus team of leading scientists accepted the award during the Daily Mirror Pride of Britain Awards in partnership with TSB at the Grosvenor House Hotel in London. As they took to the stage they were greeted by a rapturous applause, and the team joked they weaposre not comfortable with the attention from the crowd.  Pride of Britain co-host Carol Vorderman said presenting the Oxford team with their prize was a particularly poignant moment for her. Speaking on the Good Morning Britain, she said: I donapost knowyou felt it in the room but when the Oxford Vaccine Team came out, I think everybody was emotional and the standing ovations went on and on and on. I think everybody felt every emotion of the last  months kind of came to the forefront really and they came as such modest scientists. Carol was also overjoyed to have all of last yearaposs winners there too as they only had a virtual ceremony last year.The Oxford-AstraZeneca team were fuelled by vending machine snacks as they worked around the clock to develop their le-saving Covid jab. Among those walking the red carpet on Saturday night was Dr Catherine Green, who manufactured the first vaccine. She said: “The vaccine was always ­going to be the way out of the pandemic and here we are! “We wanted to walk the red carpet as a team because that’s what a was – a team effort. The university went into lockdown so we were living off the ­vending ­machines, eating Mini Cheddars and Bounty bars. “It feels great to be finally letting our hair down after the last  months.” And Prof Theresa Lambe, who co-designed the vaccine, added: “I know it sounds really boring but we were just doing our day jobs and we hoped it would help. We’re really glad it did so people can come together again on an amazing night like this.” Dr Sandy Douglas, the brains behind the process of mass-­developing the jab, said: “To receive this award means a lot ­because more than anything, it was the most amazing teamwork.”  So far, one billion doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine have been delivered to  countries around the world. It is estimated to have saved more than , lives in the UK alone. Dr Douglas added: “We knew we had a chance that we might be able to do something extraordinary. “Me and my colleagues knew thousands of people were going to die each daywe didn’t act fast, so every day we were faster, the more lives we saved.” Watch Daily Mirror Pride of Britain Awards, Tonight, ITV, pm.

And it was in the camaraderie of the Oxford team who kept each other going to discover a world-changing vaccine.  In the year that Pride of Britain lost its own founder Peter Willis, who died in June, the nation’s most emotional awards was even more poignant than usual.Coming against the backdrop of a Britain emerging from a global pandemic, it felt more important than ever to be together celebrating the best of us.At the last event in , Covid did not yet have its name. In , as Carol Vorderman thanked Oxford Vaccine team, it was the first time in  years anyone had seen the Awards co-host reduced to tears.  A room full of famous faces, from ITV ’s Simon Cowell to Hollywood’s Sharon Stone, and even Sausage from the Masked Singer, got to its feet for one of the longest standing ovations the Pride of Britain Awards, in partnership with TSB, has ever seen. After taking place last year as a virtual event, Pride of Britain was only possible in person this year because of the hard work of vaccine scientists and NHS vaccinators – many of us with the Oxford jab fighting our bodies’ daily battle against the virus.Hearing how the team had lived from the University’s vending machines, desperately missing their own families, only added to the sense that these were ordinary people achieving extraordinary things.  The team brushed off achievements which have led to . billion doses of the Oxford Astra-Zeneca vaccine being given across the world. “It’s lucky that mini-Cheddars and Bounty bars are two of your five a day,” Prof Cath Green OBE laughed. Prof Sir Andrew Pollard added: “We’re all pretty ordinary people, just doing our normal jobs in an unusual time”. As Stephen Fry, presenting them with their award said: “It’s only true heroes who think they aren’t heroes.” He added: “I would have walked across broken glass to give you this Award. Never have the three words ‘Pride of Britain’ been more deserving.”  Actress Sharon Stone spoke for many, as she overcame the tragic loss of her baby nephew to give a Prince’s Trust Award to Syrian refugee Hassan Alkhawam. “It’s really lovely to see people again,” she said. “I’ve been crying all night”. Fittingly, for a year when we remembered Peter’s passion in creating and sustaining these awards, this was an incredible group of winners.There was something unmistakably Pride of Britain about Stephen Wharton, a -year-old painter and decorator from Cumbria. In his role as part-time firefighter, he had been called to the River Eden, where teenager Kacper Krauze had sunk to the bottom, his body shocked by the icy water. Stephen is a ‘wading first responder’ but seeing Kacper’s distraught parents he took off his safety equipment so could e down to save his le.“We do get some ops discretion,” he said wryly, but “ing down  feet is pushing the bounds a bit.”  Seven-year-old Harmonie-Rose Allen, a quadruple amputee, was completely unfazed by the bright lights.Listening to her karaoke duet with Ed Sheeran, Simon Cowell told Harmonie-Rose her singing was better than Ed’s, but “don’t tell him”. Harmonie looked puzzled. “He’ll probably see it,” she said, politely. One of the most moving moments of the night came as Rebecca Carless and Jamie McCallum were surprised by the cameras, thinking they were Pride of Britain guests rather than winners. The parents were behind a Carpool Karaoke-style video, #WouldntChangeAThing, celebrating  children with Down’s Syndrome – that went viral. The extraordinary people kept on coming. -year-old Max Woosey, who has spent more than  nights sleeping in a tent gted him by a dying neighbour – through bitter storms and even with Covid – raising £, for his local hospice. Campaigning sisters Amy and Ella Meek, aged  and , who set up a kids charity to help fight plastic pollution. Hughie and Freddie, best friends who have raised more than £, since Hughie was diagnosed with Leukaemia. Some of the money has gone on slushies for young patients enduring chemo. Rob Allen who founded Sands United after he noticed no men were in the support groups for families struggling with baby loss. Rosemary Cox, , who successfully campaigned to set up the first Organ Donor Register in the UK in memory of her son Pete.Former Royal Marine and triple amputee Mark Ormrod who has gone beyond what should be possible to raise over £, for veterans’ charity REORG.

Pride of Britain is also a legacy – for Peter, our friend and colleague, whose inimitable presence shone through the awards. As Lloyd Embley, Group-Editor-in-Chief of the Mirror, told the audience: “This was his baby - and we are going to do everything we can to look after it for him.” When Peter first came up with the idea for Pride of Britain, people thought he was mad.Which celebrities would turn up to see a bloke who’d rescued someone or to recognise the achievements of some scientists   Then Paul McCartney turned up at the first ceremony, just months after losing his we Linda, and the rest is history. The sky was the limit for Peter, who would have certainly wanted Lennon too. years on, Pride of Britain continues to attract Britain’s A-list with its song for unsung heroes.

Today, children in the P year group at Castleview Primary School, Edinburgh, took part in the aposWear a skirt to schoolapos day. The initiative follows the campaign aposLa ropa no tiene géneroapos - aposClothes have no gender’ - which was launched in the Spanish city of Bilbao after Mikel Gomez, , was referred to a psychologist for wearing a skirt to class.Castleview students came up with the idea which saw pupils and teachers wear skirts today in support of equality and to help teach tolerance and respect, Edinburgh Live reports.Miss White, a teacher at the primary school, wrote on Twitter : P have been learning about the importance of breaking down gender stereotypes.We have organised a ‘Wear a Skirt to School Day’ to raise awareness of #LaRopaNoTieneGénero campaign. This will be on Thursday th November and we’d love everyone to get involved!

Rewind eight months, and queues in Scotland’s second largest city also made the headlines: a viral photo showed  people waiting for a soup kitchen in snow and subzero temperatures. At Taxpayers Against Poverty we are campaigning for a future where the queues we witnessed in February are a thing of the past. But the climate crisis means that future is under threat. Those standing in line for food are likely to be the least responsible for carbon emissions, but they will be disproportionately affected. A study by Oxfam found the richest  percent of the world’s population produce twice as much carbon as the poorest  percent. It’s not hard to see why - in the UK  percent of flights are made by a wealthy  percent of the population. Over halfdon’t fly abroad at all. The report concluded that “the over-consumption of a wealthy minority is fuelling the climate crisis, yet it is poor communities paying the price”. Covid showed us that where we work is an important determinant of our exposure to risk, and the same is true for the effects of climate breakdown. Itaposs easier to avoid exposure to high temperatures or extreme weather when you work in an office. And that exposure continues in the home - those on lower incomes are more likely to live in crowded accommodation prone to overheating.Poorer communities are also concentrated in urban areas - such as in Haringey, where our founder Rev. Paul Nicolson lived - where temperatures run even higher due to the Urban Heat Island effect.While the wealthiest can buy air con in the summer and turn up the heating in the winter, the three million in the UK already experiencing fuel poverty do not have that luxury. Housing charity Shelter has found that over a quarter of renters already live in homes they cannot adequately heat. The effects of extreme weather are even more pronounced for those without a home. In the year before the pandemic, an estimated  people died while sleeping rough in London. That’s a figure that will only increasewe do not take action: climatologists predict extremely cold winters will be on the increase. What are we asking of our leaders as they meet this week  Firstly, we need to bring people who are experiencing poverty to the table. Our leaders are overwhelmingly white, able-bodied and male - we all need to have a voicewe are to overcome the greatest threat humanity has ever faced.Secondly, those with the broadest shoulders should contribute the most - the principle on which Taxpayers Against Poverty was founded. We cannot expect households already struggling to make ends meet to pay extra on their fuel bills to subsidise green energy.Thirdly, we need to reduce the vulnerability of those experiencing poverty to climate breakdown. This means ensuring that everyone has access to decent, well-insulated housing.  We know that the transition to a low-carbon economy will involve changes to the job market - but we have been made all too aware during the pandemic that our welfare system is not fit for purpose for those out of work. That is why we are calling for a minimum income standard, below which no-one in or out of work is allowed to fall. Calculated by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, it is set at what the public consider to be enough for a socially acceptable standard of living. The recent energy bills crisis has shown a frightening hint of what is to come as the climate emergency takes hold - a minimum income standard would change as costs do, paid for by a tax on the very wealthiest in our society. Climate breakdown will affect everyone, but not everyone will be equally affected. We need our leaders to act now to ensure that both unchecked carbon emissions and queues for soup kitchens become a thing of the past.

Becca McFarlane, , from Dumbarton in Scotland, had exchanged messages with the man on several occasions on the social media .They had agreed to go for a drink, the Daily Record reports, but she was horried after she received a disturbing message.She said the man told hershe came near him wearing the outfit she had on in her Instagram pictures, he would rape her. The sickening message says: Iaposve thought about you when w****** lol put it this way seeyou came anywhere near me with that outfit you wore with the skirt and stockings youaposd be getting raped.  Becca told the Daily Record: “It made me burst out crying and I was incredibly anxious for the rest of the day. “I don’t understand, even thinking it is disgusting, never mind typing it out and pressing send. “We had chatted a few times and he seemed nice at first. “He askedI would be up for getting a drink with him sometime, I said yes and he followed with those messages. “I can only count myself as ‘lucky’ that he said that before I actually met him. Shaken Becca blocked the man on social media and reported the messages to the police.  She says the incident has left her extremely anxious to meet men online in the future. She added: I’m definitely more scared to meet men online. This has given me a fright. aposI don’t deserve to be threatened with sexual violence for the way I dress. I think it’s absolutely abhorrent men think they can speak to a woman like that. Becca says she is lucky the man showed his true colours before she went to meet him in person. She is urging other women to come forward and report similar incidents. She added: In today’s society, men think they can say whatever they want behind a phone screen. I doubt he would have said it to my face. With the recent spikings in Scottish venues, I would encourage women to come forward and report these things. Itaposs definitely worth it.

The anonymous -year-old girl said that her family had organised a large birthday party for when she turns , and had invited scores of people to attend - and booked a banquet hall to host them all. The girl said that she had been a strict vegan for more than two years, and decided that she only wanted plant-based food served on her big day - despite the non-vegan guests. But now her family have been left ided and her parents are in the firing line, as some guests didnapost seem happy about the lack of meat on the menu. What do you think about the all vegan menu  Let us know in the comments...Taking to Reddit, the woman said: I have been a strict vegan for over two years now. I am doing it because I believe in animal rights and I know what the meat industry does to the environment. I will not be part of the problem. We are catering food for this party and I explicitly said that since it’s my birthday party I want the entire menu to be vegan. My parents said they will order any vegan dishes I want, but will also provide non-vegan dishes to accommodate other guests. I am not happy with this.It’s my birthday party and one of my requests is that people not consume animals for this one night - it’s one night, it’s not that big of a deal.My parents are not budging and saying that not everyone is vegan and they need stuff to eat, but it’s my birthday party - I don’t think it’s going to kill anyone to have to eat vegan for the night. After sharing her story online, other Reddit users were quick to comment their opinion - and some picked fault with her logic. One said: I am so far from vegan, you’d probably hate me. That being said, I love vegetarian and vegan food. I don’t even have meat every day. No one will die for going one meal without meat and animal products. It is your birthday party and everyone can enjoy the food that is provided. People who complain that they didn’t get a proper meal without a big old steak or deep-fried chicken are absolutely narrow-minded.

And another wrote: Your parents are being pretty generous catering for  people for a th birthday. With that amount of investment, they deserve to have some say in the menu. You are ok to have preferences here… but ultimatelyit’s on their dime, they should make the call. If you disagree, feel free to pay for it yourself. While a third added: If one of your meat-eating friends was to throw the same party and invite you, would you expect them to have some vegan options for you Do you have a story to share  Weaposd love to hear all about it.

Chy Brown, , from New York City, US, spotted the letters at a local flea market and decided to track down the recipient – who was nicknamed aposCookieapos in the letters. The romantic notes were signed by aposBobbyapos, who appears to have been a soldier at the time, who tells his lover that he is thinking of her and sending love, as well as keeping her up to date with his goings-on.Chy, who regularly trawls charity shops and flea markets to find heirlooms that she can , couldn’t use the census to track down the address, so she took to Google to find Cookie’s real name.After finding her on MyHeritage, she saw she had close family and was possibly still alive.For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. The blogger then contacted a close cousin of Cookie, who she was able to send the letters to. I saw them in the flea market and instantly knew these were something special, Chy said. I always pick up love lettersthey have a name or address on them. This was the first time I was able to give back an item directly to someone who was still living versus a descendant or close family member. I normally pick up items over  years old, but I can’t turn away from love letters. What makes these even more special is that the recipient never received the letters in the first place.” Cookie was thrilled to be given the lost letters – which she had never received. Her cousin said: Cookie was an airline hostess in New York back then. She remembers this person and she’s in tears, according to my mom, who was FaceTiming her. Cookie said she is enjoying reading the letters with a big smile. Chy, originally from Washington DC, has made ing heirlooms from flea markets a hobby and she has sent back around  antiques to the closest family member alive.Scrolling through public family trees on Ancestry, Chy is more often than not able to reunite the objects with their owner’s descendants.  Chy added: My dad is a genealogist and growing up I saw him help families from around the world for free, not only help them with finding heritage but also help them fill in the missing pieces of their family history. Because I am an interior decorator, I thrt often and it always broke my heart seeing a family heirloom in some box at the flea market instead of with its rightful family. One day I just decided to use what I know of genealogy, what my dad taught me, and to use it to trace the items that I find at thrts and flea markets back. Once I started I never stopped. I try and stay in contact with as many people to who Iaposve ed heirlooms to as possible! Despite some of the heirlooms costing hundreds to buy and post, Chy never asks for a cent from the family members she s the items to. Cha said: I spend my own money on this and postage and never ask for repayment from families. I have spent well over , as NYC flea markets are a bit expensive. I’ve also spent hundreds on postage.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Beyond that, it isnapost something that many of us can admit to thinking long and hard about. Have you ever wondered why that was  Neither had we... but apparently there are a few reasons for it. Knickers were first introduced during the Renaissance to maintain hygiene, to protect women from the cold and to save them from aposembarrassmentaposthey fell off a horse. But when did bows begin to feature on them, and why  One intrigued person took to Reddit to get to the bottom of the mystery.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. Why do so many panties have that little bow on the centre front  Where did the tradition come from  they asked, and a number of people were quick to share their assumptions. The most common reason was that the bow kept underwear from falling down as elastic was yet to be invented. One person commented: Now  Because itaposs cute, itaposs feminine, it evokes innocence, and it makes it really easy to tell which side is the front when dressing hastily in the dark.  As for the roots of the tradition  It comes from pre-elastic days when your underthings were held in place by a bit of ribbon threaded through the eyelet lace at the tops. The little bow is where you tied that ribbon, and of course, itaposs in the front because thataposs the easiest place to do something like that. But this isnapost the only reason. Centuries ago, before electricity was invented, women would often have to get up before dawn and dress in the dark, or by candlelight. So, the bow was used to distinguish the front from the back. Now, the piece of ribbon is seen more as a decoration. Another person said: I always wondered what that damn bow was there for. I always found them a bit stupid but I learned to ignore them. Itaposs interesting to know why they were there to begin with . Holy s**t you just blew my mind, said a third. Others admitted they always remove the bows themselves, with one person commenting: I always take them off. While another said: Theyaposre really annoying. I always tear them off.

File image Image: Getty ImagesByNatalia PenzaWilliam WalkerNews Reporter:,  Nov | commentsA man died after jumping into a lake to escape a swarm of bees only to be attacked by piranhas. The -year-old was fishing with two friends by the shoreline of a lake in Brazil when they were targeted by the insects. All three jumped into the piranha-infested water but one of them was unable to get out and drowned. Specialist ers found his face, his ears and part of his body had lacerations left by the killer fish after recovering it around  feet from the shoreline. The horror incident happened on Saturday in a rural area of Brasilandia de Minas, a municipality in the state of Minas Gerais in Brazil around  miles north-west of Rio de Janeiro.  The -year-old victim, whose body was recovered a day after the man went missing when ers with specialist equipment were mobilised, has not yet been named. His family have been given permission to bury his body after investigators ruled a tragic accident had occurred and there was no sign of any crime. It has not been made clear whether the fisherman drowned before he was attacked by piranhas or the fish played a part in his death by preventing him swimming to safety like his two friends. One of the pals was the owner of the land where the tragedy occurred. The municipality is now home to around , people and boasts a tropical climate with temperatures ranging from  to  degrees Celsius. Around  species of piranhas are said to inhabit South America’s lakes and rivers. They have one of the strongest bites found in bony fishes thanks to their large jaw muscles attached closely to the tip of the jaw. Swimming near fishermen is said to increase the risk of attacks due to the commotion caused by the struggling fish and the presence of bait in the water. Nearly  piranha attacks, all involving single bites to the feet, were reported in the first half of  in an articial lake near the city of Palmas in central Brazil.

Of course he is.“Andhe keeps scoring goals, I don’t see why not.”The United States are on a high having won the CONCOCAF Gold Cup on August  with a - defeat of Mexico in the final in Nevada.Ramirez made a scoring international debut in Berhalter’s first game in charge of United States in a -

Surely they could be stored at the council depot, especially when not getting used.The grass throughout was cut and the loose grass was left lying in thick clumps, asit was a playing field, instead of a cemetery.This cemetery, in years past, won an award but I fail to see the same happening again with things as they are of late.The grass around the stones, at the sides and back, is not being cut, resulting in long grass and often ferns growing there are bollards lying loose which will undoubtedly result in damage to a car there are cones at the main car park, restricting the amount of cars that can park there, and there are also cones at the portable cabins the road in the cemetery is a total disgrace!I in no way blame the men who work in the cemetery as they are doing as they have been told to do, and I know they are taken from the cemetery to work where, resulting in those men not having the time to complete the work which is necessary to keep the cemetery in the condition it should be.I understand about cutbacks and lack of funds but I am wondering where the money goes that people have paid for plots and or council tax, which increase and yet there are even more cutbacks.My biggest concern is where has the respect gone The following is in response to the debate about the state of the A over Rest And Be Thankful in the Scottish Parliament last Wednesday, October .I fear that the current Rest and Be Thankful is a catastrophe waiting to happen and I think that there needs to be an urgency from the Scottish Government to deliver a medium-term and long-term solution for the people and businesses of Argyll.The Cabinet Secretary discussed the necessity to collect data for the end long-term solution and, as much as I appreciate that, it should have been done years ago and I completely understand the frustrations felt by businesses and travellers alike.The Cabinet Secretary also invited all contributing MSPs to walk the forestry road with engineers and I am going to write to him to accept that invitation."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week october 15 2021","story":"One morning recently, I heard the following two news items on the radio:First was a report about the petrochemical plant at Grangemouth which emits tons of CO into the atmosphere.

Look out for the third and final piece in next week#s paper.Wartime needs created additional traffic and pressures for the two main operators, thereafter, once into peacetime, West Coast Motors and its rival were able to modernise their fleets.McConnachie#s stole a march by bringing Kintyre#s first double decker to the town in , buying two more in the late s which older residents may still remember. However, failing general economics resulted in West Coast acquiring this business in . These #deckers never ran for West Coast and it would be more than  years later before such buses entered their fleet.Liveries iniably provide a recognisable identity for any bus operator and West Coast is no exception. The flowering of the company#s one surely came to its climax in the s with the flowing combination of ivory, red and maroon, set off by polished body trim lines and wheel embellishers. Styles continue to evolve but, in the opinion of this writer, no other Scottish operator has chosen a more distinctive colour scheme than West Coast which still uses two of those principal colours, ivory and red, which it bestowed on its buses  years earlier.During the s and s, West Coast#s modern vehicles were typical examples of their time. In the latter period, new bus grants were obtainable under certain conditions resulting in some splendid coaches being purchased.In post war years, the company gradually built on its service network in Kintyre and Mid Argyll. In , it picked up the East Loch – West Loch Tarbert mail ship link from Tarbert-based Dickies then the Tarbert – Kilberry service from McEacherns in , the Lochgilphead Tayvallich service from McLachans in  and, perhaps somewhat prophetically, the Benderloch-based operations of McColls in .Without doubt, the most signicant developments in West Coast#s history occurred in the - period. During the s, William Craig had attempted to introduce a direct Campbeltown to Glasgow service but failed in this ambition then and at later attempts. Finally, in , these hopes were realised when the company became a joint operator, with Scottish Citylink, of the through service between the two locations.The s continued to see signicant developments. Firstly the acquisition, also in , of the buses and Mid Argyll routes operated by Lochgilphead-based Stag Garage. This was followed, a year later, by the purchase of the old MacBrayne garage in Ardrishaig, giving West Coast an excellent base in the area.The early s saw a further involvement in Oban when West Coast secured responsibility for the Oban to Glasgow service and by  it had acquired the former Alexanders depot in Oban enabling it to build further on its already signicant presence in Argyll.Since , the rate of change has quickened further. West Coast secured the Cowal and Bute area contracts and depots in  and when Bowmans, the long-established Mull services operator retired in , West Coast added this to its portfolio. Their Oban base allows vehicle and manpower deployments on Mullneeded. Of the major Argyll islands, only Islay remains independently served by the Mundell concern of Tarbert, whose lorries are also a familiar sight in the county."},{"url":null,"title":"leader october 22 2021","story":"It is dficult to understand the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party#s decision not to allow Donald Kelly to represent the party at the  local election – especially when it will not provide a reason.Councillor Kelly said he met #a wall of silence# when asking for a proper explanation or justication, and the Courier has had a similar experience, with numerous attempts to gain answers proving unsuccessful.We asked why the decision was made and why Councillor Kelly was not made aware or given notice of itit was in relation to his Argyll First membership and why support from former Scottish Conservative leaders Annabel Goldie and Ruth Davidson appeared not to be taken into consideration.If we do receive answers to our questions, we will share them with our readers but until then we can only speculate.Surely Councillor Kelly and the people of South Kintyre deserve to know.Congratulations to Fraser Cursiter and Katie Webster who got engaged this week after Fraser proposed on the beach in Carradale.We wish the couple, who are soon moving to Australia, the best of luck for the future we hope theyto visit the place that has earned a special place in their hearts."},{"url":null,"title":"photograph of the week october 22 2021","story":"It shows one of a family of otters that lives on Gigha going for a dip in a freshwater pool.Keith looked for a likely spot for otters to visit and set up his Campark T camera in expectation and his efforts were well rewarded.As well as otters, this spot also attracted geese, a heron, a mink, a young buzzard and a iety of small birds.If you have a photograph you would like to share, please email it to editor@campbeltowncourier or send it via the Courier#s Facebook page."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week october 22 2021","story":"As we crossed the bridge, we were excited to see the island’s beauty.At first though, we had to take our friend’s word for it, as rain, low cloud and failing light obscured most of it from view.

Skye’s scenery is stunning.In John, chapter , verses -, the apostles told Thomas that while he had been away, Jesus had physically appeared to them.

scrapped.Argyll and Bute Council agreed to continue the Ring and Ride service whilst it takes time to look for an alternative.Councillor Rory Colville, community spokesman for Argyll and Bute Council, said: #We are responding to the concerns of the people who need this service most.#It will continue in its current form for as long as it takes to make an informed decision about changes and we will make people aware of what will be provided in the future.#No timescale was given as to whether this would be before next May#s elections.In last year#s budget, the service was earmarked for the axe at the time, but the council gave assurances alternative arrangements would be put in place.Councillor John Semple said: #I am glad to see that finally some common sense seems to be filtering through – only three weeks ago the administration voted to continue with this cut.#I will continue to look after the interests of the most vulnerable people in this community as the administration#s plans materialise.#Argyll First councillor Donald Kelly was a prime mover in establishing and expanding the service and is totally against the withdrawal.He told the Courier that this is only a stay of execution for this service and assurances are needed that the service will be retained in the long-term.TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGOThe MP for Argyll and Bute has pressed for additional facts about the ferry service between Campbeltown and Ballycastle.During last Friday#s Scottish Questions in the House of Commons, Mrs Ray Michie pressed the Secretary of State for Scotland, Mr Michael Forsyth, for more information.She said: #I welcome the announcement, at long last, of the ferry service, although I am disappointed Caledonian MacBrayne was not allowed to run it.#She went on to ask: #For how long does Sea Containers have the contract  Is the Secretary of State expecting the service eventually to run all year, so that we can build up not only a good tourist service, but a good import and export trade #Mr Forsyth responded: #It was important for the new route to be established. It was possible to achieve that with a private sector operator taking the risk, which means that CalMac#s available public capital and running costs can be deployed on maintaining other services and introducing new ones.#It must be the right approach to use the state#s nationalised service and the scarce resources available to it as wisely as possible.#That was what lay behind our thinking.#He went on to say that he would write to Mrs Michie regarding the contract.Mrs Michie commented: #It is important we get the full facts about this service so that we can judge whether this really is value for money as the government claims.#FIFTY YEARS AGOEmergency sea rescue services in the Firth of Clyde could have been victims of another hoax on Friday.For the Campbeltown leboat, three naval vessels and a Dakota aircraft spent nearly six hours searching Kilbrannan Sound and its approaches for a boat reported to have been sinking off Campbeltown.The drama began at lunchtime when the Campbeltown leboat mechanic, Mr Alistair Gilchrist, intercepted a wireless message which read: #Mayday Boy Danny sinking  degrees off Campbeltown.#Kildonan Coastguard Station, Troon Leboat Station and Portpatrick Radio also picked up the call the boat#s name, however, was not mentioned in the message received by the other three stations.Then a full-scale search operation swung into operation. Along with the leboat, the warship HMS Eastbourne, Fishery Protection vessel Vigilant and the US Navy ship Victoria began combing the area between the south of Arran and Kintyre.They were joined later in the search by a Dakota aircraft from Prestwick.An RAF patrol vessel stood by at Campbeltown.Campbeltown leboat reported the discovery of a large piece of timber. It was, however, too heavy to lt aboard and it was not thought to be part of possible wreckage.Then, after six hours, the search was called off. The plane and boats had covered an extensive area of sea.Coastguards using mobile equipment searched along the shores of Arran and Kintyre.Nothing was seen.Police in Campbeltown began investigations into the matter shortly after the leboat put to sea their enquiries are continuing.ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOAuchencorvie United, one of the teams that came into being in the rural area as a result of the formation of sports clubs among agricultural workers, made their first appearance in local competitive football last Saturday afternoon.Drumlemble supplied the opposition and had a comparatively easy victory by four goals to nil.Auchencorvie had several players of some promise but, as a whole, the team was sadly wanting in science and judgement and the lesson of their first experience should impress on them the fact that mere lusty vigour is not sufficient to win on the football field.In the first half, Drumlemble did not press their undoubted superiority unduly, being content with a one-goal lead at the interval. James Munro was the scorer.In the second half they added three more to the total, D Thomson having two and A Kerr one.At the opening concert of the winter session of the Scottish Clans# Association of London Mr Charles Kelly, a well-known Campbeltown vocalist, sang with much success.His pieces were The March of the Cameron Men, The Lea Rigg, I Passed By Your Window and Until.In all these numbers he had a fine reception, especially from Campbeltonians in the audience of whom there seemed to be a goodly number.A correspondent writing with regard to the work of the association says that there are probably a good many Kintyre folk in London who would find it a great pleasure to join the Scottish Clans and take part in society#s many s.The atmosphere is truly Scottish and the gatherings have a homeliness about them which appeals greatly to the newcomer."},{"url":null,"title":"late late show as pupils cruelly lose out","story":"Campbeltown Pupils were left to rue the loss of another late goal last Saturday after an th-minute strike resigned the Kintyre Park side to a narrow defeat away to St Peter#s.Playing at Renfrew FC#s impressive New Western Park, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils started the match brightly, despite another y injury list which saw several established first-team players ruled out and others unavailable due to work commitments.The Pupils took the lead before the -minute mark when John McCallum, playing at right wing in a --- formation, reacted quickest to Craig Lamont#s long throw-in, which bounced up on the dry synthetic surface, to guide a deft looping header beyond the reach of the St Peter#s keeper.The Kintyre side had efforts from left winger Scott Souden and lone striker Sean Grady go wide of the target – the latter#s promising effort deflected wide of goal – while McCallum was released by Grady and rounded the hosts# keeper only for his cutback to be cleared for a corner, away from the feet of the waiting Souden.At the other end, the Pupils had a new-look combination in defence, with full backs Craig Lamont and Michael McKinlay, and Ross Souden in central defence partnered by -year-old debutant Antonio Akoulli, studying in Scotland and hailing from Thessaloniki, Greece.The four had to be alert to the efforts of St Peter#s wingers Menzies and Lewis on either flank, and did so very well for the opening  minutes until a lapse in concentration saw Scott Lewis – signed from fellow WoSFL side Benburb FC for a transfer fee – ghost along the edge of the box and slot home a fine finish across keeper Alasdair Ferguson with his weaker left foot, into the young keeper’s bottom left-hand corner to make it -.Impressively, the Pupils rebounded from this setback and scored with  minutes played when Liam Renton, playing as an attacking midfielder, latched onto a ball from Scott Souden just inside the hosts# box, and turned his marker sharply before guiding a left-footed shot beyond the keeper#s grasp.All the while, the Pupils# deep-lying midfield pairing – a real contrast of experience levels between skipper Keith Mitchell, and Conner Brown beside him making his club debut – continued to break up play and keep the Feathers Inn-sponsored side moving forward.Despite this, there was a further scare in the visitors# penalty area when St Peter#s hit the bar from a powerful volleyed shot on the stroke of half time, but the Pupils# lead remained intact.Into the second half, though, the Pupils were pegged back in the opening few minutes of proceedings, a clever turn and precise shot beyond the grasp of Ferguson providing a fine equaliser.Admirably from a Pupils point of view, there was no onslaught from the ision#s third-placed team, also boasting a loan signing from Greenock FC, another semi-professional side, in their midfield ranks, and smatterings of semi-pro experience across their starting .However, what followed instead was a gradual build-up of pressure which the Pupils had to work increasingly hard to contain, the home side#s willing forwards continuing to probe for openings in the visitors# defence.The hard-working pair of Matthew Lang and Calum Houston were introduced in attack for the Pupils with  minutes remaining, with fresh legs required as the embattled visitors# energy levels began to wane.But even the dismissal of Lewis for the hosts, hitting out at Renton in reaction to a robust tackle from the latter, which earned the Pupils man a booking, couldn#t deny the Paisley side a late, late winner, a long ball going undefended in the Pupils ranks, and slotted home in the box by a St Peter#s midfielder to give them all three points, and in turn deny the Pupils a probably deserved draw.The Pupils# management team conveyed thanks to the travelling players for their efforts, even in defeat, and will surely take consolation from giving experience to young talent in the side, with four club debuts made in the space of week – after -year-old Andrew Renton#s appearance against Rossvale on cup duty – and within that clutch, a potentially very useful defensive addition.Tomorrow , the Pupils are at home to Glenvale FC, from Paisley, again on league duty, with kick off at pm.For more information, visit @PupilsAFC on Twitter or Campbeltown Football on Facebook."},{"url":null,"title":"leader october 29 2021","story":"More must be done to prevent the continued spate of

It is understood that at least one class within every year group except P is affected by the spread.The two authorities confirmed, this Thursday evening, that any decision to shut the school would be a collective one — but it has not yet reached that point. The only caveat to this is in the eventuality that staff numbers are so depleted, the council has no option but to close Papdale, or reduce teaching hours.As of early this afternoon, only two members of staff have been confirmed to have the virus.In a statement this evening, OIC#s executive director of education, leisure and housing, James Wylie, said: “The school remains open, and the situation is being managed and monitored with the advice and guidance of NHS Orkney Public Health.“Our aim is to keep the school open as long as possible to provide learning for those pupils who are well. We are working on a daily basis with Public Health evaluating the numbers and should it reach a point whereby it is felt necessary for a partial or full closure, then that decision will be made collectively.“However,staffing falls to a point whereby it is no longer possible to safely manage the pupil numbers in school — as happened in Stronsay Junior High School recently – then we, as the council, can take the decision to close or offer a rolling programme of reduced hours across the school.“I, again, thank everyone for continuing to answer our plea for children who are well and not displaying any COVID symptoms to still attend at school as this is vital for their education and social wellbeing.”The authorities have confirmed that a further ten PCR tests have also been requested in connection with Papdale Primary at this time, and contact tracing is ongoing. Parents with children attending the school have been urged to undertake twice-weekly lateral flow testing on both themselves and their little ones.Of the  pupils at the school,  pupils were absent on Thursday from the school — a drop from  on Wednesday. According to OIC, the reason many of these pupils remained at home was due to the COVID- situation —  whether for the purpose self-isolating, or because they are symptomatic and awaiting a PCR test. A small number of parents have also chosen not to send their child children to school.Warn and inform letters have now been sent to the parents and carers of children in all affected classes within P, P, P, P, P and P, in line with Scottish Government and Public Health guidance.In addition, Papdale#s head teacher, Wendy Bowen, has written to all parents to reassure that all necessary mitigating steps are being taken.Across Orkney, a total of  new positive cases have been reported in today#s daily figures.According to NHS Orkney, these cases are a mixture of household contacts, travel and working environment contacts amongst others. The health authority has has said that this continued rise in cases is not unexpected.NHS Orkney consultant of public health, Sara Lewis said: “We are continuing to see cases riseand this is another day of high case numbers for Orkney, but we want to reassure the community that we are managing these cases.#Although, we do ask that you continue to follow the guidance in place, ensuring good ventilationindoors, washing hands, wearing face coverings and keeping a safe distance from those out with your household,possible.

So we founded Lindus Health to do just that and to enable the next generation of healthcare companies.Mr Beckwith said: ldquoTraditional clinical research companies are dinosaurs.ldquoTaking part in a Covid vaccine trial was like stepping into a time machine.ldquoThis was one of the best-funded trials in history but research was done on pen and paper and participants had to go into hospital at the height of the pandemic to fill out forms.ldquoWe founded Lindus Health to make it easier for patients to participate in research, and accelerate the development of new treatments.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I sense every step of that journey.In , Borrodale school closed for that last time. And yet,we listen, we can still hear from Borrodale, forever young and in timeless cèilidh.Put in this kind of context we can sense how community relationships are deeply connected to change. The continuity of change, both backwards and forwards, gives us insight, and proximity with dferent and creative ways of being in place.Times change and culture continues. It is important to be hopeful in this and to not perceive the shadows of the past as a fading le force but as an index pointing to future relationships.The second social experience is of course relates to the typical excitement of guising at Oidhche Shamhna. Originally, Oidhche Shamhna was integral toour sense of place and the cultural relationships of le cycles, including time itself.Oidhche Shamhna is ‘the night of summer’s end,’ and in our older understanding of the festival, it reveals that new le begins in darkness and is born into light similarly, just as days used to begin and end at dusk, the move to the darker half of the year is also the continuation of a cycle and is equally about new beginnings.In the deeper memory of Gaelic cosmology, this is the beginning of the new year, and of course, November is still called ‘an t-Samhain’ in Gàidhlig.My earliest memories of guising would be like those of many, our dad taking my sister and I for a few easy visits to long-standing neighbours and family friends. Even though we would only go to a few houses in those early days, the intensity and excitement of the initiation on a cold dark night was largely experienced through the warmth and kindness revealed in the relationships that emerged in the evening.Guising, then, is a form of cèilidh, where the encouraging and nurturing of the gt of exchange is more intangible than we always appreciate. It is that dimension of sustaining or developing relationships that seems most important to me.One of the first homes we would have visited on my first Oidhche Shamhna will have been that of Angus and Effie Ross in Fàsach. In my early years it was a home that we probably had more time in than any house outside of my family.It was a home I visited everyday day walking home from Borrodale school. My errand was to collect our newspapers from the post office, but it wasn’t a job, it was a relationship.Our family had a strong connection with these Rosses. In , Angus Ross’ great-uncle Alexander Ross had been nominated to deliver the prepared statement for the Fàsach croftersto the Napier Commission.In it he testied specically to the clearance of my great-great-grandfather from Ramasaig , who was removed along with all the families from Ramasaig around -, to make way for sheep, congesting further the land in Fàsach. So, it is from at least that time that our family had been friends.Alexander Ross’s brother, Kenneth Ross, also Fàsach, had among his eight children a first son called Neil and a second called Norman, both being young boys during the land wars....I did know Margaret but I never did met James Ross as he had a fatal accident in the early s in Glasgow, outside the BBC.Angus Ross and Seanair worked together on the County lorry . We saw Angus and Effie a lot and my mum credits him with telling her and her siblings about their Cameron origin story in Glendale.A mysterious tale of a man with long grey hair and a beard living in a cave at Scornandaoine on the east side of Loch Poolteil. He had arrived from Lochaber, in the mid to later s, likely a refugee from any number of social problems in the Gàidhealtachd of that time.Even now it still sounds like a good Halloween story. Certainly, my mum has never been a fan of beards in the family, but we were always welcomed by the Rosses in the ceilidh ethic of everyday relationships., Tobraichean a’ Gluasad .Here, ‘Tuam’ talks about his knowledge of local wells the necessity to move between dferent wells for sustenance, and so there will be times when a well in one place becomes dry while water would be plentul in another well.A resource such as Tobar an Dualchais helps us think about our many and ied relationships with culture, place, and time.Part of the intangible gt to be found within the archives, and also with the people and places around us, is how the wells of culture will be found popping up with all their potential, anywhere and everywhere, carried through the voices and relationships we nurture and come to know.Importantly, this can activate new dialogues, experiences, and gestures of cèilidh, and to embrace these for all in our communities, our futures, wherever the wells emerge."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20211103_133201-scaled.jpg","title":"climate action group to hold skye bridge march and vigil in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, which formed shortly before the pandemic, is inviting people to show their solidarity with activists across the world in highlighting the need for urgent change to tackle the existential threat of climate change.Speaking to the Free Press during the first week of the COP UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Skye Climate Action coordinator Anne MacLennan described the summit as “critically important” and was keen to emphasise that Saturday’s event should take place in a peaceful and respectable manner.#Saturday is the Global Day of Action for Climate Justice, and the themes are that we need to act, and act urgently, and there is also the huge justice issue,# she said.“The idea for the march is for us to leave the Kyleakin-end at  noon and to walk over the bridge by the pavements and walk back again.#It is really important that the event is peaceful, family-friendly, and respectful of everyone # I think it is a demonstration of the kind of society we want to head towards being, so we can live in a sustainable and equitable way.

Let the conversation lead to tangible action.”Meanwhile, in a first for the UK, the company has just completed a pilot electrolyser project based in its treatment works at Kinnegar near Belfast.The results show the potential to produce both green hydrogen, which could be used to power buses and other heavy transport, and oxygen, which could increase the capacity of its wastewater treatment plants.Related topicsNichola MallonDepartment for InfrastructureCOPMore On Nichola Mallon‘A lack of leadership shown’ by flying to climate summitDerry’s Foyleservice to be fully zero-emission by SDLP and SF play the blame game over end to £ uplt in Universal Credit Premium‘Protestant Action Force’ claim Ards bus hijacking start of NI Protocol campaign PremiumHospitality chief Colin Neill beefs up security after torrent of threats and abuse over stance on Covid-Most ReadUnmasked: Woman who stole £m and nearly bankrupted Tyrone firm… Julie McBrien blew cash on luxury lestyle while pretending to have cancer‘We’ve had enough’: Urgent reform of caravan legislation needed because of ‘unfair practices’ by some holiday park owners, MLA saysKenneth Branagh’s ‘Belfast’: ‘The people of Belfast are honest and expect honesty in ’, says directorBelfast man who stole fish from neighbour#s pond is jailedTeenagers arrested as violence flared after Brexit Protocol rally in Belfast facing ‘le-changing consequences’ warn policeTop VideosPlayVideo: Loyalist activist Jamie Bryson reacts to overnight violence during anti-protocol protest at Belfast interfacePlayVideo: Jamie Dornan dismisses bond rumours at Belfast premiere PlayVideo: Belfast film premiere with red carpet royalty Latest Northern IrelandPatients are suffering ‘undignied deaths’ waiting in AE for bedsWoman dies following Co Antrim road crashRetired RUC officers seek apology after SDLP Policing Board member Doleres Kelly ‘sectarianism’ remarkSir Kenneth Branagh attributes pandemic creating circumstances to write BelfastPeace has to be won every day, says Sir Kenneth BranaghLatestCouple and neighbour killed as Texas barn explodesMP murder case due for Old Bailey hearingWhat the papers say – November Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo to star in Wicked filmTaylor Swt to promote new album with US late-night TV appearances,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

That many retired police officers continue to refuse to cooperate with legacy investigations to this day speaks for itself.“The transformation of the RUC to the PSNI has been an outstanding success and whilst policing continues to be challenging, I think the hard work and efforts of the those involved in implementing Patten’s recommendations deserve credit”.Related topicsDolores KellySDLPPolice Service of Northern IrelandMore On Dolores Kelly PremiumPSNI isn’t a cold house for female officers, insists Chief Constable Simon ByrneWe must do more to encourage Catholics to join PSNI, insists KellyStephen Barriskill murder probe: Man remains in custody after fatal Portadown shooting PremiumConcern as complaints against PSNI rise by over % in the space of a year PremiumMurdered mum Katrina Rainey saw daughter die in accidentMost ReadUnmasked: Woman who stole £m and nearly bankrupted Tyrone firm… Julie McBrien blew cash on luxury lestyle while pretending to have cancer‘We’ve had enough’: Urgent reform of caravan legislation needed because of ‘unfair practices’ by some holiday park owners, MLA saysKenneth Branagh’s ‘Belfast’: ‘The people of Belfast are honest and expect honesty in ’, says directorBelfast man who stole fish from neighbour#s pond is jailedTeenagers arrested as violence flared after Brexit Protocol rally in Belfast facing ‘le-changing consequences’ warn policeTop VideosPlayVideo: Loyalist activist Jamie Bryson reacts to overnight violence during anti-protocol protest at Belfast interfacePlayVideo: Jamie Dornan dismisses bond rumours at Belfast premiere PlayVideo: Belfast film premiere with red carpet royalty Latest Northern IrelandPatients are suffering ‘undignied deaths’ waiting in AE for bedsWoman dies following Co Antrim road crashSir Kenneth Branagh attributes pandemic creating circumstances to write BelfastPeace has to be won every day, says Sir Kenneth BranaghHealthcare staff exhausted and fearful ahead of winter, nurse saysLatestWill Smith recalls moment he ‘lost everything’ in Oprah Winfrey interviewCouple and neighbour killed as Texas barn explodesMP murder case due for Old Bailey hearingWhat the papers say – November Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo to star in Wicked film,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

A big part of the Caravans Act NI  is having an association to protect tenants but nobody has managed it before.”Another caravan owner, Cathy Graham, who has been a tenant at Mourneview Caravan Park in Newcastle for almost  years, set up a petition two years ago, securing thousands of signatures.

This is a massive issue. It may be too late for me, but I want the message out there.“I don’t want anyone to fall into the same trap. It’s heartbreaking to hear about people watching their caravans being towed away.”Read MoreTenants stunned at leading caravan park’s % price hikeAs reported in the Belfast , Mr Allister attended a meeting on the north coast at the start of October after pitch fees at one of Northern Ireland’s biggest caravan parks were hiked by %.The North Antrim MLA was supporting the caravan owners who refused to pay the increase and instead planned to set up a residents association to challenge what they believe to be “exorbitant rates”.More than  people with caravans at Golflinks Holiday Homes —which is also known as Kelly’s — attended a rally at the Portrush site.Three weeks later, Glengormley woman Debbie Young told this newspaper that she was forced to leave Windsor Holiday Park in Groomsport because she couldn’t afford to upgrade her caravan when the lease expired.Mrs Young, whose caravan, bought on hire purchase, ended up costing £,, said she was devastated at having to give up the dream holiday home she’d worked for all her le.Unable to buy a new caravan, she revealed how she had to leave the Groomsport park, having sold her prized #van# for a mere £,.At one point, the mother-of-four said she was offered £, for her caravan, while, according to Windsor Holiday Park’s website, their new ones start at £,.“My caravan was as good as new there was no reason to get rid of it,” she said.“I’m heartbroken that I lost so much money.”Mr Allister said: “Many caravan users are either young families or elderly folk, who have enjoyed their caravan for years.“It is heartbreaking for them to be forced to give up what is central to their enjoyment of le, because they cannot afford the exorbitant financial demands being placed on them.”Mr Allister also said the current legislation “affords inadequate protection and requires reform”.“It is clear to me that the Caravans Act needs strengthened with protections akin to that afforded in the Business Tenancies Act and a move away from the unfair opportunities of the caravan owners enjoying only a yearly licence,” he said.“This sector clearly needs more protective regulation.“The Communities Minister, in response to a recent Assembly Question from me, has advised that she has belatedly moved to initiate the five-year review required under the Caravans Act which should have been completed in .“So, now is the time to step up organised lobbying on this matter.

It comes as part of the Northern Irelands Executives winter Covid contingency plans. The Executive said there was a need to keep as many sectors open to the fullest possible extent. First Minister, Paul Givan said doing that would depend on as many people as possible getting vaccinated.” googletag.cmd.push Just over % of people aged  and above in Northern Ireland had received one dose of the vaccine. Mr Givan said: Our vaccination rates are very good but there is still room for improvement.” Further Covid restrictions are due to be relaxed by the Executive onOctober . This will allow for nightclubs to reopen, restrictions on indoor dancing lted and the requirement to be seated in hospitality to drink and eat food will no longer be in place. Mr Givan said it was a fact of le that Covid remains an ongoing issue, and that the Executive needed to continue to find ways to manage the situation. The First Minister says that the Executive will launch a new public information campaign before the end of October to build on the need for all of us to keep making safer choices. He also said that there would be a focus on “flexible and hybrid working” in workplaces. Mr Givan set out a range of optionsCovid cases rise drastically or hospital pressures become “unsustainable” with the possibility of deploying Covid vaccine passports in high-risk settings, “ considered appropriate.” The Department of Health at Stormont is also working on a systemthis situation arises that would see the strengthening of self-isolation rules for close contacts of those who contract the virus and a re-imposition in law of social distancing in certain settings.

Speaking following the announcement by the Education Minister, the Foyle MLA said: Funding announced on Tuesday will support primary schools in providing much needed mental health support and counselling services in the short term. googletag.cmd.push The evidence is clear, more and more children are presenting with mental health issues and that is why we need to move beyond a pilot project and get proper support in place in our primary schools permanently. The Ministers announcement will really only help schools until March but the problems facing our children and young people will remain long after that. I am calling on the Minister to put in place a proper plan to tackle the mental health challenges in our schools and to move beyond these short term initiatives.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry law student convicted of fraud overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derrys railway station may no longer be with us by  should the alarming rise in global temperatures not be checked leading to water levels rising with parts of Derry submergedLocal NewsGlobal warming could wipe out Derry railway station along with Foyle and Peace Bridges by  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry law student convicted of fraud overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derrys railway station may no longer be with us by  should the alarming rise in global temperatures not be checked leading to water levels rising with parts of Derry submergedLocal NewsGlobal warming could wipe out Derry railway station along with Foyle and Peace Bridges by  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ieADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry law student convicted of fraud overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derrys railway station may no longer be with us by  should the alarming rise in global temperatures not be checked leading to water levels rising with parts of Derry submergedLocal NewsGlobal warming could wipe out Derry railway station along with Foyle and Peace Bridges by  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

The scheme is a recycling initiative which he had championed during his time as Environment Minister and has worked to progress in recent years. In response to an Assembly Question tabled by Mr Durkan, the Minister of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs , Edwin Poots reaffirmed his commitment to introduce the scheme, following the department’s joint consultation with DAERA and the Welsh Government. googletag.cmd.push The Foyle MLA said: “I’m pleased that work is continuing to progress a depositscheme for Northern Ireland. “This is a scheme which began work on during my time as Environment Minister, having seen their benefits in other countries. “Unfortunately, at that time my attempts were met with some resistance, both politically and commercially. “In February , the Executive supported my calls for the introduction of a depositscheme and committed to the North’s participation in a proposed UK-wide rollout. I welcome that the consultation process has been completed and welcome Minister Poots commitment to delivering this scheme and move towards a circular economy. “While awareness in recent years has improved where recycling is concerned, we are still not at the level we need to be. “A cash incentive under a Deposit Return Scheme, in my opinion, is the best way forward and will encourage an uptake in recycling. “Our throw-away culture is completely unsustainable and our planet is bearing the brunt of it. “In recent years, we have witnessed a growing realisation that action must be taken by governments, businesses and iniduals to address the damage being done to our environment. “I would like to see this scheme expanded to include cans and plastic bottles, building on the success of the carrier bag levy, to tackle the scourge of single use plastic on our communities. “I hope the Minister will revisit an all-island approach for this initiative but for now it is crucial that we push forward on implementing this environmentally transformative scheme without further delay. “ ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please just kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log   isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at DerrysBar  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsCounty Derry law student convicted of fraud overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derrys railway station may no longer be with us by  should the alarming rise in global temperatures not be checked leading to water levels rising with parts of Derry submergedLocal NewsGlobal warming could wipe out Derry railway station along with Foyle and Peace Bridges by  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices -

Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council confirmed it would be bidding for city status for Coleraine after taking a vote on the issue at tonights full council meeting. googletag.cmd.push The item had previously been discussed at a meeting of the Corporate Policy and Resources Committee, but councillors had deferred the decision to full council. Cllr Darryl Wilson There are plenty of fence kickers and nay-sayers. Ill grasp the nettle, said Cllr Darryl Wilson as he opened the debate. I had assumed that for somewhere to apply for city status, it needed to be a sprawling metropolis with a university and a cathedral and everything absolutely perfect. When I started to research I found a number of places that have had city status bestowed were small to medium-sized towns, one of which had , inhabitants. I think we should be aiming high and aspiring for better. When places are granted city status, there is a buzz that surrounds it which adds an extra element to the area. Cllr Wilson was then interrupted by DUP councillor Adrian McQuillan, who suggested he may be electioneering, a claim Cllr Wilson rejected. Its nothing to do with an election, he said. We dont need any back-chat, were in council, and some of us at least are aspiring to make the place better instead of making jibes and comments from the sidelines. Its our job as elected representatives to improve all the areas in this Borough. There are plenty of fence kickers and nay sayers, but I think we should be aspiring for better. Cllr William McCandless We are the cradle of civilisation. Independent councillor for Coleraine, William McCandless, said the bid was about the communitys vision for the town, rather than its current state. City status is a mark of prestige and pride for its citizens, he said. This is about vision, about where we see ourselves, not just now. This dovetails in with so many other projects and aspirations we have. We have a rich history we are the cradle of civilisation in Ireland with evidence of mesolithic man at the Mountsandel site. This is about vision and hope. Is there any other town more deserving in Northern Ireland  I dont think so. The meeting then discussed the possibility of the entire Borough seeking city status. A council official said this would be possible, and mooted Causeway Coast and Glens City Council as a possible re-naming option. After the cost of the bid was confirmed to be pound,, PUP councillor Russell Watton said he was open-minded about the bid. I wasnt too sure last week. I wanted to knowit would bring any benefit to the town, he said. Would it alleviate the absolutely dire social housing situation  If I thought there was any chance of it making a dference to us, Id be well for it. Council took a five-minute recess to allow councillors to discuss the issue among themselves, before ing to the chamber. Cllr George Duddy I hope this comes to fruition. DUP councillor George Duddy confirmed his party would support the bid, and hoped it would come with a revamped transport system for Coleraine. The vision of city status being bestowed upon Coleraine and the aspirations were building up by applying for this, I hope they come to fruition, he told the meeting. Every town centre at this moment is suffering, butwe are successful, one would hope the traffic system in and around Coleraine becomes more than what was described here two months ago. DfIsaidColeraine ever bid for city status, we would hope that the one-horse town traffic system would be greatly improved. If we are successful, we have to ensure all the funding we can get goes into the largest town, but we need to ensure our smaller towns and villages do not suffer as as consequence. After the disuccsion ended, the council voted on the motion to bid for city status.  councillors voted for the proposal and one against, while eight councillors, including all Sinn Feacutein representatives, abstained from the vote.

The adaptation which now reads, “You are now entering code red for humanity”, was created by activists from Zero Waste North West as part of the North West Climate Coalitions actions in the build up to the Global Day of Action rally and march on Saturday, November  at pm in Waterloo Place. googletag.cmd.push Jim Keys from Zero Waste North West said: “We wanted to use the wall to speak the reality behind the hype of COP , that our global leaders are still more focused on propping up a capitalist system that is destroying the planet than responding to the climate emergency we are in. “As the cradle of the civil rights movement, our struggle found strength in the global solidarity it won.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.  googletag.cmd.push   However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.  googletag.cmd.push   Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.  googletag.cmd.push   More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.     Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

On Saturday night, Derry once again flocked to enjoy a night of the Undertones – but this time it wasn’t just their music - but their big screen debut that was getting the masses excited. The legendary band and their family, friends, and fans gathered to indulge in a celebration of their musical careers in the premier of a fitting tribute documentary, featuring the man who made it all possible – DJ John Peel. The documentary, produced by local man Vinnie Cunningham and directed by Tom Collins, traces the band right back to their first performances in school halls, when the lads had barely swapped their nappy rash for pimples.  Dr. Sid Dempsey, third from right, Head Consultant, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with members of the Undertones, Billy Doherty, John and Damien ONeill. Also included are Manus and Majella Martin.  The youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O’Neill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. The film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from ‘Teenage Kicks’ to ‘My Perfect Cousin’ to ‘It’s Going To Happen’. The fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O’Neill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. “The way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage,” he said. “We really have no bad feelings towards him.” The banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. Caroline O’Neill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. “He’s going to kill me for saying this,” she said. “But he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back.” Not so good-natured abuse The laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. “There were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street,” admits Damien O’Neill. And Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home: “It was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn’t buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash.” The Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. Paul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal’s shoes described the documentary as “brilliant, really enjoyable”. John O’Neill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets: “I think it’s great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big.” The screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over pound. Manus Martin who lost his own son Anthony to cancer last year expressed his deepest thanks to all involved, particularly Vinnie Cunningham and Tony Collins. Two versions of the film have been compiled and the BBC will broadcast the -minute ‘short version’ by Perfect Cousin Productions Ltd, in association with the BBC, Arts Council and Irish Film Board.

Also included are Manus and Majella Martin. uc strong ue uc p ue r n ucp ue u uc p ue r n ucp ueThe youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O ursquoNeill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. uc p ue r n ucp ueThe film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from  ulsquoTeenage Kicks ursquo to  ulsquoMy Perfect Cousin ursquo to  ulsquoIt ursquos Going To Happen ursquo. uc p ue r n ucp ueThe fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O ursquoNeill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoThe way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage, urdquo he said.  uldquoWe really have no bad feelings towards him. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ueThe banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. uc p ue r n ucp ueCaroline O ursquoNeill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoHe ursquos going to kill me for saying this, urdquo she said.  uldquoBut he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ue ucstrong ueNot so good-natured abuse uc strong ue uc p ue r n ucp ueThe laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. uc p ue r n ucp ue uldquoThere were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street, urdquo admits Damien O ursquoNeill. uc p ue r n ucp ueAnd Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home:  uldquoIt was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn ursquot buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash. urdquo uc p ue r n ucp ueThe Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. uc p ue r n ucp uePaul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal ursquos shoes described the documentary as  uldquobrilliant, really enjoyable urdquo. uc p ue r n ucp ueJohn O ursquoNeill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets:  uldquoI think it ursquos great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big. urdquo u uc p ue r n ucp ueThe screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over  upound. uc p ue r n ucp ueManus Martin who lost his own son Anthony to cancer last year expressed his deepest thanks to all involved, particularly Vinnie Cunningham and Tony Collins. u uc p ue r n ucp ueTwo versions of the film have been compiled and the BBC will broadcast the -minute  ulsquoshort version ursquo by Perfect Cousin Productions Ltd, in association with the BBC, Arts Council and Irish Film Board. uc p ue r n ucp ue ucspan style ud \"color: #ff \" ue ucstrong ueClick the Next ugt tab to go through the gallery uc strong ue uc span ue uc p ue r n ucp ue[articlepreview id ud \" \" link ud \"https:www.derrynow video multimedia  watch-the-story-of-the-undertones-.html \"] uc p ue r n uc  ue r n uc  ue r n uc class ud \"vc_story_telling \" data-position ud \" \" data-story ud \" \" ue r n ucp class ud \"vc_story_telling_title \" ue u uc p ue r n uc class ud \"vc_story_telling_text \" ue r n ucp ue ucspan style ud \"color: #ff \" ue ucstrong ueThe Undertones Premier. . .

On Saturday night, Derry once again flocked to enjoy a night of the Undertones – but this time it wasn’t just their music - but their big screen debut that was getting the masses excited. The legendary band and their family, friends, and fans gathered to indulge in a celebration of their musical careers in the premier of a fitting tribute documentary, featuring the man who made it all possible – DJ John Peel. The documentary, produced by local man Vinnie Cunningham and directed by Tom Collins, traces the band right back to their first performances in school halls, when the lads had barely swapped their nappy rash for pimples.  Dr. Sid Dempsey, third from right, Head Consultant, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with members of the Undertones, Billy Doherty, John and Damien ONeill. Also included are Manus and Majella Martin.  The youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O’Neill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. The film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from ‘Teenage Kicks’ to ‘My Perfect Cousin’ to ‘It’s Going To Happen’. The fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O’Neill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. “The way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage,” he said. “We really have no bad feelings towards him.” The banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. Caroline O’Neill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. “He’s going to kill me for saying this,” she said. “But he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back.” Not so good-natured abuse The laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. “There were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street,” admits Damien O’Neill. And Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home: “It was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn’t buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash.” The Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. Paul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal’s shoes described the documentary as “brilliant, really enjoyable”. John O’Neill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets: “I think it’s great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big.” The screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over pound. Manus Martin who lost his own son Anthony to cancer last year expressed his deepest thanks to all involved, particularly Vinnie Cunningham and Tony Collins. Two versions of the film have been compiled and the BBC will broadcast the -minute ‘short version’ by Perfect Cousin Productions Ltd, in association with the BBC, Arts Council and Irish Film Board.

The comments were made during a Government press conference on Tuesday October th, after the announcement of the countrysrevised reopening plan, where Taoiseach Micheaacutel Martin confirmed all of the restrictions set to ease from Friday,  October and the restrictions that will remain in place. googletag.cmd.push The pandemic isnt over yet. Unfortunately, were going to have to get through at least another winter before we can safely say that its behind us, Varadkar said at the press conference. The situation took a turn for the worse about two or three weeks ago and since then, weve seen rising case numbers, rising hospitalisations and rising ICU numbers.So, were not where we hoped to be or expected to be for  October... were not past the peak of the Delta wave. Later in the press conference, he said the government would be meeting with unions and employer representatives to update the Work Safely Protocol. Well have that done over the next couple of days and essentially what were saying is that a staggered and phasedto the office is possible, he explained. So, people going back to the office for a specic business purpose, like a meeting or a training, for example, or inductions - that is allowed. But certainly people who can work from home and want to continue to work from home, their employer should facilitate that. But bear in mind, there are also people whove been working from home with a laptop on a bed for  months now and they really want to get back to the office. Andthat can be facilitated,they can be in an office on their own or in an office where theyre socially distanced from other people, that should be facilitated too. But the fullto offices as we knew them, that will be next spring, added the Taacutenaiste. The announcement from the Taacutenaiste comes days after Deputy Chief Medical OfficerDr. Ronan Glynn advised the public towork from home where possiblethis autumn and winter.

Triumph Hurdle winner Quilixios faces five rivals including fellow Cheltenham winner Jeff Kidder as jump racing s to Naas for the first time this season. Rachael Blackmore will be aboard the Henry de Bromhead-trained Quilixios as the Cheltenham hero makes his seasonal debut in a race that was won by subsequent Champion Hurdle winner Espoir D’Allen in . googletag.cmd.push After a summer campaign on the Flat, Ballymore Champion Four Year Old Hurdle winner, Jeff Kidder will make hisover hurdles against a field that includes Gowran Park maiden winner An Epic Song and Gordon Elliott’s Grade  winner Teahupoo. Elliott is looking to win the Grade  BetVictor Fishery Lane Hurdle for a third successive year following the victories of Call Me Lyreen and Surin and is hopeful his son of Masked Marvel canto winning ways on his seasonal bow. “Teahupoo showed a good level of form last season which was very pleasing,” Elliott said this morning. “He is a horse that always looked like he would progress with a summer behind him. This Saturday looks a hot race but we are looking forward to getting him started.” Elliott also has a strong hand in the Grade  Poplar Square Chase with Felix Desjy the highest rated of the six runner field and he is joined by stable companion Andy Dufresne. Captain Guinness and Darver Star who were placed in the Arkle and Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham respectively add plenty of depth to the field. Elliott reported: “Both horses showed some quality form last season and they both line up with decent chances.

Triumph Hurdle winner Quilixios faces five rivals including fellow Cheltenham winner Jeff Kidder as jump racing s to Naas for the first time this season. Rachael Blackmore will be aboard the Henry de Bromhead-trained Quilixios as the Cheltenham hero makes his seasonal debut in a race that was won by subsequent Champion Hurdle winner Espoir D’Allen in . googletag.cmd.push After a summer campaign on the Flat, Ballymore Champion Four Year Old Hurdle winner, Jeff Kidder will make hisover hurdles against a field that includes Gowran Park maiden winner An Epic Song and Gordon Elliott’s Grade  winner Teahupoo. Elliott is looking to win the Grade  BetVictor Fishery Lane Hurdle for a third successive year following the victories of Call Me Lyreen and Surin and is hopeful his son of Masked Marvel canto winning ways on his seasonal bow. “Teahupoo showed a good level of form last season which was very pleasing,” Elliott said this morning. “He is a horse that always looked like he would progress with a summer behind him. This Saturday looks a hot race but we are looking forward to getting him started.” Elliott also has a strong hand in the Grade  Poplar Square Chase with Felix Desjy the highest rated of the six runner field and he is joined by stable companion Andy Dufresne. Captain Guinness and Darver Star who were placed in the Arkle and Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham respectively add plenty of depth to the field. Elliott reported: “Both horses showed some quality form last season and they both line up with decent chances. Felix Desjy won a Grade  at Punchestown this time last year which is good form and Andy Dufresne ran a solid race in a Grade  and is a solid horse on his day.” Punters can look forward to a competitive renewal of the BetVictor Brown Lad Handicap Hurdle with  runners declared including the Michael Bowe-trained Sweet Sting who would be a fitting winner after the loss of Solernia this week.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment.

We wanted to celebrate that and also remember our dear friend and past pupil, Sonia Kinsella, who died of cancer last year.ldquoWhen we think of her strength and her courage and more importantly, her optimism, this play seemed so appropriate. We hope it pays tribute to Sonia as I think the sentiments this play evokes were embodied in that remarkable lady.ldquoThe play celebrates the strength of female friendship and the incredible support women experience from each other. I think our audiences will find themselves laughing one minute and crying the next.I am so proud of what has been achieved not only in the fact we havenrsquot fallen out despite the dficulties you face when you are trying to work with friends but also the time these busy women have devoted to learning lines and rehearsing while working full time and coping with family responsibilities. It has been hard work but I truly feel audiences will really enjoy the performance.Proceeds from the performances will be in aid of Marie Curie and Assumption Grammar Schoolrsquos sister schools in South Africa.Marcelle said: ldquoThese schools struggle financially anyway but they are experiencing great challenges during lockdown. The money we raise will make a huge dference to many lives there, allowing girls to get access to education and to be offered a meal each day.The provision offered to these students in South Africa can make all the dference to their future.She added: It is wonderful to see the fruition of all our hard work that all stemmed from a conversation during lockdown and that will hopefully benefit others in dferent ways.To purchase a ticket the production, please contact the school reception on   .

The website is now live. It is www.redkiteretreat and we are regularly updating our Facebook page @redkiteretreat. For more information please pay us a visit on Facebook, like and share the page.Red Kites were in the area and over a year ago and Stephen started feeding them and as this continued more and more started turning up daily.Red Kites are a bird of prey and have a huge wingspan of up to . metres they are reddish brown with black wingtips and a grey head.They have a distinctive V-shaped tail which they use like a rudder as they twist and turn through the air on thermals and their call is a long whistle.Red Kites are primarily scavengers and a big part of their diet is made up of dead animals , including road-kill. They also follow tractors when ploughing and swoop down to grab any small animals that have been killed by the mowers or brought to the surface.They are no threat to livestock and the largest animal they have the power and speed to kill is a young rabbit. Red Kites, like all other birds of prey, are protected by law and to harm, disturb or kill them is a criminal offence.The new Red Kite Retreat bird hide has already become very popular with wildle photographers and bird watchers and booking a slot is essential.Three generations of the Malcomson family have also helped to plant some of the first of , native trees on a -acre site to create The Warriorrsquos Wood on Dechomet Mountain.The main contractor, Scottish Woodland Ireland Ltd, managed the forest expansion and farm ersication project and planted Irish Oak, Hazel, Holly, Scots Pine and Downy Birch. Stephen and Karen also created two new ponds to encourage wildle and sowed a new wildflower meadow.Warriorrsquos Wood is the initial habitat enhancement works which form part of the new eco-tourism development known as the lsquoRed Kite Retreatrsquo.Stephen and Karen are the projectrsquos co-founders and wanted a means of ersying their farm business to ensure future sustainability.Currently, Stephen has a pig and beef unit on the farm but said ldquofarming enterprises have to adapt and evolve to ensure sustainability for future generations of farmers. I see no reason why modern farming practices cannot go hand in hand with conservation, environmental enrichment and encouraging bioersity.The Red Kite Retreat project aims to create a unique tourist and visitor facility and focuses on conservation and education about the Red Kite bird of prey, with the creation of the Warriorrsquos Wood the first step in the project.The Wood has been designed to mimic ancient woodland with species adapted to grow in elevated and exposed locations, with the planting including Scots pine, oak, birch, aspen, rowan, hawthorn and juniper.The Scots pine is favoured by native red squirrels which it is hoped will be reintroduced once the woodland has matured, while Juniper is also being established on the site.Updates in the Red Kite retreat are available on Facebook @redkiteretreat, by logging on at www.redkiteretreat or telephone .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_espie.jpg","title":"Castle Espie receives plaudit  ","story":"THE Castle Espie Wetland Centre on the shores of Strangford Lough, which recently hosted the popular BBC wildle programme Autumnwatch, has been praised for its ongoing conservation work.Ards and North Down deputy mayor Robert Adair visited the centrersquos base recently and met BBC programme presenter Gillian Burke and Castle Espie manager Paul Stewart.Cllr Adair said after the huge success of Springwatch at Castle Espie, the television programmersquosfor Autumnwatch has shone the spotlight on the rich wildle of the borough and Castle Espie as an icon of sustainable green tourism.In addition to hosting Autumnwatch, the visit comes as the charity is currently celebrating with a Winter Migration Festival at Castle Espie which includes a series of bespoke events for adults and children alike and runs until November .Cllr Adair said the international importance of Strangford Lough and its exceptional bioersity is a real asset to the environment.ldquoCastle Espie provides a window on the lough with the Winter Migration Festival and filming of Autumnwatch being a fitting way to introduce people to this wonderful asset on our doorstep, he added.Mr Stewart said the centre has been celebrating the natural resource and theof the Brent geese with events in and around Autumnwatch aimed at connecting people with nature.ldquoFrom sunrise yoga, art workshops, walks and talks, to nature focused activities for children, they are all aimed at connecting people to this wonderful place, he explained.ldquoThe worldrsquos wetland habitats like those at Castle Espie actually sequester more carbon than all the worldrsquos forests despite occupying only a fraction of the area around the globe.ldquoAs well as helping to deal with the effects of climate change, wetlands are one of the most bioerse habitats on Earth, protect us from flooding, filter pollutants and help improve our mental health.The Wildle and Wetlands Trust works around the globe, protecting wetland habitats and migratory bird flyways and operates  wetland centres across the UK with Castle Espie the only one in Northern Ireland.The charity recently launched a new lsquoWetlands Can!rsquo campaign, urging people to get behind the leading conservation charityrsquos call for creating , hectares of healthy wetlands in the UK to help combat the climate crisis.Mr Stewart added: ldquoIf the Covid crisis has taught us one thing, itrsquos that we canrsquot go back to how things were before.

Both were using the course as practice for the more competitive All-Ireland races coming up in the middle of November.Alex Robinson ran in the U- race which was two loops of the one-mile course. He ran very well and held onto fourth place for most of the race, just ping to fth on the final turn. The hills drained his legs so he couldnrsquot master a sprint.He finished the two-mile course in a time of ., which at just over six minutes per mile, is nothing to be disappointed with for cross country.Oliver Robinson ran in the U- race.

Oliver finished third boy overall. Well done to both lads for continuously keeping the East Down name to the fore, week in week out.EDAC member Patrick Smith also made the long trip to Bangor on Saturday to take part in the gloriously titled North Down Festival of Cross Country Running, just to try it out.Although he was the sole EDAC representative, he soon settled into a good rhythm, despite the very tricky underfoot conditions brought about by heavy overnight rain, which almost flies in the face of the seemingly never ending forecasts of impending global warming doom.He was only running to have a go at cross country, since all his club colleagues had been fulsome in their praise for last weekendrsquos races in Comber, and also to re-kindle the love for the genre, some  years after his last attempt.So without over exerting himself and drinking in the applause of the spectators, he finished in a highly respectable . and th place in a high quality field.Despite Patrick being unduly critical of his performance, he had finished the course in what is a pretty good time for a cross country race.

He said the local company, which is the largest private employer in the Killyleagh area, regrets that after two yearsrsquo growth, it has been necessary to lay off staff.The spokesman said evenit had not been for the events in America on September , there has been an unfortunate downturn in the leather clothing business.ldquoAs a result of reduced orders, it has been necessary to take this short term step and we would stress these are lay-offs not redundancies and we remain optimistic about the future, the spokesman added.DOWNPATRICK ndash A vandalism attack on the GPrsquos emergency vehicle placed patientsrsquo lives across the district at risk last week.Doctors have revealed that had the Pound Lane attack in Downpatrick not been spotted by paramedics based at the Downe Hospital, the consequences for patients could have been fatal.Two tyres on the special car used by GPs belonging to the DowneDoc GP co-operative were slashed during the early hours of Thursday morning in an attack described as a ldquofrightening new development.The emergency vehicle, which is packed with vital medical equipment, was targeted outside the Pound Lane Health Clinic sometime between .am and .am. The manager of the local service has confirmed that the incident is the first deliberate attack against an on-call GP service in Northern Ireland in the past five years.Mr Mark Armstrong described the Downpatrick attack as a ldquofrightening new development because the vandals deliberately put the emergency car off the road by puncturing both tyres.He also confirmed an immediate review of security

were brandishing fireworks, terrorised residents in the village on Wednesday night.The situation was so bad that local politicians and police were called to speak with teenagers in a bid to quell the trouble and a number of parents were also contacted to take their children home.Local councillor, Mr Patsy Toman, said many people were disgusted at the behaviour of the teenagers, many of whom he claimed were fuelled by alcohol they had bought illegally.Mr Toman, who was called to the village along with Down Council chairwoman, Mrs Anne McAleenan, said the widespread hooliganism and violence has no place in Drumaness and hopes the situation will not be repeated.He said young children and elderly people were terried as the teenagers ran amok and claimed the damage to property was

be addressed, he said.BALLYNAHINCH ndash Northern Ireland Electricity will invest pound, on improvements to the Ballynahinch network over the next six months.NIE officials have confirmed that the

I did so because my mum Marilyn has had liver cancer for the last three years.Alistair said that the Boston Marathon was quite an emotional event for him this time due to his motherrsquos illness.ldquoI ran as part of a charity team with  people from all over the States and some other international runners and I got to hear why other people were running and their situations as well.The overall time effort was raising , which will go into medical research.Alistair has raised thousands more for other charities, such as Barnardorsquos, from his running.He felt that running the marathon was not as challenging as actually getting to Boston.Alistair explained: ldquoThere was lots of training without knowingit would even happen, waiting and hoping the US border would open to allow travel and when it didnrsquot in time, I had to convince the US Consulate in Belfast to grant me a special exemption to travel, so there were lots of hurdles to overcome on this journey.Alistairrsquos achievements are all the more impressive since he only took up running nearly six years ago.ldquoI decided to take up running for fitness and I used a couch to K running app on my phone.

Hynds produced a peerless display aside from that concession, a former Poc Fada competitor, her restarts were struck with precision to wing forwards Katie Black and Niamh Galloway, who in turn fed team captain Joanne Sloane.Straight away, Sloane would angle deliveries into the mobile Maguire. Sloanersquos slick stickwork was impressive, and she had a fine contest versus Bernie Convery throughout.The key battle however, was the dual between Dearg centre back Grainne Glendenning and Belfastrsquos Jessica Rush.With her luminous green boots and helmet, Rush would stand out in any game, but she has the class to back up the bright colours.Winning a huge amount of primary possession, Jessica lsquos jinking, probing runs and vision to find Nicole Clerkin and Niamh Dolan was causing huge headaches for an experienced Ben Dearg defence.Kilcliefrsquos breakthrough goal came in the th minute with Burns finishing brilliantly past Lara OrsquoHare.Clare Kelly and Aacuteine Moynan made timely and brave blocks from Nora Maguirersquos goalbound efforts. The midfield battle was an intriguing and crucial one.Dual star Cara Doran has been on a scoring spree in the football championship this year and she continued her hot streak, with some exceptionally well taken scores from tight angles.Eimear Dorrian was everywhere, covering every blade of grass, never static, always roving, trying to create and make things happen. Dorrianrsquos dynamism and Doranrsquos deadliness contributed hugely to the green and reds display.Niamh McGuigan produced an equally impressive display for the Belfast side. McGuiganrsquos magnetic ability to gain possession in the tightest of spaces is remarkable.Never rushed, despite the chaos around her, she has that precarious talent of always having time, allowing her to scan and assess options, a luxury that only the very top operatorrsquos have.All season, Niamh Daly has also operated at centre field, but cruelly missed out on this final through injury.Brigid Scullion cleverly ped deep to forage for possession, picking up loose ball and linking well with half backs McErlain and Mathers. Kilclief thundered into action with another brace of points from deadly Doran.Her score in the st minute was worthy of the admission fee. Still only  years of age, a career in county colours surely beckons for this gted youngGael.Eimear Breen was a constant outlet for her defence to hit, a player who uses her pace effectively at the right times.With  minutes remaining, Kilclief were edging the contest with a five point cushion. Management Brendan Breen and Seaacuten Paul Doran madetactical tweaks to thwart the increasingly dangerous Clerkin and Dolan axis up front.A double sweeper system was swtly put in place, Cliona Shields and Catherine Deegan were tasked with shutting up shop forming a highly effective shield in front of Ballinascreen stalwart Nicole Clerkin.Nicolersquos space was greatly reduced, but still she battled as hard as possible to cut the deficit. McMullan and Mastersonrsquos masterclass in creating space for goalkeeper Hynds to aim towards, were signicant.McMullan typied the fight and character within the Ben Dearg outfit, as did the industrious Catherine Deegan. Yet, East Belfast pressed with an astounding intensity and relentlessness.That huge work rate comes from having dual players with fierce commitment and blocks of fitness from constant competing, but also from their Bainisteoiriacute Ciaran Hughes and Seaacuten Coulter who encourage their team to play with flair, and they certainly do that, but intense work ethic is paramountyou are to retain a place in this highly motivated team.That competition for places has ensured consistent performance levels all season.Niamh Dolan cleverly created precious space in the congested final third in the th minute, but her angled drive was superbly blocked by Cliona Shields, then swept up bravely by the heroic McMullan, who swtly transitioned to the always available Dorrian.Testament to the synchronisity that is within this Ben Dearg side, Dorrian didnrsquot have to look up to spot the expertly timed run of Burns who showed a deftness of touch to control the sliotar and sail it straight over the black spot.It was a score that comes from playing training together over many seasons. At the other end Aacuteine Moynan and Shannon McWilliams made important blocks, just as Joanne Sloan and Niamh Galloway were about to raise green flags.Clodagh Hanvey made a strong contribution after entering the fray. Maguirersquos maturity and decision making is exceptional for a Gael just turned .With Cara Doran the same age, the future is bright for this Kilclief team. Breen too, displays a shrewd tactical brain, dropping into spaces, covering runs, causing havoc.Doran was awarded player of the match, for her scintillating display, though a case could also have been made for East Belfastrsquos Niamh McGuigan.Niamhrsquos link up play with Jessica Rush was a joy to watch, but equally impressive was her willingness to help team mates in trouble, a true team player.With both teams featuring strong and dynamic forward units, this game was always going to be decided by which defence came out on top.Ultimately, the craft, guile and experience of the Kilclief reargaurd ensured that they closed the game out and got the Championship title they so craved, especially after last yearrsquos heartbreaking defeat to Attical.Euphoric scenes and emotions were unleashed as referee HP McCusker blew his final whistle.Team captain Joanne Sloane spoke from the heart, with a speech that did her club proud. A huge roar went up from the Ben Dearg support whenever she lted aloft the Liam Mac An Ri championship trophy.Each age group at juvenile and now senior level has collected silverware this season, testament to the solid work taking place at their fantastic new facilities in St Malachyrsquos Park.Lorraine MacCartanrsquos priceless contribution in the development of players at the club was highlighted, and deserved praise was duly given to this exemplary East Belfast side.The Ulster Championships now beckon for Kilclief.Referee: H P McCusker .prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/3November2021_kilmore.jpg","title":"Kilmore navigate their way past Maze  ","story":"KILMORE Rec welcomed Lower Maze to Robert Adams Park in the third round of the Peaky Blinders Irish Cup and produced a barn storming second half comeback to progress to round four.With Kilmore two goals down at half-time, having been harshly reduced to ten men after  minutes, the odds were stacked against them.However, a tactical change and a second half performance full of hard work and passion epitomised by man of the match Paddy Grant saw Michael Carvillrsquos men defy those odds and produce one of the most memorable comebacks seen at Robert Adams Park in recent times.Kilmore started brightly but after just eight minutes they failed to clear their lines from a corner, allowing Lower Mazersquos Alex Scott to pick up the ball  yards out and fire through a crowded goal mouth past an unsighted Chris Turley in the Kilmore goals.The task in hand got harder when the referee adjudged Kilmore captain Niall McCarthy to be the aggressor in a midfield confrontation and, to the astonishment of all in the ground, deemed it a red card offence.The injustice of the sending off galvanised Kilmorersquos ten men and they took the game to Lower Maze, dominating possession and creating chances.The first of these saw Caolan Conlon burst through from midfield. His shot was well saved and the rebound fell to Gary Kennedy who fired towards the net only to see Maze lsquokeeper Heron produce a great double save.Cai Gemmel, who was magnicent throughout, saw a goal bound effort deflected wide of the head of a Maze defender as it seemed destined for the top corner.As the chances came and went Kilmore got caught with a sucker punch in the nd minute.Bradford made his way down the left and his mis-cued cross beat a stranded Turley to leave Kilmore two down at half-time and up against it.Carvill changed the shape of the team at half-time and went with a front two of Paddy Grant and Josh Smyth.This change paid idends in the th minute when Grant weaved his way into the box, although it appeared he had been forced too wide, but the forward still managed to fire a rasping drive to the roof of the net.In the th minute a sustained period of Kilmore pressure brought the equaliser, with Grant again involved when his clipped cross was nodded in at the back post by the energetic Josh Smyth.Kilmore continued to dominate and press for the winner, as it seemed as though the game was destined for extra time.In the th minute the pressure finally paid off when Carvill whipped in a corner and that man Grant was on hand to hook the ball home from close range to send the Kilmore faithful into raptures.As Lower Maze then threw everything at Kilmore in injury time, the Blues defence of Magee, Larkin, Kennedy, Stewart and lsquokeeper Turley remained steadfast.Kilmorersquos substitutes of Dagen and Lynas had a chance each on the break for a fourth, but it wasnrsquot to be.Carvill spoke of his ldquoimmense pride in the resilience and determination shown by his side after the match.It came as no surprise that the Kilmore supporters man of the match went to Paddy Grant for his two goals and an assist in a match winning performance.This win sealed double delight for Kilmore, as the club recently secured approval for the installation of a new G football pitch, complete with floodlights, dug-outs, pitch side fencing and associated pathways.Kilmore: Turley, Smyth, Stewart, Larkin, Magee, Gemmell, Conlon, McCarthy, Kennedy, Carvil, Grant.

The nearby Saintfield High School, a school supported by the entire community, is in dire need of funding for expansion and refurbishment.ldquoI would call on the EA to listen to the local community and support a truly cross community educational establishment that is already in existence.Cllr Billy Walker, who represents the area, said he will not supporting the development proposal, which he described as ldquoill-thought.ldquoAs an elected representative, I will not be supporting the call for an integrated college in the Mid Down area, he told the Recorder.ldquoFirst and foremost, I want to put on record that I am not opposed to integrated education in any shape or form.Cllr Walker said along with Strangford MP Jim Shannon, they lobbied for a new integrated primary school at Drumlins in Ballynahinch and were also instrumental in helping to get the funding to turn Killyleagh Primary School into an integrated school.He continued: ldquoMy credentials speak for themselves. My concern is that we have four post-primary schools in the Rowallane area that have been very successful in the last number of years.ldquoThe four schools are totally opposed to it as this will put serious pressure on these schoolsa new integrated college opens.ldquoThese schools have an excellent track record in working together in a cross-community basis which I have seen at first hand.The councillor claimed he had seen figures to show that Blackwater College was under-subscribed by pupils and local people have made representations to him about the development proposal.He and Mr Shannon recently met with the principals of the four local schools, including The High School Ballynahinch, to hear their concerns.ldquoHow can you honestly push for another integrated school in the Mid Down area when you have another one already under-subscribed, Cllr Walker continued.ldquoIf Blackwater wants to expand, hopefully in the near future Down High will get the go-ahead for its new build which would leave a site for Blackwater to move to.

We have had lots of support from local primary schools, many of which are integrated themselves and from other integrated colleges, who you could argue we would be in more competition with.He said that the group had written to every MP and MLA in the area and pointed out that Cllr Walker had not yet been briefed by them.ldquoHe did not take up the opportunity for us to brief him which might have assuaged some of the concerns he has highlighted, said Mr Jackson.ldquoAnd while we are hoping to establish a sixth form, we are not aware that the other local schools have also applied to do something like that.He added that the group were looking at the EArsquos response to the development proposal ldquoin detail as we think that some of our assertions have not been fully understood or appreciated as the EA looks at historical data while we are looking into the future as the urban and geographical landscape changes.Mark Morgan, principal of St Colmanrsquos, described the proposal as a ldquosolo run that disregards accepted protocols and should be dismissed.He added: ldquoIt is imperative that any proposals for change in any sector of the education system must be aligned to the area planning process.Saintfield High School principal Sarah-Lucy Hynds pointed out that irrespective of the proposal, her school would continue to strive for its own expansion.She said: ldquoSaintfield High Schoolrsquos campaign to grow has remained the same for decades. The challenges we face as a result of our capped enrolment at Year  must now be addressed as a matter of urgency.Mr Seamus Hanna, principal of St Colmcillersquos, said he was disappointed with the lack of ldquoproper consultation.ldquoOn a very basic level, the proposal ignored the reality that our staff and students already come from erse faith backgrounds and our ethos is and always has been, pupil centred, welcoming and respecting every pupil, regardless of faith or academic ability, he said.ldquoOn a higher level, it ignored the reality that schools must work in partnership to place student needs above institutional interests.

Instead, it was just the usual down-talking to unionists about how we should be ashamed of the Northern Ireland state.

Please try again later.Submitting...Letter to the editorIt plays well to their audience but it repels me from anything to do with a united Ireland. This republican triumphalism is very damaging to the unionist community. It hardens attitudes. It confirms suspicions. It builds barriers. If polls are to be believed, Sinn Fein is due to expand its electoral representation in the near future. If this is how they are behaving now, how will they behavethis strength is realised  I don’t think they’ll magically moderate. Rather, any success will encourage them to go further down this triumphalist route.The many assumptions I heard from the Ard Fheis on a united Ireland were cringe-worthy. A border poll has not even been called, let alone won, and yet victory is already taken for granted. This is arrogant and insulting to the unionist community. Yet, these assumptions will also be their downfall, as outside republican echo chambers, exist many other communities of people who are not convinced about Sinn Fein’s version of a united Ireland.Nevertheless, unionists must learn from the rise of Sinn Fein. The good news for unionism is that discomfort is a key ingredient to growth.

Tens of thousands took part in the Ulster Covenant centenary parade in . The Orange Order says many people want to replicate the experience. Picture: Charles McQuillan Pacemaker.“There was a time in my youth when a minister might lose his job for not being an Orangeman or for attending a Catholic mass. But those days are long over. Let them celebrate the survival of Orangeism into a secular and erse culture, butthey want to say they are celebrating Northern Ireland, then let them invite [LGBT] Pride and a few others to join them.”Commentator Ruth Dudley Edwards said opposition to NI Centenary celebrations will only have heightened interest in the parade. Sinn Fein’s “mean-mindedness” in stling a range of centenary events and Irish President Michael D Higgins’ decision not to attend a commemoration event in Armagh were “bound to provoke a reaction” among grassroots unionists, she said, “as was the establishment’s timidity about commemorating the centenary”. She added: “But I’m all for a great celebration of the courage of all those from all backgrounds who withstood terrorism democratically and who worked hard to make Northern Ireland prosper. I’m much encouraged at how many young people reject tribal labels and just love the place where they live. I look forward to being in Belfast next year to cheer the parade.”MORE NEWSLord Alderdice hopes book will help Presbyterian Church in Ireland learn tolerance on homosexualityDate is set for massive Orange centenary parade in Northern Ireland – akin to ’s vast Ulster Covenant marchA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

While all babies are dferent, it can be helpful to think about working towards a routine by doing the same things in the same order each night so that baby learns what is coming next.Think about your little onersquos sleep environmentIt can be helpful to black out bedrooms, something that can be especially important in the summer months. Temperature is also important the Lullaby Trust, the baby sleep charity, say that the safest temperature for our little ones is - degrees celsius.Looking at how your little one falls asleep can help them get a more settled nightIt is very normal for your little one to be fed, rocked or cuddled to sleep, however this can be dficult to maintain. Practice other ways of getting your baby to sleep in their own sleep space to help find a method that suits you, your baby and your parenting style.Watch out for signs of tirednessWhile there are typical s of time that babies will happily stay awake for, the most important thing is getting to know your baby. By observing your baby, you can try to get them down for naps during the day before they get overtired. It is also important not to try to force naps when they are under tired.Fresh air and exerciseGetting out of the house for a bit will blow the cobwebs away and help your little one to burn off some energy. Inside the home your little one will also benefit from lots of time on the floor to keep them moving, while for small babies practising a bit of tummy time can be really helpful.Donrsquot always rush inhellipSometimes your little one will babble or make noise while they are asleep, and by going in too quickly we can disturb them. Equally they can sometimes wake and be happy in their sleep space. If your little one doesnrsquot need your assistance it is important to give them the space to get themselves back to sleep independently.Take care of yourself and donrsquot be afraid to ask for helpTherersquos no shame in not being able to do it all, all of the time. Being sleep deprived can be incredibly challenging and feel very lonely. Please know that is very normal for sleep to be dficult, especially in those early days. Please remember being a parent doesnrsquot always feel easy, because itrsquos not!

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
