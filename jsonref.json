No figure in public life has a greater capacity for patience nor had that forbearance tested more often than the Queen       The Queen has always nobly strived — and succeeded — to be above politics. And, at the time of the referendum, Buckingham Palace was at great pains to stress that it was a matter for the Scottish people, not the monarch, who would accept the result whichever way it went.Privately, of course, the Queen, who has a very personal, life-long love of Scotland, as well as being the nation’s head of state, was deeply concerned at the possibility of a split in the union.It was while staying with the Queen at Balmoral less than two weeks before the independence vote that the Cameron plan to ask her to help took shape.Shaken by a Sunday Times poll putting the Yes campaign ahead, he says there was a ‘mounting sense of panic’, and urgent conversations began between advisers in Downing Street and at the Palace.He recalled ‘not asking for anything that would be in any way improper or unconstitutional, but just a raising of the eyebrow, even, you know, a quarter of an inch’.Seven days later, while speaking to a well-wisher outside Crathie Kirk — the Balmoral parish church — the Queen urged people to ‘think very carefully about the future’.         The Queen has always nobly strived — and succeeded — to be above politics. Pictured here with David Cameron outside No 10         The Queen at her audience with Prime Minister David Cameron in her sitting room in BalmoralIt was four days before the vote and became one of the main talking points of the campaign.Reacting to David Cameron’s decision to bring it up now, royal sources say ‘it serves no one’s interests’ for conversations between a PM and the Queen to be made public. ‘It makes it very hard for the relationship to thrive,’ they added.In the inscrutable language of Court circles, this is about as close to screaming blue murder.The Queen, who is currently at Balmoral, has been closely following developments.The timing of Mr Cameron’s misguided disclosure is so crucial. It is an unwelcome distraction at a time when the monarch is already, controversially, at the centre of the bitter Supreme Court battle between Remainers and the Government over the proroguing of Parliament and whether Boris Johnson lied to the Queen about it.Nor was this the first time that Mr Cameron has been indiscreet.In the aftermath of the Scottish vote, he let slip how the Queen had ‘purred down the line’ when he phoned her with the result.On that occasion, she kept her feelings to herself.         David Cameron, son Arthur and daughter Nancy when they heard the results from the 2014 Scottish referendumIs it any wonder that, as someone who has herself stuck correctly to the conventions of absolute silence on conversations with her 14 different prime ministers, she is unnerved by the way these courtesies are no longer always observed?For decades, the Queen could rely on the diplomatic good sense of the holders of her kingdom’s most important political position. But the rot set in with Tony Blair, whose autobiography trampled over the protocol of omerta that normally applies to PM and monarch.He related conversations in detail, including the strained dealings that followed the death of Princess Diana.He also described at length his visits to Balmoral, an experience he described as a combination of the ‘intriguing, the surreal and the utterly freaky’.They were, he said, a ‘bit of a horror’ made bearable by the generous drinks poured before dinner that acted like ‘true rocket fuel’.He also said the Queen, on occasion, exhibited ‘hauteur’ — and he famously disclosed how, on his very first audience after the 1997 election, she had told him: ‘You are my tenth prime minister. The first was Winston. That was before you were born.’At the time, Mr Blair was accused of a gross discourtesy, particularly for ignoring the unwritten rule that formal audiences between premier and Queen are entirely private, with no note-taking.Boris Johnson breached protocol, too, following his first meeting with Her Majesty as Prime Minister.No sooner had he left the Palace than he was overheard telling Downing Street staff that she had amusingly told him she didn’t know why anyone would want to be Prime Minister.Although it undoubtedly demonstrated that the Queen has a dry sense of humour, Mr Johnson’s comment was a serious error.Of course, Brexit has meant problems, too.Three years ago, Michael Gove was named as the source of a red-top tabloid newspaper story that claimed the Queen backed Britain leaving the EU.It was based on an apparent conversation with MPs several years earlier in which she allegedly said: ‘I don’t understand Europe.’ It was reported that she spoke the words with ‘venom and emotion’.The same paper also reported an alleged exchange between the Queen and then Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg over lunch at Windsor Castle.It claimed she told the pro-Europe Clegg that the EU was heading in the wrong direction.Clegg denied the story, and the Palace made a formal complaint about the newspaper’s ‘misleading’ and ‘distorted’ headline, which was ruled to be inaccurate.Aides will pray that admonishing David Cameron will ensure that the normal diplomacy between Sovereign and Prime Minister can return.In the partisan and febrile atmosphere currently engulfing politics, however, that seems a forlorn hope."},{"url":null,"title":"SEBASTIAN SHAKESPEARE David Camerons school pals dont recall maggots menu","story":"Share this article   Viscount Thurso made a startling declaration at the London Diarists’ Lunch this week. ‘I’m the only person here to have been seen publicly naked,’ John Thurso boomed to fellow guests.

Rae Ritchie looks at why getting the right answer is so addictive, and why getting the wrong answer can be so funnyWhat Q is one of the nation’s favourite pastimes? Nope, it’s not quidditch. It’s quizzes. We love racking our brains for that obscure bit of knowledge that we’re sure we once heard somewhere. Whether we are in the pub with our mates or at home shouting at the television, the feeling of getting an answer right is addictive. But why do we find quizzes so compelling?A buzz from the buzzerThe very nature of a quiz lures us in. As veteran question writer David Bodycombe observes: “If a question is posed, you can’t help but wonder what the answer is.”When we get the answer correct, various factors make us want to go back for more. Michelle Tolfrey, a clinical psychologist and member of the Welldoing.org community of therapists, explains: “Physiologically, when we win something, we experience a nice hit of dopamine, which can be quite a euphoric and ‘buzzy’ feeling to have. As a result, we may want to replicate this again and again to get the same sensation.”Tolfrey also points out the psychological rewards involved in quizzes. “They can be particularly enjoyable if we are doing them in the context of socialising with peers, where it can help us to feel connected with others and part of something special.“And there are, of course, lots of other social rewards involved with quizzes, such as receiving praise from others or being given a certain title, prize or accolade that boosts our self esteem.”Fellow clinical psychologist and Welldoing.org therapist Patapia Tzotzoli agrees that quizzes can meet basic human needs. “People are creatures of emotion and are motivated by pride and vanity,” she says. “Quizzes offer a platform where our knowledge is being assessed by our ability to retrieve information quickly while others are watching. Doing so offers us quick gratification and a sense of achievement that nourishes our self-esteem and gains us immediate recognition.“In other words, quizzes offer a setting with the right conditions to feed our need to be important and appreciated for it.”But if quizzes are so rewarding, why do our brains seem to crack under the pressure of needing to come up with the right answer – and quickly?“Sometimes anxiety kicks in and interferes with our memory – and consequently our performance,” states Tzotzoli. “The more anxious we become, the harder it is to remember the information we are after and we experience what we commonly describe as our ‘mind going blank’.”Not quite the answerTimes when a contestant’s mind goes awry make for comedy gold on quiz programmes. On the iconic 80s and 90s show Blockbusters, for instance, participants still had “mind going blank” moments despite being given the first letter of the answer. When asked by legendary host Bob Holness “What D, rhyming with a synonym for defraud, means to decrease in number or grow smaller in size?”, quizzer Susie somehow managed to come up with shrink (correct answer: dwindle, rhymes with swindle).At other times, contestants stuck to the right letter, but under the pressure of studio lights, got the wrong word. After answering “What O is the generic word for any living animal or plant, including bacteria or viruses?”, a young man cringed when he realised that he’d replied orgasm not organism. Contestant Pauline looked even more mortified when the penny dropped that the response to “What K is a Chinese ceremony of abasement?” was kowtow – not Kama Sutra.More such moments follow on the new series of Blockbusters that’s about to hit our screens on Comedy Central. Host Dara Ó Briain is met with laughable responses to questions including “What Q is a type of pen that is made from a bird’s feather” and “What N are potatoes when they first come into season?” No, the answers are not quail and nugget.As in the original, this latest incarnation features student contestants, although a celebrity special with Strictly Come Dancing’s Stacey Dooley and Oti Mabuse against comedian Josh Widdecombe starts the series off.For us armchair quizzers joining in from our sofas, the Blockbusters style of question has major appeal. As Bodycombe puts it: “It’s a clever format because there’s a clue inherently built into the question, which automatically makes you think you might have a chance of getting it right.”Bodycombe is spot-on. No matter how smart, we all need a little help. Just try to distinguish between organism and orgasm.What B has a brand new series?The new series of Blockbusters – hosted by Dara Ó Briain – hits our screens at 8pm on Thursday 26 September on Comedy Central."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3169ecc41d3ec20850bbf74c75bb61522702e6cc/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e20e9b2e1ddadc4b6ae43646f32c744e","title":"question are two heads really better than one","story":"Blockbusters, the classic gameshow that pits two players against one, is returning for a second series. So in quizzes – and indeed life – do you get the best results working in a team or flying solo? Abi Smith unpicks the scienceHow good are you at quizzes? Go on, you can be honest. You think you’re pretty good, right? Well, you might have a superior intellect – but then again, you might just be overconfident. “This is known as the Dunning-Kruger effect, which states that the majority of people tend to overestimate their abilities,” says Matt Shaw, a performance psychologist at coaching company InnerDrive.“Interestingly, this is more pronounced in those with the lowest ability, such as inexperienced players,” says Shaw. “Experts tend to underestimate their abilities, which is sometimes called ‘the burden of expertise’.”Knowing whether you are the type of person who is burdened with expert knowledge or likely to overegg your skills is the kind of insight that would come in handy when playing Blockbusters – the classic TV gameshow that pits a single player against a team of two students.Recently relaunched on Comedy Central with comedian Dara Ó Briain presiding, the game sees contestants making their way across the iconic hexagon-filled game board, answering questions that begin with a particular letter of the alphabet. The format rewards general knowledge, lateral thinking, quick reactions and – in the case of the paired-up players – teamwork.“It’s really important that you choose your thinking partner wisely,” says Robert Ritchie, who’s made a career by cultivating positive mindsets and behaviours across different types of teams.Currently head of organisational development at the University of Salford, Ritchie says “one head is better than two” in the idea-creation stages. After that, he says, you can deliberately decide who to bring in and when. “In a quiz format, that process is accelerated. You have to have that initial moment of reaction and decision on your own, otherwise you’ll only ever be going around consensus or groupthink,” he adds. Get the right teammate and gameplay can be dazzlingly swift: just check out this pair of Cambridge students trouncing their single opponent.Intriguingly, however, two heads are likely to be better than one even if you’re not both Blockbusting naturals. “There is a quirky phenomenon called the Köhler effect,” says Shaw. “This is when working with other people, the weaker teammate tends to elevate their performance. Not only do people work harder if their partner is outperforming them, they are also more motivated when they know that the team’s performance relies on them. This is more prominent when team members’ abilities are similar, like in a quiz.” It’s perhaps no surprise, therefore, that across the two Comedy Central series of Blockbusters, 11 out of 20 have been won by the pair – despite pairs requiring one more correct answer each round than the solo players.Question setter Charlotte Hazzard, who runs the quiz at the historic Grapes pub in Limehouse, London, also believes that two heads are better than one. “When you’ve got two brains, you’re able to pull on a greater bank of knowledge, and pub quizzes often need quite a wide spread of general knowledge,” she says.Knowing the information and having it ready at the right moment are two very different skills, however. Team player Philip fell foul of this when asked: “What U is something designed for both men and women?” His immediate response – underwear – was factually correct but not what the question was looking for. The word Ó Briain wanted, of course, was unisex.There’s a reason that the first answer that comes into your head won’t necessarily win you points, according to Shaw. “Gut responses are essentially shortcuts that help us make decisions quickly and when under pressure. However, they’re not always accurate. Under stress or pressure (like in a quiz), our focus can become too narrow, meaning we stop searching for alternative answers, which can lead to mistakes,” he says.Comedian Josh Widdicombe learned this to his cost on the celebrity edition when he buzzed in too soon on a question about West End musicals, proffering West Side Story as his W answer. This allowed professional dancer and presenter Oti Mabuse to swoop in with the correct response – Wicked – and salvage the point for herself and her presenter teammate, Stacey Dooley.Sometimes though, one head is all it takes. “At the end of the day, if you go with your gut instinct and get it incorrect, you’re more forgiving of yourself than if you hadn’t gone with your gut,” says Hazzard, whose quiz is often frequented by the leaseholder of the Grapes pub, Sir Ian McKellen. The other benefit of going it alone is that you don’t need to negotiate the politics of playing in a team. In one of many Blockbuster bust-ups, teammates Manreet and Nyah disagreed on the choice of letter and subsequently lost a point, with Manreet jokingly defecting to their opponent’s side. So, are two heads really better than one? It depends on the problem and the people – and whether you can keep playing nice.What B has a brand new series?The new series of Blockbusters – hosted by Dara Ó Briain – hits our screens at 8pm on Thursday 26 September on Comedy Central."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/893da5cdc3ec1deff5552379302619933196e9ca/0_0_10417_6250/master/10417.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5912083babaa3d15b02a00c5a18ba515","title":"quiz revival of the fittest","story":"Blockbusters is back.

Further up the river, Westminster is shutting down for five weeks. Ever since Boris Johnson raised the prospect of proroguing parliament, people have been sharing a quote from The Handmaid’s Tale, published 35 years ago, just as they did in the US following the election of Donald Trump in 2016: “That was when they suspended the Constitution. They said it would be temporary. There wasn’t even any rioting in the streets. People stayed at home at night, watching television.”“It is another predictable mess that people have got drawn into because a big honking pack of lies was told about it,” Atwood says of Brexit. Apart from the legal questions – “actions have consequences, but what will the consequences be?” – she is most interested in “who is going to benefit from this financially? Who is shorting the pound? I can think of all kinds of people who might turn it to their advantage.”As has been noted, the last time a novel received such a fanfare was the midnight launches for Harry Potter books – with fans sporting specs and scarves instead of capes and bonnets. Atwood is our high sorceress, a very grownup one, with a truly unnerving knack for auspicious timing. Her best work combines psychological acuity with audacious curiosity she is as good at recreating the politics of the playground (Cat’s Eye, 1989) as she is at inventing a chillingly plausible male theocracy. She is both deadly serious and surprisingly playful, and it is to her that readers have turned as a way of making sense of the world, helped by the hugely successful TV adaptation of The Handmaid’s Tale. With cameo appearances as an Aunt, and another in the TV version of her 1996 novel Alias Grace, which also aired in 2017, she describes the last couple of years as “horrible fun: when the occasion for the fun is not so happy. And the occasion for the fun is the rise of religious fundamentalist actions against women”.Like Kafka and Orwell, Atwood has become part of the public discourse the red and white robes adopted as a symbol of female defiance from Ireland to Argentina, but most often in the US, where her near-future dystopia, in which women have been reduced to female reproductive slaves, was set. Yet back in 1985, when The Handmaid’s Tale, Atwood’s sixth novel, was published, “a big fuss was not particularly made. I think we had some sort of publisher’s party,” she says dryly.The sequel has been surrounded by levels of secrecy to rival any ex-prime minister’s memoir, with tales of Booker judges’ computers being hacked (The Testaments is on this year’s shortlist). “I left my computer on a plane,” she confides. “I forgot about it because I was watching Captain Underpants.” She didn’t have a copy of The Testaments on it, but there was enough information to cause a stir if it fell into the wrong hands. Atwood doesn’t – yet – have the powers to ground a plane, but she was reunited with her computer within two hours. “It would have been a catastrophe,” she says, laughing now.Then Amazon blew it all by sending out copies in the US a week ahead of publication. “Somebody pushed the wrong button. It was human error,” she says unruffled. “They apologised, which is apparently among the first times, if not the first time, that Amazon have ever apologised.”Despite her formidable energy, Atwood embodies an owl-like stillness – head tilted, listening carefully, with only her hands moving when she speaks. She gives long, far-ranging answers (not always to the question asked), and can leap from Mary Queen of Scots to Mary Poppins, or from the Cromwells to the day’s news, in the blink of a gimlet eye. At nearly 80, what does she make of this remarkable late boost? “Isn’t it wild,” she says. “I can’t remember a time when I was a usual anything,” she says. “I mean going way back. I didn’t grow up in a usual way” (her childhood was spent in the Canadian wilderness). “I wasn’t a usual kind of high-school student. I was a very peculiar university student and it continued on from there.” Atwood “became” a writer at 16, when she made up a poem in her head while crossing a football field. Since then she has written more than 60 books, in almost every genre, and has been awarded more than 100 prizes, including the Booker in 2000 for The Blind Assassin. Her futuristic trilogy – Oryx and Crake (2003), The Year of the Flood (2009) and MaddAddam (2013) – has an ardent following. She lives in Toronto with her partner, the writer Graeme Gibson, spending their summers on Pelee Island, where she has written many of her novels, including much of The Testaments (as well as a stint, more surprisingly, in Norwich).The author has just had a long chat with Bruce Miller, the TV series’ showrunner, who is “quite thrilled” about the new novel, “because it gives him a lot more to work with”. Atwood, an executive producer on the show, had started writing The Testaments before the first season launched. And there shouldn’t be any clashes, as her sequel picks up 15 years later: “We know where we start in the 15 years, but there’s quite a lot of squeezing room for things that happen leading up to that,” the author explains. “I’ve given him a lot of blank space that will be his to fill. We agreed he can’t kill off certain people a long time ago.”“Hands off Aunt Lydia” and “don’t touch that baby” were her principal stipulations. “I needed this child here and that child there – so that’s how it’s going to be.” The Testaments is narrated by three voices: it is the last will and testament of Aunt Lydia, and the testimonies of two girls, Agnes who has grown up in Gilead, and Daisy who escaped to Canada with her mother as a baby. Atwood’s reluctance to write as Offred, the narrator of The Handmaid’s Tale, was one of the reasons it took her so long to attempt a sequel, despite “the clamouring” from readers. “I couldn’t do it,” she says emphatically. “Not possible. To recreate that voice and do more of it. I just couldn’t.” She is wary of follow-ups in general. “They are always kind of imitations. I saw Mary Poppins Returns. A commendable sequel. I enjoyed it, but it’s not the same.”Atwood has said in the past that The Handmaid’s Tale was written to answer the question: if there was a totalitarian regime in the US what form would it take? The Testaments sets out to show how such a regime collapses: “What makes them turn into something else? What makes them fall apart?” And for that she needed an insider: “So who in that whole cast of characters is going to know more? There’s only one answer to that.” Aunt Lydia, a female Thomas Cromwell, “swollen with power” but without absolute authority.Many readers have wondered what they might do in Offred’s situation, how to resist and survive by giving us Aunt Lydia’s story, Atwood asks us to think about questions of cruelty and complicity. All her novels are about survival. As Aunt Lydia reflects: “What good is it to throw yourself in front of a steamroller out of moral principles and then be crushed flat like a sock emptied of its foot? ... Better to hurl rocks than to have them hurled at you.” Or as Atwood puts it: “We are ordinary as long as it is easy to be ordinary.” She quotes a Polish resistance fighter from the second world war who once told her: ‘“Pray that you will never have the occasion to be a hero.’ You don’t run into a burning building and rescue somebody unless there’s a burning building … Similarly, you don’t run away from a burning building and ignore everything, unless there’s a burning building.”But the main reason for not returning sooner to the world she had created was because, before now, it no longer seemed relevant. “For a long time we were going away from Gilead and then we turned around and started going back towards Gilead, so it did seem pertinent.” The Handmaid’s Tale, which Atwood began writing in West Berlin in 1984, was her response to those who wanted to reverse the freedoms gained by women in the 70s, to put the butterflies back in the box. “They just didn’t have the power to make that happen.” Now they do.The novel’s status as a feminist classic has perhaps overshadowed another of its most prescient warnings – the catalyst for Gilead was environmental catastrophe. In The Testaments Aunt Lydia catalogues the natural disasters that ravaged “her vanished country”, before continuing. “People became frightened. Then they became angry. The absence of viable remedies. The search for someone to blame. You don’t believe the sky is falling in until a chunk of it falls on you.”If the novel deals less explicitly with the crisis than we might have expected, her point is the same: the burden will fall hardest on women and children. “It always does, because women and children are weaker – let’s take their stuff,” she says. But, as Atwood points out, she “did climate apocalypse quite thoroughly” in the MaddAddam trilogy. “Maybe not thoroughly enough,” she says, “because I think it is actually going to be worse.” But she is not without hope, and if she was younger she would “absolutely be doing Extinction Rebellion”. She was the first writer to donate a manuscript to the Future Library, in which stories remain unread for 100 years, when they will be printed on paper from a newly planted forest in Norway.At an event last summer, a member of the audience asked Atwood for one word to sum up the times we are living in. “Vital,” she fired back. “This is a hinge moment, in many different ways,” she says now. “Let’s call it the casket moment,” an allusion to the three caskets in The Merchant of Venice. “One of those puzzles in which you need to open the right door. So, ‘All right human race, which door are you going to open?’”One of Atwood’s central axioms is that nothing can be included in her fiction that hadn’t happened somewhere in the world. As Atwood has reminded us: she didn’t make this stuff up, the human race did. “If I was to create an imaginary garden, I wanted the toads in it to be real,” she wrote in a recent introduction to The Handmaid’s Tale. And this is “absolutely” the case for The Testaments: shadows of Weinstein and Epstein, Isis and the Trump administration can all be found in its murky waters. It is impossible to read the scenes set in a female detention camp without thinking of the US-Mexico border.Is Atwood firing a warning or reflecting what is already happening? “Both. But warnings aren’t effective if they are just preaching. Enactments are of interest because then people think ‘What would I do?’ Whereas if someone is going ‘Don’t do that, don’t do that,’” she says, wagging her finger. “You think ‘Oh shut up!’”This is the sixth time Atwood has been shortlisted for the Booker prize. “There are upsides and downsides” to winning, she says. If you win everyone says you shouldn’t have won the Booker. And if you don’t win, in Canada anyway, they say ‘Atwood fails to win Booker’.” And then there is the Nobel. “Oh purlease …” She is already at work on a collection of poetry, often her way of working up to a novel. And she hasn’t ruled out a further instalment: “Never say never to anything.”“Only dead people are allowed to have statues, but I have been given one while still alive”: so Aunt Lydia opens The Testaments. Is there an Atwood statue? “There’s a head,” she laughs. “We used to call it the horrible head.” The plaster cast is in her cellar, the original, made in the 70s, at McMaster University. “I don’t look like that,” she told the sculptor, who replied. “But you will …”“People bang on about your legacy,” she says, impatiently. “I’m not that interested because I’m not going to be here. I’m not going to be around haunting my legacy. Unless I do an Aunt Lydia and bury little manuscripts in libraries.” Well, there’s already that story buried away in the Future Library. Praise be.• Since we went to press, Margaret Atwood’s partner Graeme Gibson has sadly died at the age of 85."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/90e306790a4a3dd87838b7a92a8da68376a82646/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=88278e48c30bd5058878a3b85d173447","title":"have you been affected by the closure of pawnbroker albemarle bond","story":"We’d like to hear from staff and customers who have been affected by Albemarle \u0026amp Bond shutting its shops.

She had died from heart failure. It was later revealed that Sado had logged 159 hours and 37 minutes of overtime at work in the month before her death. Sado’s death was officially designated as a “death from overwork”.So common are cases of people dying from overwork in Japan that the country has a special term for it, karoshi. The first case of karoshi was recorded in 1969 according to government data, Japan had 190 deaths from overwork in 2017.Earlier this year the Japanese government introduced a law limiting legal overtime work to 45 hours a month, with an extension of up to 100 hours a month in busy periods for a maximum of six months a year. But many remain doubtful it will rein in Japan’s toxic overwork culture.“There remains considerable pressure on employees to prove themselves by long hours,” says Jeff Kingston, director of Asian Studies at Tokyo’s Temple University. “As long as this samurai work ethic prevails, it’s hard to be optimistic.”But as with the case of Japan and other cities, working long hours does not necessarily equate to high productivity. According to the UBS study, Mexico City is the world’s third-hardest working city, with the average worker clocking up 2,622 hours per year. However, Mexico is the least productive of 38 countries listed in data from OECD — managing $18.8 (£15) in GDP for every hour worked. Ireland, the most productive, creates $84 in GDP for every hour. And with an annual average of 1,856 hours, workers in Ireland’s capital, Dublin, work considerably fewer hours than their counterparts in Mexico City.But despite evidence to suggest working less hours can have a positive impact on productivity levels, overwork continues to plague many cities. The Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development surveyed 5,136 people as part of its 2019 UK Working Lives Study, and found that one in four workers overwork by at least 10 hours per week. The study also revealed that one in three workers say they have too much work to complete in their job and one in five do not have the time to do their job in their allocated hours.“Employers are often resistant to the overwhelming evidence that long working hours do not equate to good performance,” says Prof Gail Kinman, an occupational health psychologist from the University of Bedfordshire. “In fact, the opposite is true. The longer people work, the poorer their performance will be, resulting in poor concentration and memory, compromised problem-solving and creativity.”Kinman also warns that chronic, long working hours can have a major impact on mental and physical health because people’s resources are drained and not adequately replenished by rest.With job opportunities a common pull factor for people moving to urban areas, the problem of overwork can be particularly acute in cities. How can a better work-life balance be established?According to the Kisi study, Singapore has the highest percentage of people working more than 48 hours a week. “Singapore is overall thought to be a very liveable city, but the analysis showed that citizens have one of the highest stress scores,” says Bernhard Mehl, the company’s CEO.“After publishing this study we’ve had cities calling us to understand what they can do better, and it’s really about comparing yourself to the average to see where your deficits are that could drive a change-focused agenda.” In the case of Singapore, Mehl suggests that “offering more programmes around mental health and shaping the conversation around stress relief might be a good idea”.In more broad terms, Kinman says it is critical to set boundaries. “Switching off from work (physically and mentally) is essential to ensure mental and physical health and a happy and fulfilling personal life,” she says.“Plan holidays and short breaks through the year in advance use mindfulness to help you switch off practice self-compassion and prioritise self-care.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, catch up on our best stories or sign up for our weekly newsletter"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/377e5731a1651bcdeea9d3d519b8e7786c2c7fdb/0_133_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=325fa07cf475060d6cea89c5022bafde","title":"climate change morally wrong carbon abolition movement","story":"Those who fought against slavery did not agonise over the costs and benefits. Their goal was clear: make it illegalHuman-induced climate change is a moral wrong. It involves one group of humans harming others. People of this generation harming those in future generations. People in the developed world harming those in the developing world. Each of us is emitting carbon that is harming those caught in climate-driven superstorms, floods, droughts and conflicts. And there’s the greatest moral wrong of all – the mass extinction event we have triggered that harms all life on Earth.Yet until recently, climate change has not been argued as a moral issue. Rather, it has been presented as a technocratic problem, a cost-benefit problem, where the costs of action must be weighed against the benefits of avoiding disaster. The debates have been around taxes, jobs, growth and technologies. While such debates are important – there are better and worse ways to tackle the climate crisis – the effect has been decades of inaction, denial and delay. When something is a moral wrong, particularly a deep, systemic moral wrong, we don’t wait around debating the optimal path or policy we stop it.Looking back in history, the climate movement can draw inspiration from another effort to right a deep moral wrong: the slavery abolition movement. There are clearly important differences between slavery and climate change, and I’m not drawing a moral equivalence between the two slavery was a unique moral horror and climate change is immoral in its own terrible way. But the climate community can find inspiration in the 19th-century abolitionist movement’s courageous efforts to make slavery illegal around the world.Those who fought against slavery did not agonise over the costs and benefits. Their goal was morally righteous and powerfully clear: abolish slavery, make it illegal. It is time to do this for climate change: to make human carbon pollution illegal in every country in the world. It is time for a “carbon abolition” movement, to put an end to emissions.This is exactly what the science tells us we must do. In order to contain warming to 1.5-2C we need to bring global human carbon emissions to net-zero between 2030 and 2050. Not just reduce it. Stop it. This principle is enshrined in the Paris agreement, although few signatories have grappled with its implications.A set of firm deadlines, enshrined in international law, would force countries to immediately begin enacting the policies required to meet them, and force companies to start changing their business models. Some will protest that these laws would kill jobs and growth. But such clear deadlines would finally give businesses and investors certainty that the fossil-fuel economy is coming to an end, and catalyse a historic boom in innovation – bringing to life a new clean-energy economy.Getting every country in the world to enact carbon abolition laws seems a distant dream today. But things must have looked similarly bleak to slavery abolitionists in the early 19th century. But then, after years of campaigning and civil action, Britain made slavery illegal in 1833, France in 1848, the US in 1865, followed by numerous other countries and international bans in 1890 and 1926.What set the cascade of change going was the development of abolition as a mass social movement. History tells us that mass social movements such as women’s suffrage, civil rights and gay rights have always used moral arguments to change politics. I can think of no mass movement that was sparked by a cost-benefit analysis.The climate movement is finally finding its moral voice. The school strikes, the global climate strike, Extinction Rebellion and growing support for a Green New Deal suggest that, at last, a mass social movement is rising that could tip our politics into action.But to catch fire this campaign needs a clear, simple demand, a rallying cry that everyone can share. “Stop climate change” is too vague and abstract, while the cacophony of narrower demands – “Stop fracking”, “Build more solar”, “Eat less meat” – is too confusing. These are all crucial issues, but many people are unsure of what to make of it all. Instead, by clearly showing the immorality of carbon pollution, we can activate people’s moral emotions and then focus those emotions on a specific action: making it illegal.We have a starting point: Britain recently joined the Nordic countries, France, New Zealand, the US state of California and 19 cities around the world in adopting net-zero targets, and the EU is considering a 2050 target. The next step is to shift these soft targets into hard carbon abolition laws.The 19th-century abolitionists were brave enough to demand that a system built on the immoral enslavement of fellow human beings be stopped. Today, are we brave enough to demand that a system built on the immoral destruction of life on Earth be stopped?• Eric Beinhocker is professor of public policy practice at the Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford, and executive director of the Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School.

Here’s your 2019 updateLooking back, the late 20th century looks like an enviably straightforward place to live. There’s probably a touch of rose-tinted hindsight here, I suppose (imagine having to get around using only paper maps, and eating iceberg lettuce in every salad) but at least you knew where you were.Work, for instance. Work had a fixed geographical location and a time window. Work was desks and staplers and telephones and fountain pens. You had to spend all your time sitting still at the desk, so that the people at your work knew you were at work, and so that other people in their other workplaces could phone you, on the phone that didn’t move from your desk. And so you knew what to wear. A pencil skirt and court shoes were perfect when your longest journey was walking to the kettle point and back. There was little pressure to “refresh your work look” when your office surroundings, from colleagues to pot plants, remained largely the same from year to year.If we are confused and discombobulated about what to wear to work in 2019, it is because we don’t really know what work is supposed to look like any more. Freelancing, remote working, technology and office culture has fundamentally changed the way work looks and feels. Work is paper-free hotdesking and laptops in cafes and lunch al desko. Work is emails on your phone at bedtime and video meetings. It is office politics choreographed through social media rather than the watercooler. A pencil skirt does not work for walking meetings, nor is it your friend if you have to gather in “break-out areas” with low-level seating.And yet our iconography of workwear for women remains rooted in the 80s and 90s. It is Margaret Thatcher in Downing Street, and Melanie Griffith in Working Girl. It is stuck in the era when Tina Brown first ruled New York and Ally McBeal was an up-and-coming Boston lawyer. It is trouser suits and shoulder pads and handbags built to house a Filofax. None of which is appropriate any more, but we have nothing with which to replace it. The last major storyline in the narrative of what we wear to work was Dress Down Friday, which felt like progress, but was essentially just a shrug of tacit admission that no one has a clue what to put on any more.In many workplaces these days, anything goes. Which, of course, is the hardest dress code of them all, because it doesn’t actually mean that anything goes, – it means a minefield of unspoken rules to be navigated. If you wear, say, a brightly coloured trouser suit instead of institutionalised black, will people think you have a creative and original mind, or will they think you are a fundamentally unserious person? Because those judgments matter, whether you like it or not. If you wear trainers with your trouser suit will your colleagues admire your fashion sense, or wonder if you forgot to change your shoes in the ladies? And so on and so forth. When you are standing in front of your wardrobe in the morning with the clock ticking down on the departure board in your head and these questions running through your mind, anything goes is not helpful at all.So I’m not here to tell you that you should wear whatever you feel comfortable in, because (a) it’s not true and (b) it’s not useful. We don’t need rules, but we do need a plan. Right? Let’s go to work.High heels at work are a bit toxic these days, no? It goes without saying that no woman should be forced by her employer to wear high heels if she doesn’t want to, and that it is utterly ludicrous that we are still having this debate but here we are. Two years ago, the British government rejected calls to outlaw mandatory high-heel policy. Japan, where a heel policy is commonplace, is the latest battleground, with a vocal #KuToo campaign – a pun on kutsu, meaning shoe, kutsuu, meaning pain, and #MeToo. Once you recognise how high heels have been weaponised against women in the workplace it’s harder to see them in a purely benign light, as fun and empowering. I’ve worn high heels for decades and I don’t find them painful but these days I wear flats most of the time, because heels can look a bit out of touch.But here’s the thing – you’re not going to like this, but it’s true – knee-length hemlines rarely work with flat shoes, and nor do floor-scraping trousers. Those silhouettes were built on a mannequin in heels. There are exceptions, obviously. If you are Stella Tennant you can wear a knee-length kilt and a brogue and look amazing, but on most of us norms it is not an elegant silhouette. Flat shoes work best with midi-length skirts, or with trousers that end at the ankle bone or a bit higher.A flat shoe shouldn’t make you look unsophisticated, or as if you haven’t made an effort. So instead of plain ballet pumps, go for loafers, or flat Mary Janes, or flat pumps with a narrow front V which gives them a little more gravitas. Trainers need to be spotless (most can be machine washed, on cold). Black tights with flat black shoes can look a bit school uniform, so if it’s only your ankle showing, get some trainer-liner socks and show a few inches of skin instead.Many women equate dressing smartly with wearing tight-fitting clothes. Give a woman an intimidating meeting or presentation to dress for and her default will often be to vacuum-pack herself into a tight dress or suit. I suppose there are issues here about what women are valued for, stirred into a primal instinct of what to wear in order to hold an audience’s attention. Anyway, I think it’s worth recognising as a pitfall: if what you are wearing is so tight that the only male equivalent is midlife crisis cycling gear, then consider a rethink.I am not suggesting we waft around the office in kaftans. (I love kaftans with a passion and plan to spend my entire dotage in them but they are not workwear.) There is certainly something about a defined, clear silhouette that projects a crispness and clarity that feels right at work – it just doesn’t have to be a newsreader-esque hourglass dress. I am very into the trouser shape I’m calling a Mom-trouser: high-waisted, with a buttoned waistband and wide or tapered (but not sausage tight) legs. This works really well with a shirt or blouse tucked in. A loose or pleated midi skirt becomes very purposeful-looking if you wear it with a structured blazer.You can be taken seriously without being a joyless automaton. Looking too officey is very ageing, when younger people in the workplace tend to dress more casually. And anyway, we spend a lot of time working, and what you wear is one way to alter the mood of your day. Print and colour are your friends. This time of year, before we get mired in the practicalities of freezing temperatures and wet pavements, is a good time to bring some fun to what you wear. Now, while our getting-dressed time slot still happens in daylight in a civilised fashion, before darkness descends and we are groping inside wardrobes in the pitch black, is the moment to experiment. When you look at outfits in fashion shoots and ad campaigns, don’t look at the price in the credits stare at the outfit and think about what you’ve already got in your wardrobe that has a similar vibe. It might be the same silhouette in a different print, or vice versa – but if you get an idea, then try it out.There are lots of ways you can add fun to what you wear to work. Colour is fun. Leopard print is possibly a bit too fun for some workplaces, but stripes are great. Florals can be very work-friendly on black backgrounds, and florals on black backgrounds are to autumn what leopard-print skirts are to summer, in the modern fashion calendar, which is, everywhere. Jumpsuits and boilersuits put a spring in your step, mentally as well as physically – something about the mobility of a jumpsuit makes it seem like an upbeat thing to wear.Not all fashion is created equal, when it comes to workwear. Fashion this autumn, for instance, includes many trends, some of which are well suited to wearing to the office (70s bourgeois is a slam dunk, being both smart and slick but also fashiony), and others which are perhaps less so. Feathers, for instance. Bucket hats. “Ugly sister” shoulders. Microbags.Trends that will work this season include shirtdresses: try them over knee-length or ankle-length boots, or layered over a polo neck, if they feel too summery otherwise. Also, try a blazer with a belt over the top I am very much feeling this as an intermediary level before the time comes to wear an actual coat.I’m talking about your coat, and your tote bag. The image in your head of what you wear to work is the clothes you are wearing once you have taken off your coat and hung it up along with the bag with your snacks, your gym clothes, the returns parcel you’ve got to drop off at lunchtime. But for many people you encounter on your way in and out and to and from meetings and appointments, the only part of you they see is your coat and your tote bag.So, think about your coat, obviously, but also be aware that even though you can’t see it – you get it out of the cupboard and sling it over your shoulder and leave the house – if your tote bag bears a brand or slogan, then that is the headline emblazoned across your person. If you wouldn’t wear it on a slogan T-shirt, don’t wear it on a tote bag. People will judge you, fact.

Paul Merton talks about the legacy of his hero – and how comedy is too coarse todaySeven years before his suicide, Tony Hancock tried to became a movie star. The Rebel (1961) is a comedy about a clerk who quits his job and moves to Paris to become an artist, despite his total lack of talent. Scripted by Half Hour creators Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, it was a deluxe bespoke vehicle, designed to take Hancock across the Atlantic and turn him into the new Peter Sellers.Brits flocked. Homegrown critics raved. And Hollywood absolutely hated it. (“Stumbling … presumptuous … depressing … low,” reckoned the New York Times, comparing him unfavourably to Norman Wisdom.)It was the start of the end. The following year, after a final series of Hancock’s Half Hour minus Sid James – let go lest Hancock be defined only as part of a double act – Hancock fired Galton and Simpson, too. They then made Steptoe and Son (average audience: 28 million) Hancock made a second bid for international film stardom with a self-scripted feature about a Punch and Judy show in Bognor Regis.“It’s not a comedy,” grimaces Paul Merton. “Don’t expect any laughs. It’s very bitter.” Merton was six when he went to see it with his mother, who began flinching in the first scene, when Hancock swears at the Lord Mayor. By the time he had “taken an ornamental pig and shoved a bunch of flowers up its arse, really quite violently”, her fandom was substantially shaken.Now, those two films that kiboshed Hancock’s big-screen dreams – one wonderful, one sort of awful – have been restored and rereleased with the heave-ho of Merton, a longtime keeper of the Hancock flame. The Rebel, at least, is a revelation: snappy, surreal, full of satirical horsepower and starring a baby-faced, blue-eyed bon vivant. For those of us familiar only with the black-and-white grump, the effervescence is amazing.Tell Merton this, and delight knocks a decade off him. “Ray and Alan always said Hancock seemed to have been born at 40, but in The Rebel he does have the bloom of youth in those cheeks. I think it’s the smooth skin.” Nice clear eyes, too. “Yes, wonderful!” he beams.Yet he is still a far cry from 35-year-old leading men today, few of whom have white tufts and dialogue describing themselves as “stout”. “Well, yes,” says Merton. “But since the early days he was called “Tubs” and there was lots of talk about his terrible feet. Comics then were meant to look a bit funny.”Still, when he remade half a dozen Half Hours in 1996 (big ratings, iffy reviews), he says you would never have guessed he and Hancock were the same age at the time of shooting: “It was to do with the war and with nutrition.” Plus, this was the era of Sgt Pepper, when 64 was repellently elderly. “Now, it’s not considered anything! It’s the new 12!”At 62, Merton looks like a merry, greying, hippie-era John Lennon. He is having cappuccinos in a deserted Bloomsbury hotel, hair straggly, round specs thick and glinting. He wears a charcoal suit and enormously floral shirt presumably bought for TV. In fact, he could have strolled straight off it. Merton surpasses even your most hopeful expectations: funny, friendly, generous, easy.Yet, like his hero, there is a residual sense he is a bit dour and depressive, stemming perhaps from an inpatient episode at Maudsley psychiatric hospital around the time he broke through on Whose Line Is It Anyway?. Actually, he says, that was down to some dodgy malaria tablets – his stay extended because staff didn’t believe he actually was on telly every Friday.The smog that surrounds Hancock is harder to shift. “It’s an impossible story to ignore,” says Merton. “The clown with the tear in his eye the comedian who makes everybody else laugh but cannot find satisfaction himself.” An easy cliche is media catnip. Merton “loathed” Stan \u0026amp Ollie, last year’s Laurel and Hardy biopic, because “it tried to create drama where there was no real friction. If I’d seen it in a cinema, I’d have been asked to leave. Every 15 minutes, I was like: ‘Oh, for fuck’s sake!’”Galton and Simpson were, he reports, “just astonished” by the 1991 Hancock film starring Alfred Molina, which shows them smirking “like the Kray twins” in the back row at his ill-fated 1966 stage comeback. Years later, Galton met the writer at a party and punched him to the floor. “Good on him!” grins Merton. “The sheer anger! How dare you do that! Ray and Alan were always grateful and affectionate towards Tony. He’d split his fee with them 5050. He introduced them to France and wine. When they knew him there was little hint of what was to come. He was a bit of a worrier. But then a lot of comedians can be worriers, particularly if you’re not writing your own material.”Hancock’s legacy, he thinks, has suffered under a spotlight fixed on his grubbier troubles – and some unhelpful visuals. “That famous shot of him wearing the big coat and looking miserable over a cup of tea. That was from a programme called The Cold. He’s meant to be ill. Not to look desperately suicidal.”Yet even Merton can’t help having false hindsight. “There’s that line in The Rebel,” he says with a shiver. “‘You’ll be sorry when I’m dead.’ It does rather leap out at you.”Quite why the film was such a disaster across the pond is still a puzzle. After all, Ealing succeeded, despite – or perhaps because of – its amplified Englishness. Even the Carry Ons had cut through. But something about the bluster and camp indignation of Hancock’s delivery seems to have mistranslated. And there is something peculiarly parochial about the narrative of a frustrated fantasist crashing out of the rat race. There are echoes of Billy Liar in the office scenes groundwork for Reggie Perrin in the train commute, in which Hancock’s voiceover speculates about his fellow passengers (few Americans travel to work in the same way).When Merton first saw The Rebel in the late 70s, it was during his three-year stint at Tooting Bec employment office in south London. The sequence on the 8:32 to Waterloo struck a special chord. “Hancock goes: ‘Oh, there’s young Reginald. If this train’s still running in 1980, he’ll be on it.’” Merton shudders. “When I started at 19, they told me about the pension scheme. Going to the same place every day, doing the same job, filled me with horror.”This is another reason The Rebel might not have hit home in the land of the American dream. Even back in 1961, the notion of ditching a mundane job to try to make it big wasn’t so wild. It might also be what limits its contemporary appreciation, when it is taken as read you should seek artistic fulfilment (and jobs for life are the real pipe-dream).In the film, George Sanders’ art dealer is unsparing about Hancock’s lack of talent today, such harsh criticism is a no-no. Whether or not someone actually has any gifts “doesn’t seem to be important any more,” says Merton. There are too many channels and “not that much talent to go around to fill all this space”.He was watching something the other day, he says, that recapped the career highlights of a social media star, “which mostly seemed to be combing his hair. I mean, it’s a long way from Sammy Davis Jr! I know we all want to leave our mark, but now there’s millions of them, I’m not sure it’s any better than it used to be in terms of standing out from the crowd.”The Rebel is especially sharp on the fallacy of inidualism. An existentialists’ party sees them bemoaning the hegemony of office life, while dressed in matching black outfits with identical goatees. Plus ça change, laughs Merton. “I’m by no means an expert on women’s hair, but I have noticed in the last three or four months this fashion, which I think is great, for pink hair and yellow hair. Everyone’s inidual in their own way of doing it, but they’re all doing it.”Merton’s granny-ish lack of savvy is knowingly naive – and real. He delights in a luddite world (no mobile phone, no email, no idea what Instagram is) not so distant from that inhabited by his hero. Despite his day job, he says he doesn’t follow the news or care for politics. “Give me a story about a parrot that’s learned how to drive and I’m in seventh heaven.”Nor does he watch modern comedy (his most recent reference is The Royle Family), mostly because he’s got an “incredibly good memory for jokes” and worries about accidental plagiarism. When he does catch a bit, he’s rarely impressed. “Comedy has coarsened. It’s weak. It’s lazy. I don’t want to sound prudish, and some bodily function jokes can be good. But it’s a shame that if you say ‘fuck’ in front of an audience, they’ll probably laugh. It’s a shock thing. Any weak punchline can be bolstered by sticking that word in there.”Not that we should rose-tint comedy’s golden age. The Blood Donor contains uncomfortable lines about Hancock’s “undiluted British” blood and how it ought not to be mixed. The Two Ronnies had “quite a bit of blackface and antisemitism. Stuff which you’d have gone ‘Ooooh’ at even in 1977.”But Merton doesn’t really want to give anyone a kicking. Comedy is an underrated skill, he says, more so now than ever. It is overlooked for Oscars “because comedy undermines the pomposity of calling yourself something like The Academy of Motion Pictures and Science”. Yet it is harder than drama, because if that audience seems spellbound “they might just be thinking about tomorrow’s shopping. While with comedy, they’re either laughing or they’re not. You know exactly how it’s going.” He sighs. “In the 1920s, Chaplin was compared to Michelangelo and Leonardo Da Vinci, Beethoven and Shakespeare. He was considered a giant of his art.”Hancock’s aspirations were understandable. And in filming The Rebel – about a man desperate for artistic acclaim – he was making his own stab at what he saw as the ultimate immortality. It’s not so unusual, it turns out. As we’re packing up, I ask Merton if he ever fancied getting into film. “Yes, but the film didn’t want me getting into it.” He laughs. “But that was always my real big top ambition.”I hadn’t realised. Oh yes, he says. A couple of years ago, he wrote a script with his wife, Suki Webster. “We couldn’t even get meetings. Channel 4 never even replied.” I’m amazed. Why? He frets it might have felt like a vanity project that he should have got a director onboard first. “But I’ve got no reputation in that world. No credit, no credibility. Still, I think we were rather bemused by the complete lack of interest.”Merton smiles sadly. And, for a second, Hancock is back in the room.The Rebel and The Punch and Judy Man are on Blu-ray, DVD and Amazon Video from 30 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89ed3b7e946b92ec8e5a0dd8d2a850add0561229/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=643012bdbc2d19ec33bfe33dca785764","title":"anna jones turkish lahmacun esme salad recipes","story":"A deliciously chewy, moreish flatbread that many call the Turkish ‘pizza’, with a spicy salad of tomatoes and onion with beansWhere I live in Hackney, London, there is a Turkish kebab shop on every corner. The mum or granny of the family often sits in the window, rolling gozleme and bases for their pizza-like lahmacun: I challenge you to find a better, cheaper lunch. I rarely make them at home though as I’m not as adept at rolling, but I found myself out of town the other day and craving them.So this was dinner, with an ezme salad featuring mandarin, inspired by a recent trip to the restaurant Bubala in London, where they put grapefruit in theirs. I am sure neither of these dishes are traditional: I’ve simplified the lahmacun dough and added a few things like harissa to the ezme salad, but that’s exactly what recipes should be, and what I love about where I live in London: a tapestry of food, people and culture.Lahmacun are often nicknamed “Turkish pizzas.” There are as many variations of these flatbreads in Turkey as there are pizzas in Italy, from bazlama to manaqish, depending on where you are. The breads vary in how the dough comes together and how they are cooked, as well as what they are topped with. I obviously go for the vegetarian version: here, earthy spices lift finely chopped sweet peppers and late-summer tomatoes.For the pizza dough350ml luke-warm water1 tbsp dried yeast1 pinch sugar2 tbsp olive oil500g strong white bread flour (or 00 pasta flour)1 pinch saltFor the topping2 red peppers, deseeded and chopped3 tomatoes, finely chopped1 fresh green chilli2 garlic cloves2 tsp cumin seeds1 tsp ground coriander1 tbsp tomato pureeZest of ½ lemonMix the warm water, yeast, sugar and oil in a bowl, and leave for about 10 minutes.In a stand mixer with a dough hook, mix the flour and salt for a few seconds. Then, with the motor still running, slowly add the liquid, and keep mixing until the dough no longer sticks to the sides and is soft, glossy and stretchy – about five minutes. Alternatively, you can mix the dough and then knead by hand for 10 minutes. Stretch the dough between two hands, if you can see through the thin layer of dough that forms then it’s ready.Cover the dough so it’s airtight,  and leave somewhere warm for about an hour. Once it has doubled in size, turn out and knead for a few more minutes, until soft.Heat the oven to its hottest setting and put a pizza stone or heavy-based frying pan in to get really hotside.Finely chop or blitz the topping ingredients in a food processor to a rough, salsa-like texture. Season well with salt, then pour the topping into a sieve and stir until most of the liquid has drained off, and you’re left with a thick, tomatoey salsa-sauce.On a well floured surface, split the dough into four and roll each piece out into a 5mm-thick round. Remove the hot pan from the oven and carefully put a circle of dough into the pan. Put two tablespoons of the sauce on top and spread evenly in a nice, thin layer.Bake for about five minutes, until bubbly, golden and charred at the edges. Remove from the oven, sprinkle with the fresh herbs and sumac, then finish with a drizzle of olive oil. Repeat with the rest of the dough and topping and serve immediately.An absolute staple of Turkish cuisine. You will find a bowl of this spicy salad as part of many meze spreads. I first tried it in an east London takeaway, alongside falafel, Turkish feta and stewed green beans, and now I can’t get enough.

Well, even the experts disagreeSo long as it’s made from ripe tomatoes, I think sugo is fine without sugar, but my partner disagrees. What do you think?Peter, Zollikon, SwitzerlandSeptember is the month when British outdoor-grown tomatoes are at their peak, not to mention cheapest, so hit the market, fill your boots and channel your inner nonna by making vats of this classic pasta sauce.As for Peter’s domestic dispute, the simple answer is: it obviously all depends on the quality of the tomatoes, though, as with all cooking, your own tastes play a pivotal role, too, says Rachel Roddy, Feast’s Italian correspondent. “I don’t know where this idea that adding sugar is wrong or even an issue came from,” she says with a shake of the head. “After all, I’ve seen so many cooks add a pinch of sugar in much the same way as you’d adjust the taste with salt.”Essentially, the less ripe your tomatoes, the more likely they’ll be to need a little something to help them along. Not only that, Roddy adds, but “plenty of tomatoes are really quite acidic, so will only benefit from a bit of added sugar”.Even the great and the good of the food world can’t reach a consensus on the matter. Claudia Roden opts for “a teaspoon of sugar, or to taste”, for every kilo of fresh tomatoes (or 800g of tinned), whereas Anna del Conte adds the same amount to sugo made with tinned, but omits it “in the summer when good fresh tomatoes are on the market” Alastair Little adds just “a little sugar” to his sugo by default, and Giorgio Locatelli only “if needed”. The queen of Italian food writing, Ada Boni, however, makes no mention of sugar at all, a path followed a quarter-century later by Ruth Rogers and Rose Gray in their 1990s River Cafe books.That restaurant’s current head chef, Joe Trivelli, is on-message, too. “I absolutely don’t do it,” he says, though he accepts that may have something to do with being fortunate enough to work only with impeccable produce. “It’s all about the tomatoes,” he says. “Good ones will be sweet enough as they are. Everyone used to put tomato puree in tomato sauce – well, my mum did, anyway – and that’s also pretty pointless all it does is add an artificial, sweet taste.”Mind you, Trivelli says, certain brands of tinned tomatoes come swimming in juice of questionable origin, so in some circumstances sugar is kind of forgivable. “After all, when I was a student, we were taught always to add a touch of sugar, but I’d forgotten about it until now – it hasn’t crossed my mind to do so in years.”That said, officially the best sugo recipe in the whole world ever (don’t all @ me at once, please: it’s just a statement of fact), namely “tomato sauce III” in Marcella Hazan’s 1976 Classic Italian Cookbook, includes a quarter-teaspoon of granulated sugar per kilo of ripe plum tomatoes. To make it, wash and halve the toms, then simmer in a covered pot for 10 minutes. Pass the now slightly slumped fruit through a food mill back into the pot, add 110g butter, a peeled and halved onion, a touch of salt and the sugar, and leave to burble and reduce gently, lid off, for 45 minutes. Pick out the onion, adjust the sauce for salt, then toss through cooked pasta or gnocchi. You’ll never view pasta al pomodoro the same again, promise – as Hazan so modestly put it, this sauce is “unsurpassed”, and who am I to disagree?• Do you have a culinary dilemma?

Opponents whom fans of a particular club dread to see their team face because they seem inexplicably incapable of registering a win? Although it may be some time before the next Tyne-Wear derby, Newcastle supporters could be forgiven for being baffled by their side’s curious recent inability to beat Sunderland, their bitter rivals in the north-east. Newcastle are on a run of nine games without victory against a team that generally didn’t take much beating even before their ignominious slide into League One. Between April 2013 and October 2015, Sunderland beat Newcastle six times in as many games.Meanwhile in East Anglia, Norwich City and Ipswich Town have played each other 148 times dating back to 1902. Ipswich have won 60 matches to Norwich’s 58 but have failed to prevail in any of the past 12 Old Farm derbies, losing seven and drawing five. On Merseyside, Everton fans won’t need reminding that they haven’t won against Liverpool in any of the past 19 meetings. Further south, Tottenham Hotspur finally ended a weird hoodoo against Chelsea in April 2018. A 2-1 win ended a run of 32 meetings without a Spurs victory at Stamford Bridge dating back 28 years.For more than half a century in international football, Germany considered Italy to be their particular angstgegner, due in no small part to an apparently inexplicable inability to beat them at major championships. At the 1962 World Cup finals, the two nations played out a scoreless draw in front of 65,440 fans at the Estadio Nacional in Santiago, beginning a series of eight games between the sides at summer finals in which West GermanyGermany failed to register a win. Described as “the Italian trauma”, this malaise was finally cured in Bordeaux at the 2016 European Championship, when Germany prevailed in a quarter-final penalty shootout. Somewhat remarkably, Mesut Özil’s opener in the 65th minute marked the first time in 845 minutes of tournament play between the two sides that Germany had even taken the lead.Writing in the  more than a decade ago, the Racing Post football betting guru Kevin Pullein, a man whose currency is cold stats rather than sentiment or superstition, debunked the notion of bogey teams, stating that they are “as much a figment of our imagination as the bogey man”. He made the point that “past results in a fixture have no influence over future happenings”, pointing out that teams “who seem to have some sort of spell over their opponents have simply been lucky most of the time”.His words will come as music to the ears of Watford fans travelling to the Etihad Stadium to face Manchester City on Saturday. Bottom of the table and still smarting from that FA Cup final humiliation last May, most of them would probably settle for a reasonably narrow defeat before escaping with their dignity intact. The more optimistic among Hornets fans, however, may view the game as an opportunity for some sort of payback, considering their team’s stirring second-half comeback against Arsenal one day after Pep Guardiola’s side had showed obvious signs of fallibility while losing at Norwich. Injuries to key personnel mean Manchester City look so vulnerable they could finish as low as second come season’s end.For optimistic, read delusional. While there is no shame in losing to Manchester City, getting beaten by them 11 times in a row is a state of affairs that is, at the very least, mildly embarrassing and suggests there may well be some sort of supernatural force at work. In the past 16 meetings between the two sides, Watford have managed two draws, both masterminded by the now England Under-21 manager Aidy Boothroyd well over a decade ago. Watford have lost the other 14 matches by an incredible aggregate score of 46-8.When the sides line up at the Etihad shortly before 3pm, it will be 11,158 days since Watford last beat Manchester City. To put this in some sort of context, Margaret Thatcher was still prime minister of the UK, the Scottish rockers Simple Minds were No 1 in the UK charts with Belfast Child, and eight of the Watford starting XI that lined up against Arsenal last weekend had not been born.As well as Boothroyd, the managers Colin Lee, Steve Perryman, Glenn Roeder, Graham Taylor (twice), Kenny Jackett, Gianluca Vialli, Ray Lewington, Malky Mackay (twice), Brendan Rodgers, Sean Dyche, Gianfranco Zola, Giuseppe Sannino, Óscar García, Billy McKinlay, Slavisa Jokanovic, Walter Mazzarri, Marco Silva, Javi Gracia and Quique Sánchez Flores (twice) have been appointed at Vicarage Road since Watford last beat Manchester City. With all that in mind and the visitors to the Etihad available to back at odds of 30-1 to buck this trend, a bet on Watford might be best left alone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ffe53c3ac511357a416aeb046904ba2ba333401/134_307_3833_2300/master/3833.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb6542fc8a17568026a7e633ebe915e3","title":"premier league team news injury updates and more live","story":"Time for some Pep Guardiola press conf goss. The Manchester City boss has given an update on when centre-back John Stones will return:“Hopefully in one month, or a bit more, he will be back.”Stones’ absence has added to the longer-term loss of Aymeric Laporte, meaning City played Brazilian midfielder Fernandinho as a makeshift centre-half alongside Nicolas Otamendi in their Champions League tie away to Shakhtar Donetsk on Wednesday.That said, it went pretty well as City kept a clean sheet and won 3-0.Pep also says he expects Saturday’s opponents, Watford, to present a stronger challenge than they did in the FA Cup final when City hammered them 6-0.“Now it’s totally different,” said Guardiola. “It’s the beginning of the season and they have changed their manager. I saw their game against Arsenal and - wow - the second half was incredible, the way they played.” Where did this “in and around” usage come from? Increasingly heard in football terms when referring to a striker being “in and around the box”. But now Frank Lampard has expanded it to a player being “in and around” the team.Perhaps he’s just a fan of the Small Faces?“Yes you have always been hereFeeling deep insideA feeling that I could not seeOr touch, or try to hideMy love is in and around youI bless the day that I found youSo listen up baby.”Some Chelsea team news. And it could be of the positive variety with Frank Lampard giving an update on one of his young stars, Mason Mount.The midfielder suffered an ankle injury after a late challenge from Francis Coquelin in the Champions League defeat against Valencia on Tuesday but Lampard isn’t ruling him out of Sunday’s showdown with leaders Liverpool.“He’s got a chance,” said Lampard. “We all saw the image of the tackle which made it look really bad but we are trying to get him moving today. We’ll make a call before the game.” Talking of midfielders and ankle injuries, N’Golo Kante looks to have shaken off one of his own after returning to training. “It’s a boost with N’Golo, we all know the importance of him to the team. The only question is how fit he is. We have to manage him but it’s great to have him back in and around us.”In and around us? “In football and life, everything is possible,” says Watford boss Quique Sanchez Flores. And coming from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 with Arsenal last week surely proves the endless possibilities of the universe.Flores, who is back for a second spell at Vicarage Road, may have to look in a mirror and repeat that mantra plenty of times ahead of Saturday’s games as his side travel to the Etihad. And, as the stats gods of Opta tell us: Manchester City have won their last 11 meetings with Watford in all competitions, scoring at least twice in each game (38 goals in total).“For us when we are preparing a match in the week, we are not thinking about how tough it is or not. Every single match (in the Premier League) is very tough,” said Flores, whose Watford side prop up the table with a grand tally of just two points from five games. “We are preparing the match thinking about our possibilities and how we can do things and how we can try to manage. We are always positive. My priority basically is to try to find some style for us. We want to try and establish some order, some organisation and this is what I want.”It’s the Phil Jagielka derby at Goodison on Saturday. The England defender made 350 appearances for Everton and returns there with Sheffield United, the place where he launched his career.The Blades are currently 15th with five points from five games and two-club man Jagielka sees plenty of encouraging signs.“Because we’ve not got massive household names who have played a lot of Premier League football and we didn’t spend a tremendous amount of money in the summer, people have knocked us,” he said.“But in among the squad and the staff the belief has always been there and I think, when you’ve done what these lads have done over the last few years, you can’t do that without great determination and self-belief.” “It’s too easy to lose confidence in this ision because you do play against some fantastic players week in, week out. But as it stands, as you can tell from the previous couple of years, the momentum is still there and that’s key for us at the moment.”He stressed: “We are blessed to have him. The results and the way we play our beautiful football speaks for itself. I have good harmony with Chris.”Interesting to note that Prince Abdullah made his wealth from paper production. And he’s not the first. Look at Jeff Lamp, 42 years old, got his own Porsche. That’s from paper.Thanks Tom and good afternoon. I’ll kick off with some Leicester news and words from the bossguru himself, Brendan Rodgers. No less than eight of his side who featured in the 1-0 loss at Old Trafford last weekend were 23 or under and Rodgers says, as a group, they’re still learning.“For us the ambition is important and there is real excitement going forward. We have a group of exciting young talent that need educating and we must give them confidence and belief to achieve,” he said. “There is a strong culture here of learning and wanting to do better. We have very talented young players and also a great group of experienced pros to complement that.“All of them have the hunger to improve and when you mix all that together then ambition will hopefully help you to progress. We are trying to form an identity here and we know we must improve - and we will over time. “But we know we haven’t fully got to our top level yet and we’re still in a good place - fifth in league and still in a cup and showing some good qualities with lots still to improve on.”Plenty of squares crossed off there in ‘Brendan Bingo’.Right, I’m handing over now and putting you in the capable hands of David Tindall. We’ve got Pep Guardiola and Manuel Pellegrini media conferences, among other things, to come, as well as squadsheets for the weekend’s big games. Bye.Paul Wilson chews over Liverpool and Manchester City’s title prospects and says that though questions are suddenly being asked about Pep Guardiola’s side, you’d be daft to say it’s already Liverpool’s to lose:Embarrassing goals dept: here’s a Qatari goalkeeper making the worst possible start to a matchWelcome back.

To steal a not-yet-trademarked big football club’s slogan, this means more.Brighton’s manager, Graham Potter, has been chin-wagging about the long trip to Newcastle tomorrow evening. He says his team must be flexible as they look to shackle the “different option” of the fit-again Newcastle striker Andy Carroll, reports PA Media. Steve Bruce feels the former Liverpool player offers his team an “old-fashioned centre-forward” with which to target the opposition defence. Potter accepts keeping Carroll quiet will be a tough task, but is also aware that his players have to keep guard against a frontline that caused Tottenham so many problems a few weeks ago. “I would imagine it is a big boost having someone of his quality,” Potter said when asked on the prospect of facing a fully-fit Carroll on Saturday evening. “It is a different option, there is not too many like for like players as Andy Carroll around. “I have been impressed with how their front three have combined anyway and played. They went away to Tottenham and won. They were competitive at Liverpool before a couple of errors made the scoreline go away (from them) a little bit. “Newcastle away is a difficult game, just like all the games we have played, but we will just focus on what we need to do well to get a positive result. We know we are going to have to play well and be lucky, that type of stuff, but we will try.” Potter will have full-back Martin Montoya available again following illness. “The boys are open-minded to being flexible and adaptable and they all want to take that challenge on,” Potter said. “We lost three players after the international break, as an example, and you have to be able to adapt and do something different to before - those that needed to went out and demonstrated that.”You’ll be wanting a weekend quiz won’t you. Well here you are:Jurgen Klopp has compared Frank Lampard’s Chelsea to his early Borussia Dortmund team and said Mason Mount, Tammy Abraham and Callum Hudson-Odoi are already £60m players. Liverpool travel to Stamford Bridge on Sunday when both teams will be looking to respond to midweek Champions League defeats. Chelsea, who also lost on penalties to Liverpool in the Uefa Super Cup final, have made an inconsistent start under Lampard, who has won only two of his first seven matches in charge. But Klopp believes the new Chelsea manager is developing an exciting young side that reminds him of his early work with Dortmund. The Liverpool manager said: “They had a couple of problems but they sorted them well. It’s a really exciting team. It reminds me a little bit of my team at Dortmund years back. They were really young and people always spoke about that but they only played because they were that good. “Chelsea brought in Pulisic in the summer. I don’t know about the money but it was £50m-60m. All the players around him now have the same value. Tammy Abraham is a £60m player, Mason Mount for sure is 60m, maybe more. Hudson-Odoi was already that. Jorginho is still young, Kante looks like he could play for the next 20 years, Kovacic, Barkley, then the experienced guys around them, Pedro, Willian, Giroud. “If there was one club in the world where a transfer ban didn’t hit that bad it was probably Chelsea because of their transfer policy in the last few years with these high quality players out on loan. Abraham didn’t learn where the goal is at Chelsea, he found it in different places. They are just a good team, they have all my respect. They are a proper contender for everything. Now we play there and we want to get something.”Here’s David Hytner with that Tottenham loan refinance story in full:Some financial crisis news: the BBC is reporting that Southend United have been hit with a winding-up petition by HMRC. It’s their second this year. The new petition is due to be heard at the Royal Courts of Justice on 16 October. Southend have made a terrible start to their League One campaign, currently lie second from bottom above the even-more-afflicted Bolton, and are managerless after Kevin Bond quit earlier this month.Southampton v Bournemouth chat: Saints manager, Ralph Hasenhüttl, is feeling pretty chipper about his side. “You can feel that these players are believing in what they’re doing,” he says, “It’ll be a tough and tactically demanding game against Bouremouth but an interesting one for the players and the crowd. It can be a very open game but hope we get the right result One of the Southampton players in an upbeat mood this season so far is Jan Bednarek, whom our own Ben Fisher met earlier in the week. Catch up with what he said here:Some Spurs news: Daniel Levy has announced that the club will be refinancing their new-stadium loans but insisted that he will continue to run Tottenham on the relatively frugal business plan that has characterised his chairmanship. The full story on that from our man David Hytner will be up shortly.As for the team, Mauricio Pochettino has been speaking before tomorrow lunchtime’s match at Leicester, and he thinks it’s too early to tell how the season’s going to pan out. “It’s too early to talk about contenders and what will happen in the future. Still all the teams are finding their best,” he said. “We only play five games in the Premier League. Until you play between 10 and 15 games, it’s difficult to see what will happen and the real contenders, teams who are going to be serious contenders. It is still so early.”“Leicester is a very good team with a lot of unbelievable players. After winning the Premier League they rebuild their squad and are doing fantastic with a great manager like Brendan Rodgers, who I know very well. They are doing a fantastic job.” Reflecting on the 2-2 draw at Olympiakos, and the criticism levelled at Christian Eriksen’s performance in particular, Pochettino admitted: “The collective performance wasn’t the best from us. I am happy with the commitment of Christian, he ran a lot and was very committed with the team, the effort but I think I am not concerned about him.” Some reading for you’se: Ben Fisher surveys the top-flight’s subs’ benches and training grounds for this piece on the Premier League’s forgotten men.Ole Gunnar Solskjær has aired some thoughts, in the aftermath of that narrow Man Utd win over Astana. Including that he’s not that stressed by Marcus Rashford’s recent lack of goals because the forward has demonstrated hunger and determination to improve. Talking of forwards, Anthony Martial is expected to miss the trip to West Ham on Sunday along with Paul Pogba and Luke Shaw. United could also be without Dan James, who missed the match against Astana with a knock sustained in the victory against Leicester. “I don’t know,” Solskjaer said. “He’s not trained the last few days. Hopefully, but not sure. We’ll have a recovery day with everyone and we’ll see on Saturday.” Solskjær said the likes of Axel Tuanzebe and Fred could also figure in the line-up on Sunday, as is 17-year-old Mason Greenwood after his display against Astana. “It’s always hard to keep players who perform well out of the team,” the manager said. Newcastle news now, and Andy Carroll, no less, could be in for a second Toon debut when Brighton visit on Saturday. Here’s this from PA Media:Andy Carroll could make a second debut for Newcastle against Brighton on Saturday evening after finally shaking off an ankle injury. The 30-year-old last played for former club West Ham in February, and later underwent surgery to address a long-standing problem, but has trained all week with the Magpies, who he joined at the end of the summer transfer window, and is ready to resume his carer. Head coach Steve Bruce said: “As long as he comes through today OK - touch wood, he’ll come through today OK - but yes, he will be involved, which is good news for all of us. “At the top end of the pitch, him and Allan Saint-Maximin as well, we have been a little bit short - and Dwight Gayle is another one - so we have had limited options up top, but certainly the return of Andy and Allan give us something which obviously can only benefit us.”Jürgen Klopp speaks! The Liverpool manager is up before the media, ahead of Sunday’s trip to Frank Lampard’s Chelsea (TM). Injury-wise, he tells us that Naby Keita’s back in training today, but Alisson is not ready yet, though he is “making good progress”. Divock Origi’s not ruled out.As for converns around Virgil van Dijk’s fitness, the manager replies: “We have four world class centre-halves and they can play together, so that can be enough.” As for the man behind them, Adrian, Klopp hails his progress since his Southampton blunder. “The Southampton thing was exceptional but human beings make mistakes. He was only maybe two or three weeks here when we played Southampton and they know each other much better now and hopefully it can stay like this. It couldn’t be the case in the first few games. Asked to assess Frank Lampard’s record so far, he says, “He’s done really well but it’s not my job to talk about other managers. What I can say is they play exciting football, they’ve played last two games in a different system in a busy period, so that’s interesting, they’re an exciting football team, young but good. It’s not a surprise that he’s done well. I said it last year and was not just being polite, it’s the truth. He did an outstanding job at Derby so I’m not surprised he’s doing a really good job at Chelsea.“If there’s one club in the world a transfer ban didn’t hit that bad it’s Chelsea because of their transfer policy of the last few years with a lot high quality players out on loan.”Some news nuggets you may have missed: Callum Hudson-Odoi has signed a new five-year deal at Chelsea, whose transfer ban seems to have made them realise the breadth of their young talent:And Sheffield United’s new owner Prince Abdullah has defendedexplained the Bin Laden family’s interest in investing in the club:And some random rumours, courtesy of Scott Murray:Morning everyone. It’s been a busy old week and we’re back in the cycle of Premier League teams being in action pretty much every day. No sooner have we digested last night’s European action – featuring relief for Manchester United, satisfaction for Rangers and Celtic, worry for Wolves and an upswing in the Arsenal rollercoaster – than we’re pitched into the weekend’s Premier League action.Starting tonight at St Mary’s, where Southampton host Bournemouth in what should be an agreeable mid-table south coast tussle, Saints seeking their first home win of the season and Bournemouth looking to build on a deserved win over Everton last Sunday.Tomorrow’s programme gives Leicester another chance to test their top-six credentials against a Spurs side who looked a bit ragged in Greece on Wednesday, while Norwich visit Burnley full of the joys of autumn after turning over Manchester City, who host Watford in what the visitors will hope won’t be a repeat of the 6-0 Cup final non-event in May. The second coming of Quique Sánchez Flores does at least appear to have made them more sprightly, if the draw against Arsenal is anything to go by. Elsewhere, Chris Wilder takes his marauding Sheffield United centre-backs to Everton and Newcastle take on a Brighton side who’ve not won since eviscerating Watford on the opening day.It’s not too busy a morning on the press conference front, but Jürgen Klopp is due up soon. We’ll have team news and more about the above games and others as the day progresses.

The news follows a difficult period at the organisation. An independent report in February this year described its workplace as “toxic”.Amnesty said the union’s course of action was disappointing.Unite believes the proposed cuts will “greatly reduce” the charity’s ability to deliver critical human rights work, and will result in the loss of expertise.The union said it had no option but to ballot its members, given management’s refusal to consider using donations to keep people in work, rather than using them to boost reserves. The organisation has 755 staff.Alan Scott, Unite’s regional co-ordinating officer, said: “Unite has exhausted all the available dispute resolution options open to it, including meetings at the conciliation service Acas.“Unfortunately, Amnesty’s management has refused to countenance reducing the amount of money being pumped into reserves in order to save jobs, and therefore members felt they had no option but to ballot for industrial action.“Amnesty’s management can still have the opportunity to prevent industrial action by tabling proposals that redundancies will be avoided by using a fraction of its reserves.”Unite said the redundancies were a direct result of overspending by the senior management team.A spokesman for Amnesty said: “It is disappointing that Unite has decided to ballot its members employed by Amnesty International for industrial action. However, we fully recognise and support Amnesty International employees’ right to strike.“We are very grateful to everyone who has engaged constructively with the consultation and enabled us to reduce the number of redundancies. Nonetheless, this provides little solace to those at risk of losing their jobs.“We deeply regret that these redundancies have been made necessary due to harsh financial realities and the need to put the secretariat on to a more stable footing for the future. This is a painful and difficult decision, and we will do everything in our power to support impacted staff.“Regrettably, we do not have the option to further reduce the level of reserve as it is at the absolute minimum to ensure the fiscal future of the organisation.”One insider at Amnesty said the threatened redundancies were the “final straw” for many staff at the organisation, who feel they have been treated badly.“We’ve had damning wellbeing reports one after another. But the way they are conducting the consultation, we feel no lessons have been learned,” another source said.The crisis at Amnesty emerged last year when Gaëtan Mootoo, 65, a senior researcher, killed himself at his Paris office, leaving a note blaming work pressures and a lack of support from management. His death was followed by several reviews. One, conducted by James Laddie QC, found that “a serious failure of management” had contributed to Mootoo’s death.A subsequent independent review of workplace culture found a “state of emergency” at the organisation after a restructuring process."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b97b8cf0a8bd1a0ff2a819eb024c7f669937136/335_0_1378_827/master/1378.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19f8c2a3b2345952dafe84c2c7cfadf9","title":"american airlines aairpass golden ticket","story":"My dad was one of the only people with a good-for-life, go-anywhere American Airlines pass. This is the true story of having – and losing – a superpowerby Caroline Rothstein with illustrations by Hokyoung Kim for NarrativelyOn 10 March 2009, a case was filed in the US circuit court for the northern district of Illinois, where I grew up. Rothstein v American Airlines, Inc starred my father, Plaintiff Steven Rothstein, and the defendant, then the world’s third-largest airline. With $23bn in annual revenue, American Airlines had nothing to lose. For my father, it was a last-ditch effort to save his life.Here’s how it all took off. In the early 1980s, American rolled out AAirpass, a prepaid membership program that let very frequent flyers purchase discounted tickets by locking in a certain number of annual miles they presumed they might fly in advance. My 30-something-year-old father, having been a frequent flyer for his entire life, purchased one. Then, a few years later, American introduced something straight out of an avid traveler’s fantasy: an unlimited ticket.In 1987, amid a lucrative year as a Bear Stearns stockbroker, my father became one of only a few dozen people on earth to purchase an unlimited, lifetime AAirpass. A quarter of a million dollars gave him access to fly first class anywhere in the world on American for the rest of his life. He flew so much it paid for itself. Often he’d leave in the morning for a business trip, fly back, and I hadn’t even known he’d left. Other times, I remember calling his office to find out what country he was in. He (and our whole family) was featured on NBC’s Today Show in 2003, and then on MSNBC in 2006. For 20 years, he was one of American’s top fliers, accumulating more than 30 million miles, which he acquired every time he flew, even with the AAirpass.Then, on 13 December 2008, American took the AAirpass away.For several years, the revenues department at American had been monitoring my father and other AAirpass holders to see how much their golden tickets were costing the airline in lost revenue. After 20 years, it seems, they’d decided the pass wasn’t such a good idea. My father was one of several lifetime, unlimited AAirpass holders American claimed had breached their contracts.A few months later, my father sued American for breaking their deal, and more importantly, taking away something integral to who he was. The legal fight went on for years without going to trial. The story became front-page news. The Los Angeles Times. The New York Post. Fox News. A slew of online outlets. It’s even a perennially popular conversation topic on Reddit.The obvious story is that my father was a decadent jet-setter who either screwed or got screwed by American depends on your take. The coverage is always sensational. And I think – as does my whole family, including my dad – that at the very least, it doesn’t quite land.Legend goes, upon bringing me to O’Hare Airport as a baby, my father said, “This is daddy’s playground.”Dad has loved to travel for his entire life. His father, Josh, was a navigator in the army air corps during the second world war and ran a company that manufactured paper and artificial flowers, traveling worldwide and telling stories about the places he went.“When I was nine,” Dad tells me, “we went to Denver. When he left in the morning to go on his business appointments, he said to me: stay at the pool, charge your lunch to the room, and I’ll see you at dinnertime. Make sure you have your tie on.”When he was 16, Dad’s parents took him on a three-and-a-half-week trip: New York–San Francisco–Honolulu–Kamuela–Tokyo–Nagoya–Osaka–Okinawa–Taipei–Hong Kong–Calcutta–Karachi–Tehran–Rome–Florence–Nice–London–New York.“I began to taste, directly, the fervor of foreign travel,” he tells me. “I felt as at home in Copenhagen or Paris as I did in New York … I was a child of the world.”He wrote his college application on a typewriter at a hotel beach in Hawaii and mailed it from a post office in Osaka. In college he worked for a travel agency helping students book standby flights at low fares, which he utilized himself. “I was on my own and could go anywhere at a moment’s notice,” he reminisces. He flew to Europe several times a year and went to live there after graduating in 1972.That December, he joined the wallet business – a company my grandfather had purchased – doing sales. He had an apartment in Manhattan on East 89th Street, but mostly, he was at the wallet factory in Oklahoma, or traveling, both for work and play. On the weekends, he’d rush to Houston, Dallas, Wichita Falls, Mexico City or Acapulco, then back to work on Monday.“Steven got on a plane like most people get on a bus,” says my mom, Nancy Rothstein, who was married to my father for 36 years.Transitioning to finance, Dad moved to Chicago in 1976 for a stint at Smith Barney and, according to him, became the second-highest-grossing stockbroker at Bear Stearns in 1979, where he worked for a decade. Later, he focused on investment banking, and also became the largest shareholder of the financial corporation Olympic Cascade, the holding company of a brokerage firm, National Securities. Through it all, he continued flying. Everywhere. Airports and airplanes – they were who Dad was.When American started the AAdvantage program, Dad and Uncle Shelly (Mom’s uncle and one of Dad’s best friends and business associates) began flying even more than they already did. Then, after a good year at Bear, the investment in an unlimited pass made sense.In September 1987, five months after my brother, Josh, was born, and three months after we moved from downtown Chicago into the north suburbs, Dad bought his unlimited lifetime AAirpass. The cost was $250,000, which the agreement stated was based on his age. My father was 37 years and four days old when he dated the check.Two years later, which was one year before my younger sister, Natalie, was born, he added a companion feature to his AAirpass, allowing him to bring another person along on any flight. The cost was $150,000, based on his being 39 years old. This changed the game, not only for him, but our entire family.Ernie Thurmond, a former American employee who handled Dad’s AAirpass contracts, helped with adding some special stipulations. My parents decided early on to take separate planes so that in the unlikely event of a crash, at least one of them would be alive for their three children. So the agreement amendment stated: “If spouse is the companion, the spouse will be allowed to travel separately from Holder, provided that the spouse travels on the flight immediately prior to or just after the flight taken by Holder.” My parents wouldn’t fly on the same plane for at least a decade after that.Major US and global hubs became Dad’s office American became his home. He knew every employee on his journey – from the curb, through security, to the gate, and on to the plane.In the early 1990s, Dad found his go-to agent at the American Airlines Platinum desk: Lorraine Cross from Raleigh, North Carolina. None of us has ever met her in person. But Lorraine was family, her southern lilt a speakerphone staple at the dinner table. While my father befriended dozens and dozens of American employees throughout his tenure as one of their top fliers, no one played a role quite like Lorraine.Lorraine and Dad became fast pals. Over the next decade-plus, he’d send Lorraine – and others at Platinum – postcards from Maine when he took us to sleepaway camp, menus from restaurants around the world, and magazines from foreign airport lounges. Lorraine loved receiving these she’s even kept the postcards after all these years.She says they shared inside jokes — a lot. “Every time I talked to your father, as we would close the conversation – I’m southern – I would always say, ‘Bye now.’ … That was my closing. He would say, ‘Pay later.’ Caroline, we used to laugh all the time.”Lorraine and the other Platinum desk employees weren’t his only pals. Recently, Dad described himself as being “like an adopted child”. American – and its employees – were his parents. He knew the skycaps at O’Hare, LaGuardia, JFK, Heathrow, LAX the people at the front desk at the Admirals Club pre-departure lounges flight attendants on hauls he frequently flew the gate attendants and the folks who drove the carts from security to the gate, like Aamil.Aamil – whose name I’ve changed to respect his privacy – was a refugee who fled the Bosnian genocide with his family. Dad met Aamil when he was in high school, driving a cart at O’Hare, and took him under his wing – errands and various paid-for-hire tasks. Ultimately, Aamil started coming over for dinner picked us up at school became Josh’s “big brother” ears for his dating rendezvous as he entered high school and was both an employee and a dear, dear friend.Dad “was gracious and kind in a way you don’t see in a lot of people”, Lorraine says, recollecting the time he helped fly some priests to Italy to see the Vatican, or when Mom called her from the local Gap to use miles to help a sales clerk visit her mother.Dad gifted the miles and upgrades he accumulated throughout his life – both before and during his AAirpass tenure – to dozens and dozens of people. Once he upgraded my cantor and his wife to first class from Amsterdam. He regularly let relatives and people in crisis come along in his extra seat. There was the time he took my brother’s best friend on his first airplane ever to see a football game the American Airlines employee he saw in India, crying because she might lose her job if she didn’t make it to Toronto his brother and sister-in-law for their honeymoon a guy from college and his wife who really wanted to go to Australia a man in the back office at National Securities, who wanted to visit his dying father (he got there just in time). “Your family’s heart is as big as the state of Texas,” Lorraine says. “It’s incredible how many lives they touched and how many lives touched them because they’re very sensitive and attuned to what goes on in the world.”I’m not saying Dad was a saint. Just that his AAirpass was about more than solipsistic travel. It allowed him to build relationships. And it allowed other people to access the world like he did. That’s what Dad’s AAirpass and ultra-elite flying status yielded for him: lifelong bonds.On 13 January 1998, the American Airlines CEO, Robert Crandall, wrote my father a letter after they’d seen each other on the Concorde (a transatlantic supersonic aircraft).At the end, Crandall wrote: I am delighted that you’ve enjoyed your AAirpass investment – you can count on us to keep the Company solid, and to honor the deal, far into the future.My friend Phil likes to say my father ran his life like a corporation and raised me in it. His underwear was pressed. UPS and FedEx came nightly to our driveway to drop things off, pick things up. He had packing down to a science – sets of clothes folded and fitted into plastic cases, cosmetics ready to go. We had a whole suitcase closet in the basement, and at some point, he turned the downstairs guest room into a staging area for packing.“They sort of broke the mold when they made him,” says Mom, who is a sleep consultant.He stored everything he collected while traveling in the basement – hotel soaps, shampoos, conditioners his thickened old passports towels shirts hairdryers and combs from around the world – in what we called his “Secret Room”, the key hidden in his office desk. A fun party trick was bringing people inside – his business associates, my siblings and my friends. Sometimes we used the items ourselves. Often, we gave things away. After Hurricane Katrina, Dad and I flew down to New Orleans with boxes of clothes and toiletries. When he went to India, he brought things along. Like travel, for Dad, the Secret Room was an extension of souvenir collecting as a kid.As a kid myself, I often complained about Dad’s excessive traveling. I used words like “abandonment” and “neglect”. In retrospect, that was wildly dramatic. But it’s how I felt.“No matter where Steven went, there wasn’t a day we didn’t talk,” Mom says. “Some men are home every night at 5.30 from the office, but they’re not really there. Steven Rothstein was there.” She emphasizes there with a deep, grinding grunt. “Whether he was in the house or out of the house, he was very involved. He was very much there. And always in touch. I mean, he used a phone … he was one of the first people with a cellphone.”She’s right. Most of my life, I focused on how Dad was always on a plane. When I think about it now, when he was home, he was there: sitting with me on my bedroom floor, or at the dinner table, or coming in to kiss me goodnight. He has a presence. Not only a loud voice, but also a boom of self. He arrives. He is both taking off and landing at once.“He never missed an opportunity to come home to the family,” Lorraine says. “I don’t care where he was going. I don’t care what he was doing. If there was a chance he could come home and stay with his family overnight, he preferred that to any hotel in the world.“I really valued and appreciated that from him,” she says. “His family meant the most. I would say, ‘That’s a long way to go, are you gonna overnight and come back the next day?’ He’d go, ‘No, I wanna sleep in my own bed. I wanna go home. I wanna be with my family.’”I laugh, tears in my eyes. I didn’t know this.“That was crucial to him, to be with his family,” Lorraine says. “He did some crazy stuff to make that happen over the years.”Dad was an airport celebrity, and when we traveled together, it embarrassed the shit out of me. Like riding a cart from security to the gate (because as a family, we ran late – Dad has a knack for rushed arrivals). I would bow my head so I couldn’t make eye contact with anyone we passed. Or walking into the Admirals Club locations and having the folks at the front desk know us by name.Or when, in second grade, he took me to Japan for the weekend because he wanted me to experience an inaugural flight (San Jose to Tokyo). We were in the bulkhead, the first row of any flight cabin. As we landed, there were reporters flooding the jet bridge to photograph the first person off the flight. Technically, based on his seat, that was Dad. But as he figured out what was happening, he insisted I go first so I could be the star. I stood there with my seven-year-old smile, bright-colored headband, and long V-neck Limited Too sweater hanging down to my thighs.I was mortified. But Dad wanted us to experience absolutely everything there was in life.He wanted to take me to all 50 states by the time I was 11. We put a big US map on the wall behind his home office desk. After each trip, I’d add a pin to the visited state another for the places I wanted to go. When we’d gone to 30-something states, I asked to stop I wanted to be able to have new adventures as an adult.“You grew up with a different lens than most people you knew,” Mom says. “I’m not saying … that other people didn’t travel all over the world. But I sort of doubt, for the most part, they had the kind of wanderlust and open-mindedness and fascination that your father had with the world, and still does, for that matter.“Yes,” I answer.“Not only framed you,” she adds, “but it helped with your, your tapestry. It was woven into your tapestry. Into the fabric of who you are, and how you look at other people and the world.”I understood the weight and privilege as a kid. I understood – we all did – that the AAirpass meant my father could travel and do business in unprecedented ways, and it allowed our entire family to travel in ways few people on earth could. We got the privileges, all of them, all of us.I ask my sister, Natalie, a psychotherapist living in Chicago, her earliest memories of traveling on an airplane: landing in Australia at age three, walking down the aisle as the plane was still moving, and someone grabbing her to keep her safe. “I think I remember that because it was really dramatic,” she says. “I have a lot of vivid memories from that trip, actually.”“Were you aware that we were in first class?” I ask.“I didn’t sit out of first class until I was 12 years old,” she says. “I don’t know if I was aware when I was three years old. But I was aware very early.”Wont to interrogate privilege – race, class and otherwise – I pry. Did she really get that first class was different than the rest of the plane?“For a long time, I really wanted to sit in coach,” she says, “because I felt uncomfortable being a kid in first class when it was clearly where all fancy adults were sitting. It was clear I was surrounded by mostly people who had a lot of money, and I was always one of the only kids in first class, and that felt weird and I always wanted to be with other kids in coach.”That trip to Australia (I was in fifth grade) was our first big international family vacation. The following year, Dad, on a whim, said to Mom: let’s go to Tokyo.“Japan!” she said. “Over Christmas? Are you kidding?”But we went.Mom can still perfectly picture us all at dusk in Tokyo: “Dad has on his camel coat. You and Josh are in all the black-and-white-check stuff. We’re walking through an aisle of stalls … going to yet another monastery or shrine and the flavors that we felt and saw and tasted … it was probably one of the best Christmas vacations we’d ever had because we were the only people in the hotel.” She starts chuckling. “And it was so much fun. It was so unusual to be Americans at Christmas in Tokyo.“It was about seeing the world … We wanted to connect to the people,” she says. As she recounts these stories, her tone is somewhere between euphoric and frenzied. She punctuates each story with an “oh my God” and transitions immediately into the next.“When we were in India … we got so friendly with our cab driver that we brought him for dinner to the hotel … For a while we were in touch … We would send him pictures and things. That was the kind of richness that this AAirpass, this sense of a family traveling anywhere we wanted to go in the world that American could take us – that’s what we did. People enriched us. Hopefully we enriched others.”She starts laughing as she recalls a time we visited the Holy Sepulchre in Israel and Dad got in trouble for lying down with his yoga strap, trying to stretch his back in front of the church. “I mean, there was so much color in what we did and where we went and how we did it. The travel was first class, the hotels were first class, but the experiences were very real and authentic.” And then without skipping a beat, she goes up an octave with: “Oh my God … so Josh was dead when we first went to India, right?”“Josh was dead both times we went to India,” I say.“Yeah,” she says. “But he was very much with us, I’m sure.”On 6 October 2002, Josh – 15 and a half – was hit by a car while walking down the sidewalk. The car had pulled an illegal U-turn. To avoid a collision, another driver accidentally accelerated, swerved up on to the sidewalk and flung Josh into the side of a building. His head hit the building. He was knocked unconscious. My uncle Jeffrey called me from Scarsdale and told me to get on a plane. It was my first month of college I rushed to the Philadelphia airport and bought a ticket home. I landed at O’Hare, descended to baggage claim, into more uncles’ arms. Their faces distraught: It doesn’t look good. It would be at least another 15 years before I could descend the American Airlines baggage claim escalator without going into a trauma shock.Josh died the next morning – our rabbi and the hospital chaplain reciting the end of life Hebrew blessings and prayers Dad, Natalie, our maternal grandmother, and me standing around the bed Mom’s own body draped alongside her dying son Natalie’s hand on his heart for his last beat.Over a thousand people attended his funeral. Lorraine helped get people on flights. I remember a family friend walking through the front door of our home after a flight from Australia, as if she’d taken a bus.To say Josh’s death broke Dad would be an understatement. Ernie from American says it was sad to watch Dad when they occasionally saw each other over the years. “He’s not the same person any more,” Ernie says.Josh was Dad’s little buddy. His only son. He’d already lost his father in 1989, and he would soon lose the companionship of Uncle Shelly, when Shelly had a stroke.“People react to tragedy in different ways,” Lorraine says. “He let Josh’s death take the best of him away … Outwardly, his strength was renowned. But I knew how much it impacted him … I know his children meant more to him than any business deal, than any situation in life that could come up.”Right after Josh died, Dad leaned on people like Lorraine, and other agents and employees, which I hadn’t known until writing this piece. I had asked Dad what the media tends to overlook when they cover this story.“When everyone was asleep in the house,” he tells me, “and I had nobody to talk to, and I was lonely about Josh’s death, I would telephone American Airlines reservations and speak to the agents about who knows what for an hour and then at the end, they’d ask me, oh, what reservation was I calling about to make, and I would say, ‘Oh yeah, I need to go to San Francisco next week.’ I really didn’t need to go to San Francisco. I was just very confused and very lonely and I was calling American Airlines because they were logical people for me to speak to. They knew me. I knew them. I knew their names. I knew their lives.”I tell Dad this makes sense, to lean on the community you know in a time of need.“I traveled all over the world,” he says. “Going from the front of American Airlines to the gate, I might see a dozen people, each of whom would say hello to me, and I would say hello to all of them.” Dad says that about 10 American Airlines employees came to Josh’s funeral. “That’s an extremely unusual relationship for a passenger to have with the airlines.”I talk to Natalie, who was still at home with a front row seat to his grief while I was away at college. She tells me about the shame Dad felt when people in our community often pitied him after Josh died – and still do – as if he were a broken man. But the airport and American were where he was still treated like a full, whole man.“His community at American treated him like a normal human, and walking through the airport, they didn’t treat him like he was broken, the way a lot of his other worlds did,” she says. “It was the only sense of normalcy that he still had.”Six years and two months later, Dad arrived at O’Hare with Aamil, who needed to go to Sarajevo but didn’t have the cash, so Dad offered to fly him to London on his AAirpass and then pay for his London hotel and airfare from there to Sarajevo.“ I went into the ticket counter. I checked in my luggage for London. I walked to the gate … and just as I was walking on the plane, they handed me a letter terminating the AAirpass,” Dad recounts. “Why did they let me go to the gate? Why didn’t they tell me up front, which would have been the nice thing to do?”Turns out a letter had been drafted to notify Dad that they were concerned with his behavior and use of the pass. But they decided not to send it. They didn’t want the bad press – what it might mean to terminate a lifetime AAirpass from a frequent flyer. So they terminated it without warning, at the airport – a punch right into Dad’s proverbial heart.Even Lorraine hadn’t been notified. “I walked in one day from work,” she said in a deposition, “and received notification that the AAirpass had been terminated. I was probably more shocked than anyone else.” No warning. No input sought, even though she had been regularly managing his and other top fliers’ bookings.Dad’s luggage went to London. They wouldn’t help him get it back. Aamil never made it to Sarajevo. In fact, that was one of the last times they ever spoke. Ultimately, Aamil disappeared from our lives.Dad doesn’t think Aamil understood the “shock and horror” of what had happened. Dad went home. Told Mom. Got in bed. And slept for the rest of the weekend, and arguably – at least figuratively – for a really long time after that. “I was in disbelief,” he recalls. “I was in shock. And I had no idea how I was going to live my life the way I lived it.”The AAirpass was Dad’s lifeline. His blood. Mom described his relationship with it as “sacrosanct”. There was a contract. Rules. It was his superpower. He didn’t ever want to do anything wrong.But American claimed he did.Dad was one of a few lifetime, unlimited AAirpass holders that American had been monitoring and claimed had breached their contracts. They claimed Dad made “speculative bookings” and a host of other things that they interpreted as objectionable based on a clause in the contract about “fraudulent usage”.“When I bought the AAirpass, in no uncertain terms, they told me that there was only one rule: I couldn’t give anybody the AAirpass,” Dad says. “And those were the days before they took identification from passengers.” A former colleague had once offered him five grand a week to use the AAirpass. Dad told the guy he was “crazy”.But now, after years of secret investigation, apparently Dad and others were costing American too much money. Though Dad had dealt with the reservations agents on an almost daily basis, it was the revenues department that got involved, interjected, and launched an investigation that brought the whole house down.On 10 March 2009, Dad sued American for breaking their deal, claiming $7m in damages. The dollar amount was based on the value of the lifetime unlimited AAirpass the last time it was sold for public consumption – though American had stopped selling them in 1994, a 2004 Neiman Marcus catalogue offered them for 3 million bucks. So it was the Neiman’s figure plus estimated costs for first-class travel for the rest of his life.A primary issue in the case was whether American properly terminated his AAirpass Agreement based on Section 12, which read:12. FRAUDULENT USAGE. If American determines that an AAirpass has been fraudulently used, American reserves the right to revoke the AAirpass and all privileges associated with it. Holder will thereupon forfeit all rights to the AAirpass, without refund, and will return the AAirpass card and this Agreement shall terminate.They claimed that his “fraudulent usage” included booking empty seats for his companion feature under “Bag Rothstein” or “Steven Rothstein Jr” (which they had for years condoned, and Mom says was not Dad’s idea), as well as “booking speculative reservations” – ie, flight reservations he was allegedly never planning to actually take.Dad believes there was someone at American who decided, “Oh, if these guys didn’t have these goddamn AAirpasses, it would be great.”According to Lorraine and the legal documents, a longtime American employee launched the investigation, looking into several other AAirpass holders, including Dad and Jacques Vroom, another lifetime unlimited customer, whose AAirpass termination also resulted in a lawsuit.(I reached out to American Airlines for comment on this article. Their media relations representative said: “We are pleased to continue to provide AirPass benefits to eligible cardholders when enjoyed in conjunction with the appropriate program conditions.” They said they did not have anything to add beyond what’s already in the court documents.)Truth is, AAirpass was – even in its earliest, earliest days – a failed program. It didn’t yield the revenue they’d hoped. In 2017, one writer listed the lifetime unlimited AAirpass as number one on the “7 Worst Marketing Disasters in human history”. In fact, when AAirpass started, according to Ernie, American thought they’d make “hundreds of millions of dollars” selling them, but they did not. “It became painful,” Ernie says. He says he tried several times to get them to shut it down they didn’t want to admit defeat.As for the case, American anticipated a resolution without a trial Dad anticipated a trial by jury. Instead, everything happened in legal offices, calls, motions and documents, judges’ chambers and depositions. They spent the summer of 2009 debating – back and forth – over the fraud clause, and whether it was ambiguous or clear.Then, American counterclaimed, saying Dad broke the contract by improperly using the companion feature. In early 2010, they claimed, “Rothstein had a history of making speculative, fictitious, impossible andor illogical reservations on behalf of companions.” They claimed these “companions” were people with whom he “had no intention of traveling”.The senior analyst who launched the investigation reviewed and analyzed Dad’s flight records, and claimed “that between December 2003 and April 2004, Steven Rothstein made companion reservations using ‘Steven Rothstein, Jr.’ using for his AAirpass companion feature for at least 41 flight segments”. But again, they had condoned his booking companion seats under fictitious names for years. In April 2004, an American employee had approached Dad and asked him to stop, as security measures around flying had clearly started to shift after September 11. So he stopped.But they continued investigating him, looking for a way to push him out.Another document shows that American contends that 14 incidents from August 2006 to November 2008 were considered “fraudulent” under their alleged terms – but Dad was never notified that they were considered fraudulent at the time they were made.In her deposition, Lorraine said she hadn’t received any written directions from American Airlines regarding what was and was not “acceptable practice for making reservations for the Executive Platinum customers”.Lorraine said, both in her deposition and our interview, that she didn’t suspect misuse of his AAirpass they were the ones handling all of his bookings. Yet, they – Lorraine, and anyone else in reservations – weren’t contacted at all once revenues began the investigations.Mom chuckles when she recalls sitting in the federal judge’s chambers with the attorneys in 2010 as American noted his making “fraudulent reservations”.“Steven never made a single reservation on his own on a computer,” she says. “Every single reservation he ever made was made with an American Airlines paid employee.” Dad didn’t use a computer. He was the first person I knew to have a cellphone, and then the first person I knew to get a BlackBerry (and remains one of the last to have one). To write letters, he’d use an electric typewriter or audio-record memos on his Dictaphone and mail mini cassette tapes to his secretary to type and then fax or mail accordingly. But a computer – never. Still doesn’t.Ernie says Dad found creative ways to use his AAirpass, even though Ernie knows of other cardholders who absolutely violated the terms of use – letting others use it, getting paid. “He would be at the airport waiting to board an airplane by himself,” Ernie says, “and he would meet somebody at, like, the Admirals Club and get into a conversation with them and they’re on the same flight he is and he said, ‘Well, why don’t we continue this conversation on the airplane? Let me go check and see if they’ve got any open seats in first class,’ and he would invite that person to join him.“It was not prohibited by the language of the contract,” Ernie says. “But it was not intended to be used like that … I don’t think Steve did anything that was directly or intentionally trying to do something that was … against the rules. Certainly it took some interpretation on American’s part to go after him.”Seven third-party witnesses connected to Dad – family members, friends and business associates – were interviewed during discovery. They were questioned by American around the “speculative bookings” that were deemed retroactively fraudulent.Sometimes Dad would spontaneously book a flight for him and a companion – say, taking my aunt to visit my cousin in Denver – planning to twist his loved one’s arm to travel at the drop of a hat. But that’s the challenge. Rarely could anyone else do that, even if they gave their word. Only Dad knew how to drop everything and fly. That was his superpower. He had wings. The family member, or colleague, or friend he hoped to take along couldn’t always go.Dad’s lawyer asked one of my uncles: “Do you have any reason to believe that Steven Rothstein made reservations in your name without actually intending to bring you along as his companion?”“Never,” he said.Maybe it seems normal to me because that’s how I was socialized, in the vortex realm of a father who treated an airplane like a bus. As a journalist, now, I can read the court documents and understand where – from American’s standpoint – this behavior was kind of absurd. Yet American Airlines agents condoned it for decades. And understanding that the legal terms of the contract and agreement stipulated that fraud meant giving someone else your pass to use, Dad’s quirky and hectic and allegedly “speculative” behavior seems reasonable within how he worked.There was discovery and depositions throughout 2010 there were seemingly endless motions and American kept extending discovery then a summary judgment in American’s favor on 30 June 2011. They had won.American dismissed “with prejudice” their remaining counterclaims then the case went into a holding pattern after American’s parent company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy that fall a joint stipulation of dismissal was filed on 21 September 2012, the day before Dad turned 62.But that wasn’t the end end. As mentioned, the judge issued a summary judgment. Then, the court of appeals affirmed. Dad had lost. The appeal stayed until American exited bankruptcy in December 2013. And the final chunks of paperwork were filed in 2014. But it never really quieted.I didn’t know the full details of the trial until I wrote this piece. That my mother, two uncles and an aunt all went in for depositions, or that hundreds of legal hours and thousands of dollars and documents unfolded. I didn’t quite get the magnitude until taking off my daughter hat and trading it in for my journalistic reporter lens.This spring, after gaining access to the court documents, and reading over 80 documents in full, I call Dad as I leave my writing space at 11.30pm and walk to the subway station at Union Square in Manhattan. I say this is clear: what American did to interpret fraud was out of line. But I say: “Dad, some of the bookings they cited for what they called speculative as evidence in the case were … well … shady.”I tell him I need to maintain my journalistic balance and integrity. I ask him point blank: “What’s the deal?”He goes on: “After they told me not to buy an empty seat they knew that I was in a huge depression in the actual MEDICAL SENSE. IT WAS A SERIOUS DEPRESSION. I was incoherent, crying several times daily, drinking liquor which I never did before and if I got in a seat I didn’t want to explain why I was crying to anyone.” So he wanted it empty. He wanted to be alone, just as had always been his booking practice on many airlines, even well before the AAirpass days. He liked his space. He liked access to bringing extra carry-on bags. He liked some privacy. The airplane was his home. It’s where he lived. It’s where he got to do work, or catch up on sleep, or regenerate. Then, once Josh died, it’s where he grieved. He was at home.People buy extra and empty seats all the time. Technically, that’s what he’d done with the companion feature. A permanent extra seat for life – whether another human was in it or not.In one sense, I understand how these could be interpreted as “speculative bookings”. Dad does admit he booked seats he wasn’t sure that he, or his companions, would ultimately use. But that’s not an uncommon practice, and he never understood it to be against the rules. His understanding was that fraudulent behavior was limited to giving the AAirpass to someone else – which he never did.“I never booked my own reservation on a computer,” he reminds me. “I never knew how to do this. So every single one of the reservations they didn’t like was booked andor changed by an American employee. Again. I didn’t know how to use a computer. I still have never ever ever booked any reservation online. I always use the phone. So their own agents never stopped me from anything. And I didn’t understand what American was asking me to do or not to do because my mind was torn apart from depression. Real depression.”The 7 April 2018, article in the Hustle by Zachary Crockett quoted my father saying: “I wish I’d never bought the thing.”Earlier this year, I speak to Dad, in India, where he’s traveling for work. He FaceTimes me from his hotel room (from an iPad, still no computer). He sits on a couch, a desk and bright lights trailing in the background.I ask if he’s accepted the loss – the AAirpass.“Probably, yeah,” he says. “Enough’s enough. I can’t worry about it all day long.”Twenty-six minutes and thirty seconds later, after he’s relived 13 December 2008, so I could recount it above, something shifts.“Why did they have to be mean?” he says. And later, he interrupts himself mid-story: “What American did was nasty.”It’s like there isn’t space for anything else in his mouth or head.“It took away my mobility. It took away my hobby. I thought that I could go to Sweden for the weekend in July and pick up flowers when I was 70.”“And now?” I ask.“I can’t do that, can I?”“But how do you feel about it all now?”“I’m angry,” he says. “Still. I’m less angry. But I’m still angry.“They stole my personality,” he continues. “They stole my love. They stole the very thing that caused me to give them a half a million dollars in the first place. And a half a million dollars is probably like 5 million dollars today. And they did it maliciously. If there had been a problem, the proper thing to do would have been to telephone me and tell me they’d like me to change the way I used the AAirpass.”I remind him that when we started talking, now 59 minutes ago, he said he had accepted it all.“I guess as I think about,” he says, “I’m angry. So maybe someplace in between. Or maybe my mind goes back and forth.”Grief and death don’t discriminate. Loss – human life, financial wealth, material goods – doesn’t discriminate either. It’s gut-wrenching no matter what. Of course, racial and class privilege, body ability, access to healthcare and support, and other privileges obviously play a massive role. But the inside spectacle of pain is traumatic across the board.“Your dad was so depressed as it was,” Mom says. “He was totally unglued after Josh died, and then he loses the one thing that gives him some freedom to run away from his grief.”The AAirpass “also wasn’t just a loss for him”, I say to Mom. “It was a loss for our family because it gave us access to experiences that were part of who we had become as a unit, and we’d already lost Josh, and so to have lost the AAirpass meant we could no longer travel.”“… Like we did,” she adds. “Because economically after Josh died, it was also a problem. Dad wasn’t able to work at the same pace, speed and everything else that he had. So it was a huge loss, and it was shitty timing because it gave our family an opportunity to still travel, to find the joy in travel. … It took away a big part of our lives, and we already had a big part of our lives taken away. … So, it was a family trauma.”We’ve done a remarkable job – at least in my opinion – of finding some way back to being a family unit after Josh died and my parents got orced (which, having separated in the years after Josh died, was formalized in 2014), and Natalie and I have built an unbreakable bond to manage the vacancy lingering between our age gap.I ask Natalie if she has any resentment or anger about the AAirpass.Dad still hasn’t gotten used to it. The AAirpass was “his pass to freedom”, Mom says. “The trauma of taking that away, it grounded him, literally.”“He seems to be, I don’t know, is he running from things?” Ernie adds. “I didn’t think of him as a settled person.” Ernie notes the places my dad has lived – or tried to live – since my parents sold the house and got orced. Berlin. Hong Kong. India. New York. Chicago. Australia. France.“It’s like if he stops moving,” Ernie says, “then he’s not him any more.”We inherit things from our kin. As much as I salivate over locking myself in a silent cave to write, I feel a wildly profound sense of purpose when I’m traveling. As an internationally touring poet, performer and educator, when I am on tour, I am alive. I know how to operate an airport or bus terminal or Amtrak station or rental car. Natalie does too. People have come to me about their hatred or fear of flying. It’s like a spa, I tell them. A certain amount of time in the sky that belongs only to you. Regardless of your seat.Of course, I recognize that because I was socialized to fly in first class, my feelings about travel are biased. Even though I fly economy now, even though my eyes can tell the difference, somehow my body does not. I am in the air. I am free above the world. I don’t need fancy seats or legroom. I’m just grateful to get a break from Earth.My best friend, Chloe, recently asked me what my favorite airline is, given all the travel I do. I said, even though they so deeply impacted my family’s life: American. I feel nostalgia. Loyalty. It’s like having a crush on that kid who chases you around the playground, or never letting go of your first true love.Mom still has skycaps’ numbers in her phone. She, Natalie and I all still fly American, even though it hurts (and I have exactly 384,475 American miles at the time of publishing this piece, so if that dwindles unexpectedly, we’ll all know why).When I talked to Lorraine, she told me she wanted to go to Fargo, North Dakota.I scream: “Lorraine! I’ve never been to North Dakota! Fargo is on my bucket list!” I’ve made it to 47 states by now Oregon and Alaska are still on the list, as well.“Oh my God, Caroline, I’ve got a feeling we may end up going to Fargo, North Dakota,” she says, “laughing our butts off and having a ball.”I am yelping at this point. Literally hitting my leg and chair audibly. Suddenly, I feel like Dad must have felt talking to her – laughing, joking, dreaming up trips. Some people inherit money. Or trauma. A host of other things. I’ve inherited plenty, but perhaps – more than anything – it’s the wanderlust and desire to meet people and go places around the world.After we scheme about Fargo, she sends her love to my mother and sister, and says she’d love Dad’s number she’d love to catch up. I thank her and wish her a beautiful day.“You as well, Caroline,” she says. “I still love ya, so you take care, sweetheart.”“Love you as well,” I say. “And what was it that you would say to my dad?”“And then ‘pay back’?”“He would say, ‘Pay later.’”I ask if we can try again.This story originally appeared on the digital storytelling platform Narratively.

Early on, she told me about a man she had met briefly, years earlier, to whom she felt a sexual attraction unlike anything she had experienced before. Nothing happened, so it stayed an unexplored fantasy.A year ago they met again by chance, and the chemistry was (she explained) instantly electric. We had a frank discussion about her desire for him, which resulted in her taking him to bed one afternoon for what she described as the best orgasm she had ever experienced. This was followed by weekly lunchtime sex (at my apartment in London).Soon afterwards, my partner and I decided to live together, and her lover began to visit our place once or twice a week. The challenge, for me, was to recognise that the chemistry she had with him was no threat to her love for me. I could not ask her to forgo such enjoyment (he is 20 years younger than me, 15 years younger than her, so there is a huge difference in the pleasure she gets from each of us). I recognised that the problem was mine, not hers.We interact comfortably and they feel unselfconscious about showing their mutual attraction in my presence. I enjoy seeing their foreplay or hearing them having noisy sex in the spare room – not as a matter of eroticism, simply two people having a good time.She would not want me to have the same, and so I remain happily monogamous.

However, when asked if the company was seeking such deals with other talent, Hastings said: “You could say that, but I couldn’t possibly comment.”Netflix is thought to be arranging an exclusive tie-up with Charlie Brooker, the writer behind Black Mirror and Bandersnatch, and to be in negotiations for a deal with Peter Morgan, the creator of The Crown.The company, which expects to spend about $15bn globally making and licensing TV shows and films this year, will increase its budget and productions still further to fight the challenge of the launch of a swathe of well-funded new rivals.In October, it will take over all of Shepperton Studios, home to films ranging from Alien to Mary Poppins, as part of a 10-year deal to guarantee the space it needs to pump out its ever-increasing number of productions without delay.Disney, which is due to launch its global streaming service, Disney+, recently struck a similar deal with Shepperton’s parent Pinewood Studios, home to the James Bond and Star Wars franchises.Competition is heating up in the streaming wars as new entrants attempt to break the global duopoly of Netflix and Amazon. Netflix and Amazon Prime Video have amassed 240 million subscribers worldwide, with almost 20 million in the UK.Apple TV+ will launch on 1 November, with star attractions including Jennifer Aniston in her first TV series since Friends, a comedy drama called The Morning Show with fellow A-listers Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell.Two weeks later, Disney+ will launch with content including the Star Wars films and original $100m TV series The Mandalorian, the Marvel universe, again including exclusive TV series spin-offs, Pixar films and family fare from Toy Story to Frozen, plus TV shows such as The Simpsons. WarnerMedia’s HBO Max, and NBCUniversal’s Peacock streaming service, will also launch next year.Hastings predicted that the new competition would further increase the cost of programmes and talent. The Crown is thought to be the most expensive UK drama at a reported cost of £100m, but Hastings said that to compete with the deep pockets of the new entrants “we will raise the bid to hold on to great content … some day The Crown will look like a bargain”.Hastings said that as the market opens up, Netflix – which has previously been notoriously secretive about its programme ratings – would be more open about how its shows are doing and how it operates.He said Netflix had to “grow up”, and tried to allay public service broadcasters’ fears about its power.When asked about comments made this week by the Channel 4 chief executive, Alex Mahon, about concerns in the UK TV industry about “a growing concentration of power in the hands of just a few tech behemoths”, Hastings said: “In terms of too much power that can be a risk in a society definitely, and we need to be aware of that.Kenton Allen, the chief executive of Big Talk Productions and a former producer of hits such as The Royle Family and Rev, welcomed Netflix’s £500m UK budget, saying: “Bring it on.”However, he added: “As a producer there are pros and cons. There’s an arms race on talent they are doing some direct deals with writers so that takes those writers out of the market, so that’s a negative – you lose someone like Charlie Brooker.“It’s a US showrunner model and UK writers are not on the whole showrunners, they need producers. Where does that put the British producer? Out of the picture frankly. But it’s a mixed ecology so we can still talk to them about other things and we will be finding new talent.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd32eb2b3b16569e035616d0ea89a510963c9809/0_284_5747_3448/master/5747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04a19e00ba1d62bf60344cdeab06b57f","title":"send us your questions for john humphrys","story":"The Today presenter has asked his final question.

But in January, Radio 1 added the single Started Out to its C-list. Then its B-list. Then its A-list. This should not be surprising: it is fantastic, a limber bass workout indebted to the house godfather Larry Heard, made more addictive by the sweet insistence of Georgia’s voice. But no Domino act had been playlisted at the station since Arctic Monkeys. And DIY hits (especially by female producers) are not exactly fixtures on daytime radio.It happened again a few months later with About Work the Dancefloor, a song as indebted to Tegan and Sara as the techno futurists Cybotron, indicating it was no fluke: Annie Mac, who championed Georgia at Radio 1, hails her “brilliant, brilliant songwriting and production in a world of identikit pop-dance records”. So she pushed the album back to January 2020 to let momentum build. “A lot of artists would probably find it quite frustrating, but I’m always writing new music, so I was like, yeah!” says the curly-haired 29-year-old, born Georgia Barnes. The album is worth the wait: playful and empathic pop that wears its club smarts as convincingly as Robyn does.We meet on a dangerously hot summer day, sheltering in the shade of her mum’s luscious garden in Kensal Rise, north-west London. She is a forensically knowledgeable music nut and swiftly intimate company, apologising for the kiwi tree that occasionally emits a sharp, pissy stink. She walks down the garden, pointing out neighbour Don Letts’ studio over the hedge, next to the bunker-like studio where she recorded both her albums. It was built by her dad, Neil, of Leftfield. After he left following her parents’ split a few years ago, she moved home.Even before Radio 1 came along, Barnes had decided to take her time following up her self-titled 2015 debut. “I shut the door and I listened to artists I really loved,” she says. As well as staples Depeche Mode, house and techno, she studied Kate Bush, Neil Young and Joni Mitchell. “I was like: ‘Why are these good songs? Let’s try and write songs like these.’ It took a year and a half to really get that down.”Barnes had already waited to start her solo career, so another 18 months was negligible. She went to the Brit school, first for theatre, then music, and chafed against the mainstream pop curriculum she was more interested in the music she was discovering from India and Africa. She felt lost after completing her studies. Then she had a revelation at Glastonbury 2007 after stumbling upon the five-hour live debut of Damon Albarn’s Africa Express. “Tinariwen, never heard of them before,” she recalls. “Damon, Amadou and Mariam, Toumani Diabaté, the Somalian rapper K’naan.” She stayed for the whole thing. “It changed my life.”She felt she lacked that kind of confidence, but started playing the occasional solo show. Domino caught on and signed her in late 2014. Suddenly she had a deal and was out on tour while coping with the breakdown of her parents’ marriage. “I felt like everything was spiralling a bit out of control,” says Barnes. She was drinking too much. “As a drummer, I was always known as a wildcard but that was part of my charm. I was always on time and reliable, then liked to be wild and party a lot.”Binge-drinking went hand-in-hand with binge-eating. “I had put on so much weight,” says Barnes. “I’m not saying that being overweight is worrying, but for somebody who had never been overweight, I was quite worried, my mum was quite worried.” After one particularly toxic bender, her friends staged an intervention. Barnes decided to “be sober for as long as I could do it for, just to change my view of alcohol”.She did not drink for two years – the whole time she was making Seeking Thrills – and rarely does now. But she still went clubbing, marvelling at the sights in Berghain, Berlin while sober. “That’s what worked so well for me,” she says. “That I was extreme about giving up alcohol, but not about giving up that whole side of my life.” She got healthy – going vegan, doing yoga and having early nights – and figured out what made her happy. She realised that being a session drummer was all about serving other people: “Making sure the artist was OK, not causing any trouble. Seven years of that made me not really care about myself. Then suddenly, putting out my own music, it was like: ‘Oh my God, hang on – how am I supposed to be in this?’ I had to really work on it.”There is a clear difference in clarity between Barnes’s albums. The debut cleaved closely to her Soas studies, the pan-global samples and tentative lyrics recalling a defanged MIA. She is bolder on Seeking Thrills, the music more distinctive and rallying. You could see Barnes had come into her own from her superb one-woman set at this year’s Glastonbury. When she wasn’t battering her striking Simmons electronic kit (she was inspired by vintage footage of Depeche Mode and Sly and Robbie playing them), she was jumping off the drum riser to literally bounce with glee, drumsticks crossed overhead.She says the Prodigy influenced her performance style. “I remember Keith Flint saying he didn’t wanna think about what he was having for tea while he was on stage, he wanted to work!” She laughs. “That’s what I want to do. I want people to come out going: ‘She’s doing it all herself? That’s mad!’ The audience get on your side if you’re showing them that much work.”Her ethos is panning out. Twelve years after Africa Express changed her life at Glastonbury, Barnes was invited to be part of its latest album, Egoli (“my proudest moment”). She is helping the Black Madonna produce her debut album, and working with the Flaming Lips’ Wayne Coyne, a close friend she met at a festival. Plus Seeking Thrills is not even out for four months. Quiet year, then. “Fuckin’ ’ell!” She laughs. “I know. It’s mad, innit.”The kiwi tree emits another sulphuric waft. “I’ve got a real connection to this record,” she says, reflectively. “I feel like it really means a lot because they were transformative years. I’ve enjoyed every single moment of it.”• Never Let You Go is out now on Domino. The album Seeking Thrills is released on 10 January."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5175afd464a02cdee0a41d50c9055c645a4cfb2d/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b8e9d61f67c744d0ee6490b14cd02e9","title":"harry styles one direction 1d x factor stevie nicks rolling stone","story":"The 1D star is returning with new 70s-inspired material – plus stories about magic mushrooms, Malibu and models Before Harry Styles released his first solo album in 2017, nobody had any idea what to expect. One moment he was on The X Factor singing Natalie Imbruglia’s Torn to Sinitta in canvas M\u0026ampS slippers and a mum scarf, and the next he was covered in tatts, appearing in high-fashion spreads looking like he had probably caught at least one STI (one of the cooler ones, like chlamydia). Would he sound like a former boyband member, or the mini Mick Jagger he had styled himself as? The resulting self-titled debut was both: rock-influenced, comfortably cool, appealing to his teen fanbase and newer adult fans alike.With album two on the horizon, could Styles’s next artistic persona be coming into view? A couple of years have passed since his debut and he has now fully solidified himself as someone who wears Gucci flares, hangs with Stevie Nicks and writes bisexual anthems. Still, that didn’t prepare anyone for the onslaught that was his recent Rolling Stone profile in which we learned that album two was born among a swirl of magic mushrooms, Malibu beach parties, Paul McCartney’s Ram, T-Rex’s Cosmic Dancer, Haruki Murakami novels, transcendental meditation, a break-up with Instagram model Camille Rowe and an old American game called Cornhole, where you fling some sacks into distant holes. Or, in his words: “It’s all about having sex and feeling sad.”From that strange combo, you would be forgiven for thinking this album is going to be Mother Earth’s Plantasia with some spoken-word poetry about shagging over the top. But if we have learned anything from what pop stars say their albums are influenced by, and what they actually end up sounding like, we know there is usually quite a substantial gap in between. Zayn Malik, for instance, was said to be heavily influenced by Frank Ocean. Taylor Swift has spoken about her love of Annie Lennox. Grimes is obsessed with OutKast and Tool. In fact, Styles was recently spotted with super pop producer Max Martin, so maybe the new record is actually wall-to-wall bangers. Or, was his recent move of turning down the role of Prince Eric in the live-action version of The Little Mermaid because he’s got a collection of OTT water-themed musical numbers tucked up his billowing sleeves?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6c71c0ed93baaabd6dd5c721a337425890aca95b/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aeb7ce9e94dc20ba082b3bc74272fb83","title":"revoke and remain inside lib dem conference podcast","story":"With a new leader in Jo Swinson and the defection of six MPs to the party, Lib Dems are hoping for a resurgence.

Sadly the Conservative response has been woeful, from denial through to now a reluctant commitment to a broad and watered-down investigation that we fear will do nothing to address this problem.”Khan said Islamophobia was “endemic” in the Conservative party. He added that Karim’s claim was “extremely serious and indicative of the scale of the problem” and the minister must be investigated immediately.A Conservative party spokesperson said: “All those found to be party members have been suspended immediately, pending investigation.“The Conservative party will never stand by when it comes to prejudice and discrimination of any kind. That’s why we are already establishing the terms of an investigation to make sure that such instances are isolated and robust processes are in place to stamp them out as and when they occur.”Party sources said not all the names provided were Tory members and the timings and details of any such investigation would be guided by the government’s review into a definition of Islamophobia.The government announced in May it had begun the process for establishing a working definition of Islamophobia, after confirming it would not be adopting the wording proposed by the all-party parliamentary group on British Muslims. The timeline for this work was unclear.During a Tory leadership election debate in June, Sajid Javid, the chancellor of the exchequer, committed to holding an independent investigation into allegations of Islamophobia and asked the other candidates whether they would also commit to it. They all appeared to agree, including Boris Johnson, who said: “Hear, hear.”However, Johnson later said he understood they had committed to a general investigation “into all types of prejudice and discrimination including antisemitism”, not Islamophobia specifically."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/867f44f188ea6d31e9240c24540f2e4d945b5373/0_62_2657_1594/master/2657.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=98302aa7026cca3d97f68e0b568b20ad","title":"some people never convince david cameron reflects brexit legacy","story":"After three years of silence, the former PM wants to reclaim the right to be heard on the issue that defines his premiershipTowards the end of our conversation about his new memoir, For the Record, David Cameron’s mobile rings. His daughter Nancy is on the line. She wants to know if he will be free to come and see her awarded a school prize. “I’ll be there, darling,” he assures her. “I’ve almost finished all these hideous interviews.”For the past week, and for the first time in more than three years, Cameron has barely been off the airwaves or out of the media. The hideous interviews have come thick and fast. Some of the headlines they have made have been calculated, like the settling of scores with Boris Johnson and Michael Gove over Brexit. Others have been inadvertent, like the revelation that Cameron lobbied for the Queen to “raise an eyebrow” about the Scottish independence campaign during the referendum in 2014.At his launch party on Tuesday, the former prime minister joked that there were two hardback bestsellers being published this month. “One’s a book about a riven society and a dangerous dictatorship,” he told guests. “And the other’s by Margaret Atwood.” His own book, it is clear from our interview, has a wider purpose. Three years after his premiership collapsed in the wake of the vote to leave the EU, Cameron is trying to regain the right to be heard, above all on Brexit and on the referendum that swept him from office.“I totally understand that there will be some people I will never convince, who will say you should never have had it,” Cameron says of the 2016 vote. He knows that millions of remain voters blame him viscerally for everything that has happened since then and probably always will. “But I think there are a lot of people who can also see that there was a growing inevitability about having a referendum and, yes, there was a problem in the Tory party, but the relationship with the EU was a far bigger one. Britain’s position was becoming more tenuous, and we had to fix it. I hope that I can convince people that it was an honest and thought through attempt to deal with the issue.”This is the nub of the case that weaves its way right through the 700 pages of Cameron’s memoir and through much of what he has said in interviews this week. The UK’s relationship with the EU was always both necessary and contingent, he argues. Until now, every prime minister for the last 40 years has simultaneously wanted a seat at the top table and a special deal for Britain. Every one of them, even Tony Blair, felt they had to fight off moves to political union. “These weren’t pretend ghouls and ghosts,” Cameron says. “They were real.” It’s a useful reminder that Cameron, so often dismissed as an insouciant optimist, is at heart a very practical politician.He is insistent that British ambivalence has origins that long predate the migration crisis or the rise of Nigel Farage. Cameron traces the roots back to Margaret Thatcher’s support for the EU single market in the 1980s. “The single market was both the best thing and the worst thing for Conservatives. We created it. But then we didn’t like the legislation that was needed to make it work.”“The EU is a law-based organisation that doesn’t like exceptions,” he continues. “The differing speeds issue had to be addressed, especially with the eurozone.” Cameron thinks the balancing act would have had to continue even if remain had won in 2016. He quotes the downbeat assessment of an anonymous official (surely the Bank of England deputy governor, Jon Cunliffe) telling him “it would have kept us in the EU for another 10 years”.“My biggest regret”, he says, is that he let expectations about his 2015-16 renegotiation get too high. “I should have made it clear that some of the things my colleagues were arguing for were not available – picking and choosing which laws to obey, radical cuts in the budget, some sort of country club membership. These things are not possible.” He thinks there was more substance to the renegotiation deal he brought back from Brussels in February 2016 than is now acknowledged. The concessions he achieved were “a big deal for the EU. They hated it.”Some of that defiant confidence drains away when Cameron talks about the referendum process itself. He thought “a lot” about writing a enhanced majority threshold into the referendum legislation, but it never happened. “I agonise about that one.” He thought the Electoral Commission “got it wrong” by insisting the choice on the ballot was between remain and leave, not yes (Cameron wanted a yes-to-Europe campaign) and no. He had always thought June 2016 would be the optimum date. Now he is not so sure. “We lost the vote so it’s worth asking the question.” He is scathing about Labour’s role in the campaign under Jeremy Corbyn. “They were awol.”Cameron’s own stance on Europe has not changed three years on. “I’m a remainer,” he says, without equivocation. And it is as a remainer, albeit a pragmatic one, that he has watched events unfold – and now unravel – since he walked away in July 2016.He says supportive things about Theresa May. “She was definitely a moderniser.” But his disagreement with her Brexit strategy is barely concealed. He approves of the fact that “she got a deal”. He “shares her frustration” that it was then voted down by “the people who most wanted Brexit”. But, crucially, he says that “picking one of the existing models, a Norway-style model, would have been a safer and more secure way to deliver Brexit while safeguarding the economy.”And he is critical of her failure to adapt her strategy after the 2017 election. “If you think about it like that, then the red lines, the election result and not reaching out more until too late to other support have had an impact. You need Labour support for a partnership Brexit. If you go back to the beginning, to 2016 and particularly after 2017, you might have been able to get more buy-in. The government went in a different direction, with the red lines and all the rest of it.”And, now, today, under the very different leadership of Boris Johnson? Cameron’s answer may surprise many, since he admits he is open to a second referendum if Johnson fails to make a deal. “I think it is more difficult now. Logically, where we are is either Boris gets his deal and brings it back and passes it, or there are three options: you can find another deal, you can have a general election, or you can have a second referendum. We’re running out of ways to get unstuck what is stuck.Cameron’s memoir ranges wide across many issues. He remakes the case for his Tory party modernisation project during the opposition years from 2005 and for the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition’s austerity programme after 2010. Though he admits that “some of the early speeches were a bit ‘Hello birds. Hello trees.’” he is convinced that his 11-year leadership has been hardwired into “a modern compassionate Conservative party”. The book also contains some very good anecdotes about everything from Brussels summits to visiting Balmoral. Many who read the pages on the death of his son Ivan in 2009 will be moved to tears.In the end, though, everything in Cameron’s story always comes back to Brexit. “It is very difficult to try to put Brexit to one side because it’s so massive,” he admits. But he sticks to his fundamental argument about his defining legacy. “It wasn’t some cranky view that there would have to be a referendum. The idea that this was just a Tory party drama, a Tory obsession, is not correct. Yes, it was a particularly big problem for the Conservative party and the pressure was growing and growing. But I was wrestling with a genuine problem. The trouble was I lost.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/deaea458a0c1c893aeed69adc1cc2e43d1d169fd/0_105_3453_2072/master/3453.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b690ec7daa0edca1a9c5dbecec3caf43","title":"climate scientists prepare largest ever arctic expedition","story":"Hundreds of researchers will spend year on ship improving understanding of sea iceResearchers from more than a dozen countries are preparing to launch the biggest and most complex expedition ever attempted in the central Arctic – a year-long journey through the ice they hope will improve the scientific models that underpin our understanding of climate change.In the €140m (£123m) Mosaic expedition, 600 scientists from 19 countries including Germany, the US, Britain, France, Russia and China will work together in one of the most inhospitable regions of the planet.“The Arctic is the epicentre of global climate change,” said Markus Rex of Germany’s Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research, who will lead the expedition. “At the same time the Arctic is the region of the planet where we understand the climate system least.”Packed full of scientific equipment, the German icebreaker RV Polarstern will leave the port of Tromsø in northern Norway accompanied by a Russian vessel to search for a suitably large ice floe on which to anchor and set up base.As the days get shorter and the sea freezes around it, the Polarstern will slowly drift off on its own towards the North Pole while rotating teams of 100 scientists spend two months each conducting research on the ice.Stefanie Arndt, a sea ice physicist who will join the mission in mid-February, said the unique advantage of this expedition compared with others was that researchers would be able to observe processes in the Arctic across an entire cycle of seasons.“What’s particularly interesting is the transition from winter to spring,” she said, a time when the ice is normally too thick for ships to reach the central Arctic.Recording changes in the density, size and type of snow will help scientists better understand the flows of energy in the Arctic. “For example, how much light the snow reflects back into the atmosphere, how much it absorbs and how much light reaches the upper ocean,” said Arndt. “This has big implications for the ecosystem.”Energy from light affects algae growth and ocean temperatures, which in turn influence how much sea ice melts from below.Understanding these and other complex processes occurring in the Arctic is essential for the increasingly sophisticated computer models scientists use to predict weather and climate. Experts believe that any disruption to the Arctic’s delicate cycle of freeze-and-thaw will be felt farther south, though it is still not clear how.Recent changes in the jet stream – a current of air that circles and insulates the Arctic like a giant thermos – have allowed warm, moist winds from low latitudes to move north. At the same time, chilly blasts of Arctic air – the dreaded polar vortices – have brought deep freeze conditions to the continental US and Europe.Concerns about global heating have spread far beyond the scientific community in recent years. The expedition starts on the same day as global climate protests and before a UN climate summit in New York next week.Rex, the expedition head, said the cooperation between scientists from many different countries stood in contrast to the geostrategic jostling that big powers have started engaging in as the Arctic, with its untapped riches, begins to open up to exploration.He put the fact that Germany, hitherto a second-league player in the Arctic, was leading the expedition down to the country’s technical and logistical expertise.“We’re doing it because we can, and nobody else can do it,” said Rex."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f86d634297e6085c75dd500d1e5743793a4c935/0_249_5321_3193/master/5321.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=218a4282bf00bed494e6f038157a4c28","title":"rugby world cup fans previews predictions japan","story":"South Africa are confident.

Although, if we beat Argentina, we could reach the semi-finals. Wales or Australia in the quarter-finals are both winnable games. The good thing is that for the first time in years, the French have had time to work as a unit, particularly on tactics. The enhanced management team also changed the defence, which worked well during warm-up games.It might be too early for some of the brand new players such as Romain Ntamack, Demba Bamba and Peato Mauvaka, but the exceptional gifts of some of the young guns like Antoine Dupont, Damian Penaud and Grégory Alldritt mixed with the rebirth of some old guns like Maxime Médard and Louis Picamoles could bring some good results. The problem is that the team isn’t rock-solid and it has some weaknesses better teams can exploit. Arnoud XavierSadly this year will almost certainly be a huge comedown for the Lelos after the highs of automatic qualification in 2015. After taking that step four years ago, the aim should be to, at least, finish third in the group again. However, Georgia were dealt a horrible hand in the draw, which could not have been worse.Georgia could have had the USA, Russia or Namibia as fourth seeds, which would almost certainly have guaranteed third place. Despite the poor build up, there would have perhaps been talk of “targeting” one of Australia or Wales for a last eight spot. Unfortunately, Georgia find themselves in a group with Fiji, who have a squad good enough to threaten Australia and third place seems far harder this time around than it was last time. Pool D is the only group with four teams in the top 12 of the World Rugby rankings.One should be positive, it isn’t a foregone conclusion. Georgia has as good a scrum as anybody and if the game against Fiji comes on a horrible rainy day, hopefully played on a recently ploughed field, parity could be secured. If it is an arm-wrestle, Georgia has a chance. And of course, that scrum could also turn over Wales and Australia’s. But the team has shown consistently over the last four seasons, against second-tier nations as well as the few opportunities they have against the big boys, that they struggle to finish opportunities off and without a huge change in that area there really is no chance of anything better than fourth. Adam HookerIt seems mad to be saying I’m nervous when my team is ranked as world No 1, but that’s the mad position I’m in as an Ireland fan. 2018 was a dream year. If the 2019 Six Nations felt lacklustre by comparison, then the thrashing by England was a real bodyblow for a fan’s confidence.Recent results against Wales steadied the ship and I hope we can recover the magic that saw us outclass the All Blacks. I’m flying out to Japan and praying we hit the ground running against Scotland. I’m an Ulster girl and want Rory Best to go out on a high. One of the friends I’m going with is Scottish and I’ll be pure sickened if they have bragging rights for the rest of our trip. Emma CassidyWe hope to win the first two games against Namibia and Canada, and then we’ll go in pilgrimage to the Vatican and pray for a miracle. Maybe we’ll defeat South Africa again like in 2017, or maybe we will face an already qualified and content All Blacks. But whatever happens I really hope that Sergio Parisse and Leo will have some glory in their last Rugby World Cup. Damiano MartignagoHistorically we have played 19 lost 19, so a victory would be sweet. Scoring a try against South Africa or New Zealand would be awesome. As the lowest ranked team in the finals and, probably, the fewest fans able to afford the trip, our fan strategy will be to get the Japanese to love us and support us. I know our team will play with strength and stubborn optimism. We love Namibia and the fact that we are on the world stage. We will be few, but we will sing our national anthem, Land of the Brave, with passion. Jeremy SilvesterAfter the heartbreak of 2007, the nervousness and joy of 2011, and the excitement of 2015, it’s hard to say if New Zealand will raise the trophy once more. Of course, Kiwis are dreaming of the legendary three wins in a row. However, we know that having an amazing team doesn’t make it a winning team. With 2007 in our memories, no New Zealander is going to assume we will always make it through the quarter-finals.Ardie Savea and Brodie Retellick are the two players I am looking forward to watching the most. I’m excited for Retallick’s return from injury and I hope Savea receives the international recognition his abilities deserve. We will be proud of our boys no matter what. Nikki CarterWe just want to give it a good lash. We probably won’t get out of the group, barring a miracle. KT O’ConnorAnything less than the quarter-finals would be a big disappointment anything more a big surprise. It’s hard to know what to expect from Scotland anymore, such is their inconsistency. They are capable of blistering brilliance one day (running in six tries in half an hour or so at Twickenham) and abject incompetence the next (the error-strewn performances at home to Ireland and away to France in this year’s Six Nations). I’m left with the impression that we’re going backwards under Gregor Townsend.Vern Cotter gave the side a more steely, competitive edge. Though, let’s face it, Scotland could hardly have been any less competitive in the years before he took over, whereas with Townsend it seems to be a case of boom or bust. That might be harsh on him and you could point to the home warm-up win over France as evidence of steeliness, but one minute I find myself thinking we could beat the Irish, top the group and give South Africa or New Zealand a serious run for their money in the last eight, and the next I’m contemplating the very real possibility of losing to Ireland and Japan and going home early. Much will depend on Finn Russell, possibly too much. I’m also hoping the Ireland players don’t complete a hat-trick of sneakymistimed hits on Stuart Hogg this year. James CalderI’m approaching the tournament with building expectation and hope. The Boks are many people’s pick for the title. Their squad depth is unrivalled and their preparation under Rassie Erasmus has been meticulous. I expect their first game, against New Zealand, to be part one of a double header that will culminate in the final. South Africa have the forward power to generate both quick ball and field position for them to unleash their burgeoning back line.Handre Pollard is in the form of his life and will be one of the dominant players of the World Cup. At blindside flank Pieter-Steph Du Toit is already a candidate for world player of the year and can play a similar role to that of Juan Smith in the 2007 World Cup victory. Cheslin Kolbe has the potential to announce himself as a true superstar and be one of the stars of the World Cup. Fans across the world will be won over by his stepping ability and his huge courage. South Africa’s main weakness will be Faf De Klerk and Willie Le Roux, two players who waver from world class to dreadful. If either of them has an off day, it could cost the Boks hugely. Sam KantorowichI don’t have much hope really, but just want one positive result in our four games to show the amazing development rugby is having in Uruguay. I’m looking forward to watching Juan Cat, Santiago Civetta and Manuel Leindekar. Juan LaffitteOur hopes are simply to win one or two matches. Of our opponents in the pool – England, France, Argentina and Tonga – I realistically think we can beat Tonga and then produce another highlight, like we did in 2007 against South Africa. We can expect to come up against a second or third XV against England and maybe Argentina, but France will want to give their first team a run so we’ll have a hard time of it there. Tonga is the game we are setting our sights on. The boys are up for the challenge and won’t lack spirit. Brendan CareyThis year could be our year. I’m not reading too much into the warm-up games. Warren Gatland knows what he is doing to ensure we are in the best possible frame of mind for the start of the tournament. Losing Gareth Anscombe was a huge blow and, if Rhys Patchell misses out we’ll be very thin at No 10, but Dan Biggar knows how to play on the biggest stage and his kicking game is second to none. With Alun Wyn Jones leading from the front, George North on the wing, and a resurgent Jonathan Davies in the side, I expect us to beat all of the northern hemisphere sides. That just leads to the big three and, on our day, we are finally ready to dispatch them.

And as the civil rights attorney who helped establish the Rooney Rule – which requires NFL teams to interview minority candidates for head coaching and senior football operations jobs – he understood the deeper significance of the moment for a league that long has excluded African Americans from its most important and celebrated on-field position.“Then you look at Lamar Jackson. His field awareness was so impressive. He can sense the pass rush and escape. He places the ball with nice touch. He’s showing the complete game.“We’re trying to overcome 100 years – literally 100 years! – of stereotyping of black quarterbacks. And they demolished all of them in that one game.”As the NFL celebrates its centennial season, the league is experiencing a changing of its quarterback guard. Peyton Manning and Andrew Luck are retired. Eli Manning has been benched. Ben Roethlisberger is out for the season, and faces an uncertain future.Health permitting, Tom Brady, Drew Brees, and Phillip Rivers continue to truck along – but each is far closer to the end of their careers than the beginning.All of those players are white. Meanwhile, the NFL’s most promising and accomplished young signal-callers are predominantly black: not just Jackson and Murray, but also Dallas’ Dak Prescott (26 years old), Houston’s Deshaun Watson (24), and Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes (24).And that’s not all. As Jason Reid of The Undefeated has noted, 2019 marks the first year in which the league’s reigning MVP (Mahomes), No 1 overall pick (Murray), highest-paid player (Seattle’s Russell Wilson), and a former MVP (Carolina’s Cam Newton) are all African American quarterbacks.The answer lies in a lengthy history of overt discrimination and subtle bias – and a determined, multi-generational effort by black athletes to overcome both.“How do you get from there to here?” Mehri says. “You build a wall of integration. Bit by bit. Brick by brick.”The NFL’s story began with a standout African American quarterback: Fritz Pollard, a chemistry major and All-American at Brown University, led the Akron Pros to the league’s inaugural championship in 1920.In 1933, however, the NFL secretly decided to ban black players – reportedly at the behest of former Washington owner George Preston Marshall, a committed segregationist who in a 1942 interview argued that if African Americans were allowed to play, “white players, especially those from the South, would go to extremes to physically disable them”.The ban mirrored the status of black Americans at the time: separate, unequal and living in a de facto apartheid state via Jim Crow in the South and a patchwork of exclusionary laws and customs everywhere else.The ban also was rooted in the widespread, racist beliefs about black inferiority that underpinned segregation. In the early part of the 20th century, said Jay Coakley, an emeritus professor at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs and sports sociologist, whites assumed that African-Americans lacked the physical stamina and emotional courage to excel at contact sports like boxing and football.After Jack Johnson became the first African American heavyweight champion in 1908 – and then defeated “great white hope” James J Jeffries in a 1910 bout that triggered white race riots across the country – that assumption morphed.“Whites accepted that blacks were physically evolved, but decided that they were intellectually un-evolved – that they were actually lower on the ladder of evolution than white people, and somehow closer to our animal ancestors. And that’s the ideology, the cultural context, that prevailed when the major sports in the US were desegregated.”Though the NFL lifted the ban in 1946, opportunities for African American quarterbacks were almost nonexistent. George Taliaferro became the league’s second ever black quarterback in 1950, and even made three Pro Bowls – but only as a rusher and receiver who never completed more than 16 passes in a season.The league’s third black quarterback, Willie Thrower, was given even less of a chance to make a mark. In 1953, the Chicago Bears inserted him for a single drive against the San Francisco 49ers – and after Thrower completed three of eight passes to put his team in the red zone, replaced him with white starter George Blanda.In sportswriter William C Rhoden’s book Third and a Mile: The Trials and Triumph of the Black Quarterback, Thrower’s son, Melvin, recalled that his parents owned a bar called “The Touchdown Lounge”, with a picture of his father on the wall.“On the bottom, it said: THE FIRST BLACK QUARTERBACK IN THE NFL, 1953,” Melvin said. “People told him to take it down. ‘You’re lying,’ they said. ‘You’re lying. That ain’t you. Take it down.’”As football and American society continued to desegregate in the 1960s and 70s, the sport was rife with what sociologists call “racial stacking” – a sorting process in which iniduals are funneled into certain positions based on stereotypes.From Pop Warner to the NFL, the down-the-middle positions of center, inside linebacker and quarterback were considered to be “thinking” spots. As such, they were seen as too cerebral for African American athletes, who additionally were thought to lack the leadership and grit to lead other players and perform under duress.Of course, this was balderdash. Sandy Stephens quarterbacked the University of Minnesota to a national championship in 1960, and many other black signal-callers at the game’s lower levels proved perfectly capable when called upon meanwhile, plenty of white quarterbacks tossed interceptions, made boneheaded mistakes and otherwise labored in utter mediocrity.Nevertheless, stacking had a pernicious, two-pronged effect: drastically reducing the pool of African American college quarterbacks who conceivably could be signed by a NFL team, and making it almost impossible for one of them to get a fair shake in the league.Ken Shropshire, who competed with and against African American quarterbacks in a predominantly black high school league in Los Angeles, experienced stacking for the first time while playing for Stanford University in the 1970s. Black teammates James Lofton and Tony Hill both had been prep signal-callers. Both were converted to wide receivers in college.“I learned that was a regular thing,” said Shropshire, the CEO of the Global Sport Institute at Arizona State University and author of the book In Black and White: Race and Sports in America. “Ironically, we had a contest in practice for who on the team could throw the ball the longest. James Lofton would win every year.”When Denver drafted Marlin Briscoe in 1968, the Broncos told Omaha University’s star quarterback that they wanted him to play defensive back. Briscoe had other ideas. Nicknamed “the Magician,” he insisted that he wouldn’t sign unless the Broncos allowed him to participate in a three-day quarterback tryout at the start of training camp.“They thought I was crazy,” said Briscoe, who grew up idolizing Baltimore Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas. “It was unheard of to see a black man play QB in the pros. But all I wanted to do was showcase my skills.”The tryout, Briscoe said, went as he expected. Seven other quarterbacks, all of them white, got to make 10 throws during drills. Briscoe always went last, and got “maybe seven or eight”.At the end of camp, Denver named Briscoe a starter – at cornerback. But after starting quarterback Steve Tensi was injured and backup Joe DiVito struggled during the Broncos’ home opener, coach Lou Saban put Briscoe in under center.Briscoe completed his first pass for 22 yards. He later drove Denver 80 yards, scored on a 12-yard run, and nearly led the Broncos to a comeback win. A week later, he became the first black starting quarterback in pro football’s modern era – and ultimately finished the season as the runner-up for AFL rookie of the year, compiling five starts, 1,589 passing yards, 308 rushing yards and 14 touchdown passes.The following summer, Briscoe went back to Omaha to take college courses. His phone rang. “Denver was having quarterback meetings,” he said. “Here I am, the starting QB at the end of the season, and I didn’t even get an invitation to the competition.”Briscoe flew to Denver. He discovered his services under center were no longer needed. “I never did get an explanation,” he said. “But I understood what was going on.” He ended up in Buffalo, where he played receiver and was named All-Pro before winning two Super Bowls catching passes for the Miami Dolphins.Briscoe never played quarterback in the NFL again. But he had broken an important barrier. “When I got to Denver, it was always thought that you’d have a fan backlash, a player backlash, that whites wouldn’t root or play for a black quarterback,” he said. “Well, that was a myth.“My offensive line, they were all from the south. Not only had they never played for a black QB, but prior to the pros, they had never played with black players. And the first thing out of their mouths was, ‘don’t let ‘em touch the Magician.’“For them to embrace me, for the fans to embrace me, that was validating. And I knew that I had to succeed. If I didn’t prove that I could do it, then how long would it take for another black quarterback to get a chance?”Other trailblazers followed. James “Shack” Harris – Briscoe’s roommate and mentee in Buffalo – became the first African American quarterback to start a NFL season opener, start and win a playoff game, play in the Pro Bowl and be selected Pro Bowl MVP.In 1978, Doug Williams became the first black quarterback to be selected in the NFL draft’s first round. Nine years later, he made history again by starting and winning the Super Bowl with Washington.Meanwhile, Warren Moon – who went undrafted after wining a Rose Bowl with the University of Washington – won five straight championships in Canada before signing with the Houston Oilers and embarking on a prolific 17-year NFL career that made him the first black quarterback inducted in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.Like Briscoe, the African American signal-callers who came after in the 1970s and 80s couldn’t be merely average. They had be exceptional. They were given less time to develop than their white peers, and less leeway to make mistakes. They also had to fight against a racialized conception of how a pro quarterback was supposed to play.Tall, statuesque pocket passers were the gold standard. Shorter, more mobile ones were seen as fragile and unreliable. Coming out of college football, white quarterbacks tended to fit in the former category, black quarterbacks the latter.According to former NFL player and sports historian Mike Oriard, it’s no coincidence that the 6ft 4in, 235lb Williams wasn’t considered much of a running threat – or that Williams’ college coach, Grambling State legend Eddie Robinson, told Harris not to run the 40-yard dash for league scouts, the better to avoid a positional switch.“The rise of black quarterbacks created the idea of the white quarterback,” said Oriard, an emeritus professor and dean at Oregon State University. “Before the stereotype emerged that black QBs were athletic, there were no distinctive characteristics associated with white quarterbacks.”By winning NFL games with their arms and their legs, Randall Cunningham and Michael Vick helped change attitudes toward black quarterbacks with fleet feet. (Perhaps unsurprisingly, white signal-callers who could run and scramble, like Fran Tarkenton and Steve Young, were seldom disparaged as merely “athletic.”)Concurrently, the evolution of the pro game turned a perceived liability into a strength. As passing became paramount and pass rushers faster and more punishing, quarterbacks who could escape the pocket, make throws on the move and turn surefire sacks into gains became increasingly valuable.At the college level, black quarterbacks have become much more commonplace: since 2010, at least one African American signal-caller has started in the national championship game. Mehri believes that has produced a trickle-up effect in the NFL, as social science research indicates that companies are nearly 200 times more likely to hire a minority candidate if the finalist pool for a job includes more than one minority.Of the league’s 90 quarterbacks currently active or on injured reserve, 19 (21 percent) are black – which means African Americans remain underrepresented at the position. Nevertheless, Shropshire believes that the gap is closing, and that the league is as close to being an on-field meritocracy as it has ever been.“For those of us who follow this closely, the moment you sort of know is when you can no longer name all of the black quarterbacks in the league,” he said. “That happened for me a couple of years ago.”Some bias still lingers. A 2004 study of football scouting publications found that white athletes were more likely to be praised for mental abilities, while blacks received physical compliments. A pair of 2017 studies found that white and black college students were more likely to describe pro quarterbacks in stereotypical ways than not, and that whites in general assigned stereotypes to black signal-callers but not to white ones.Two years ago, a  analysis of the previous seven league drafts showed that the average pick for a black quarterback was 70th overall as opposed to 53rd for a white quarterback – even though those same black quarterbacks had a career passer rating slightly above 90.0, higher than the average rating for their white counterparts.“It takes a couple of generations to change the legacy of racial ideology,” Coakley said. “It’s dying a slow death. And we may be at a point where it is grasping to its last breaths.”Tell that to Baltimore’s Jackson. Prior to the draft, veteran NFL executive Bill Polian suggested that the youngest-ever Heisman trophy winner would be better off playing receiver in the pros, while others raised concerns about Jackson’s ability to read defenses.In response, Jackson declined to run the 40-yard dash for scouts. He opened this season by throwing five touchdown passes in a 59-10 victory over Miami, then told reporters, “not bad for a running back.” After out-dueling Murray, he had Ravens coach John Harbaugh deliver a more pointed message, one more brick in a wall of integration: not bad for a quarterback.“To see how these kids have evolved from the era I played in and dispelled the myth that a black man could not think and throw and lead at that level, it’s just gratifying,” Briscoe said. “We’ve come so far. And it’s a long time coming.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0926b41667cd4b2788b80278087051b2e74767b6/0_726_3961_2377/master/3961.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30a3fb5b1cb37d301e123d4bbfbde08d","title":"ireland scotland rugby world cup 2019","story":"Ireland are regarded as the clear favourites and could find conditions work in their favour against a Scotland side who have prepared by coating their training balls with shampooThe first rugby club established in Japan was in Yokohama in 1866, making it one of the oldest in the world. Its first captain was a Scotsman, George Hamilton, a former Rugby School pupil, and among its founders was the owner of one of Ireland’s largest estates. This Sunday the country’s second biggest city in terms of population will play host to a rather larger Celtic gathering in a match that will likely leave the losers playing for second place in the pool.Ireland are regarded as the clear favourites to defeat Scotland having done so once this year at Murrayfield and shown in their final warm-up match, against Wales in Dublin, that they have recaptured the ruthless efficiency that New Zealand were unable to sabotage last November. Even though they are without a trio of injured Lions backs, Rob Kearney, Keith Earls and Robbie Henshaw, they brim with attacking and defensive menace behind and have a balance at forward to match that of any team in the tournament.Ireland’s dip since defeating the All Blacks has pushed them out of the clutch of favourites for the World Cup, but they start the tournament as the leaders in the world rankings, and though they are the only one of the home unions to have never made it beyond the quarter-final stage, they have never looked better equipped for a World Cup campaign, a tournament where success has been built on strong defences.Ireland: J Larmour, A Conway, G Ringrose, B Aki, J Stockdale, J Sexton, C Murray C Healy, R Best (captain), T Furlong, I Henderson, J Ryan, P O\u0027Mahony, J Van Der Flier, CJ Stander.\u0026nbspReplacements: N Scannell, D Kilcoyne, A Porter, T Beirne, J Conan, L McGrath, J Carty, C Farrell.If Scotland hoped the conditions would suit them, so hot and humid that they have prepared for Sunday by coating the rugby balls they use in training with shampoo and conditioner, they are likely to be disappointed. The forecast is for rain, downgraded from the deluge anticipated earlier in the week to something lighter. Weather predicting here seems no more reliable than in Britain, but Ireland are more likely to be heartened by the colour of the sky above them. September is the wettest month in Yokohama and the one when the sun shines the least.“Scotland like to take risks, calculated ones,” said the Ireland defence coach, Andy Farrell. “We need to expect the unexpected and try to get ahead of the game. They like to play at a high tempo and we need to create opportunities in defence to combat them.”As Ireland contemplate taking something from their opponents’ manual by honing their counterattack, so Scotland will look to use defence as a means of attack. “We have to strand up and be counted,” said their scrum-half Greig Laidlaw, who partners Finn Russell at half-back with the head coach, Gregor Townsend, opting for experience to get off to the winning start that would provide him with insurance.“Our defence has to stand up and it has to do so for 80 minutes,” said Laidlaw. “When we hold on to the ball, we cause problems and score tries, but we must also hold out teams. If we conceded soft tries, it puts massive, needless pressure on our attack. Defence is all about attitude: you have to get off the line and hit people. We did that when we played France at home recently but not when we played them, away. We then bashed Georgia a bit and we need that physicality again.”Form over the last four years would suggest an Ireland victory in double figures, but a World Cup has its own eco-system. Four years ago, Ireland were slated as a potential semi-finalist only to be overrun by Argentina. Scotland were expected to be among the also-rans but came the closest of the four home unions to the last four, denied by a late, controversial penalty awarded to Australia at Twickenham on a day when the alacrity with which they counterattacked looked to have taken them through.“One thing I am confident about is that we will be tough to beat,” said the Ireland head coach, Joe Schmidt. “That comes from having a very collective effort, which you will see against Scotland. We have been holding back a few things and I am sure we will see something new from them. Maybe it will come down to the bounce of the ball.”One of the Yokohama club’s first grounds was known as the Swamp. The International Stadium will be somewhat firmer, no matter how hard it rains. As the Celtic cousins meet for the effective prize of a place in the last eight, it will come down to who keeps their heads as much as their feet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13738bac0e6bb49c10f6332c988eec073e752e69/0_148_2357_1414/master/2357.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=270961cd2d376f3c0509699d0328a64e","title":"japan overcome dogged russia win opening rugby world cup match","story":"• Japan see off tiring Russia after early shock for World Cup hosts• Matsushima hat-trick seals victory after very shaky startThe first Rugby World Cup ever to be staged in Asia is under way and the host nation have duly delivered the result the tournament organisers needed. First impressions are considered very important in Japanese culture and, while their overall performance was not exactly a technicolour dream for their coach Jamie Joseph, the Brave Blossoms’ bonus-point victory will have focused a few minds among their fellow Pool A occupants Ireland and Scotland.There is still a fair way to go before Joseph realises his goal of steering Japan into the World Cup knockout stages for the first time but there were enough positive signs to enthuse a stadium almost entirely populated with excited red-and-white clad supporters. Right-winger Kotaro Matsushima claimed three of his side’s four tries to earn himself the honour of scoring the first hat-trick by any Japanese player at a World Cup.Unlike their epic 2015 pool victory over South Africa in Brighton, no last-ditch miracles were required this time but Russia deserved considerable credit for keeping the contest alive into the final quarter. They gave Japan problems aerially in the first half and never gave up at any stage. Their skipper Michael Leitch will know that improvements will be required to unsettle the Irish on Saturday week but as far as their supporters are concerned the show is firmly on the road.The main barrier to Japanese satisfaction was always likely to be first-night nerves. Leitch freely admitted to being disconcerted by the scale of the pre-match interest – “I’ve been making all sorts of mistakes in training there are so many people and so many cameras” – but even he could not have foreseen his side’s distinctly shaky start after emerging from the most spotless home dressing-room ever seen at a major sporting event.Having made a mess of the opening kick-off, the hosts were seven points down inside the first five minutes after their full-back William Tupou totally misjudged a Russian up and under and winger Kirill Golosnitskiy pounced on the loose ball to earn himself the distinction of claiming the fastest try ever scored in an opening World Cup game. Only when Timothy Lafaele threw a lovely backhand offload out of a tackle to give Matsushima enough space to cruise over wide on the right did the anticipated script finally begin to materialise.The Russian coach Lyn Jones, a familiar figure at Neath and London Welsh in a previous life, had instructed his players to go out and perform with no fear and the message seemed to have sunk in. They certainly defended with spirit, not least their powerful openside Tagir Gadzhiev who originally hails from Dagestan on the shores of the Caspian Sea and has a background in mixed marshal arts. Any British or Irish club seeking back-row reinforcements should definitely take a look.Japan, for their part, were busy and willing without always displaying the composure that sets the really good sides apart. There were no available weather-related excuses on a dry evening aside from a slight breeze but it was frustratingly typical when good approach work ended with Matsushima failing to ground the ball over the try-line to the satisfaction of the television match official. Luckily for his peace of mind, the winger was swiftly presented with another chance on the same part of the field and made no mistake to steer Japan into a 12-7 lead at the interval.The second-half was always going to be a test of Russian fitness but in the remarkable Gadzhiev they had a relentless beacon of resistance. Only in the aftermath of a 47th-minute turnover and galloping score for Japan’s flanker Pieter Labuschagne did the margin begin to inflate, a tired clearance from Russia’s captain Vasily Artemyev giving Matsushima the chance to add his third try 11 minutes from time.To say Russia will not have long to dwell on this outcome is an understatement. The tournament schedule has them back at it on Tuesday against Samoa in Kumagaya, a desperately tight turnaround in anybody’s language. No one will be rushing down to the bookmakers to put money on them winning a pool game but, on this evidence, those backing them to concede a bucketload of points in the pool stages may be disappointed. Jones has clearly got them playing for each other, which is always half the battle.It would have taken a stony heart, either way, not to marvel at how the World Cup has grown since its one-man-and-a-dog first edition in 1987. The genuine joy on the faces of the local kids during the opening ceremony, the widespread pride at the tournament’s arrival in Asia and Bill Beaumont addressing a packed stadium in Japanese were all, let’s face it, a distant dream not all that long ago.

Thousands. Every time I wheeled my bike out of my parents’ garage I turned right and I was on the worlds circuit.”It can surely be no coincidence that the joint race organisers, Welcome to Yorkshire, the tourism body for God’s own county, routed the women’s course right by her parents’ house in Otley. If it weren’t for a big hedge, Carol and John Armitstead would be able sit in their back garden and watch their youngest daughter whizz past up the hill to Farnley with the rest of the peloton as she attempts to win her second rainbow jersey.“As soon as it was announced, I thought: I have to do that race,” she said. There was just was just one small problem, albeit a nice one: she got pregnant last year and in September welcomed to the world her first daughter, Orla.Three days before she gave birth, her determination to become world champion again on home turf was undimmed. Instead of sitting on the sofa mainlining biscuits like other women past their due date, she was out in her Lycra, a bump jutting out above her cross bar, with her husband, Philip, then still riding for Team Sky.“Funnily enough, that last bike ride included the finishing circuit for the worlds in Harrogate. I remember thinking it was pretty surreal that I was aiming to be racing up the final climb in a year’s time and my life was about to change completely,” she said. “Looking back, I had zero idea just how much it was about to change.”The plan, post birth, was for the couple to both carry on racing professionally. “Before you’re parents you think, ‘ah, it’ll be all right, what’s the big deal? She’ll fit in somewhere,’” laughs Deignan.It didn’t take many sleepless nights before Philip decided to retire at the end of the 2018 season when his Sky contract ended. He is now Orla’s primary carer and his wife is endlessly grateful: “We decided it was better that he focus on looking after Orla and supporting me in what would be a very difficult two years. I’m so glad he has because it has made all the difference to our family.”There were plenty of times on maternity leave when Deignan doubted her ability to return to racing, though she saddled up again the minute she got the all-clear from her doctor, six weeks post-delivery:“It’s just so overwhelming in those first few months when you are absolutely exhausted and she wasn’t sleeping. I breastfed her as well for the first six months, so I was going out training for three hours, coming home and feeding her and going out again.”So few professional bike racers return after having a baby that information on how to do it safely was limited. Paralympic cyclist Dame Sarah Storey, who won two world titles 10 months after giving birth to her second child in 2018, was a key source of advice. “She breast fed until her kids were about two, and I was keen to understand from her how I was going to manage the feeds,” says Deignan, who is one of only two mothers on the UCI world pro tour circuit.The other is the Italian, Marta Bastianelli, ranked fifth in the world, who gave birth in 2014. But perhaps her fiercest rival in Yorkshire next week will be the Dutch rider, Marianne Vos, multiple world champion in three cycling disciplines, who has had an incredible year coming back from injury.Deignan might be the Yorkshire favourite but the bookies’ money will be on Vos, or fellow Dutchwomen Annemiek van Vleuten or the reigning champion, her old Boels Dolmans teammate Anna van der Breggen.Not being the favourite means she will race differently from last time: “I won’t be the one attacking and making the race. I will be holding my cards close to my chest and very much playing a tactical race, which is not what I am used to. But I am really excited about it. I think it’s going to be a lot of fun.”These days, riding her bike is a welcome break from the sometimes monotonous drudgery of parenting, she says: “For me, being a full-time mum would be the hardest job in the world, without a doubt. If you’re doing it properly, if you’re all in and being the best mum in the world 24 hours a day without getting that break when it’s just about you and your own focus, well, those women have my utmost respect.”Becoming a mother has changed her perspective: “Cycling is less important than it’s ever been but I’m more motivated than I’ve ever been. I go out and I love riding my bike now. I have a perspective now having taken a year away from professional sport just how lucky I am to do it as a job.”She doesn’t think she has changed much, but is overall much happier, following a stressful few years which nearly saw her banned from competing in the Olympics after she missed three drugs tests. “For me, being happy means I’m a better bike rider.”Deignan, now 30, was surprised to read a recent report that she would retire after the Tokyo Olympics next year. “I was quite shocked by that headline. My immediate goals are the world championships and then the Olympic games and I haven’t thought about my goals after that. What will determine my retirement are so many unknown things, so it’s far too soon to announce my retirement.”Lizzie is an ambassador for cycle insurance provider Cycleplan.

They will need to rectify that if they want to make a quarter-final.”And here is Robert Kitson’s match report from Tokyo:Oh, more light reading. Robert Kitson on the absolutely mouth-watering clash between New Zealand and South Africa tomorrow:I think we’ll just have to agree to differ on the Mexican Wave. Meanwhile here is Warren Van Der Mescht: “I would love to hear the football commentators try and pronounce Labuschagne correctly! Labus-caj(cajk) nee.”C Hodgetts is simply not having it, as for the ‘Mexican Wave’:“Sorry but we were doing that in America long before the 86 World Cup. We were doing it at high school football games and concerts. I don’t even think Mexicans call it the Mexican Wave.”Here is some light reading to take you through today:Ireland v Scotland preview by Paul Rees:Ugo Monye on England v Tonga:A piece about Sergio Parisse and his FIFTH World Cup with Italy:Nigel Owens blows his whistle and it’s all over. An appropriately entertaining way to open the 2019 Rugby World Cup. Russia gave Japan a bit of a scare, leading as they did until just before half-time. Understandably there were some nerves in Japanese ranks, but they steadied the ship, and their superiority showed - particularly in the second half as they took total control. The likes of Ireland, Scotland and Samoa will not be taking either of these teams lightly, but Japan look to have a serious chance of upsetting one of their northern hemisphere rivals and grabbing a place in the quarter-finals.80min: Ryan on The Mexican Wave. Or The Wave: “The Wave was not invented by Seattle Seahawks fans. ESPN had a short 30 for 30 documentary on it, and it was some baseball team in the early 1980s, with the credit either going to the team’s PA announcer or this one crazy fan. I think the team was the San Francisco Giants.”79 min: Look, I’ve probably missed a couple of these second-half replacements, but Japan are winning by 20 points, and man of the match Kotaro Matsushima has scored a hat-trick for the hosts. Those are the headlines.77 min: Dave McKenna has been in touch:“I have to say, as an Irishman with Scottish roots who has made his career and started a family in Japan, this Group A is going to be like Sophie’s Choice! Dave, Tokyo”Dave, you are guaranteed at least one, and probably two, teams in the quarters! Enjoy it.75 min: Into the final five minutes and with a 20-point lead, it’s party time for the fans in Tokyo. New Zealand v South Africa tomorrow is going to be a seriously high-quality encounter, but tonight’s opener hasn’t lacked either entertainment or quality.73 min: Thanks to Paul Tuplin for emailing: “With the name Labuschagne being predominant in cricket and now rugby, do you think the FA need to be searching for a footballer with that name to get us over that difficult quarter final  semi-final barrier.”Great point, Paul. Marnus Labuschagne was seriously impressive with the bat for Australia in the recent Ashes series and now we have Pieter Labuschagne starring for Japan’s rugby team. Where is the third star Labuschagne coming from? Can Gareth Southgate recruit him?Matsushima is over for his hat-trick! A poor kick by Artemyev is seized on by the Japan back line and the winger seals his treble with a straightforward finish on that right wing. What a night for Matsushima. Russia have put up a fight but this match is done, and the hosts are off the mark with a victory.68 min: Gaisin, Sychev, Matveev, Polivalov and Sozonov are all on for Russia. The inevitable bench-emptying.67 min: A thought-provoking email from C. Hodgetts, with regard to the party atmos in Tokyo this evening:“The Wave was started in the USA. Washington state to be exact. Mexico saw it on televised Seattle Seahawks football games and started doing it at (soccer) matches.”Now that may well be true, but in the UK I think we first saw it at the FIFA World Cup in 1986, in Mexico, and it has henceforth been called the Mexican Wave as far as we are concerned. I think it’s too late to change now - sorry!Leitch chooses to kick for the posts after a Russian infringement inside their own half, and the hosts are back with a 13-point lead.63 min: Japan have made 453 attacking metres with ball in hand, Russia have made 236. That seems a fairer reflection of the match so far than the tackle count.61 min: Thompson and Tanaka on for Japan. Nagare and Van Der Walt off. “Release!!! ... Good man!” shouts Nigel Owens at a Japan player. You have to love his style.It’s a 10-point game. Can Russia fight back to within a converted score? The replacement-fest now begins, I’ll be back in a couple of minutes ...59 min: Artemyev, who is neither a nearly-man nor a has-been, claims a Garryowen in the Japan 22, but he is isolated. Then Russia win a penalty!Russia have looked very good, in patches, but the consensus seems to be that their fitness is not good enough to match the best. I guess we will know for sure in about 25 minutes ...57 min: Russia come strongly again, with Gadzhiev nearly crossing in the left-hand corner, but they are penalised for going off their feet at the ruck. That was a golden chance for Russia to get right back into this.56 min: Inagi and Valu off for Japan, with Iseleli Nakajima and Jiwon Koo coming on.55 min: According to the stats on the official tournament site, Japan have made 90 tackles so far and Russia have made 93. So it’s very close on that score, even if Japan are well ahead on the scoreboard.54 min: Russia aren’t finished just yet, and spend a couple of minutes camped within yards of the Japan try line, trying to drive the ball over for their second try of the match. They win a penalty.49 min: Russia No 8 Nikita Vavilin makes a very strong carry but again it’s stolen by the on-rushing Japan defenders, who are not giving Russia an inch. Now Russia have the put-in at a defensive scrum. They appear to be running out of options fast. Meanwhile, the first Mexican Wave of the tournament is rolling around Tokyo Stadium.A high-class steal in contact in midfield, and a really good try for Japan, who are in full control now. Labuschagne rips the ball away while making a tackle, and sprints clear of the covering defence to cross the try line. In truth it was a tired piece of play from Russia and the superior fitness of the home team is really starting to show.Russia are penalised for not rolling away, and Japan strengthen their grip on the match with a straightforward three-pointer from Tamura.43 min: Thank you Andy Bradshaw for your half-time email:“This is a great game, although I’m terrified at what Ireland and Samoa are going to do to Russia if they’re this blown in the first half.”42 min: Right from the kick-off, Japan are right in Russia’s faces, and it’s only some quality defensive work by Dorofeev in the left-hand corner that snuffs out a potential try.40 min: Here we go then. Will Japan run away with this, or can Russia give them another big scare in the second half?That was a really entertaining half of rugby with Russia starting brilliantly and Japan coming back into it very strongly as the half wore on. A fine way to kick off seven weeks and one day of rugby. All to play for.Here’s a bit of half-time reading, starting with tactical analysis from Nick Evans:Here it Robert Kitson on New Zealand v South Africa:See you in a few minutes for the second half.This time there is no doubt. Matsushima crosses for his second try of the match in plenty of space on the right wing and has time to run in towards the posts. The pressure finally told on Russia after Japan went through the phases impressively in their 22. It looks like it may have been a forward pass to Matsushima, but there was no desire from the officials to check it. The extras are added, and Japan lead for the first time in the match, following that early try for Russia.37 min: Japan come again and they have a penalty advantage inside the final four minutes of the first half. They run it left, then right, but the Russia tackling is still excellent as they try to maintain that slender lead.36 min: It’s no try - Matsushima lost the ball forward. It was partly down to a brilliant bit of defensive work by Artemyev, with a last-ditch tackle in the corner. If Russia can get in for half-time with their two-point lead in tact, they will be pretty thrilled.35 min: Is it the second of the match for pacy winger Matsushima after another good attack by the hosts? He is in, in the right-hand corner, and es over, but his left hand is flirting with the touchline added to which there is a question mark about whether or not he has the ball under control ...35 min: Russia scrum-half Vasily Dorofeev is off for a head injury assessment. Meanwhile, the fly-half Kushnarev overcooks a kick to touch, and looks to the heavens in frustration.33 min: Here’s the reaction in the Tokyo fan zone to that first try by Japan:32 min: Inside the final 10 minutes of what has been a whirlwind of a first half so far, with both of these Tier 2 nations doing themselves proud and showcasing their skills. But there are a few Russia players who are blowing hard already. It looks certain that their coach, Lyn Jones, will need to empty his bench in the second half.29 min: Russia win the line-out - just - and again show their attacking prowess. Kushnarev spots some space behind the defensive line, and puts a lovely little kick over in midfield, which is grabbed by a team-mate and Russia are right on the front foot again. After a spell of pressure by the hosts, they are under considerable pressure in defence again now.25 min: Japan come again, but an excellent turnover by Russia No 8 Nikita Vavilin sees him storming down the middle of the pitch. It’s kicked ahead, into the Japan 22, and Russia have an attacking line-out in a very promising position. Yutaka Nagare clears for Japan and it’s another line-out for Russia - who will be pretty happy with the scoreboard.23 min: Yet another wave of attacking from Japan and they are over the try line. The ball is touched down, just, by Moore but referee Nigel Owens brings it back for a forward pass. Time for the director to focus on the fans for a few seconds, and it does look like a real party atmosphere in Tokyo.21 min: A lovely step by Japan fly-half Yu Tamura and he breaks two tackles, and wins a penalty. Japan kick for territory inside the Russia half.20 min: The match has indeed settled slightly with a couple of breaks in play after that breathless first 15. Shane Williams in the commentary box says it’s suiting to Japan to keep the ball in play, and keep a high tempo. Russia aren’t short of attacking threat but you would fancy Japan to be the better conditioned of the two sides, especially after the Eddie Jones era.19 min: Dominic O’Reilly emails: “Russia look early contenders for the ‘most emotional singing of an anthem’.” Well, Artemyev did say ‘there will be enough adrenaline to raise the dead’. Russia have certainly started strongly and are not here to make up the numbers.16 min: Japan fly-half Tamura collects a cross-kick, and then there’s a big hit in midfield by Vitaliy Zhivatov on James Moore. It’s been a seriously high-tempo start and no matter how well these teams are conditioned, they surely can’t keep this kind of pace up for 80 minutes or more. It’s great to watch though ..."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ac501c9ad906ee26d9aa68adbef1dba278b5fa0/0_3546_5504_3302/master/5504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2291f7dc353bbb91ffe3512f922f5529","title":"jen brister funniest things","story":"The standup, author and actor on the things that make her laugh the mostHas to be Me Talk Pretty One Day by David Sedaris.

Even in white you’re not going to confuse these with Apple’s earbuds, and that’s a good thing.The simple, attractive design is subtle enough to go fairly unnoticed in your ear, but different enough to be attractive, particularly in black and silver.The lump containing most of the workings fits beautifully in the concha of your ear, with the earbud tip slotted into a secure and comfortable position down your ear canal with a small twist. Even the stalks fit nicely in the gap between your lobe and tragus. At 5.6g each the earbuds are pretty small and light, and not once did they feel like they would fall out.Everyone’s ears are different, but the Track Air+ are some of the most comfortable earbuds of any size or shape I’ve worn.The Track Air+ magnetically slot into a charging case that’s one of the best in the business. It’s small enough to fit in the money pocket of a pair of jeans, making it one of only a handful of truly wireless earbuds that are that pocketable with the Samsung Galaxy Buds and Apple’s AirPods.The case charges via USB-C or wireless charging, which is handy, and will charge the earbuds up to three times. The Track Air+ lasted just shy of six hours with noise cancelling active, meaning you get about 24 hours of playback with trips in the case.The only slight niggles on the case are that, while the lid shuts securely with magnets, the hinge feels a little flimsy and will need a little bit of care in handling and the plastic body is easily marked.The Track Air+ support Bluetooth 5.0 and can be used inidually. They also support the standard Bluetooth audio format SBC and Qualcomm’s high-quality aptX, but strangely not AAC. While that’s not an issue for Android and Windows users, as aptX is built into both, Apple devices do not support aptX, with AAC their highest-quality supported Bluetooth audio codec, meaning the Track Air+ default to SBC.Most will not notice, but SBC has a higher latency, which means the Track Air+ suffered from a more noticeable audio delay with games on iOS than on Android. Lipsync issues were minimal with all major video apps on Android and there was only a minor delay noticeable with YouTube on an iPhone.Connectivity was rock solid with the majority of phones, including a OnePlus 7 Pro and iPhone XS, even in the most challenging of situations. Only once did I notice a momentary blip with a Google Pixel 3XL exiting the London underground at Liverpool Street.One of the weak points of the Libratone are the onboard controls. A double tap on either earbud can do one of the following: playpause, switch noise cancelling mode, skip track forward or activate your phone’s voice assistant. I set the left bud to skip track and the right bud to pause, but there’s no volume control, meaning it’s a trip to your phone to turn the music up or down.Removing both earbuds pauses the music and it resumes when you put one back in. A button in the case puts the buds into pairing mode, while the Libratone app takes care of settings. You can also check the battery of the earbuds and the case in the app.One of the best bits is how the Track Air+ sound, with a good amount of punchy bass and clarity rivalling some of the better sounding true wireless earbuds, while falling slightly shy of the big Sony WF-1000XM3 as the best. Feed them some aggressive rock or electronica and be richly rewarded, but they manage to do a good job of most genres.A basic EQ allows you to switch between neutral, extra bass or enhanced treble profiles, sounding best left in neutral. The silicone earbud tip, of which you get four sizes in the box, also does a good job of blocking out noise, but the Track Air+ also have noise cancelling built in. While it isn’t anywhere near as effective as that deployed by Sony’s new top earbuds or Bose, it dealt with the drone of plane engines well and managed to make a dent in most commuting noise too.You can adjust the noise cancelling through 30 levels, either manually or automatically based on your environment using the Libratone app on your phone. The earbuds sounded slightly less full in the mid-range with noise cancelling cranked up to maximum, but the trade-off seemed worth it in noisy environments.The Track Air+ struggled with wind noise with noise cancelling active. The ambient monitoring mode is excellent, sounding natural enough to hold a conversation fairly easy. I mainly used it to listen out for announcements.Call quality was pretty good too, with recipients saying I sounded fairly clear with only a little bit of loud background noise audible.The Libratone Track Air+ are some of the best true wireless earbuds available at the moment – very nearly the isolating, noise-cancelling AirPods Apple won’t give us.They have a stalk design but are attractive and don’t look like AirPod clones. They are some of the most comfortable earbuds I have ever worn: small and light enough you simply forget they’re in, but stay put and block out noise. The case is one of the best in the business too truly pocketable with USB-C and wireless charging, and you can check the battery level in an app.Connectivity was rock solid to both phones and tablets, with aptX for Android and Windows. Sound quality was really good, falling just shy of the very best true wireless earbuds available. And they have pretty effective noise cancelling.They are not quite perfect, but the only minus points are lack of volume control on the earbuds and the curious lack of AAC support, which is only a fairly small issue for iOS users.At £179 they’re not cheap, but undercut Apple’s AirPods with wireless charging case by £20 and Sony’s WF-1000XM3 by £40, making them pretty good value by comparison.If you want great-fitting, great-sounding true wireless earbuds that last a long time and fit into an excellently pocketable case then the Libratone Track Air+ tick every box, and have noise cancelling as the cherry on top.Pros: great sound, noise cancelling, super comfortable, brilliant case, aptX and Bluetooth 5, long battery life, solid connectivity, small and attractive.Cons: no AAC support, no volume control on buds, problem with wind noise, noise cancelling not the best.

Instead, they should focus on defining – and living by – the standards that they would like to see in regulation, before it gets forced on them anyway.For some of the most potentially dangerous new technologies, such as facial recognition, that could mean voluntarily refusing to sell them to certain countries, for certain uses, or even agreeing to a moratorium altogether, said Brad Smith, the president and chief legal officer of the world’s most valuable publicly-traded company.Speaking to the  before the launch of his new book, Tools and Weapons, Smith said that if technology firms wanted to be proud of how they changed the world for the better, they must take more responsibility for the ways they have made it worse.“When you think about all of the issues that people worry about in the world today and what they spend their time arguing about, it’s often issues like trade, immigration, nationalism, globalisation,” Smith said. “But all of these sit on top of a foundation. And the foundation is really being driven by technology.”“If an agency in any government wants to deploy facial recognition in a manner that we believe will result in unfair bias and discrimination, that’s something that we won’t do.”The conversation around the technology has advanced rapidly, even in the gap between Smith finishing the manuscript and the book hitting shelves. “I’ve never seen an issue evolve as quickly as facial recognition has,” Smith said. “And I think there’s a lot of food for thought in that. I say that in part because we feel it deeply ourselves.”“It was just 13 months ago where we published a blogpost where we said: ‘This is technology that is going to need to be regulated.’ The reaction in Silicon Valley was like: ‘What is wrong with you people at Microsoft, why are you doing this?’ And then look at where we are now: we just saw the city of San Francisco, next door to Silicon Valley, ban public sector use of facial recognition.”But, although Smith calls for regulation generally, he argues against an all-out ban. “The first question one should ask is why, why is this happening? It is a technology that can be deployed in, literally, an Orwellian fashion. But I think whenever you want to ban a technology, you also have to ask, well, what are the potentials for it to do good as well? And so then the question is how do you strike the balance? I don’t think that you strike that balance by banning all use. You strike that balance by banning the harmful use.“Now, I respect the people who call for a moratorium, because implicit, or maybe explicit, in the word moratorium is the notion that this will not last forever. I worry about moratoriums nonetheless, just because it can make it more difficult to learn how to use the technology well if you can’t put the technology to use. But I respect that point of view.”A month after Smith spoke to the , 76 protesters were arrested picketing the Manhattan Microsoft store with signs reading “No Business With Ice”, as part of the Close The Camps movement which demands an end to detention centres for migrants. The protest organisers told CNN that “it is our responsibility to hold US corporations accountable … in the racist torture and trauma that is being inflicted. We have the power to end this cruelty.”In the book, Smith describes Microsoft’s contract with Ice as a surprise to many in the company. A blogpost celebrating the deal, posted before the Trump administration started to set up detention camps on the US border, was rediscovered by activists in June.“A marketing statement made several months earlier now looked a good deal different,” Smith writes. “As we dug to the bottom of the matter, we learned that the contract wasn’t being used for facial recognition at all. Nor, thank goodness, was Microsoft working on any projects to separate children from their families at the border.”Smith says he distinguishes the sale of technology such as facial recognition from the more mundane productivity software that Microsoft does supply to Ice, and to other controversial state actors around the world.“One must assume responsibility for how your products are used in specific, well-defined, clearcut and relatively narrow ways. I think it’s a different situation to try to deny access to all technology because you disagree with what people are doing in their lives or with their businesses, or as a government. So to say, ‘I’m not going to let you use Microsoft Word or our search engine on the internet’, I think that’s a very different dynamic.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4da596a805af995a16f08595c7481e510388e47/0_0_4284_2570/master/4284.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=026bdd479b28357c2f050da20e63a8ec","title":"brad pitt snoop dogg asap rocky peaky blinders steven knight gangster series","story":"The world’s biggest stars are queuing up to be cast in the dandy gangster series. Ahead of the finale, creator Steven Knight talks about the show’s ‘bizarre, dream-like’ boomFrom the streets of Small Heath, Birmingham, to the news stands of Bogotá, we are now living in a Peaky Blinders world.The BBC first broadcast Steven Knight’s series about a gang of razor blade-wielding dandies in 2013. Six years later, its star Cillian Murphy, in character as Tommy Shelby, adorns the cover of Rolling Stone Colombia.The final episode of the fifth season will be shown on BBC One on Sunday evening, as the Shelbys tussle with fascist MP Oswald Mosley and a rival gang from Glasgow called the Billy Boys.As the Blinders scale new levels of popularity, thanks in no small part to Netflix streaming the show in 183 countries, it is no surprise to hear that A-list stars are contacting Knight asking to join the cast.“We get a lot of people who get in touch and want to take part,” he says. “There’s Brad Pitt. Snoop Dogg. A$AP Rocky, too. I think in series six we will open the door a little to get some celebrity actors in. The main thing is they have to be good. We’ll just get the best actor for the part, as we did with Sam Claflin, who plays Mosley. He’s perfect.”He does, however, rule out cameos for their own sake. “I always find it difficult when the audience knows a person from somewhere else and they just drop in. It’s very distracting.”Could he be referring to Ed Sheeran’s much-maligned appearance in Game of Thrones? “Well, there are some casualties along the road,” he says.Knight confirms Mosley will return in the sixth season and goes on to say that he has as good as cast an actor in the role of Diana Mitford, second wife to the leader of the British Union of Fascists, the party Mosley founded in 1932.While the Peaky Blinders are roughly based on a real-life gang and their enemies – former adversaries Billy Kimber and Darby Sabini did exist – the plot has played fast and loose with facts. With Mosley, the most well-known character depicted, Knight says his storyline will be more historically accurate.“What I’m trying to do is take history, and the specific things history notices, then write around the things that aren’t so known,” he says. “So Mosley was having an affair with his wife’s sister and stepmother, but history doesn’t count that, that isn’t what we know him for. But who the hell does that? He was charismatic and magnetic, which made his message seductive and enabled him to draw people in. I want to make people see that evil is seductive and that we need to be careful.“The rise of fascism, racism, national socialism and populism ... it’s happening now,” continues Knight. “I looked at Mosley’s speeches, and one of them began ‘Do not believe false news.’ He was telling people that the media was lying to them, that foreigners were taking things away from them. It’s my good fortune – but the world’s bad fortune – that these things are happening again and I can write about them. I just hope people realise that nine years after Mosley started making these speeches there was a world war. Let’s not do it again.”Knight is speaking at the the Legitimate Peaky Blinders festival and standing about 50 feet from the first reported crime by a Peaky Blinder – an assault in March 1890, years before the events depicted in the show. On the street below, there are thousands of fans dressed in period attire in tribute to their favourite characters.“It’s bizarre,” he says. “It’s like a dream.” A huge draw across the Midlands, there are fans from all over the UK, from France and Belgium. Earlier in the day, Knight met one fan who had travelled from Los Angeles.“It’s a whole world we’ve created, it’s more than just clothes and a good soundtrack,” he says. “I do lots of projects in film and TV. You have some that are lucky, and some that are unlucky. Peaky is the luckiest project I’ve ever been involved with. Every time we leap forward a couple of years, we hit a period of history that has such resonance. None more so than the current series. I don’t plan these things that far ahead, it just happens.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d6cf3e79c1489963084526d6063a7b6957fe991/0_71_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=492e3e4b276fd65f4fac28e087e8fcf2","title":"justin trudeau wearing blackface details emerge third incident","story":"Footage emerges of third instance of Canadian prime minister in blackface, with one month to go before election• How will Justin Trudeau’s blackface photos affect Canada’s election?Justin Trudeau is scrambling to halt further damage to his re-election campaign after a string of racist images from his past put Canada’s image-conscious prime minister at the centre of yet another scandal.Less than five weeks before the federal election on 21 October, the Liberal leader’s campaign was rocked when images emerged of Trudeau wearing blackface makeup.On Thursday, new video emerged of a third instance of Trudeau in blackface – just hours after he had apologized for wearing what he described as “racist” makeup to a costume party in 2001.The latest images came in a short, undated video clip published by Global News in which, Trudeau – his face, arms and legs painted black – waves at the camera and sticks his tongue out. The opposition Conservative party – currently neck-and-neck with Trudeau’s Liberals – confirmed it had sent the video to Global News earlier in the week.Trudeau admitted he could not remember how often he had worn blackface makeup. “I am wary of being definitive about this because of the recent pictures that came out, I had not remembered,” he told reporters in Winnipeg. A spokesman for the prime minister said he had spent the morning calling Liberal candidates and community leaders to fully apologize for what he did “knowing how racist and hurtful this type of thing was”.The scandal erupted late on Wednesday, when Time magazine published an image of Trudeau dressed as Aladdin – complete with dark skin makeup and a turban – at a 2001 function at a private school where he was then working as a 29-year-old teacher.Trudeau immediately apologized, and acknowledged that he had previously blacked up at a high school talent show, when he had sung Day-O, the traditional Jamaican song.“I apologise profoundly,” Trudeau told reporters aboard his campaign plane. “I didn’t think it was racist at the time, but now I see, it was a racist thing to do.“I’m pissed off at myself. I’m disappointed in myself,” he said.Opposition politicians reacted swiftly, saying the decades-old images called into question Trudeau’s judgment, his commitment to ersity – and his fitness to lead the country.“How do you look someone in the eye that has mocked the lived reality that I have lived – but, more importantly, what a lot of Canadians have lived,” said Jagmeet Singh, leader of the New Democratic party.The Conservative leader, Andrew Scheer – Trudeau’s main opponent – said he was “shocked and disappointed” and claimed the prime minister had “lied” in his apology to Canadians.But Scheer has also faced calls in recent weeks to eject members from within his own party for racist or homophobic statements. He told reporters he would stand by candidates who showed genuine remorse for previous actions – a standard he appeared unprepared to offer to Trudeau.The Green party leader, Elizabeth May, said she was “deeply shocked by the racism shown in this photograph of Justin Trudeau”, saying the prime minister must commit to learning better social justice leadership at “all levels of government”.Greg Fergus, a Liberal MP in Quebec and member of the federal Black Caucus, said he was “hopeful” the incident could help spur “nuanced” conversations about systemic racism in Canada.“I think the real measure of the man, and I think the thing we need to be talking about, is all the amazing things we have done for ersity,” Fergus said.“What Justin Trudeau did was wrong. He has apologized. I know it is not representative of the man he is,” Mitzie Hunter, a black member of Ontario’s Liberal party, tweeted. “This is a teachable moment for all of us. I accept his apology and I hope Canadians do too.”Others, were less forgiving of the prime minister’s previous actions.“The privilege continues. There is no excuse for this. Apology is a first step. You should be aware of the history of #blackface and racism in this country and others. Apparently #ersityisourstrength? Deeply disappointed,” tweeted former colleague Celina Caesar-Chavannes, who left the Liberal party in March 2019.After his landslide electoral victory in 2015, Trudeau was praised for his apparent commitment to ersity and inclusion, as well as polices which appeared to offer an explicit rebuke to those of Donald Trump: he quickly named a young and ethnically erse cabinet and initially welcome large numbers of Syrian refugees.But he is fighting for his second parliamentary majority against the backdrop of a protracted political scandal: earlier this year Canada’s ethics watchdog found that Trudeau broke the country’s conflict of interest law when he allegedly pressured his attorney general to halt the criminal prosecution of the Quebec-based engineering giant SNC Lavalin.Trudeau’s Liberal is effectively locked in a dead heat with rival Conservatives in terms of the popular vote, but they hold an edge when it comes to winning seats in parliament.It remains unclear how the images will affect the prime minister, whose political career has benefited as much from his carefully curated public persona as from his policies.When asked by reporters if he would eject a member of his own party for a similar image, he said he wouldn’t entertain “hypotheticals” and that each incident would be viewed on a “case-by-case basis”.Asked why he should stay on as leader, Trudeau responded: “I’m asking Canadians to forgive me for what I did.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad8036192dc371b4aef63bc4c4f956090967d691/0_54_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=251181bb0e0705cc36991273fca7693d","title":"chinese journalists to be tested on loyalty to xi jinping","story":"Exam will test journalists on president’s teachings on socialism and propagandaChinese journalists will soon be required to pass a test grading their understanding of Xi Jinping Thought, the socialist teachings espoused by the country’s leader.A notice from China’s media regulator has been sent to more than a dozen state-owned news organisations in Beijing over the last month. It instructs employees to prepare to take an exam on the “study Xi” propaganda app, launched earlier this year, in order to have their press credential renewed.Most believe the regulation will soon apply to Chinese reporters across the country. Journalists from three media organisations, two of which were outside Beijing, told the  their publications had also received informal notices to register on the app.“From the top down to the bottom, I don’t think anyone will be able to escape it,” said one reporter from a broadcaster in the eastern Shandong province who said he was not authorised to speak on the topic.The on-site, closed-book exam, to be administered by news organisations in early October, will be ided into five parts, including two on Xi Jinping’s teachings on socialism for the new era and Xi’s “important thoughts on propaganda”, according to Media Reform, a self-published news account on WeChat.News of the test, first reported by the South China Morning Post, comes as Chinese media face increasing restrictions. China is considered one of the least free countries to operate as a journalist, ranked 177 out of 180 in 2019 by Reporters Without Borders, above Eritrea and North Korea.While Chinese journalists face jail time and self-censorship is common, journalists especially from independent publications often push the envelope, investigating cases of local or corporate corruption. To get a press credential, journalists have previously been tested on their understanding of “Marxist journalistic ideals.”.“To be honest, it doesn’t mean that much,” the journalist from Shandong said. “Still, it’s a move to restrict public debate.”Authorities have stepped up their regulation of Chinese media and the internet, which already limits access to foreign websites, including news sites. In July, a draft regulation under China’s social credit system proposed punishing citizens for publishing information that “violates social morality” or causes “adverse social impacts”.Xi has demanded loyalty from Chinese journalists before. In 2016, he told staff at three state-run news outlets in Beijing that they were “the propaganda fronts and must have the party as their family name”.According to Media Reform, the exam for journalists is not expected to be difficult. The notice sent to reporters from their editors said news organisations should establish study groups and begin preparing for the test. Sample questions will soon be uploaded to the app, according to the news website Sohu.The test will only be able to be retaken once. Journalists said they were not sure whether they would need to take it every time they renewed their press cards, done every five or six years.While some journalists said they resented the new rule, others were less critical. “Chinese society needs to strengthen political study and correctly lead public opinion,” said a reporter with a paper in the south-western province of Guizhou, who asked not to be named.“Western media may be able to report on anything they want, but they also still pay attention to the ideology of their countries,” he said.Additional reporting by Lillian Yang"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8cc87935b078fcc3721a706d72125d8e2480038/0_206_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c815aefcaef97923eb444af1021d448c","title":"pakistan women rights activist gulalai ismail flees washington us asylum","story":"Gulalai Ismail escapes after months in hiding and seeks political asylumA prominent Pakistani activist, whose campaigns to empower girls have won her international awards and recognition, has defied a travel ban and fled to the US.Gulalai Ismail said she feared for her life after speaking out against sexual violence and disappearances allegedly carried out by the army in north-western Pakistan.After four months on the run, she succeeded in eluding a vast hunt and has turned up in the US, where she is seeking asylum.Ismail said she never sought to become an overseas dissident but believes there has been a closing of the political space in Pakistan, where the army has remained the dominant power-broker for most of the country’s history.“I never wanted to leave Pakistan,” she said in Washington. “I believe that I can better work towards democracy and civil supremacy and peace in Pakistan.”But she concluded she would be more effective abroad. “If I had ended up in prison and tortured for many years, my voice would have been silenced.”Ismail said she posed a special threat as a vocal woman. “When a man stands up, he is mostly against the state oppression,” she said. “But when a woman stands up, she is fighting oppression on many levels – fighting cultural norms, fighting the patriarchy and the state oppression.”Ismail was a teenager when she co-founded Aware Girls in 2002, which promotes gender equality in the deeply conservative Khyber Pakhtunkhwa district.In 2017, she won the prestigious Anna Politkovskaya award for human rights advocacy. A year earlier, she was honoured for conflict prevention by the Chirac Foundation in France and has been welcomed by Michelle Obama.But Ismail came under greater scrutiny last year when she spoke in support of the Pashtun Protection Movement, which defends the rights of the Pashtun tribe in the north-west.Quoting witnesses, Ismail said the army crackdown on Pashtun militants near the border with Afghanistan had led to frequent disappearances and sexual assaults.Most women were silent on such issues due to stigma, she said, but when a boy told her security forces were barging into his home and harassing his mother, she went to investigate.Ismail said: “Dozens of women had come to tell us that the incident of sexual harassment was not unique. It is systematic. It had been happening for years.”She was detained briefly in 2018, but her fears mounted in February when she was taken into custody for two days after attempting to hold a news conference.Ismail said she was held in a cold, dirty room with a urine-soaked sheet on the ground. She said she was denied food and water, and other female inmates warned against talking to the “high-profile terrorist”.In May, police filed a complaint against Ismail under an anti-terrorism law after she spoke out about the rape and murder of a 10-year-old girl.Ismail declined to discuss how she escaped Pakistan, saying she did not want to put others at risk. Her name was widely circulated to seek her arrest and airport authorities were told not to let her leave.“There were videos created online by military trolls which were clearly saying that the moment I’m in custody they will teach me a lesson,” she said. “I spoke about the issue of rape – now they will ‘teach me’ what rape is.”She said security forces attacked her driver and a friend who was handcuffed, beaten and administered electric shocks for 14 hours in an attempt to extract information on her whereabouts.For now, Ismail is living with her sister in New York. She said her initial fears of being sent back to Pakistan, a historical ally of the US, were eased after she held meetings in Washington at the state department and with staff of US lawmakers.But she remains worried about her parents in Pakistan. Ismail said they had become isolated with security forces interrogating anyone who dares to even text them.“I wanted to speak freely and that’s why I’m here,” Ismail said. “However, when it comes to the future of Pakistan, I do not see a prosperous Pakistan until the military establishment decides it needs to go back to its barracks.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bd12f91b25e86f44c424f4b7e65bcb30b9925fd/0_0_3667_2200/master/3667.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10acab5736f3ade9455682fc4ad5b2eb","title":"walking friendship tiramisu genoa centenarians secrets longevity","story":"The Italian city is home to nearly 300 centenarians – and this number is rising fast. Three women shed light on life beyond 100Adele Corsanego goes to a gym class three mornings a week and is always up for a party. She drinks wine with every meal, and eats pasta, cheese and tiramisu. She is 108 years old.“I’ve always been very active,” she told the  in an interview at the David Chiossone nursing home in Genoa. “I walked and cycled a lot, and played tennis for most of my life.”The Genovese diet is mostly based on the typical Mediterranean mix of plenty of fish, fresh vegetables, fruit and occasionally meat, but also includes many inventions of its own.\u0026nbspThe city’s most famous food export is pesto sauce, made with extra virgin olive, pine nuts and basil. Foccacia bread is also synonymous with the city as is farinata, a flatbread made with chickpeas.\u0026nbspTestaroli, a type of pasta from southern Liguria, is also popular, while vegetable quiche is eaten abundantly.\u0026nbspThe Genovese also eat eggs, cheese and drink wine, with the added benefit of most of the ingredients they consume being produced locally or regionally.\u0026nbspScientists often turn to Italy in their quest to explain why there are so many sprightly people living beyond 100. The number reaching the milestone is rising: according to data released this summer by Istat, the national statistics agency, Italy is home to 14,456 centenarians, up from 11,000 in 2009.Of that figure, 1,112 are over the age of 105, more than double compared with a decade ago, while the number of supercentenarians, those aged 110 and above, rose from 10 to 21.Studies have tended to concentrate on the islands of Sardinia and Sicily, or the southern regions of Lazio and Campania, usually in remote coastal or mountain villages seen as far from the stresses of modern life. But the largest proportion of centenarians (almost 650) in relation to the population size reside in the northern Liguria region, particularly in its industrial capital of Genoa, a long, tangled city of overpasses, underpasses and steep hills wedged between the sea and mountains.As of early September, Genoa was home to about 288 centenarians, the majority of them women. This is expected to rise to 350 over the next few months as people reach their 100th birthday.“Genoa has a strange combination of things,” said Valter Longo, a Genoa native and director of the Longevity Institute at the University of Southern California. “The birth rate is low, lots of elderly people move there from other regions, the climate is warm, healthcare system good … then there’s the diet, of which fish and fresh vegetables have always been a staple part, and so you’ll have some people making it to 105.”Along with Corsanego, who turns 109 in January, the  met Rina Verdoia, 102, and Pierina Travi, 104. All three women were born in the city, albeit from different socioeconomic backgrounds. Corsanego came from a bourgeois family that had the means to retreat to a mountain village in Piedmont during the second world war. She led a mostly privileged life and ate the best quality food.Verdoia was born into a poor family, and Travi spent a period of her youth in a home run by nuns after her parents were left destitute. All three had one child.Travi, who lives in a small home in central Genoa run by the Sant’Egidio charity, gave birth to her daughter at the age of 45. Verdoia is cared for by her daughter, who is in her 70s. Corsanego’s son died when he was in his 50s. Neither had parents or siblings who lived beyond 100.All three eat a simple, fresh diet, which includes pasta and wine with every meal, as well as the typical Genoa staples of pesto sauce and focaccia. Over their lives they would deal with common ailments by letting them pass instead of taking medicine.But other factors, such as Genoa’s topography, have possibly played a role in their longevity. “I always walked, everywhere,” said Travi, adding that she had never ventured beyond the province.Walking in the city is difficult to avoid, whether through the narrow alleyways of the centre or up and down the hills of neighbourhoods beyond.“Genoa has areas where people can live as if they were in a village,” Longo said. “My mother lived on a hill and would sometimes go down it and back twice a day with the groceries. These are also fairly friendly, close-knit communities.”“The problem is not so much an ageing population but having too few young people,” said Andrea Chiappori, the president of Sant’Egidio’s Genoa branch. “This makes people think negatively towards elderly people as they are seen as a burden. It should instead be a good problem – living a long life should reflect that the quality of life and social system are good.”Verdoia, who spent much of her life volunteering, said the secret to her resilience is “helping and respecting others”.“Especially those who are poor … everything you do to help others comes back to help you,” she added. Friendship is another key, she said. Travi “remains a child at heart”, she said. “I always got on well with others, never argued.”Corsanego, who is always the first to arrive for the hour-long gym classes and readily embraces the nursing home’s social activities, advised “living life in the present, without worrying too much about the future”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f01fe0598f6ff3c80122b992ae26a3aed1ec73f/0_367_6585_3951/master/6585.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5279c434e52068277c920149416a019b","title":"we need to talk about hope","story":"This week’s Upside highlight was a live event in London – and a lot of environmental hopeFriday night and the lights were indeed low.

Photograph: PAIreland’s meat processing plants continued to face blockades on Friday and only three protests out of approximately 20 have been lifted, according to an organisation representing beef farmers.However, the Beef Plan Movement (BPM) said that a further six groups of protesting farmers are meeting to consider their options in terms of accepting or refusing the deal.The long-running dispute is primarily a result of farmers’ dissatisfaction around the cost of beef.Negotiations at the weekend resulted in an agreement between meat processors and six farm representative organisations but other farmers continued to protest.However, Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed warned that the agreement could only come into force if all protests and blockades ended.Dermot O’Brien of BPM said they are doing “everything in our power” to ensure the agreement is accepted by both sides.“The Beef Plan Movement is engaging meaningfully with all of the other stakeholders to try and move the agreement along and to bring this agreement into the public arena so we can move along,” Mr O’Brien said.“We want those plants opened. We want all plants running and slaughtering animals for those farmers who need to slaughter their animals who are reaching upper age limits of 31 weeks,” he added.On Wednesday, the first blockade was lifted from Dawn Meats factory in Slane, Co Meath, followed by another suspension of protesting at ABP in Ferrybank in Co Waterford. On Thursday, another blockade was lifted at ABP in Cahir, Co Tipperary. The Dawn Meats company said that upwards of €2.25 million worth of finished beef is being “illegally” refused exit from its Charleville plant as a result of 10 farmers engaging in picket lines.The facility, which is now in shutdown mode, employs over 300 staff and exports beef to over 20 countries. It has not slaughtered any animals in over 2 weeks.A spokesman for Dawn Meats said: “Continuing illegal blockades are an act of national sabotage and an afront to the very many genuine farmers seeking to make ends meet at a critically challenging time for the Irish beef industry.”“International beef customers are completely frustrated that for a second week in a row they will receive no Irish product and have had to source South American beef to meet their requirements,” the spokesman added."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4020029.1568660148!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"gosafe speed cameras facing industrial action by workers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Siptu said notice of industrial action in ‘the coming days’ was intended to mean by the end of the week. File photograph: Cyril ByrneThe GoSafe, the company which runs Ireland’s roadside speed monitoring vans, is set to face notice of industrial action by the end of the week in a row about pay and conditions.The GoSafe consortium was awarded the State contract to operate the privatised speed cameras in 2016 for five years, in a deal reportedly worth up to €115.5 million.Besides complaining about pay, Siptu GoSafe staff also allege that shift patterns are so strict that it leaves them with little choice but to carry a plastic bottle for use in toilet breaks.Inidual GoSafe drivers who have spoken anonymously to The  said they were employed on nine- or 11-hour shifts, most of which was spent in the van.While they are allowed to take breaks, the possibility of giving evidence in court meant they had to be in operational charge of the van and camera equipment throughout the shift.For many this meant eating lunch in the van. And while they are allowed outside to “stretch the legs”, the need to remain in operational control means they cannot go beyond sight of the van. Staff also spoke of the danger of being attacked by the public and pressure to meet deadlines for travel when they journey between pre-selected checkpoints.Efforts to contact GoSafe for a response were unsuccessful. But the obligations it faces to monitor speed means that industrial action could create significant problems for the company.No option but strike voteAny reduction in hours of roadside monitoring is also likely to have an impact on the State’s Road Safety Strategy, given the significance of speed in fatal and other serious road crashes. Siptu organiser Brendan Carr said his members had no option but to vote for strike action after GoSafe insisted that issues should be dealt with through the company’s representative forum. Mr Carr said the company had refused to implement a Labour Court recommendation which confirmed that it was Siptu representatives who have the sole right to negotiate on behalf of its members with management.Mr Carr criticised what he described as “the unacceptable practice of Government departments issuing contracts for State services to companies who refuse to engage with the industrial relations bodies of the State.“This is a completely unacceptable situation when such companies are in receipt of large amounts of public funds,” he said. Asked if there was a timeline for industrial action Mr Carr replied “it is expected that notice of industrial action will be served by Siptu on the company in the coming days”. A Siptu source said “the coming days” was intended to mean by the end of the week."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4024887.1568980930!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"speed camera van operators to strike for 24 hours in september","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tStaff operating speed camera vans on behalf of the State are to stage a 24-hour work stoppage on Saturday September 28th in a dispute over working conditions.Staff operating speed camera vans on behalf of the State are to stage a 24-hour work stoppage on Saturday September 28th in a dispute over working conditions.The trade union Siptu, which represents workers employed by GoSafe Ireland said its members had been left with no alternative other than to go on strike.Siptu organiser Brendan Carr said on Friday, “ Our members are only taking this action as a last resort because of the intransigence of management who have refused to address their concerns relating to health and safety and their conditions of employment.”“Our members can be confined to their van for up to 11 hours while conducting their duties. This results in workers being placed under extreme circumstances while at the same time trying to conduct their crucial road safety service.”He said the staff concerned had attempted to address these problems through the State industrial relations mechanisms.“However, the company has refused to engage with the workers through their union despite the service they provide being fully funded by the State. The Labour Court has issued a recommendation saying that the employer should recognise Siptu as the representative of its employees who are union members but this has been completely ignored by management. “““This dispute highlights the unacceptable practice of Government departments issuing contracts for state services to companies who refuse to respect the industrial relations bodies of the State. This is a completely unacceptable situation when such companies are in receipt of large amounts of public funds.”Mr Carr said that Siptu had written to the Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan, in relation to concerns raised by staff at GoSafe Ireland.“Union representatives asked to meet with the Minister to discuss this dispute and seek his assistance in resolving it prior to any industrial action.”“Unfortunately, the Minister declined to intervene, despite the possible serious implications for road safety which is one of his key responsibilities.”"},{"url":null,"title":"matt cartoons september 2019","story":"To continue reading this articleAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekRegister for freeRegister or subscribe to continue readingAlready a subscriber?Newsletters and daily briefings30 days free, then £2 per weekUnlimited access to Premium articlesExclusive subscriber events and rewardsThe daily newspaper on your smartphone or tabletAlready a subscriber?Sign up for our exclusive, subscriber-only Matt newsletter - and get an unseen Matt  each week. www.telegraph matt-nlOrder The Best of Matt 2018 by visiting books.telegraph or call 0844 871 1514.  ​To order a fine art print, signed or unsigned of this, or any Matt cartoon, go to telegraphmattprints or call 0191 603 0178.Brexit latest news: Michel Barnier and Stephen Barclay agree to carry on talks aimed at replacing the backstopMacron unveils \u0026#39rural action plan\u0026#39 including cheaper alcohol licenses in bid to win over Yellow VestsTaiwan loses another ally as Kiribati switches allegiance to ChinaComment: Anyone who wants to delay Brexit cannot have the best interests of Europe at heartSupreme Court prorogation appeal: What could the judges decide and when will the verdict be released?Why Australia, the US and Japan are banned from speaking at the UN\u0026#39s flagship climate summitComment: My stint on Question Time last night exposed just how out of touch the political elite are with the people they were elected to serve Comment: Diary of a reluctant MEP: Why is it so much easier to get a free cocktail than a chance to speak in the Chamber?\u0026#39There\u0026#39s no impartiality in Brexit anymore\u0026#39 -  readers on this week\u0026#39s top storiesMonopoly censors Manneken Pis on Brussels edition boxSilver Spitfire pilot log week five: Stranded in RussiaGlobal climate strike protesters arrested as Britain braces for weekend of chaosComment: The biggest obstacle to a workable backstop alternative lies not in the EU, but the UKBest independent schools in the UK: Compare league table results for A-levelsBest independent schools in the UK: Compare league table results for GCSEsBrexit Backstop: what are the options Boris Johnson can turn to for the Irish border?BBC forced to cut live footage of British rapper holding aloft effigy of Boris Johnson\u0026#39s severed head Friday morning news briefing: \u0026#39We can do a deal\u0026#39, says Jean-Claude JunckerIain Duncan Smith: EU leaders are \u0026#39panicking and desperate\u0026#39 about a no-deal BrexitWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"does new science mean elixir youth within grasp todays middle","story":"One professor appears to have found a way to eliminate the frailties of old ageI have reached the stage of life (48) where I put both hands on my knees and push off with a grunt whenever I get out of a chair.

It looks exactly the same as before, yet somehow\u0026nbspentirely different.The design itself hasn’t changed from last year. That’s no surprise because 2018’s Apple Watch Series 4 was a radical departure from all the Watches that had gone before, with its bigger display in a nearly identical case, for instance.The Series 5, then, is a dead ringer for Series 4. Except for the couple of things that make it appear very different different.First, there’s the case. Last year, you could choose between aluminium and stainless-steel finishes cladding the watch. The aluminium came in several colours, including rose gold, while the stainless steel came in the natural silvery colour you’d expect, plus Space Black and Gold.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Gun-toting humanoid robot sent into spaceRussia has launched a humanoid robot into space on a rocket bound for the International Space Station (ISS).

These include a new metal finish: titanium. It is lighter than – and a little more expensive – than the stainless-steel options and is very attractive. Especially in the Space Black option.Then there’s a return to the ceramic finish not seen since Apple Watch Series 3. It looks sensational: gleaming white and almost glowing, it’s so shiny.But the case is not the real reason this Apple Watch looks so different. That’s down to the new display which gives rise to a new feature: an always-on screen.Unlike regular watches, smart watches tend to conserve battery by turning off the display when you’re not actually looking at it. It makes sense, right? So to wake the display, you must raise your arm. The Apple Watch has always done this raise-to-wake action perfectly, better than rivals, but it still leaves you with that occasional moment when flicking your wrist leaves the display dormant.Now, with the low-temperature poly-silicon and oxide display (abbreviated, thankfully, to LTPO), Apple has devised a way to keep the screen on all the time.iPhone 11 review reveals eye-catching upgrade for AppleSo, you can sneak a glance at the time in a dull meeting without having to twist your wrist revealingly, for instance. Or look at the Watch when it’s facing downwards, where it previously would have switched off.This sounds like such a small thing, but in practice I’ve found it to be a real game-changer.It takes a little getting used to because Apple has organised it so the display dims when you’re not looking at it, though is still entirely visible. It’s very cleverly crafted so it’s not just a matter of turning down the brightness: each Watch face has been optimised so certain elements fade out altogether in the less bright state, or change to a darker colour. Without moving your wrist, you can see the dimmed state raise your arm and it’s back to full brightness and full-on design.It’s the key feature on the new Watch and it works brilliantly.Edelson  AFP)There are new Watch faces to go with the new hardware, including some exclusive to the new Series 5.The other major new hardware in the Watch is a compass. I can hear you snorting in derision, but it’s actually plenty useful. That’s because it can be integrated into apps. For instance, when you’re looking for a restaurant on Yelp and you don’t know which way you should head on the street, take a look at the arrow on the Yelp Watch app. As you turn, the arrow turns with you, so the right direction to head in is unmistakable.It’s also useful in outdoors situations, or if you just fancy knowing your current elevation, longitude, latitude and incline. A bit geeky but quite cool.Much of the rest of the Watch is the same as Series 4. Why didn’t Apple upgrade the processor? Probably because the speed increase it got last time around was enough to last for a while or perhaps the power use optimisation needed for an always-on display may have made this the best configuration.There are new apps in the latest watchOS 6 software, such as a handy Noise app which warns you when the environment you’re in could be too loud for your ears to endure.The Watch has always been about health and fitness and other additions include menstrual cycle tracking for women and the ability to track trends in your activity over a longer period of time. Of course, the heart rate monitor and ECG capabilities of Series 4 are on board here, too.A word about Series 3. Although Series 4 has been retired, the excellent Series 3 first launched in 2017 has had a huge price cut and now starts at £199. This is phenomenal value for such a capable smartwatch. You don’t get the sumptuously big screen or ECG features of Series 5, for instance, but it’s a great first Apple Watch.The Series 5 Watch starts at £399 for the smaller, 40mm case in aluminium or £429 for the larger, 44mm case. Add £100 if you want cellular connectivity so you can make phone calls even when your iPhone is at home.One other thing worth mentioning: Apple is all about personalisation this year. Not only are there more case options than ever before – I didn’t even mention the special editions with Nike and Hermès – but it’s now possible to mix and match the Watch and band you prefer with much greater choice.The always-on feature is the marquee upgrade on this Watch and it’s tremendous. It doesn’t affect battery life, that’s still well over a day. Until last week, Series 4 was the best smartwatch on the market by a country mile. Series 5 puts Apple further ahead of its rivals.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Again, over half – 56 per cent – said they do not have enough information to start making decisions about their post-Brexit recruitment strategy, with just 27 per cent happy to make decisions based on existing information.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Environmental activists rally during the UK Student Climate Network\u0027s Global Climate Strike protest in central London.

Australia were all out for 284 after Steve Smith frustrated the hosts with a total of 144. He helped drag his side from 122-8The institute also found that since the 2016 vote to leave the EU most employers have focused on retaining existing EU staff, rather than on planning for immigration restrictions.Very few employers are ready for the end of free movement and restrictions on immigration in just over a year. Worse still, many seem both daunted and alarmed by the range of restrictions planned and the costs they are likely to incur,” said Gerwyn Davies, senior labour market adviser for the CIPD.“It seems inevitable that the rate of inflow of EU citizens into the UK from 2021 will fall compared with recent years,” he added.The CIPD urged the government to bring in immigration restrictions gradually to give firms more time to adjust and to avoid harming UK competitiveness.It recommended introducing a two-year visa system for unskilled workers and making an exception for some jobs with labour shortages by lowering the proposed £30,000 salary requirement for foreign workers.One engineering firm in Scotland told the CIPD that the average salary of a skilled manufacturing worker is £28,000. “That’s a significant issue for us,” the employer said.The British Chambers of Commerce also highlighted lingering gaps in government guidance on the status of EU migrants despite the fast-approaching Brexit deadline of 31 October.“The implications of unclear government advice, and gaps in the system, could be costly for businesses that may feel they need to access professional help,” the group said on Friday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Australia were all out for 284 after Steve Smith frustrated the hosts with a total of 144. He helped drag his side from 122-8The institute also found that since the 2016 vote to leave the EU most employers have focused on retaining existing EU staff, rather than on planning for immigration restrictions.Very few employers are ready for the end of free movement and restrictions on immigration in just over a year. Worse still, many seem both daunted and alarmed by the range of restrictions planned and the costs they are likely to incur,” said Gerwyn Davies, senior labour market adviser for the CIPD.“It seems inevitable that the rate of inflow of EU citizens into the UK from 2021 will fall compared with recent years,” he added.The CIPD urged the government to bring in immigration restrictions gradually to give firms more time to adjust and to avoid harming UK competitiveness.It recommended introducing a two-year visa system for unskilled workers and making an exception for some jobs with labour shortages by lowering the proposed £30,000 salary requirement for foreign workers.One engineering firm in Scotland told the CIPD that the average salary of a skilled manufacturing worker is £28,000. “That’s a significant issue for us,” the employer said.The British Chambers of Commerce also highlighted lingering gaps in government guidance on the status of EU migrants despite the fast-approaching Brexit deadline of 31 October.“The implications of unclear government advice, and gaps in the system, could be costly for businesses that may feel they need to access professional help,” the group said on Friday.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Mr Coveney acknowledged that the mood music around Brexit talks had improved\u0026nbspbut said there was still a wide gap between what the UK has proposed and what the EU would accept.\u0026nbspThe comments reversed a rally sparked last night by optimistic remarks from European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.\u0026nbspIn today\u0027s session, the pound is down 0.4 per cent against the dollar and 0.2 per cent against the euro at €1.131.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe banks are strong-arming Thomas Cook, says analyst\u0026nbspAlex Brignall, Travel and Leisure Analyst at City equities broker Redburn, comments:\u0026nbsp“It feels like a bit of strong-arming by the banks to see the Fosun deal get sorted quickly, or for the situation to be resolved in another way, likely through disposals. Triton has remained very keen to buy the Nordic business, so that should be able to be done if the other solutions do not come through on time.\u0026nbsp“The concerning thing is that September should be the best point of the year for the cash balance, so for banks to be demanding a cash top-up now suggests demand has taken a big hit from all the negative publicity and that the company is facing additional working capital stress.”\u0026nbspWhat are the options for Thomas Cook as it struggles to stay afloat?\u0026nbspJoanna Ford, partner at law firm Cripps Pemberton Greenish, says the proposed rescue deal would come at a cost. Existing shareholders would lose much of the value of their investment and control would shift to Thomas Cook\u0027s\u0026nbspChinese investor, Fosun, says Ms Ford.\u0026nbspThis is a common and obvious option for companies that are struggling financially – turning to their existing stakeholders to put their hands in their pockets so their investments can hopefully be salvaged makes sound commercial sense.\u0026nbspShareholders will inevitably want something additional in return, though, and this is usually in the form of shares that then dilute the value of the stake held by those shareholders who chose not to invest.But if that doesn\u0027t work...\u0026nbspIf the rescue deal fails to materialise then the options for Thomas Cook could include administration, an insolvency process where professionals are appointed to manage the company’s affairs. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn this scenario they would try to sell the whole, or parts of the business, leaving behind the company in administration, its shareholders and all the liabilities, which would then be paid (usually not in full) from the cash received from the sale. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOther options to businesses with cash flow difficulties include emergency borrowing, either from their own banks or specialist distressed lenders, but this is usually only a sticking plaster if the root cause of the difficulties are not addressed. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIf the problems continue, then the cash deficit simply increases and the lenders stand to shoulder greater losses should the business ultimately collapse.\u0027Truly extraordinary\u0027\u0026nbspThe record low prices secured for new renewable energy\u0026nbspprojects are truly extraordinary says\u0026nbspSimon Virley, UK head of energy and natural resources at KPMG.\u0026nbspThe government has secured almost 6GW of new renewables capacity, without spending any of the £65m budget allocated for this auction, due the record low clearing prices.\u0026nbsp“Giant offshore wind projects will now be built in the North Sea effectively ‘subsidy free’. \u0026nbspThis raises the prospect of offshore wind contributing even more than previously envisaged to achieving the UK’s Net Zero emissions target by 2050.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspGoogle makes \u0027biggest\u0026nbspcorporate purchase\u0027 of energy\u0026nbspGoogle boss Sundar Pichai said the tech giant plans to make the\u0026nbsp“the biggest corporate purchase of renewable energy in history.\u0026nbspIncluded in the investment will be more than $2bn (£1.6bn) in energy infrastructure and 1,600-megawatts of wind and solar agreements.\u0026nbsp“In all, our renewable energy fleet now stands at 52 projects, driving more than $7bn in new construction and thousands of related jobs,” Pichai said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOffshore wind no longer needs subsidies after costs tumble\u0026nbspRenewable energy from new offshore wind farms will be cheaper to produce than the current market rate and no longer require any subsidy after cost tumbled 30 per cent in two years.\u0026nbspThe government revealed that 12 new energy projects, including offshore wind farms will receive between £39.65 and £41.61 per megawatt hour.\u0026nbspBoris Johnson said: The UK is leading the way in the fight against climate change, and it\u0027s great news that millions more homes will be powered by clean energy at record low prices.Seizing the opportunities of clean energy not only helps to protect our planet, but will also back businesses and boost jobs across the UK.Three Mobile customers will continue to pay a loyalty penalty\u0026nbspCitizens Advice says Three Mobile customers will continue to pay a loyalty penalty that collectively amounts to as much as £2.7m a month after the company.\u0026nbspOther major networks have committed to end the practice of continuing to charge customers for their handset when their minimum contract period ends and they have paid it off.\u0026nbspBut Three has refused to follow suit, Citizens Advice said. This means loyal customers are being overcharged, the organisation said.\u0026nbspA Three spokesperson said: The current proposals are not in customers\u0027 best interests. Applying an arbitrary discount to tariffs will not effectively tackle what really matters - helping them to find a contract which is both best-suited to their needs and priced fairly.Dover is 100 per cent ready for no-deal Brexit, says port chief executive\u0026nbspThe Port of Dover is 100 per cent ready for a no-deal Brexit, according to the port\u0027s boss, Doug Bannister.\u0026nbspHowever, he\u0026nbsptold Bloomberg\u0026nbspthat he still has no clarity on the rules of the game such as what documents will be needed for freight consignments\u0026nbspMr Bannister also conceded that he was anticipating\u0026nbspdisruption: whether it’s a day, two days, a week, two weeks, a month, two months, nobody can really predict”.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThomas Cook in race to find £200m to stave off collapse\u0026nbspThomas Cook is\u0026nbspon the brink of administration after the tour operator\u0027s lenders demanded that it finds\u0026nbsp£200m in extra funding.\u0026nbspThe company said it was in talks with stakeholders to secure the required funds, including Chinese firm Fosun which injected £450m last month.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0027s travel correspondent, Simon Calder, explains how people who have booked holidays with Thomas Cook might be affected:\u0026nbspThomas Cook: How will holidaymakers be affected if the travel company collapses?\u0026nbspRBS appoints Alison Rose as chief executive\u0026nbspRBS has confirmed the appointment of Alison Rose as chief executive. Ms Rose will become the first chief executive of a major British high street bank when she replaces outgoing boss Ross McEwan on 31 October.\u0026nbspRBS will also be the only FTSE 100 company with women in its top two positions.

Mr Coveney acknowledged that the mood music around Brexit talks had improved\u0026nbspbut said there was still a wide gap between what the UK has proposed and what the EU would accept.\u0026nbspThe comments reversed a rally sparked last night by optimistic remarks from European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.\u0026nbspIn today\u0027s session, the pound is down 0.4 per cent against the dollar and 0.2 per cent against the euro at €1.131.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe banks are strong-arming Thomas Cook, says analyst\u0026nbspAlex Brignall, Travel and Leisure Analyst at City equities broker Redburn, comments:\u0026nbsp“It feels like a bit of strong-arming by the banks to see the Fosun deal get sorted quickly, or for the situation to be resolved in another way, likely through disposals. Triton has remained very keen to buy the Nordic business, so that should be able to be done if the other solutions do not come through on time.\u0026nbsp“The concerning thing is that September should be the best point of the year for the cash balance, so for banks to be demanding a cash top-up now suggests demand has taken a big hit from all the negative publicity and that the company is facing additional working capital stress.”\u0026nbspWhat are the options for Thomas Cook as it struggles to stay afloat?\u0026nbspJoanna Ford, partner at law firm Cripps Pemberton Greenish, says the proposed rescue deal would come at a cost. Existing shareholders would lose much of the value of their investment and control would shift to Thomas Cook\u0027s\u0026nbspChinese investor, Fosun, says Ms Ford.\u0026nbspThis is a common and obvious option for companies that are struggling financially – turning to their existing stakeholders to put their hands in their pockets so their investments can hopefully be salvaged makes sound commercial sense.\u0026nbspShareholders will inevitably want something additional in return, though, and this is usually in the form of shares that then dilute the value of the stake held by those shareholders who chose not to invest.But if that doesn\u0027t work...\u0026nbspIf the rescue deal fails to materialise then the options for Thomas Cook could include administration, an insolvency process where professionals are appointed to manage the company’s affairs. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn this scenario they would try to sell the whole, or parts of the business, leaving behind the company in administration, its shareholders and all the liabilities, which would then be paid (usually not in full) from the cash received from the sale. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOther options to businesses with cash flow difficulties include emergency borrowing, either from their own banks or specialist distressed lenders, but this is usually only a sticking plaster if the root cause of the difficulties are not addressed. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIf the problems continue, then the cash deficit simply increases and the lenders stand to shoulder greater losses should the business ultimately collapse.\u0027Truly extraordinary\u0027\u0026nbspThe record low prices secured for new renewable energy\u0026nbspprojects are truly extraordinary says\u0026nbspSimon Virley, UK head of energy and natural resources at KPMG.\u0026nbspThe government has secured almost 6GW of new renewables capacity, without spending any of the £65m budget allocated for this auction, due the record low clearing prices.\u0026nbsp“Giant offshore wind projects will now be built in the North Sea effectively ‘subsidy free’. \u0026nbspThis raises the prospect of offshore wind contributing even more than previously envisaged to achieving the UK’s Net Zero emissions target by 2050.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspGoogle makes \u0027biggest\u0026nbspcorporate purchase\u0027 of energy\u0026nbspGoogle boss Sundar Pichai said the tech giant plans to make the\u0026nbsp“the biggest corporate purchase of renewable energy in history.\u0026nbspIncluded in the investment will be more than $2bn (£1.6bn) in energy infrastructure and 1,600-megawatts of wind and solar agreements.\u0026nbsp“In all, our renewable energy fleet now stands at 52 projects, driving more than $7bn in new construction and thousands of related jobs,” Pichai said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOffshore wind no longer needs subsidies after costs tumble\u0026nbspRenewable energy from new offshore wind farms will be cheaper to produce than the current market rate and no longer require any subsidy after cost tumbled 30 per cent in two years.\u0026nbspThe government revealed that 12 new energy projects, including offshore wind farms will receive between £39.65 and £41.61 per megawatt hour.\u0026nbspBoris Johnson said: The UK is leading the way in the fight against climate change, and it\u0027s great news that millions more homes will be powered by clean energy at record low prices.Seizing the opportunities of clean energy not only helps to protect our planet, but will also back businesses and boost jobs across the UK.Three Mobile customers will continue to pay a loyalty penalty\u0026nbspCitizens Advice says Three Mobile customers will continue to pay a loyalty penalty that collectively amounts to as much as £2.7m a month after the company.\u0026nbspOther major networks have committed to end the practice of continuing to charge customers for their handset when their minimum contract period ends and they have paid it off.\u0026nbspBut Three has refused to follow suit, Citizens Advice said. This means loyal customers are being overcharged, the organisation said.\u0026nbspA Three spokesperson said: The current proposals are not in customers\u0027 best interests. Applying an arbitrary discount to tariffs will not effectively tackle what really matters - helping them to find a contract which is both best-suited to their needs and priced fairly.Dover is 100 per cent ready for no-deal Brexit, says port chief executive\u0026nbspThe Port of Dover is 100 per cent ready for a no-deal Brexit, according to the port\u0027s boss, Doug Bannister.\u0026nbspHowever, he\u0026nbsptold Bloomberg\u0026nbspthat he still has no clarity on the rules of the game such as what documents will be needed for freight consignments\u0026nbspMr Bannister also conceded that he was anticipating\u0026nbspdisruption: whether it’s a day, two days, a week, two weeks, a month, two months, nobody can really predict”.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThomas Cook in race to find £200m to stave off collapse\u0026nbspThomas Cook is\u0026nbspon the brink of administration after the tour operator\u0027s lenders demanded that it finds\u0026nbsp£200m in extra funding.\u0026nbspThe company said it was in talks with stakeholders to secure the required funds, including Chinese firm Fosun which injected £450m last month.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0027s travel correspondent, Simon Calder, explains how people who have booked holidays with Thomas Cook might be affected:\u0026nbspThomas Cook: How will holidaymakers be affected if the travel company collapses?\u0026nbspRBS appoints Alison Rose as chief executive\u0026nbspRBS has confirmed the appointment of Alison Rose as chief executive. Ms Rose will become the first chief executive of a major British high street bank when she replaces outgoing boss Ross McEwan on 31 October.\u0026nbspRBS will also be the only FTSE 100 company with women in its top two positions. Katie Murray is the lender\u0027s chief financial officer.\u0026nbspMs Rose, who is currently chief executive of RBS\u0027 commercial and private banking ision, as well as deputy CEO of NatWest,\u0026nbsphad been widely tipped for the top job.Good morning and welcome to The Independent\u0027s live coverage of business and economics events around the world.\u0026nbspThe pound has added to the gains it made yesterday as hopes grow that a no-deal Brexit can be avoided.\u0026nbspSterling is up 0.33 per cent against the dollar this morning to $1.257 and up 0.17 per cent against the euro to €1.136.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It is particularly unacceptable that children growing up in the poorest areas of the country and children with special educational needs are most likely to leave school without reaching basic levels of attainment,” Anne Longfield, the children’s commissioner for England, said.The commissioner has written to the Department for Education and asked it to commit to halving the number of children failing to gain a Level 2 qualification by the age of 19 over the next five years.Climate change and mental illness among ‘biggest threats’ to childrenLast year, of the total 554,938 education leavers, 98,779 did not achieve this qualification by age 19.“The government must urgently investigate why the progress that has been made over recent years in closing the attainment gap has stalled and now going backwards,” Ms Longfield added.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

That includes new features like improved multi-tasking, a re-designed home screen and more.When the new iPhone update arrivesThis is the first year that Apple has split the operating systems for iPhone and iPad into separate releases, with the latter being referred to as iPadOS. That has presumably allowed the company to more easily stagger the different releases.And it will not be until 30 September that Apple TV gets its own software update, too. That update, named tvOS 13, will bring support for multiple users as well as the ability to use Xbox and PS4 controllers with Apple\u0027s set-top box.Apple presumably could not delay the release of iOS 13 for iPhones in the same way as the Apple TV and iPad because the iPhone 11 and iPhone 11 Pro will be released this week, and they needed a stable version of the new software to ship on them.The company did unveil a new iPad at its September event, when the new iPhones were shown off, but that device will not ship until 30 September.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 467 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.567 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1367 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1467 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1767 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2167 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2767 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2967 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3167 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3667 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4367 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. The record frequently switches in tone: Banks can be both formidable and vulnerable, accusatory or filled with regret. “Gimme” demands sex and refuses to be shamed for it “Contaminated” mourns a toxic relationship that can’t be saved and “Stroke” is a bitter riposte to a man emulating the Greek figure Narcissus – laid over a funk guitar riff.4567 Mini Mansions – Guy Walks into a BarMikey Shuman shares vocal duties with Tyler Parkford his voice falls somewhere between the sleazy drawl of his QOTSA bandmate Josh Homme and Alex Turner’s more adenoidal tone on opener “We Should Be Dancing”. With tracks that frequently dart from sprawling, psychedelic pop to scuzzy post-punk and rock references, the record has a superb dynamic that holds the listener’s attention, while the band navigate through a single, tumultuous relationship. By the end of all that, you feel like they deserve a pint. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Hackman’s debut album, 2015’s We Slept At Last, was a gentle, unprovocative affair –  though if you listened closely, the dark, sexual energy that convulses through her current sound was already there. Her second, I’m Not Your Man, was scuzzier and more explicitly queer – a road she continues down with Any Human Friend, a blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals.Frontman Corey Taylor, who had just emerged from a toxic relationship when recording this album, addresses feelings of belittlement and inadequacy with unflinching honesty and some of his best vocal work in years. Over the Celtic influences of “Solway Firth” (at one point, he seems to attempt some Cockney screamo) he issues a blistering riposte to the people he holds responsible for his negative mindset.There’s an increased anxiety, both corporeal and emotional, running through The Center Won’t Hold, a pent-up desire to break free from something – though they never seem quite sure what. “Disconnect me from my bones, so I can float, so I can roam,” sings Brownstein – her singular voice all yelps and creaks – on “Hurry On Home”. On “Reach Out”, Tucker begs, her voice a little sleeker than Brownstein’s but no less commanding, “Reach out and see me, I’m losing my head.” Quietly discordant piano ballad “Broken” pays tribute to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused supreme court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault: “Me, me too, my body cried out when she spoke those lines.”The overarching sound, production and instrumentation on Eve are outstanding. Produced by Rapsody’s long-time collaborator and mentor 9th Wonder, the record samples cuts from Herbie Hancock’s “Watermelon Man” (“Whoopi”) and Phil Collins’s “In the Air Tonight” (“Cleo”), offers a smooth R\u0026ampB joint with “Aaliyah” featuring the late singer’s ghostly backing vocals, and includes an interlude that is “an ode to the black woman’s body”. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as closer “Afeni”, are pure soul.  Swift has a habit of putting her worst foot forward. The album’s lead single, “Me!”, is peppy and poppy in all the wrong ways, a rictus grin of a song that rings hollow. Thank goodness that the rest of the album is nothing like that. Perky opening track “Forgot That You Existed” is a syncopated snigger, on which Swift shrugs off old grudges and breathes a sigh of relief in doing so. “Something magical happened one night,” she sings. “I forgot that you existed. And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn’t.” The title track, meanwhile, is poignant and unfussy, a reminder of Swift’s ability to distil infatuation into something specific and universal. (Alexandra Pollard)One could argue that there’s too much eclecticism here – that if this really is Crow’s final LP, she perhaps could have gone for something with a more singular sound. But then it wouldn’t be a Sheryl Crow album. She sings about the fear of the unknown on “Flying Blind” – her steely determination on this record has you believing that she’ll take the leap regardless. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)There’s more of a soul influence here – “HER Love”, the counterpoint to his 1994 track “I Used to Love HER”,  benefits from the gospel-like vocals of Daniel Caesar and Dwele, while “Memories of Home” skitters over a muffled bass and Common’s recollections of his past – including an incident where he was molested by a family member.This is Del Rey at her most assertive – personally, if not politically. Those hoping for a barbed protest record in keeping with Del Rey’s newfound public activism (last year she called President Trump a “narcissist” who “believes it’s OK to grab a woman by the pussy just because he’s famous”) will be disappointed. But it is gratifying to hear her take control. Aside from “Happiness Is a Butterfly”, that is. “If he’s a serial killer, then what’s the worst that can happen to a girl who’s already hurt?” she asks. Crikey.Assisted by veteran producer John Congleton (St Vincent, John Grant), he channels the spirit of David Bowie and Iggy Pop. He screeches over distorted “ooh oohs” via The Rolling Stones’s “Sympathy for the Devil” on opener “Calm Down aka I Should Not Be Alone”. “Transition from Nowhere to Nowhere” is sung in a Ziggy Stardust croon, while “Rated R Crusaders” shows Furman exploring his Jewish identity in the era of the IsraelPalestine conflict.If Brothers, their brawny album from 2010, turned the pair into serious rock contenders, then 2011’s El Camino cemented their reputation. Yet neither can claim to be as fiendishly catchy as Let’s Rock, a record that can scarcely sit still. On opener “Shine a Light”, the riffs are big, the momentum irresistible, with frontmanguitarist Dan Auerbach layering scabrous licks over ACDC-like chords. Backing singers Leisa Hans and Ashley Wilcoxson add texture to the grooving “LoHi”, while the languid “Sit Around and Miss You” is Stealers Wheels by way of the Deep South. Listen to the melodic harmonies in “Tell Me Lies” and it’s not just the lyrics that’ll remind you of Fleetwood Mac. The tones here are stark and bleak, compared to the claustrophobia of 2014’s Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes. You can hear his paranoia in the stuttering techno opener “Traffic”, which channels the heady grooves and pulses of electronic artist Floating Points (who, with his neuroscience background, seems like an entirely fitting reference point).There are plenty of surprises, like Swizz Beats singing on “Who Are You” against elegant violins that recall a Kamasi Washington composition. “Adult Film” features a gorgeous piano riff the Pete Rock-produced “The Art of It” has a delicious funk vibe “It Never Ends” comes full circle via a bright piano loop. Where a full album produced by Kanye West (2018’s Nasir) didn’t pan out – perhaps because West’s perfectionism was a bad fit for Nas’s penchant for procrastination – “You Mean the World to Me” sounds like it would have been a standout on that record had it not been abandoned on the cutting-room floor. Now it’s a standout on this album. For all the album’s eccentricities, the vibe is earnest fairytale rather than tongue-in-cheek – save for the sound of a strangled feline mirroring the lyrics “when you stepped on your cat” on “How Many Times”. Epic highlight “Electric Fire” and celestial album-closer “How Can a Head” capture Coyne at his most wistful. The latter is a wide-eyed, strings-laden gem, its childlike, questing lyrics poignant whatever your age. 5967 Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsGiven our current preoccupation with the Eighties, you could argue that Lost Girls is hardly breaking new ground – and yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. Three of her past albums have been nominated for Mercurys expect this to make it four. (Patrick Smith)6067 MUNA – Saves the WorldMUNA might not be a household name yet, but their influence runs through the charts like a stick of rock these days. Listen to Katy Perry’s summer smash “Never Really Over”, or Taylor Swift’s feminist clap back “The Man”, and you’ll hear the same dense, sticky synths and brawny beats that the emo-pop trio have been honing for the past three years. Their debut album, 2017’s About U, was raw, poignant and just the ride side of melodramatic, queering the mainstream, one sad-pop anthem at a time.6167 Pixies – Beneath the EyrieTales of witchy curses (“On Graveyard Hill”) and spirit reincarnation (“Daniel Boone”) feel like they’ve been dug up from ancient folklore, and capture classic-Pixies menace and ghoulish spirit. Over the album’s 12 tracks, ghostly organs and minor-key guitar-picked sequences help to conjure this dark, Gothic vibe. Yet for all its darkness, Beneath the Eyrie is brimming with the kind of melody that we expect from these indie-rock giants from the late Eighties. “Ready for Love” is a melancholy ballad with harmonising vocals from bassist Paz Lenchantin (Kim Deal’s now-permanent replacement), while lead single “Catfish Kate” – a tale of a woman battling a catfish in a river told by Black Jack Hooligan – is a rock hit in waiting. (Elisa Bray)6267 Jenny Hval – The Practice of LoveThis endlessly fascinating artist’s seventh, full-length, album The Practice of Love is just as considered as 2016\u0027s Blood Bitch, examining one’s role in humankind and on Earth, and probing that favourite of pop-song themes: love. But where the 2017 Nordic Music Prize-winning Blood Bitch was packed with visceral imagery and disarming sonics, the themes of The Practice of Love are encased in a warm cocoon of poetry, blissed-out circling synths and trance-like Nineties beats. (Elisa Bray)This is nomy at their most ambitious and pleasurably weird. As with the dreamy “Upset My Girlfriend”, which speaks of a man about to propose to his partner despite the fight they’re in, it’s an album stranded somewhere between pure joy and unexplainable sadness like slapping on a false smile despite feeling miserable, and recognising how much it helps in the moment. (Adam White)Listening on headphones, I was reminded of the late French designer Janet Laverriere. Born in 1909, she was still a powerful, playful force when I interviewed her for this paper in her eighties. She banged a cast iron radiator with a spoon to celebrate the echoes and curves of essential pipework: “I put all the hard plumbing on the outside. In kitchens, in bathrooms, I am feminist, evidemment!”Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Why Me? Why Not. is enjoyably defiant, Gallagher embodying a settled and contented aura. “Gotta live for something besides yesterdays,” Gallagher snarls on “Be Still”. The downbeat “Once” forgoes easy Noel-bashing for a mournful glance at the years when the pair were still speaking (“I remember how you used to shine back then... but you only get to do it once”). And “Now That I’ve Found You” is even somewhat sickly-sweet in tone, a cheery tribute to his daughter Molly, whom he met for the first time when she was 21. “I know it’s late for lullabies, but the future is yours and mine,” he sings, alongside upbeat whoops and Radio 2-friendly guitars.The album takes a deep, contemplative breath on “Short and Sweet”, which is exactly what it promises, a Grace Jones-like ballad on which Howard’s voice takes precedent over inconspicuous guitar, and the background hisses like an old vinyl. On “He Loves Me”, she grapples with maintaining a relationship with God when she’s long since stopped going to church.  It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 467 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.567 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1367 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1467 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1767 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2167 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Comprising songs from Segall’s eclectic (that’s putting it lightly) catalogue and performed by him and the Freedom Band (Mikal Cronin, Charles Moothart, Emmett Kelly, and Ben Boye), the album is delightfully short and sweet. It is certainly a drastic switch-up from Freedom’s Goblin (2018), which had 19 tracks and ran for 75 minutes.If you want to know how hard it is to categorise Titanic Rising – the enthralling fourth album from Weyes Blood – look no further than the American musician’s own attempt to do so. It is, she says, “The Kinks meet the Second World War, or Bob Seger meets Enya.”Tension aside, there’s a great sense of fun here. The title track is pure euphoria, as restless synths of a Utah Saints or Orbital rave break into swelling bass and melody. And they create the full club experience with “Got to Keep On”, on which the four-to-the-floor beat, funky rhythm guitar, sweet backing vocals and chiming bells make way for the simple sounds of happy party-goers just as the anticipation builds, so does the instrumentation into a hypnotic crescendo. It’s masterful production. (Elisa Bray)Six months after the release of Oxnard, Anderson .Paak returns with another Dr Dre-produced record, Ventura. Where the former was overflowing with choppy, experimental sounds, guest appearances and clumsy attempts at Gil Scott Heron-esque revolutionary lyrics, the sequel – recorded around the same time – streamlines .Paak’s sound, making for a tightly packaged, melodic and danceable album.Two years after the release of his Mercury Prize-nominated debut Yesterday’s Gone, the south London hip-hop artist unveils its follow-up, Not Waving, But Drowning. And if any two records could portray how quickly someone can grow from a boy to a man, it’s these.2767 Lizzo – Cuz I Love YouNo one could accuse Lizzo of holding back. Not when it comes to her voice – which is raw and rowdy, so laden with personality even the vulnerable moments are a joy to listen to –  and certainly not when it comes to her message of unabashed self-love. That’s the predominant theme of the singer  rapper  flautist-extraordinaire’s hugely likeable third album, Cuz I Love You.It seems as likely as Old Man Steptoe dining with the Rees-Mogg, but this new tactic of burying their confrontational gruesomeness beneath a veneer of alt-rock respectability for album three works well for Fat White Family. Drenched in chamber strings and celestial harmonies, the plush yet sinister “Oh Sebastian” could be Pet Sounds selling its soul to the devil. “Fringe Runner” is so sleek and funksome it could be a New Romantic “White Lines (Don’t Don’t Do It)” “Kim’s Sunsets” is a piece of refined cosmic reggae resembling a blissed-out “Bankrobber”.2967 Cage the Elephant – Social CuesOn Cage the Elephant’s fifth album, Social Cues, frontman Matt Shultz reacts to the breakdown of his marriage and the loss of three close friends. He undergoes a kind of Jekyll and Hyde transition through the 13 tracks, the result of which is the band’s best work to date.SOAK reaches to outsiders once again on her new album. 3167 The Cranberries – In the EndThere’s a cruel irony that the release of The Cranberries’ final album should come just a week after journalist Lyra McKee was shot dead by the New IRA during a riot in Londonderry. “Zombie” was a protest song written by the band’s late frontwoman Dolores O’Riordan after two children were killed by IRA bombs – was released. She was deeply affected by the deaths, and would no doubt have been devastated by recent events in Northern Ireland as well.On her third record, Aldous Harding combines the gothic folk of her self-titled 2014 debut with the dramatically intimate tones of her follow-up album Party.Big Thief’s frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has an uncanny ability to make you feel like you’re in on a secret. Her whispering, spectral delivery and deeply personal lyrics are the key to this. Even on the band’s third album UFOF, with an audience that has grown exponentially in the past few years, the songs are still immensely intimate affairs.On his debut album, the 24-year-old Collard mixes sultry jams that recall the electronic funk of MGMT with nods to the greats: Prince, James Brown, Led Zeppelin and Marvin Gaye. Throughout, Collard exhibits his extraordinary voice, which swoops to a devilishly low murmur or soars to an ecstatic falsetto.   Dedicated covers the full, but generic, spectrum of relationships: dizzying love, lust, and break-ups. But whether she’s pining for the return of a former love in the funky disco banger “Julien”, or singing about masturbating post-break-up in lead single “Party For One” (“I’ll be the one If you don’t care about me Making love to myself Back on my beat”), the vibe remains positively jubilant.Getty Images for Spotify3667 Tyler, the Creator - IGOR“I don’t know where I’m going,” Tyler, the Creator begins on the song “I THINK”. “But I know what I’m showing.” The US artist’s words ring true throughout his fifth studio album, IGOR, where he adopts the dark and twisted mutterings of the Frankenstein character from which the record gets its name. It’s been a long wait for Flying Lotus’s new album. In fact, the LA producer has been masterminding Flamagra for the past five years – snatching moments between collaborating with Kendrick Lamar on To Pimp a Butterfly, directing and writing the comic horror movie Kuso, producing much of Thundercat’s Drunk and growing his Brainfeeder label.A heftier sound is never at the cost of melody, which shines through in Thomson’s vocals, the rest of the band’s backing falsetto, and the searing blues grooves stamped all over Future Dust. Those qualities are captured nowhere more satisfyingly than on “25”. “All Over Town” is their singalong anthem, neatly positioned in the middle to ease the pace.In keeping with the relatively restrained guest spots, it’s heartening just how much Skepta has rejected overloading Ignorance is Bliss with high-profile producers, preferring instead to burrow into his own aesthetic. There’s no attempt to chase someone else’s wave here no token drill, afroswing or trap beats to satisfy playlist algorithms. Instead, his cold grime sonics are rendered down to their no-frills essentials – brutalist blocks of sad angular melodies and hard, spacious drums.Bruce Springsteen seems to have told almost every tale in the grand old storybook of American mythologies, except perhaps one: a wide-eyed Californian dreamer finds the Golden State turns sour and flees back east, to some romantic speck of a town, to pine and rehabilitate. It’s the classic pop plotline of Bacharach and David’s “Do You Know the Way to San Jose?”, and it’s a tale Springsteen taps repeatedly here, on his sumptuous, cinematic 19th album, which is nothing short of a late-period masterpiece.A revolving door of female vocalists (A-listers, indie darlings like Angel Olsen and unsung songwriters) deliver heartbroken lines over big, shiny beats and synths. The emotional cohesion the record loses in its shifting cast of singerssongwritersgenres it makes up in DJ-savvy textural variety. Help Us Stranger reaches all corners of guitar rock: funky Detroit garage (“What’s Yours Is Mine”) country soul (“Somedays (I Don’t Feel Like Trying)”) psych (a cover of Donovan’s “Hey Gyp (Dig the Slowness)”) blues and bluegrass (“Thoughts and Prayers”). A cornucopia of instrumentation is woven into its brisk 42-minute yarn.4367 Hot Chip - A Bath Full of EcstasyWhen Hot Chip achieved chart success with their second album, 2006’s The Warning, it seemed more like a happy coincidence than a sign they were conforming to current pop trends. Since then, they\u0027ve released a string of consistently great albums, from 2008’s Made in the Dark (featuring their only Top 10 single to date, “Ready for the Floor”) to this, their seventh and best record, A Bath Full of Ecstasy. The record frequently switches in tone: Banks can be both formidable and vulnerable, accusatory or filled with regret. “Gimme” demands sex and refuses to be shamed for it “Contaminated” mourns a toxic relationship that can’t be saved and “Stroke” is a bitter riposte to a man emulating the Greek figure Narcissus – laid over a funk guitar riff.4567 Mini Mansions – Guy Walks into a BarMikey Shuman shares vocal duties with Tyler Parkford his voice falls somewhere between the sleazy drawl of his QOTSA bandmate Josh Homme and Alex Turner’s more adenoidal tone on opener “We Should Be Dancing”. With tracks that frequently dart from sprawling, psychedelic pop to scuzzy post-punk and rock references, the record has a superb dynamic that holds the listener’s attention, while the band navigate through a single, tumultuous relationship. By the end of all that, you feel like they deserve a pint. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Hackman’s debut album, 2015’s We Slept At Last, was a gentle, unprovocative affair –  though if you listened closely, the dark, sexual energy that convulses through her current sound was already there. Her second, I’m Not Your Man, was scuzzier and more explicitly queer – a road she continues down with Any Human Friend, a blunt, bold album on which Hackman’s beatific voice sits atop methodically messy instrumentals.Frontman Corey Taylor, who had just emerged from a toxic relationship when recording this album, addresses feelings of belittlement and inadequacy with unflinching honesty and some of his best vocal work in years. Over the Celtic influences of “Solway Firth” (at one point, he seems to attempt some Cockney screamo) he issues a blistering riposte to the people he holds responsible for his negative mindset.There’s an increased anxiety, both corporeal and emotional, running through The Center Won’t Hold, a pent-up desire to break free from something – though they never seem quite sure what. “Disconnect me from my bones, so I can float, so I can roam,” sings Brownstein – her singular voice all yelps and creaks – on “Hurry On Home”. On “Reach Out”, Tucker begs, her voice a little sleeker than Brownstein’s but no less commanding, “Reach out and see me, I’m losing my head.” Quietly discordant piano ballad “Broken” pays tribute to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused supreme court judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault: “Me, me too, my body cried out when she spoke those lines.”The overarching sound, production and instrumentation on Eve are outstanding. Produced by Rapsody’s long-time collaborator and mentor 9th Wonder, the record samples cuts from Herbie Hancock’s “Watermelon Man” (“Whoopi”) and Phil Collins’s “In the Air Tonight” (“Cleo”), offers a smooth R\u0026ampB joint with “Aaliyah” featuring the late singer’s ghostly backing vocals, and includes an interlude that is “an ode to the black woman’s body”. As on Laila’s Wisdom, Eve conveys Rapsody’s natural feel for funk – “Michelle” (Obama) bounces in on a jaunty piano riff – but other tracks, such as closer “Afeni”, are pure soul.  Swift has a habit of putting her worst foot forward. The album’s lead single, “Me!”, is peppy and poppy in all the wrong ways, a rictus grin of a song that rings hollow. Thank goodness that the rest of the album is nothing like that. Perky opening track “Forgot That You Existed” is a syncopated snigger, on which Swift shrugs off old grudges and breathes a sigh of relief in doing so. “Something magical happened one night,” she sings. “I forgot that you existed. And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn’t.” The title track, meanwhile, is poignant and unfussy, a reminder of Swift’s ability to distil infatuation into something specific and universal. (Alexandra Pollard)One could argue that there’s too much eclecticism here – that if this really is Crow’s final LP, she perhaps could have gone for something with a more singular sound. But then it wouldn’t be a Sheryl Crow album. She sings about the fear of the unknown on “Flying Blind” – her steely determination on this record has you believing that she’ll take the leap regardless. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)There’s more of a soul influence here – “HER Love”, the counterpoint to his 1994 track “I Used to Love HER”,  benefits from the gospel-like vocals of Daniel Caesar and Dwele, while “Memories of Home” skitters over a muffled bass and Common’s recollections of his past – including an incident where he was molested by a family member.This is Del Rey at her most assertive – personally, if not politically. Those hoping for a barbed protest record in keeping with Del Rey’s newfound public activism (last year she called President Trump a “narcissist” who “believes it’s OK to grab a woman by the pussy just because he’s famous”) will be disappointed. But it is gratifying to hear her take control. Aside from “Happiness Is a Butterfly”, that is. “If he’s a serial killer, then what’s the worst that can happen to a girl who’s already hurt?” she asks. Crikey.Assisted by veteran producer John Congleton (St Vincent, John Grant), he channels the spirit of David Bowie and Iggy Pop. He screeches over distorted “ooh oohs” via The Rolling Stones’s “Sympathy for the Devil” on opener “Calm Down aka I Should Not Be Alone”. “Transition from Nowhere to Nowhere” is sung in a Ziggy Stardust croon, while “Rated R Crusaders” shows Furman exploring his Jewish identity in the era of the IsraelPalestine conflict.If Brothers, their brawny album from 2010, turned the pair into serious rock contenders, then 2011’s El Camino cemented their reputation. Yet neither can claim to be as fiendishly catchy as Let’s Rock, a record that can scarcely sit still. On opener “Shine a Light”, the riffs are big, the momentum irresistible, with frontmanguitarist Dan Auerbach layering scabrous licks over ACDC-like chords. Backing singers Leisa Hans and Ashley Wilcoxson add texture to the grooving “LoHi”, while the languid “Sit Around and Miss You” is Stealers Wheels by way of the Deep South. Listen to the melodic harmonies in “Tell Me Lies” and it’s not just the lyrics that’ll remind you of Fleetwood Mac. The tones here are stark and bleak, compared to the claustrophobia of 2014’s Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes. You can hear his paranoia in the stuttering techno opener “Traffic”, which channels the heady grooves and pulses of electronic artist Floating Points (who, with his neuroscience background, seems like an entirely fitting reference point).There are plenty of surprises, like Swizz Beats singing on “Who Are You” against elegant violins that recall a Kamasi Washington composition. “Adult Film” features a gorgeous piano riff the Pete Rock-produced “The Art of It” has a delicious funk vibe “It Never Ends” comes full circle via a bright piano loop. Where a full album produced by Kanye West (2018’s Nasir) didn’t pan out – perhaps because West’s perfectionism was a bad fit for Nas’s penchant for procrastination – “You Mean the World to Me” sounds like it would have been a standout on that record had it not been abandoned on the cutting-room floor. Now it’s a standout on this album. For all the album’s eccentricities, the vibe is earnest fairytale rather than tongue-in-cheek – save for the sound of a strangled feline mirroring the lyrics “when you stepped on your cat” on “How Many Times”. Epic highlight “Electric Fire” and celestial album-closer “How Can a Head” capture Coyne at his most wistful. The latter is a wide-eyed, strings-laden gem, its childlike, questing lyrics poignant whatever your age. 5967 Bat for Lashes – Lost GirlsGiven our current preoccupation with the Eighties, you could argue that Lost Girls is hardly breaking new ground – and yes, nostalgia is a fairly generic formula. But listened to as a whole, the album positively thrums with sonic invention, managing to feel both fresh and full of intrigue. Khan once again demonstrates a knack for uncanny storytelling. Three of her past albums have been nominated for Mercurys expect this to make it four. (Patrick Smith)6067 MUNA – Saves the WorldMUNA might not be a household name yet, but their influence runs through the charts like a stick of rock these days. Listen to Katy Perry’s summer smash “Never Really Over”, or Taylor Swift’s feminist clap back “The Man”, and you’ll hear the same dense, sticky synths and brawny beats that the emo-pop trio have been honing for the past three years. Their debut album, 2017’s About U, was raw, poignant and just the ride side of melodramatic, queering the mainstream, one sad-pop anthem at a time.6167 Pixies – Beneath the EyrieTales of witchy curses (“On Graveyard Hill”) and spirit reincarnation (“Daniel Boone”) feel like they’ve been dug up from ancient folklore, and capture classic-Pixies menace and ghoulish spirit. Over the album’s 12 tracks, ghostly organs and minor-key guitar-picked sequences help to conjure this dark, Gothic vibe. Yet for all its darkness, Beneath the Eyrie is brimming with the kind of melody that we expect from these indie-rock giants from the late Eighties. “Ready for Love” is a melancholy ballad with harmonising vocals from bassist Paz Lenchantin (Kim Deal’s now-permanent replacement), while lead single “Catfish Kate” – a tale of a woman battling a catfish in a river told by Black Jack Hooligan – is a rock hit in waiting. (Elisa Bray)6267 Jenny Hval – The Practice of LoveThis endlessly fascinating artist’s seventh, full-length, album The Practice of Love is just as considered as 2016\u0027s Blood Bitch, examining one’s role in humankind and on Earth, and probing that favourite of pop-song themes: love. But where the 2017 Nordic Music Prize-winning Blood Bitch was packed with visceral imagery and disarming sonics, the themes of The Practice of Love are encased in a warm cocoon of poetry, blissed-out circling synths and trance-like Nineties beats. (Elisa Bray)This is nomy at their most ambitious and pleasurably weird. As with the dreamy “Upset My Girlfriend”, which speaks of a man about to propose to his partner despite the fight they’re in, it’s an album stranded somewhere between pure joy and unexplainable sadness like slapping on a false smile despite feeling miserable, and recognising how much it helps in the moment. (Adam White)Listening on headphones, I was reminded of the late French designer Janet Laverriere. Born in 1909, she was still a powerful, playful force when I interviewed her for this paper in her eighties. She banged a cast iron radiator with a spoon to celebrate the echoes and curves of essential pipework: “I put all the hard plumbing on the outside. In kitchens, in bathrooms, I am feminist, evidemment!”Fender drew plenty of early comparisons to Bruce Springsteen – on Hypersonic Missiles they’re entirely warranted, as much for the instrumentation as the lyricism and his vignettes of working-class struggle. There are sax solos (more than one), and pounding rhythms that make you want to jump in a car and drive down a highway at sunset, and blistering electric guitars next to classic troubadour acoustics. He has Springsteen’s rousing holler, and the early indications of someone who could be the voice of a generation – not because he wants to be, but because he sees things and understands. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)Why Me? Why Not. is enjoyably defiant, Gallagher embodying a settled and contented aura. “Gotta live for something besides yesterdays,” Gallagher snarls on “Be Still”. The downbeat “Once” forgoes easy Noel-bashing for a mournful glance at the years when the pair were still speaking (“I remember how you used to shine back then... but you only get to do it once”). And “Now That I’ve Found You” is even somewhat sickly-sweet in tone, a cheery tribute to his daughter Molly, whom he met for the first time when she was 21. “I know it’s late for lullabies, but the future is yours and mine,” he sings, alongside upbeat whoops and Radio 2-friendly guitars.The album takes a deep, contemplative breath on “Short and Sweet”, which is exactly what it promises, a Grace Jones-like ballad on which Howard’s voice takes precedent over inconspicuous guitar, and the background hisses like an old vinyl. On “He Loves Me”, she grapples with maintaining a relationship with God when she’s long since stopped going to church.  In its five-star review of the album The Independent said: “A talented pianist as well as a rapper and singer, Dave often spits over discordant chords to amplify the urgency of his chosen subject, or else raps in gruff, assertive tones across an emotional sequence that complements his stoic intensity.“On “Environment”, he talks about the conflict between what people see of his apparently glamorous life, and the reality behind the scenes where the blood and sweat is drawn out of him. He’s put everything into this album.”Dave is the figurehead for a hopeful generation on his debut albumDave made his acting debut in the third series of Top Boy, which was released in September 2019 on Netflix. He appeared at Glastonbury Festival in June, performing with headliner Stormzy and also for his own set on the Other Stage.Albums by British and Irish artists with a UK release date between 21 July 2018 and 19 July 2019 were eligible for nomination, with more than 200 submitted.The judges for this year’s prize were: BBC Radio 1 DJ Annie Mac, Clara Amfo, Danielle Perry (broadcaster \u0026amp writer), Gaz Coombes, Jamie Cullum, Jeff Smith (head of music, 6 Music \u0026amp Radio 2), Jorja Smith, Mike Walsh (head of music, Radio X), Phil Alexander (creative director, Kerrang!contributing editor, Mojo), Stormzy, Tshepo Mokoena (editorial director, Vice), Will Hodgkinson (chief rock \u0026amp pop critic, The Times).

Analysis of a 74-year-old\u0026nbspA.\u0026nbspsligoi\u0026nbspspecimen that once lived at London Zoo revealed its distinct genetic code and it is this species that is thought to be the largest of the three.Sixteen other specimens collected in the early 20th century were also examined.“It’s amazing in this day and age that it took until now to work out what the world’s largest amphibian is,” the study’s lead author Samuel Turvey, a conservation scientist at ZSL, told National Geographic.Created with Sketch.Science news in pictures Show all 20Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.120 Turtle embryos influence sex by shakingThe sex of the turtle is determined by the temperatures at which they are incubated.

The tallest of the skeletons uncovered measured at 1.9mGiant salamanders, which typically live in rocky, mountainous river systems, were once widespread across central, southern and eastern China.Scientists concluded that Chinese giant salamanders erged into three distinct species between 3.1 and 2.4 million years ago, which coincides with a period of mountain formation when the Tibetan plateau rose rapidly.But their meat is considered a delicacy in China and they have historically been used for medicinal purposes, which has created a vast farming industry. Habitat loss and poaching also pose severe threats.‘Frozen Dragon of the North’: New species of flying creature foundWhile millions are now kept on farms, these appear to overwhelmingly be members of the most common species, while wild populations are at great risk of extinction.“These findings come at a time where urgent interventions are required to save Chinese giant salamanders in the wild,” said Melissa Marr, a PhD researcher at the Natural History Museum.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Zookeepers hope to one day introduce another animal to Professor Lew as a mate.Scientists believe that in light of the recent study, published on Monday in Ecology and Evolution, future conservation efforts could\u0026nbspinvolve\u0026nbspscreening farmed giant salamanders to determine their species before encouraging them to mate and reintroducing\u0026nbspthem into the wild among their own species.Dr Turvey added:\u0026nbsp“We hope that this new understanding of their species ersity has arrived in time to support their successful conservation, but urgent measures are required to protect any viable giant salamander populations that might remain.”Additional reporting by PAShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Months ago, that was the date that a college student typed into a joke Facebook event, before writing the words that would go on to make it become a day of angst for the US military and residents who live near Area 51.Next to that date, a bored young man called Matty Roberts writes an event description that would propel the page to viral fame.“Storm Area 51, They Can’t Stop All of Us,” it read.Now that the day has arrived, the mission to “storm Area 51” looks very different than it did during that moment of excited viral fame. It went from an online joke, to something that prompted action from both the US military and Facebook, to a potential disaster for the people who are intending to turn up after all.The event began as a joke. That much was clear from the description, which referenced an anime character and suggested people would be able to outrun bullets.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month - August 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.When stars like the Sun grow advanced in age, they expand and glow red.

Lets see them aliens.”The page developed in the same comedic manner, playing host to a variety of jokes and memes that sarcastically riffed on aliens and the secrets of the government.Storm Area 51 event could be disaster, locals fearBut it very quickly became very serious indeed. As interest in the Facebook page grew, so did anxiety that some people might really try to break into the base – and US Air Force spokesperson\u0026nbspLaura McAndrews\u0026nbspwas one of a number of officials who\u0026nbspgave a stern warning to anyone who did.Ms McAndrews added: “The US Air Force always stands ready to protect America and its assets”.Last month, the event disappeared from Facebook. It wasn’t clear exactly why, and at the point it was removed more than two million people had indicated they would take part.It was particularly frustrating for organiser Mr Roberts because he had attempted to parlay the interest into a real event: the equally ill-fated Alienstock. Rather than raiding Area 51, that woud be a festival devoted to the culture that surrounds it, attempting to harness people’s interest in the moment into something organised and profitable, rather than potentially lethal.There are now three different major events planned, with a number of others likely. It’s not clear how many people will be arriving in Nevada to take part in them.Two of the main ones are now called Alienstock, after some confusion and disagreement between the people organising them. One will happen in Las Vegas, and appears to be something like a more traditional EDM festival the other is taking place in the tiny town of Rachel, Nevada, in the heart of Area 51-country.It’s that event in particular that has led locals to “prepare for the worst”. Rachel is a tiny town, with a population of around 54, which is only about twice the number of musical acts advertised as performing at the event.Last month, the town’s official website posted a warning indicating that the event has a “high potential to get ugly”. The town and the harsh desert that surrounds it has few places for anyone to stay, is subject to wildly fluctuating temperatures, is home to dangerous animals and the local area has no internet,\u0026nbspphone signal or credit card facilities.Those warnings are still continuing as the weekend begins. This week, local Joerg Arnu said that people did not know what they were getting themselves in for.“Those that know what to expect camping in the desert are going to have a good time,” Arnu said. “Those who are looking for a big party are going to be disappointed.”He predicts people showing up in the desert in shorts and flip-flops.“That doesn’t protect you against critters, snakes and scorpions,” Arnu said. “It will get cold at night. They’re not going to find what they’re looking for, and they are going to get angry.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Emily is the shadow foreign secretary, and should use language that reflects the importance of that role.”And Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman Chuka Umunna said Ms Thornberry should “withdraw her inappropriate remarks”.Mr Umunna said: “Language counts – comparing the Lib Dems to a murderous organision is no laughing matter.

In an apparent act of revenge, she was passed over for the stand-in slot when the leader was absent for prime minister’s questions.But she played down the snub, telling The House: “I’m pretty confident I’m doing it in the future. It was a decision for Jeremy and LOTO (leader of the opposition’s office) to decide, it wasn’t for me.”And she played down the significance of Labour deputy leader Tom Watson’s call for a second referendum before a general election, saying: “It’s just how he is, isn’t it? I haven’t seen him for a while … But he’s deputy leader and he can say what he wants.“Ms Thornberry recently got into difficulties on TV trying to explain Labour’s position on Brexit.But she defended the position, saying: “We are now wedded to having a second referendum because so much has changed since three years ago. The question then is what will the choice be. We don’t want to put these lousy Tory choices of no deal or Theresa May’s deal to the public. We want there to be two good choices.“I would say anything other than leaving the European Union is not a good choice but it would be second best. We need to have a choice that will look after jobs and the economy as best we can, which means being in the customs union and being close to the single market.“We’ve said we need, before we do finally leave, to have it confirmed with the public if they do want to leave, this is a way that makes sense, or we remain. It’s important that we’re clear about that, but I’m never going to be able to do anything other than campaign to Remain because I think we should be in the EU.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Friendship with the White HouseTrudeau\u0027s gender-balanced cabinet was the first of its kindMr Trudeau, 47, eldest son of the late prime minister Pierre Trudeau, and who was first elected premier in 2015, has been on the back foot since the first images emerged this week. They\u0026nbspshowed him with his face in dark make-up at a party at a school where he was teaching in 2001, aged\u0026nbsp29.The school yearbook picture, obtained by Time\u0026nbspmagazine, show him wearing a turban for an Arabian Nights-themed fancy dress party at the West Point Grey Academy in Vancouver.\u0026nbspThe prime minister, who launched his re-election campaign just a week ago, said he should have known better. “I’m pissed off at myself, I’m disappointed in myself,” Mr Trudeau told reporters.But on Thursday, the problem appeared to get worse for Mr Trudeau,\u0026nbspas other images of him in blackface emerged. Asked how many incidents there may have been, he replied: “I’m wary of being definitive about this because the recent pictures that came out I had not remembered.”He said he had already shared “the moments I recollected”, adding:\u0026nbsp“But I recognise that it is something absolutely unacceptable to do. And I appreciate calling it makeup, but it was blackface, and that is just not right.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Earlier this year, Virginia governor\u0026nbspRalph Northam faced repeated calls to stand down after a racist picture surfaced from his 1984 medical school yearbook. He did not do so.The episode is deeply embarrassing for Mr Trudeau and disappointing for his supporters. Despite his privileged background, he has long pitched himself as champion of the marginalised, and has promoted a number of women and ethnic minorities to his cabinet.To his admirers in the US, he has been the opposite of Donald Trump.Polls show Mr Trudeau’s Liberal Party\u0026nbspbeing pressed hard ahead of election day on 21\u0026nbspOctober. Conservative leader Andrew\u0026nbspScheer\u0026nbsphas said Mr Trudeau was “not fit to govern this country”.Asked on Thursday if he intended to stand aside as leader of the party, Mr Trudeau said he had spent much of the day speaking to colleagues and community leaders.\u0026nbspCan Trudeau survive blackface scandal when country heads to polls?Trudeau apologises as ‘racist’ brownface photo rocks Canadian politicsCanadian PM Justin Trudeau pictured wearing ‘brownface’ at 2001 party“I will continue to do the work that is necessary to keep us moving forward in the right way,” he said. “Canadians have an important choice to make on October\u0026nbsp21 and I trust Canadians to make that right choice.”Greg Fergus, a Liberal member of parliament who is black, said there was a lot of confusion and hurt in the black community but noted that the prime minister had apologised.He pointed out that it was Mr Trudeau who put Viola Desmond, a black woman who refused to leave the whites-only section of a Canadian movie theatre\u0026nbspin 1944, on Canada’s $10 bill.Mr Fergus added: “I think the real measure of the man, and I think the thing we need to be talking about, is all the amazing things we have done for ersity.”Mitzie Hunter, a Liberal who is running to lead the party in Ontario provincial politics and is black, tweeted: “I know it is not representative of the man he is. This is a teachable moment for all of us. I accept his apology and I hope Canadians do too.”Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The page, which encouraged people to “see them aliens” and suggested that enough people raid the base then they couldn’t be stopped, is bringing an unknown number of people to Nevada to take part in the event.Local officials have already signed emergency declarations in response to the event, and local residents warned people not to come. But the event is still likely to prove popular, leading people to take precautions against whatever might happen.“We are preparing for the worst,” said Joerg Arnu, a Rachel resident who could see from his home a makeshift stage and cluster of portable toilets in a dusty area recently scraped of brush surrounding West’s little motel and cafe.Created with Sketch.Best Nasa pictures of the month - August 2019 Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.When stars like the Sun grow advanced in age, they expand and glow red.

He’s also organised a radio-equipped night watch of neighbours, fearing there won’t be enough water, food, trash bins or toilets for visitors.“Those that know what to expect camping in the desert are going to have a good time,” Arnu said. “Those who are looking for a big party are going to be disappointed.”He predicts people showing up in the desert in shorts and flip-flops.“That doesn’t protect you against critters, snakes and scorpions,” Arnu said. “It will get cold at night.

Promoters began scouting sites. A beer company produced alien-themed cans. A Nevada brothel offered discounts to “E.T. enthusiasts.”The Federal Aviation Administration closed nearby air space this week.The U.S. Air Force has issued stern warnings for people not to approach the gates of the Nevada Test and Training Range, where Area 51 is located.Area 51 tested aircraft ranging from the U-2 in the 1950s to the B-2 stealth bomber in the 1980s. The government spent decades refusing to acknowledge the site even existed, before releasing documents confirming it in 2013. Its secrecy still fuels speculation that it’s where the government studies aliens.County lawmakers in Nye County, home to a conspicuously green establishment called the Area 51 Alien Center, are discouraging Earthlings from trying to find extraterrestrials there.“We’re taking precautions and checking the back roads,” Sheriff Sharon Wehrly said.Her deputies last week arrested two Dutch tourists attracted by “Storm Area 51.” The men pleaded guilty to trespassing at a secure U.S. site nowhere near Area 51 and promised to pay thousands in fines.Arnu said the military added razor wire to barbed cattle fencing on the Area 51 boundary near his home, installed more cameras and battery-powered lighting, and erected an imposing spike barrier just inside a gate. He noted a new sign telling trespassers they’ll be arrested and fined $1,000.Hundreds of law enforcement officers and medics will be on hand, along with the Nevada National Guard.Additional reporting by Associated PressShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Just type Area  into the fly to field and the map does the rest.After decades of government officials refusing to acknowledge Area , the CIA released declassied documents in  referring to the ,-sq minstallation by name and locating it on a map near the dry Groom Lake bed.It is a popular tourist destination.The base has been a testing ground for a host of top-secret aircraft, including the U- in the s and later the B- stealth bomber.For years the US government denied it even existed.But in  the CIA officially acknowledged its existence and its location was revealed.Declassied documents say it was originally an area for the Army Air Corp pilots to practise their aerial gunnery.During the Cold War, experimental aircraft, such as the high altitude U- spy plane, and weapons systems were tested there.Its current use is unknown and remains a top secret. The mysterious site is part of the vast Nevada Test and Training Range and has become the centre of UFO conspiracy theories.The so-called Roswell incident is one of the most discussed and controversial UFO theories in history.In July  the military sensationally announced in a press release it had found the remains of a crashed flying saucer in the desert.But the following day it retracted the statement, saying it was in fact a damaged US Air Force air balloon.Yet as reported, Sherf Jess Slaughter and Deputy Sherf Charles Fogus were on duty in a patrol car on the night of the alleged incident.Suddenly they heard reports of a crashed aircraft on their police radio.In the interview Mr Fogus claims he saw a flying saucer smash into the side of a river bed and that the flying object was “ft across”.Describing the scene, he said: “When we got there, the land was covered with soldiers. They were hauling a big, creature.“The bodies must have been  feet tall.“I saw the legs and feet on some of them. They looked like our feet.”As well as assessing alien technology it is often suggested that it is a place where meetings or joint undertakings with extraterrestrials occur.Other theories suggest it has served as a research site for a range of exotic weapons and technologies.This includes the development of time travel or teleportation technologyAnother theory is that the much rumoured Aurora stealth plane is being tested here.The most outlandish idea is that Area  is a base for a one world government.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I am fully aware, however, how the right-on conspiracy theories play out here.That is, I’m only saying this because The Mash Report goes against my own political prejudicesand am part of a right-wing media group trying to destroy the working-class via Brexit.The same right-wing media group that broke the Yellowhammer No Deal crisis story, off which The Mash Report has been leeching material all series.Above and beyond my own obvious desire to enslave the proletariat, through dumb quiz show answers, though, I am also a comedy fan, and the remarkable thing about the Brexit circus is that not once, in more than three years, has The Mash Report, Have I Got News For You, The Last Leg or Frankie Boyle’s New World Order said anything so funny it’s worth repeating.Hardly surprising really when, rather than being part of the comedy process, all of those shows are such an entrenched and slanted part of the left-of-centre political process they’ve all removed deserving Labour targets, like Diane Abbott, John McDonnell and Emily Thornberry, from any sort of firing line.It’s natural BBC Channel  bias and stupidity that’s led them to that sorry pass, I think, not orders from above.But the chances of those two networks ever changing their tone and playing fair Take the exact number of angry rants Nish Kumar’s aimed at Labour’s anti-Semites, on The Mash Report, multiply it by the number of times he’s mentioned the actual result of the Brexit referendum and your answer’s still zero.THE height of optimism  Britain’s Got Talent: The Champions host Ant McPartlin announcing: “We’ll be back with the winners of Holland’s Got Talent . See you in a few minutes.”Remarkably, though, they did, and I quickly regretted the decision, as even Simon Cowell had lost patience with the process by then and was taking it all out on some Dutch dance troupe called Fire.“It lacked imagination and creativity.

There is a huge lobbying operation to try to persuade us all to go cashless and use only electronic forms of payments.Already, some fashionable bars and restaurants advertise themselves as cashless.Sainsbury’s recently opened a store where the only way to pay was via a smartphone app — though it was rapidly forced to change its policy when confused shoppers jammed the helpdesk.Little known to most people, David Cameron nearly announced in his  Conservative Party conference speech that Britain would become the world’s first entirely cashless society by .He only pulled back when advisers warned that the public was not ready for such a move.Too right we are not ready to have cash snatched from our wallets and be forced to pay for everything with cards or smartphones. And I hope we never will be.I have nothing against electronic forms of payment, when we choose to use them.I do plenty of shopping online and often choose to pay by card in shops, too.But the right to use cash is a vital freedomwe are to avoid being exploited.I am sick of being told that going cashless is for my convenience. No, it isn’t.It is for the enrichment of some very powerful financial interests who have been furiously lobbying governments to abolish cash.In , investors worldwide put billioninto the financial technology — or fintech — industry.Why  In the expectation of huge rewards.According to the Boston Consulting Group, the industry currently earns trilliona year in revenue — such as fees when we use our credit card or download a payment app on to our phone.By , it expects that to DOUBLE.No prizes for guessing where that extra trillion is going to be coming from — you and me.It might be free for consumers to use a debit card now, but you can be sure it won’t bethe option of paying by cash is abolished.Another reason the industry wants to force us to go cashless is to sell data on our shopping habits.When we buy things with cash, we are anonymous. But when we spend on our cards, our spending can be tracked.Visa, Mastercard and ­American Express have already set up subsidiaries to monetise this data and flog it for marketing purposes.While some stand to make fortunes, the victims of an increasingly cashless economy are the poor and elderly, who find their lives made ever more dficult.Hard though it may be for some of us to believe, when a cashless London transport system was being discussed it emerged that ten per cent of the passengers do not have a bank account.It is not easy to open an accountyou do not have a fixed address and cannot produce things such as utility bills. How are such people supposed to cope in a cashless society There are some things — such as parking in certain towns — which can now only be done by smartphone app.That might make sense to young, educated policymakers in Whitehall and council officials who have grown up with the devices and find that using them is second nature.Yet surprising though it may seem to some, . per cent of the population has never used the internet.Four in five over-s do not own a smartphone, and with good reason.Even without arthritis or serious problems with my vision, I find the devices extremely fiddly to use.I struggle to read what is on the screen and I often find my phone battery has run down by the end of the day.I wouldn’t want to be without a phone, but even less would I want to be reliant on it as my electronic wallet.When the Cameron government was seriously considering turning Britain cashless, one of the reasons mentioned was that it would help tackle crime on the grounds it is supposedly harder for criminals to handle electronic money, as it can be traced.But try telling that to the many victims of online scams who lost a collective £.billion last year in Britain.Just because electronic transfers are theoretically traceable doesn’t mean anyone is actually doing the tracing.Online fraud simply isn’t being taken seriously enough by the police or any other authority.Until or unless it is, going cashless will expose more people to fraud as they are forced to open online accounts.What is wrong with having a iety of ways to pay and letting us choose Cash, cards and cheques have happily co-existed for decades and there is no reason why cash cannot continue to exist alongside payment apps and the like.Far from sneakily trying to abolish cash, the Government should be standing up for our right to use it — ensuring, for one thing, that there are enough free cashpoints for all of us to access our money.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Many will not be able to begin an apprenticeship, start technical courses or enter some workplaces because they cannot meet the basic entry requirements.The analysis also concludes that children on free school meals- a key measure of poverty - are twice as likely as their richer classmates to be without this level of qualications at age .In total, %of FSM teenagers did not get to this level of attainment, compared to % of their wealthier peers.It is shameful that last year almost , children in England left education at  without proper qualications, Ms Longfield said.It is particularly unacceptable that children growing up in the poorest areas of the country and children with special educational needs are most likely to leave school without reaching basic levels of attainment.While we should celebrate the progress that is being made in raising standards for millions of children, it should never be an acceptable part of the education system for thousands of children to leave with next to nothing.She called on the Government to investigate the issue and commit to halving the numbers failing to get Level  qualications by age  within the next five years.Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner, said: It is shocking that the number of children leaving education without a qualication has risen by nearly a quarter in the last three years.It is clear that this sudden rise has happened since the Tories came to power and imposed brutal cuts on education and support for families and children.The figures are particularly stark for children from the most disadvantaged backgrounds and with special educational needs and disabilities, yet more evidence that those who most need our support are those losing out.Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers , said: The number of children leaving school without basic qualications fell continuously between  and , but has risen sharply in recent years as the full impact of real-terms cuts to school funding has become clear.Children from disadvantaged backgrounds are the victims of a decade of austerity.

The responsibility sits with both sides to find a solution.Mr Barclay also said the backstop is inconsistent with the Good Friday Agreement because it doesnt have the consent of both communities.Responding to the remarks, an EU Commission spokeswoman said Brussels would not be drawn into a blame game with Britain.She said: Our role is to be constructive, to move forward the negotiations and to make progress so as to allow reaching the joint aim of having a deal.Eurocrats also batted away Mr Barclays suggestion that they are not ready for No Deal, insisting EU states are fully prepared.Both the Commission and No  confirmed yesterday that Britain has tabled written proposals on replacing the backstop for the first time.The UK side yesterday put forward a series of informal discussion papers containing over its ideas to revamp the border fix.The dossier covers parts of Britains aim for a three tier replacement to the backstop which would involve some checks on the island of Ireland.It includes agreeing an all-island agri-food zone, under which Northern Ireland continues to follow EU rules on farming and food standards.This would be coupled by replacing alignment in other areas with alternative arrangements and agreeing a Stormont Lock for Northern Irish consent.Under the plan the whole of the UK would leave the EUs customs union and single market.Teams of officials from Brussels and Britain met yesterday and will get together again today to discuss the technical details of the proposal.The revelation came as two Labour MPs leading a cross-party group for a deal told Mr Barnier up to  of their colleagues are ready to rebel against Jeremy Corbyn.Stephen Kinnock and Caroline Flint were invited to Brussels by the EU chief negotiator so he could grill them on the latest parliamentary arithmetic.Some EU officials have expressed regret that they have focussed too much attention on hardline Remainers rather than moderates.Ms Flint said he had probed them on what pressure they could bring to bear on the two main parties and discussions surrounding the Benn bill.She insisted: There’s still a majority in parliament, cross-party, who would like to get a deal through.I think we better reflect the public. People want us to try and find a way through this.Mr Kinnock said the Frenchman told them he was not hung up on the language and the way in which absolute assurances are given the backstop wont be permanent.He said of his grouping: Dferent parts of the coalition are looking for dferent things but we really are now at the last roll of the dice.We made the point that the more the debate has radicalised and polarised, the closer you get to No Deal.Everybody that’s tried to reverse Brexit, to not accept anything that doesn’t pass ious purity tests, has played directly into the hands of the No Dealers.Irelands PM Leo Varadkar yesterday said the rhetoric and mood music surrounding the talks has improved and theres a lot of energy and a lot of positivity.But he warned: The dficulty is that when it comes to the substance of the issue that needs to be resolved, the gaps are still very wide.His deputy Simon Coveney, who met MPs from parliaments Brexit committee in Dublin yesterday, also warned the two sides are a long way apart.He said: “There is a signicant gap between what the British Government has been asking about in their approach, and what the EU is able to accept.Mr Coveney added that France and Finland agreeing a September  deadline for new UK plans showed the growing frustration and concern within the EU”.Asked about the ultimatum, the Commission said that every day counts and that the sooner we make progress the better.A French official said: If we dont get the proposals before the end of September, we will not have enough time to discuss them before the summit in October.Yesterday a report by the OECD warned Ireland is set to be the worst hit EU countrytheres No Deal - but Britain would suffer even more.The Paris-based think tank said the countrys economic growth would be cut by . per cent next year and in , compared with a % hit for the UK. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This can lead to high blood pressure, heart disease and stroke.”Mr Wfen said: “Ear plugs and separate bedrooms can temporarily help but they don’t get to the root of the problem, or deal with the snorer’s health.Most couples want to share the marital bed, and they want a peaceful night’s sleep.Using an oral device can offer an effective and long-term solution.Oral devices can also treat OSA - but you should talk to your GP firstyou think you have this condition.”The devices are available for as little as £. while the companys newest device, which is created from unique dental impressions, costs £.The tailor-made device is a good option for people with small or large mouths, as most oral devices only cater for the average-size mouth.Mr Wfen said: “Wearing a LabFit Oral Device every night is where you’ll see positive long-term results.“You’ll wake up feeling refreshed, see an improvement in your mood and concentration, and feel less sleepy during the day.Your partner will also get a great night’s sleep, making you both feel happier in your relationship.”Previously, we revealed how medics have come up with a new device that can be implanted into your chin to stop snoring.The device is a small U-shaped object, about the size of a thumb nail, that is implanted into the skin under the chin during a -minute local anaesthetic.It provides a workout for the muscles around the tongue as it sends out impulses to active nerves and muscles to stop the tongue and airways collapsing during sleep - a key cause of snoring.The device, developed by Belgium-based Nyxoah, has been approved for use in the UK following a recent trial which found that it brought major improvements in symptoms of OSA.Sleep apnoea leads to loud snoring as it sees soft tissue around the airway, including the tongue, relax and collapse repeatedly during sleep which obstructs the normal flow of air.Up to two million people in the UK have obstructive sleep apnoea and in the longer term, it has been linked to an increased risk of high blood pressure, stroke or heart attack.The manufacturer says the results from the new device will be published this year, and major improvements were seen in symptoms."},{"url":null,"title":"masked burglars raid james bond filming location","story":"Count Patrice de Vogüé and his we Cristina were woken at dawn by hammering on the door of their palatial home in the -acre grounds of Château de Vaux-le-Vicomte.Six raiders then forced their way into the vast th-century château, which is located  miles south of Paris, reports the Times.The terried couple - aged  and  - were then ordered to open their safe which the gang promptly emptied.The thieves made off with cash, emeralds and other jewels after tying up the couple with the Count’s neckties, said prosecutor Béatrice Angelelli.However, they did not take any of the artworks or other precious items in the palace.After the robbers fled, the couple freed themselves and called the police.They were shaken but not injured and refused medical treatment after their ordeal.The French TV series Versailles and Moonraker, the  Bond movie with Roger Moore, were both filmed at the château.Eva Longoria, the Desperate Housewives actress, then married NBA basketball star Tony Parker there in .And the historic site - which attracts hundreds of visitors every day - has also been used as a glamorous backdrop for Victorias Secret modelling shoots.Count De Vogüé has devoted himself to restoring the château and running it as a business since he opened it to the public in .However he once admitted he has struggled to pay for Vaux-le-Vicomte during an interview with Paris Match magazine.“People believe that you must be rich to own a château,” he said. “That’s absolutely .”His ancestor Alfred Sommier, an industrialist, bought the estate, which was dilapidated, in .The count and his we received the château as a wedding present from his father and decided the best way of saving it was to open it to the public.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Yet Mr Coveney today fumed that people should not be taken in by the current talks - which he said would only kick the can down the road to a later date. Warning Ireland could become collateral damage, he blasted Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclayaposs claim that a fully-formed alternative to the backstop will only be needed in .    Mr Coveney told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: What weaposre being asked to do by Stephen Barclay and others is to replace a guarantee around that border question which solves it... with a promise that somehow we will do our best to try to solve this issue in the future but we donapost know how just yet. That doesnapost sound like a fair deal to me. The Irish position is that we want to find a solution, we want to get a deal and we want to allow the UK to leave the EU in an orderly and sensible manner. But we cannot allow Ireland to be the collateral damage of that. And I think for Britain to ask us to do that is a very unreasonable request. And it wonapost be the basis for a deal. He added: Trade across  road crossings that has created a normality and a peace that is settled on the island of Ireland for the last  years, that now faces signicant disruption... That is what weaposre fighting for here. Ireland is in no doubt as to what a no deal means for us. It is very damaging, very dficult and it poses huge questions for politics and potentially for the management of civic unrest in the context of Northern Ireland, around the border question.    The backstop is a clause in the -page Withdrawal Agreement that guarantees Northern Ireland would not have to make border checks along the frontier with the Republic. But in , the UK would be forced to follow EU rules once the backstop kicked in - on  January  - and there would be no end date. EU chiefs have shted their language in recent days by saying they are happy to consider an alternative to the backstop, as long as it achieves the same objectives. Mr Coveney said he had “no problem with” an alternative to the backstop and “we are not attached to the backstop because of its name”. But he warned a big gap remains between the UK and the bloc adding: In order to close that gap we need to get credible proposals from the British government which we simply havenapost received yet.  Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay will meet with the EUaposs chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, in Brussels today after hopes of a deal mounted. Speaking to Sky News, Jean-Claude Juncker said we can have a deal and the pound reached a two-month high. But he was unable to put the chances at more than   when pressed. And the UK is embroiled in a row after EU leaders said there must be concrete written proposals to solve the border question by the end of this month.

A Tory spokeswoman said all those found to be party members have been suspended pending investigation after a probe by the BBC and the MatesJacob Twitter account. Yet despite the BBCaposs evidence including comments of Muslim scum, I donapost want Muslims in this country and Islam is THE religion of hate, it is unclear how many people have been suspended, or when they will face investigation. Tory sources said not all  people - none of whom were named by the BBC - were party members, but did not say how many of them were. They added timings and details of any probe will be guided by a government review into definitions of Islamophobia. Critics fear this review, launched in July, will give Boris Johnson an excuse to stop short of a full independent inquiry into Tory Islamophobia - which all candidates promised during the partyaposs leadership campaign.    Harun Khan, Secretary General of the Muslim Council of Britain, said: An independent and specic inquiry into Islamophobia specically is long overdue. Sadly the Conservative response has been woeful. From denial, through to now a reluctant commitment to a broad and watered down investigation that we fear will do nothing to address this problem. As much as it continues to deny this, it is becoming increasingly evident that the Conservative Party’s problem with Islamophobia is endemic. A Tory former MEP today claimed very senior members of the party had Islamophobic conversations directly about me. Speaking as part of the BBCaposs investigation, Sajjad Karim said those who had discriminated against him included parliamentarians, one of whom is in fact a serving minister at this moment. Labouraposs shadow women and equalities minister Naz Shah said: Whoever this is, they are not fit to serve as an MP, let alone as a government minister. Boris Johnson must act, find out who it is and sack them.  A Conservative Party spokesperson replied to the BBC investigation by saying: All those found to be Party members have been suspended immediately, pending investigation. “The Conservative Party will never stand by when it comes to prejudice and discrimination of any kind. That’s why we are already establishing the terms of an investigation to make sure that such instances are isolated and robust processes are in place to stamp them out as and when they occur.” Yet Tory minister Kwasi Kwarteng appeared to suggest a full independent probe into Islamophobia in the Conservative Party wasnapost necessary. He told the BBC: I think the party has enough structure and discipline and focus to try and deal with this problem in the first instance. “Obviously this is something that is ongoing.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dad who calls himself fing","story":"NewsDad who calls himself f***ing legend cries his eyes out as police arrest himLuke Phillips, from Hull, lists his occupation on Facebook as full time f***ing legend - but he has been jailed for  monthsShareCommentsByMichael MutchKelly-Ann Mills:,  SEP Updated:,  SEP NewsHe was jailed for  months \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Luke Phillips drove at speeds of mph through a north Hull housing estate as he attempted to avoid being caught by police. The -year-old drove the wrong way down one way streets and ran through a red light where he narrowly avoided hitting a pedestrian.He was caught after abandoning the vehicle and asked officers can I just have a moment to cry eyes out, knowing that he would be heading to prison as he had breached a suspended sentence he received just months earlier, Hull Live reports.Phillip Evans, prosecuting, told Hull Crown Court the high speed chase broke out after officers in an unmarked car spotted Phillips, driving a Renault Megane, cut in front of another vehicle on August .    He said: “They saw the defendant pulling across a vehicle in front of the police car and turning into Arram Grove. The car in which the defendant’s vehicle pulled in front of had to brake. “The officers wanted to stop the Renault Megane in order to give him some advice about his driving, however, the vehicle sped off and engaged in a desperate attempt to avoid the attention of the police car.”Phillips, whose Facebook profile lists his occupation as been a full time f***ing legend, began driving at high speeds through the Orchard Park estate.Mr Evans said: “There the defendant left his vehicle somewhere in the region of Lingcourt on a grass area and sought refuge from at least two members of the public by askingthey would shelter him from the police. Neither were cooperative.    “Fortunately there was an officer in plain clothes in the area who was able to join in the search and tracked the defendant first on the roof of a garage. “When the police eventually caught up with him shortly thereafter he said on arrest ‘can I have a moment to cry my eyes out’.” Phillips, of Clanthorpe, Hull, then told police: I have got a one-year-old. I’m going to prison. I only got the car to make some cash and look what’s happened. He already has five convictions which include handling of stolen goods and criminal damage. In April , he was sentenced for possession of cocaine with the intent to supply, receiving a  month sentence suspended for a year. Judge David Tremberg told Phillips he missed “a golden opportunity” to turn his le around. He said: “You [Phillips] were one of the very few people who appeared before this court facing sentence for a serious charge that was not locked up straight away. “The court entrusted you with a golden opportunity to sort yourself out. That trust sadly was misplaced.” Defence barrister Catherine Kioko-Gilligan told the court that Phillips “lacked consequential thinking” when he committed the offence of dangerous driving. She said: “In terms of the offence this is not the worst example of its kind but it is clear that the offence was committed as a result of the defendant’s lack of consequential thinking.

Luke, staying at the troubled holiday firmaposs Cookaposs Club Sunny Beach resort in Bulgaria, documented other potential hazards including a cable in front of a door. He posted a video to social media with the caption: Thomas Crook, more like. Donapost book at Thomas Crook’s own hotel, Cookaposs Club Sunny Beach, Bulgaria, because this is what youaposll get.”    One video shows Luke walking down a room corridor on the fourth floor and opens a thin unlocked cupboard next to one of the rooms. Inside the cupboard there is a series of pipes as Luke points the camera downwards and shouts to his mate at the bottom: “Shine the torch up, shine it to the wall.” A glimmer of light can be seen many feet below where Luke’s friend is. Luke says to the camera: “There you go, that’s your drop. Very professional that Thomas Cook.” Another clip shows a long exposed cable protruding out of a wall across the corridor and through a door titled ‘staff only.  Luke explains how his friend tripped over the cable at night which is situated in front of a staircase. Luke explained: “[He] trips over this wire. It comes out the wall there, and right next to a stairwell.” As Luke’s friend lts up the slack cable with foot. More footage posted claims to show the hotel with a leak in the ceiling, exposed electrical wires with tape around it, crumbling floors and walls as well as an un-tiled bathroom. Luke also shows a section of a staircase inside the hotel which he claims cut his toe. Reviews on TripAdvisor for the hotel, refurbished this year, are also damning.  Jon.E said: “I’ve stayed at numerous all-inclusive hotels throughout Europe and the Caribbean and unfortunately this is the worst - [it] doesn’t even warrant a  star rating - I’m going to be blunt, the hotel was only % full...this hotel is cheap and nasty, and should be avoided.” Craig F from Kilmarnock added: “Honest review by an honest person literally just back and felt the need to write my first review.

The floors are nished concrete. “Everything was dark and grey and the corridors barely lit with red lighting on sensors which don’t come on until you are part way down them.

The Camelot theme park in Lancashire was based on the well-known medieval Camelot castle, which was associated with the legendary King Arthur, and comprised of a acre site near the village of Charnock Richard. Thousands of families would visit the park each year, before its gates finally closed in . Since then, the park has been left to crumble away - now laying in tatters, with rusting rollercoasters and a crumbling white castle at the entrance.Owners Knights Leisure blamed low visitor numbers on bad weather and events such as the  Olympics and The Queen’s Jubilee - with over  staff losing their jobs.  Whilst certain rollercoasters were sold to theme parks around Europe, seven years later, many of the rides remain abandoned, reports the Liverpool Echo .‘Urban explorers’, while warned off the site, are regularly found walking the tracks of the decaying rollercoasters, avoiding the   security that roam the perimeter. Previously, almost  new homes are planned for the former Camelot site by developer Story Homes. The plans are for up to  homes and an employment area, which Story Homes says could deliver about  jobs.    The proposals have proved controversial with residents in the area. The Camelot theme park opened in  and boasted a ft roller coaster called the Knitemare which spanned some  meters. It also had a log flume, a smaller size roller coaster The Twister, three large water slides and a large caterpillar roller coaster train which spanned the wholeand depth of the park running above ground and on ground level. Together Money set about calculating the hypothetical land value of eight intriguing abandoned places from around the globe, from derelict theme parks to uninhabited islands.

Marie Hayes had illegally pocketed welfare payments for more than three years by ly telling officials she was a single parent - when in fact long term partner John Gavagan was living with her at their family home.

Newcastle City Council was forced to go to court to evict Neil Coates, , and close his flat following complaints about anti-social behaviour and alleged drug dealing. The courts were a last resort after Coates ignored written warnings and a Community Protection Notice Warning in a case that dragged on for more than a year. Neighbours were forced to put up discarded drug taking paraphernalia, callers at all hours, disturbances after dark and the sound of car doors slamming at the property in Kenton in Newcastle, ChronicleLive reports. It cost £ to clean up a communal area that was splattered with blood, urine and vomit.    Property manager Your Homes Newcastle served a Closure Order on the property in July  for three months. That order was extended for three more months to give Coates a chance to improve his behaviour, but that didnapost happen. He was evicted on September . Councillor Clare Penny-Evans, cabinet member for communities, said: “Everyone has the right to feel safe in their own home and neighbourhood. When tenants make people feel unsafe, we won’t hesitate to intervene and use all our powers. “I hope this sends a clear message that we will support our good tenants and seek to evict those who repeatedly breach their tenancy agreement by acting anti-socially.” Matthew Foreman, director of customer services at YHN, said: “Eviction is always a last resort for us but something we won’t hesitate to doa person’s behaviour is affecting their neighbours and the community.

Rebecca Hetherington, , knew something wasnapost right as far back as  - when she started noticing changes in her appetite. The criminology PhD student, from Newcastle, was also regularly coming down with colds. By , Rebecca was convinced there was something very wrong and visited her GP for a check up. Since then, she was turned away on a number of occasions because they believed she was fit and healthy. Rebecca said she was made to feel like a hypochondriac, and even cried in some of her appointments because she felt so confused about why she felt unwell. At the end of , Rebecca noticed a small lump in her neck, which she initially thought could be a sign of a throat infection or a virus.    Rebecca said: I started to notice the neck lump towards the end of , but it became more prominent after the new year, and by May  it was very visible. I developed a secondary lump near my collarbone too. At first, I though perhaps it was a throat infection or virus, but after a few weeks I became very worried it was lymphoma because of the armpit pain and night sweats, which are classic lymphoma signs. The lump looked quite flat but covered a large area of my neck, around  centimetres wide. The night sweats happened quite regularly at first, weekly from around  but by  it was nightly. I had to change my pyjamas and bedding regularly. As the months passed and the lump grew, Rebeccaaposs concerns began to rise. Not wanting to give up, she made another GP appointment for April ,  and fortunately she was seen by a locum GP that time who acknowledged her concerns and referred her for an ultrasound and fine needle aspiration to diagnose the lump.    By May of that year, Rebecca was diagnosed with stage two metastatic papillary thyroid cancer, which they estimated sheaposd had for three years as it had spread to approximately  lymph nodes. She underwent a thyroidectomy and neck dissection, before starting the highest dose of radioactive iodine treatment and spending five days in isolation in a lead-lined room as she was dangerously radioactive. Speaking about the diagnosis, she said: I was shocked, Iaposd been mentally preparing for cancer, but I was sure it was lymphoma, so the cancer diagnosis wasnapost what shocked me, but hearing it was in my thyroid was. I had never heard of thyroid cancer. Rebecca is monitored every three months for cancer recurrence, and in June  she was found to have residual cancer and required a second neck dissection. Rebecca is still not classed as cancer free and has regular scans. She added: I still have no feeling in my jaw or ear on the left side, and weakness in my arm and shoulder. I then developed severe hypocalcaemia because my parathyroid glands were removed and damaged, so my body is unable to regulate its own calcium, vitamin D or magnesium.    I now rely on medication to keep the levels stable. I had around  staples in my scar which were removed without anaesthetic a week after my surgery. I then received the highest dose of radioactive iodine and was put in a lead-lined room in hospital for five days due to how radioactive I was. I was nervous to swallow the iodine because no one can touch it, so you have to swallow it through a metal straw to avoid the radiation being opened before it hits your stomach. After the first day or two, when the swelling of my face, taste of metal and vomiting had died down, I was able to use my laptop for university work, which was a good distraction. Speaking about her journey to diagnosis and struggle to be listened to, Rebecca said: I was convinced something was wrong but was regularly told there wasnapost. For years I was going back and forth to my GP, even when I developed a lump in my neck.

Jade Savage travelled for three hours to meet her date only for him to call her fat. She jokingly asked for donations to claw back the £ she’d paid to travel to go for a drink with the ‘dark-haired, blue-eyed’ man she’d met on the popular dating app. She told how she was stunned when he took one look at her and said: F*k me, you’ve put on weight and told her to go homeshe didn’t like hearing the truth. Single mum Jade, , has raised £ so far after asking for money for wine and sticks of lard, but says she’ll donate some to charities to help prevent suicide and abused women. On top of that, dating app Bumble has offered to match the donations on her GoFundMe page so she isn’t put off dating for good, making the total £,.    Jade said: It’s incredible. I didn’t think it would go this far but I don’t regret calling him out on his behaviour. And I’m not going to let one guy’s silly comments stop me from going on dates. I’m happy with the way I look and hadn’t had any complaints before. The support worker, who has a four-year-old son, Jimmy, says she’d put on lbs before going to meet the ‘flash’ salesman after he’d dumped her a month before. We’d been on three dates before including a weekend in London where he’d wined and dined me, says Jade. But then he announced that he had been talking to another woman and wanted to take her out. I was like, “aposOK crack onapos but of course it’s not nice to hear the guy you’ve seen a few times likes someone . I was single and decided to slob out in my PJs on the sofa eating anything and everything I could while drinking wine and wonderingI’d ever meet Mr Right. It was my Bridget Jones moment.    I put on almost half a stone, but I’m always curvy - I’m a size  and ft ins - and didn’t think it mattered. I love my curves and I’m comfortable in my own skin. Then we started messaging again and he suggested going on another date. I had put on weight on my stomach, the tops of my arms and chin, but I felt confident about the way I looked. Jade wore a fitted black jersey dress to the drinks date, travelling  miles from her home in Syston, Leicestershire, to meet for drinks in Peterborough. I was intrigued to see him again, she says, But I couldn’t find him when I arrived at the station. I texted and he said he was outside in the car. As soon as I opened the passenger door, he took one look at me and said: ‘F*^k me, you’ve put some weight on.    I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. It wasn’t banter and I asked why he would say something like that. He replied: ‘Well it’s the truth.’ He kept repeating it so I called him a ‘pr*k and he went berserk. I got out of the car and he said he’d give me the cost of my train ticket, but I refused and left. I didn’t need him to judge me. I like the way I look and his opinion is irrelevant.Fuming, Jade went to the hotel opposite the train station to cool down over a glass of wine - and posted on Facebook about ‘the worst dating experience of my le.I said I didn’t need to dress up, pay to travel all that way, and spend all that money only to be called fat by my date. One of my friends said for a joke that I should set up a GoFundMe page to get my money back and so I did. I thought my friends would donate for a laugh but I didn’t expect it to go viral. She says she will spend the money donated on wine and then give some to a suicide prevention charity and to a woman’s shelter. Jade has three dates lined up through the Badoo dating site next week.

Andrew Nino and Kiara Paz, both , and -year-old Alyssa Brianna Vega are charged with first-degree felony aggravated robbery with a deadly weapon. Austin Police say the pair kicked their way into the family apartment and stole drugs and money at gunpoint. Desire, who was . weeks pregnant and her boyfriend chased after them. She was shot. Medics rushed Desire to hospital where she gave birth to Emery Skye who was placed on le support. Eight days later Emery passed away while being held by her loving mum and dad. In a heart-wrenching, emotional and powerful account of what happened on that awful night brave Desire has spoken to Mirror about the trauma and loss she is going through and how God is helping her by aposguiding her out of her painapos. apos You will always be my blessing and I’m so hurt that you’re missing from my arms but you’ll never be gone from my heartapos    When I first found out I was pregnant I always wondered who she would become andshe would be healthy and I prayed and hoped to be able to give her a great le. I had a close friend lose her baby very young and the thought always stuck with meI ever lost Emery I would go insane and a part of me would die and I would be sooo lost. I worked the whole way up until a couple days before the incident and I was so excited for the opportunity to be a mother. I felt during those months and even now, that was my God given purpose. She was my inner strength and my motivation. She still is. One night I was at home in my apartment organizing for her arrival and moving things around. I kicked myself out of my only bedroom in the apartment and made my room the living room so I could have room for all her dressers and belongings in the bedroom. Of course the things filled the room and I still had things in the kitchen, living room and dining room areas that were for her as well. That’s how ready and excited my family and I was...    I heard a knock on my door but was never expecting company and when I went to check outside and around the areato see who knocked, I never saw a soul. A few minutes later, I had continued to look through herclothes and separate them by size to wash, when suddenly I heard the door get kicked open. Startled and confused I stayed in the room until I heard a manaposs voice asking where I was. I suddenly crept out the bedroom only to be encountered by a woman with a kne. She quickly grabbed hold of me and I begged and pleaded for her to not stab me that I was pregnant. There in the living room also stood a man in which the voice belonged to holding a gun, pointing it at my boyfriendright at his head. We didn’t know these people, we asked who they were and what they wanted. They came for someone who had problems with the boyfriend.  I begged and pleaded for them to let us be, that they were in MY HOME and that I had nothing to do with whatever they were there for. After a while of being told not to move and to shut up and being threatened to be shot or stabbed, angrily and disappointed they started grabbing our phones, car keys, all my medical cards and WIC card as well as my ID, social, and money I had in my purse that I was saving for an emergency and the money I was saving for baby. They took an Xbox as well since I didn’t have much except baby items in the apartment they tried taking what would be somewhat valuable or important to them. As they began to run out the house I hollered for the boyfriend to follow them and I grabbed a kne and ran out behind him. As soon as I stepped foot out the apartment I started screaming for someone to help me that two people just broke into my apartment with a gun and kne and were taking my things! I continued to run and as I came around the corner I noticed the boyfriend was fighting for my stuff back in which he was somewhat successful and was able to grab a few things back.  Still running I looked back to seehe was okay and then I heard a gunshot. I knew I had been hit because immediately I felt an intense pain spread throughout my stomach. I quickly covered where I felt blood escaping, the backside of my lower right abdomen. The pain in my stomach was too intense for me to walk so I sat in the street holding my wound, praying, yelling for someone to help me I had been shot. The neighbours then surrounded the sidewalks and were startled by gunshot noises and even more so to find me . weeks pregnant shot in the streets. They quickly called the cops and EMS to help. Shortly after the EMS had arrived and were tending to me. Right after the noise of the gunshot I could no longer feel Emery kicking in my stomach and I knew something was wrong. I remember answering questions that were asked and in between constantly asking them to help my baby, to save my baby. In the EMS ride they tried to detect her heartbeat in which they soon found out wasn’t there. They called for an emergency c section an anaesthetist.  Last thing I remember is being rolled into the emergency room with so many eyes on me, I knew it was serious but didn’t know how serious. A few days later I was more aware of things around me. I was then informed I was shot twice once in the left abdomen which exited the backside lower right abdomen in which I was applying pressure once I was shot, and another time in my left breast. The bullet went through my abdomen and nicked some organs and went through my uterus and intestines. I had to have surgery on my intestines and had a lot of internal bleeding and blood loss which was also being treated. They were able to save my intestines and uterus. However, I had also been informed that upon the emergency c section once they delivered Emery she was not breathing and had to be resuscitated. After resuscitating her they realized due to the amount of blood loss and the loss of oxygen to her brain that she was completely brain dead and airlted her to help fight for her le in a hospital that would be able to provide the medical attention she needed. The doctors and nurses in both hospitals were so great, and my family as well as Emery’s dad and his family were there every day through our battles for support. It was a hard time for us all. Nobody had been contacted until the next morning Sunday July st. Everyone was frantic and worried and hurt to find out what happened to me and how Emery had been hurt the most. We were able to FaceTime which kept my motivation to see Emery every day. When I first saw her she was completely motionless and couldn’t open her eyes, cry, or even breathe on her own. They had put her on le support to help make her stronger, however she wasn’t doing too well.  After she arrived to the new hospital that first night, she was having a lot of seizures and they knew there was no hope of her surviving or doing anything on her own. As I was in the hospital I asked for a baptism for Emery. They didn’t expect her to live past that night and I wanted to make sure she would be baptized and saved to go to Heavenshe passed. The ceremony was beautul. I prayed that night before I went to bed, praying for a miracle and for God to give her and I strength to pull through the night, and we did. A few days after my surgery I continued to fight to push my way towards being discharged and being able to go be with Emery. She was fighting as well. My baby girl was so strong and able to push through until Mommy was able to be with her again. I can’t express in many words the joy I felt once I was discharged and allowed to go be with my baby girl.  You can donate to Desireaposs Go Fund Me here I thanked God and still thank God every day for allowing me to have her and for the family to have her over those days which she was here on Earth with us. The doctors didn’t expect her to live another night but she lived for a total of ! When I arrived to her hospital the doctors informed me of how severe her condition was and told me her brain stem was completely dead and that there would be no way she could breathe on her own, cry, crawl, eat, walk, read, write, do anything on her own. Every day I spent with her they reminded me of this condition she was in and the how impossible it would be for her to do anything without the machines. That’s when they told me this is a decision that is ultimately up to me, however when do you finally say that enough is enough and let her rest  My heart was already broken into a million pieces knowing she was hurt and now knowing that I could never do anything to heal her pain or make her better completely demolished my heart. I felt so confused and hurt and angry. I didn’t feel like it was right for me to have to make such a decision to let her go being that I fought so hard and she did too for us to be reunited again and have moments together. I was informed of how the process would be once I made my decision and I was so stubborn. I wanted to do things with her that I would’veshe wasn’t brain dead. I signed a paper for DNR one night but that’s as far as they got me. I was stuck on being able to spend time with her just as the family was able to while I was in my hospital recovering. I appreciated the nurses they were so loving and understanding and allowed me to stay in the hospital so that I could be with her as much and as long as I wanted to.  I loved touch times the most and made sure to never miss one. Those were the times I was able to do those things with her: bathe her, change her diaper, take her temperature, and weigh her. After a few days and talking to a few more doctors I realized they were right. As much as I wanted to keep her this wasn’t the le I wanted her to have.... Mommy would’ve loved to take care of her evenshe was  with tubes and couldn’t do anything for herself. However what one doctor told me stuck with me: this is a decision you make out of love. My love for her was soooo strong and deep and as much as it killed me not having her and seeing her with all the tubes and motionless, I knew I should let her go and be free and not continue to suffer. I prayed to God every day and every night for strength and guidance and forgiveness and to watch over my baby girl. On the th of July we decided it was time to put our love for her in front of all  we were feeling or wanting and gave the doctor permission to take her off the tubes. I was allowed to hold her in my arms the entire time and have whoever I wanted in there. When they first took off the tubes her father and I and our parents were in the room.  Once they took off the tubes, they warned us that she may be able to breathe for a little bit or a few days given that her body was getting used to the machine. I prayed and prayed for her to be able to breathe on her own for a little while so we could all see her without her tubes. Once they removed the tubes, she continued to breathe! A miracle. What a long way my baby had come from that first night when they said there was no hope. I asked for the rest of the family to join us in the room so we could all love and support her and watch her fight and see how beautul she was without the tubes... I still held her through each breath she took. The more she took on her own the more you could tell she was fighting to take those breaths. We loved her dearly and knew she was strong but baby girl you don’t have to continue to fight to be with God and rest. She had already fought long and hard enough and didn’t need to prove to any of us family members how strong she was because she showed us that strength when she continued to live despite the doctorsapos words. She was breathing on her own for  min. The same time Mama had spent bleeding out after being shotand we praised God for allowing her to do that on her own. So many thoughts and emotions filled our heads after seeing her breathe on her own. We wanted to so badly put her back on the machine but once you decide, you decide.  She went peacefully in my arms that day and with the love and support of her immediate family surrounded by her as well as the grace of God. It looked asshe passed in her sleep and oh how peacefully she went and looked as her body started to fade to purple. I was at a complete loss for words. I never thought I’d be torn of my daughter before her due date. I never thought I’d have to experience such trauma nor loss. I wanted to cremate her to have her with me everywhere I go. However, we were informed that in order to do that the medical examiner would have to keep her body and it would take up to  months for us to have it back for services and then cremation. I was devastated. I felt like my work was falling down all around me and as I fell apart I had to remain strong. It hurt me to think that I would have to endure such trauma and then lose my first born daughter and also bury her! Hi, I am Emery Skye. I was born . weeks early because two people broke into my mommies apartment and robbed her.I’m not sure why they did that. Don’t they know she was getting everything set up for me to come home soon They shot her, the bullet almost hit me. Thankfully the EMS got there quickly. My mommy survived. She has lots and lots of staples on her tummy. Thanks to St. David’s Hospital I lived too.I heard my mommy and grandma say how perfect I am. But every time the doctor comes in I can hear my mommy cry.He says my brain has no activity. Something about the bullet caused my brain to have no oxygen.They say I will never be able to open my eyes or do anything at all. I’m sorry mommy, I really am trying.I don’t know why those people did this to us. Why they’d hurt me or my mommy. But today a man named Jesus told me he was going to make me all better, said I would be one of his angels.I would be able to watch over my mommy and my entire family. Iaposm so excited. I am never going to leave my mommy’s side. I can see now, I see my mommy. She is so beautul but she is crying, everyone is crying. I can see a baby in a white dress. I think she’s sleeping. Oh... I think she’s me."},{"url":null,"title":"woman who refused flight because","story":"NewsWoman who was refused flight because she was too big loses incredible  stoneNorma Dibrell, , says before her drastic weight loss she used to eat , calories a day and was a dress size ShareCommentsByScott Thompson:,  SEP Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video how-many-calories-should-consume-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, subsets :[,,,,,],bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,video.suppressDates:true,hidePreviewImage:\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Norma Dibrell, , admits at her heaviest she was consuming up to , calories a day. The Texan educator says she was once refused a plane ticket because the travel agent said she was apostoo big.apos But she has since lost a staggering  stone after spending the first  years of her le obsessed with food. Norma confesses she used to eat three huge meals and four hefty snacks most days. At her largest she was st lb and a dress size . Because of her size Norma didnapost see any point in taking up any physical exercise. It wasnapost until she fell in love with travel that things started to change for her.    Norma had to book two flight seats as she was unable to fit in one and she couldnapost take part in fun activities her fellow travellers enjoyed, like, climbing, waterfall jumping, or using ziplines. In December , Norma had a gastric bypass after realising that being over st meant she wasnapost fitting into society and she had to make some big changes to her le. Through radically reducing her caloric intake and exercising at least five times a week, by December  she had lost st lb. She now weighs st lb and fits a much more comfortable dress size . For the first  years of my existence food was my coping mechanism. I was easily eating as much as , calories a day. Whether it was a good day or bad day Iaposd feel better through food. If my day was just OK, Iaposd spice it up with food. I just loved food and relied on it, Norma said.    If Iaposm honest I still do love eating, but I allowed myself to splurge constantly then and because of my size, weight and priorities, I didnapost see intentional physical activity as an option or necessity. This is what Iaposd eat on a aposbadapos day: at am a large venti caramel frappuccino, slice of iced lemon pound cake and an egg cheddar and bacon croissant. At am Iaposd have a Snickers bar and hot Cheetos. At pm Iaposd have two leg quarters with a cup of rice and a large soda. At pm Iaposd eat a big bag of Doritos and ten Oreos. At pm Iaposd eat a granola bar and drink another large soda.    At pm Iaposd eat  chicken nuggets, a Big Mac, hot napos spicy chicken, large fries and another large soda. At pm Iaposd eat popcorn with pickles and chocolate covered almonds. I also had a drawer at work jam-packed with snacks and I ate them mindlessly and endlessly. The snacks were nuts and chocolate covered nuts, crisps, candy bars and granola bars. This is just in one day and I didnapost really exercise. I used to struggle a lot. Especially with travel. I needed to buy two plane seats, I couldnapost use the ziplines, I couldnapost climb or surf, I couldnapost jump off waterfalls, I couldnapost go on roller coasters, I couldnapost wear heels or boots or the nice clothes I wanted to. I couldnapost even leave a room without carefully consideringIaposd fit through the exit before trying. I was also always so tired after really short walks.    The list just goes on. All this was because of my weight and size. One time I was even refused travel because the agent told me I wouldnapost fit in the seats and they wouldnapost let me buy a second seat. I was so embarrassed. Following her gastric bypass surgery, her surgeon, dietitian and psychiatrist gave her clear recommendations. Now for breakfast I might have a protein shake. Lunch is typically tuna and cucumber or turkey slices and cheese. For dinner a dferent protein and more veggies like ground turkey zucchini boats, bunless lean cheeseburger or spaghetti squash with turkey meatballs. For snacks Iaposll have one of these jerky, yogurt with berries, pork rind or fruit. Now I exercise on a treadmill or go walking or jogging outdoors five times a week and cover , steps a day. I now eat about , to , calories a day. Although people are amazed at Normaaposs complete transformation, she admits that it is still dficult on a daily basis because she still had an unhealthy relationship with foods.    People are generally completely stunned when they see me now. They donapost even recognise me anymore, Norma continued. I think the hardest thing about this journey has been feeling I had to change myself to fit into this world. Boys seem to like me better now that Iaposve lost weight, but then people did used to say Iaposd be prettierI lost it.  Iaposm still obsessed with food so I still find it dficult itaposs still a huge part of my le but I eat dferently to be healthier. I now eat foods that fuel me instead of destroy me. Itaposs unfortunate that size dictates social value and aesthetics so much, but thataposs the truth and people tell me I look good now, asI looked bad before. Apart from feeling like I now conform to societal norms, I feel I am very strong and capable. I committed to this lelong lestyle and itaposs completely changed my le. Iaposm working on my mental health, my relationship with food and educating myself about food.

Our minder, one of thousands of electricity company staff working on the mammoth clean-up, warns us staying longer than five minutes is hazardous. We are here to witness the devastation left behind by a catastrophe which has ruined so many lives. The damage is evident eight years on - with mangled roofs and twisted metal, and steel cladding covering gaping holes in the wall of a reactor building. Our visit also coincides with a Japanese court ruling the three men in charge at the time of the  meltdown were not guilty of professional negligence.    Yesterdayaposs judgment that Tokyo Electric Power Company executives Tsunehisa Katsumata, , Sakae Muto, , and Ichiro Takekuro, , could not be held directly responsible for the deaths of more than  hospital patients, among , people evacuated from around the plant, has caused outrage. Lawyer Hiroyuki Kawai, representing more than , locals who filed the criminal complaint against TEPCO, insists the legal battle for justice will continue for years to come. Our ultimate goal is to eradicate dangerous nuclear plants that have thrown many residents into despair, he says, vowing to launch an appeal.  Many of those affected claim the disaster, triggered by a . magnitude earthquake and tsunami, could have been avoided. Prosecutors claimed the executives had access to studies predicting the risk of a nuclear calamity from a tsunami. And in  a special commission concluded Fukushima was a profoundly man-made disaster.  It found TEPCO failed to meet basic safety requirements. The firm deliberately took away clfs which would have protected reactors from a tsunami and also disregarded warnings its sea wall was not high enough. Eight years on, the damage is still evident in the mangled roofs of the Fukushima Daiichi power station reactors and in the ghost towns inside the exclusion zone to which refugees are only now ing.  Entering the prohibited site through a series of police checkpoints, we pass enormous silos where tens of thousands of sealed sacks of radioactive soil are being stored. In the decontamination squad mess building, we see hundreds of workers putting on hazmat suits and breathing masks which are sterilised at the end of the sht. They cannot take anything from the high-radioactivity zone off site.  We are issued with protective masks, goggles, gloves, boots and hard-hats to wear in the most toxic areas. Jagged gaping holes in the shredded wall of a reactor building are reinforced by steel cladding - the only barrier between us and a pool of hazardously radioactive melted fuel. The pipe network of the cooling system which failed when it was pummelled by the -metre high surge of seawater is now a rusted tangle in a derelict shell.  When the earthquake happened, our TEPCO host explains, the three reactors automatically shut down. Emergency diesel generators pumped coolant the through their cores, but when the tsunami struck  minutes later it engulfed the protective seawall flooded the basement. The generators were knocked out and coolant stopped flowing, causing fuel meltdowns.  As workers struggled to re-supply power to the reactorsapos cooling systems over the following days, an intense build-up of hydrogen caused explosions in four of the total six reactors. From a viewing  we can how the steel skeleton of one of the reactors has been left exposed by the blasts. A line on the side of another reactor marks the height of the tsunami.  Robots are being used to remove radioactive debris and spent nuclear fuel from the reactors, we are told. The scale of the clean-up process is most graphically illustrated by the endless rows of -metre high cylinders used to store nearly one million cubic metres of contaminated water. Although a stf sea breeze drts in behind us, our guide snappily tells us it is time to move on.    I can feel a dull ache at the back of my throat, symptomatic of increased background radiation. Another reading is taken before we leave - signicantly higher than it was on arrival. Japanaposs government wants to banish the stigma around Fukushima and the region will next year host several Olympic events.  It will be , however, before TEPCO will be able to declare the site completely safe. Spokesman Katsuyoshi Oyama tells me: Obviously we are not proud, but it is right that we do this properly for the people of Fukushima. To revitalise the area TEPCO must do everything correctly we will stick with this until it is complete.  As Britain increases its dependence on nuclear power from a quarter to a third in the next  years, the lessons of Fukushima are there to be heeded. Although the UK is not prone to earthquakes like Japan, campaigners say there is a danger from flooding. Reactors typically need to be situated near water to keep the reactors cool. Over-budget Hinkley Point C on the Somerset coast is the first nuclear plant to be built in Britain since , one of several planned for the coming decades.

Massive hordes are expected to flood the area surrounding the facility today to answer a call to aposStorm Area .apos But the organiser behind the event has already pulled out of plans for an aposAlienstockapos festival in recent weeks. Matty Roberts cited fears that what started as a joke could turn into a possible humanitarian disaster.  A statement on Nevada town Rachelaposs website earlier predicted that Alienstock would be Fyre Festival . - referring to the disorganised aposluxuryapos island party that left attendees stranded with inadequate food, water and shelter.    Normally quiet desert towns, like Rachel, surrounding the highly-classied facility, have braced for the tourism explosion for the weekendaposs events. Area  has long occupied a special place in the popular imagination as the base of the United Statesapos Governmentaposs galactic secrets. Theories of extraterrestrial close encounters, fanned by science fiction and Hollywood depictions of UFOs and little green men, have led alien enthusiasts and conspiracy theories to regard the facility with envious eyes.  Some of the two million people who signed up to an Internet joke to aposStorm Area apos will be driven by desire to try to catch a glimpse of the closely-guarded enigmaaposs deepest secrets. Many more will be there for the memes. Already, the Internet is celebrating as footage of LKTNV Channel  Anchor News anchor Joe Bartels being photobombed by the dayaposs first Alienstock legend performing a aposNaruto runapos.    For those of us who donapost travel in the meme-universe, thataposs a style of running where an anime character leans forward and sprints with their arms stretched out behind them like a ninja.

Lets see them aliens.  What is Area  For decades, Area  has been the topic of conspiracy theories and sci-fi inspired folklore - fueled by the US Governmentaposs historical refusal to even confirm it even existed. Wild theories range from Area  ing as the base for captured UFOs and alien remains, to rumours itaposs where the government stores its secrets about extraterrestrial activity, and develops systems and aircraft based on alien technology.

If we want to win a league we have to perform as we did in the second half but for  minutes.“We know it’s going to be a hard league. We’re sitting at the top of it. If we’d lost the first game of the season and won our next four the atmosphere would be dferent and the questions would be dferent.“We hope to stay at the top. We’ve had a wee dip but, over the course of a season, there will be more dips like this. We have to make sure we beat Arbroath on Saturday.”Going back to his former stomping ground on the Ayrshire coast, Smith knew he and another ex-Ayr man Lawrence Shankland were going to be under the spotlight wearing tangerine.He accepts they didn’t perform and makes no excuses for himself or anyone  at the Terrors, who know all about the threat and quality of The Honest Men.United lost both of their visits there last season when Smith and Shankland were among the Somerset tormentors-in-chief.Smith added: “From first-hand experience I know Ayr’s philosophy going into every game, particularly playing against Dundee United, who they did well against last season.“They would have been keen to keep that going. Me, Shanks and the other boys knew that they have a squad of good players.“Fair play to them but we didn’t do enough. We didn’t compete and put our stamp on the game. We didn’t deserve to take anything.”Right-back Smith accepts they can’t expect to win every game this season but believes it was the performance which angered those connected with United most.Ayr controlled proceedings for most of the  minutes and Smith believes they can only look at themselves as they seek to get back to winning ways in their quest for promotion.“You can’t win every game but the manner in which we lost was not acceptable,” he said.“We didn’t turn up and Ayr took advantage. They are a good side and we can’t afford to take our foot off the gas at any point.“The second half was better. In the first half, we were outworked, which can’t happen.“First and foremost, we need to look at ourselves.“I don’t think we passed the ball enough, which is what we’ve been doing for the first four games. We’ll pick ourselves up and see what we need to improve.”Smith was involved in the concession of both the goals at Ayr last weekend and has held his hands up for his involvement in Daniel Harvie’s opener and Alan Forrest’s penalty which sealed the points.“They were both straight balls,” he reflected. “The second goal, I’ve given away the penalty so I need to hold my hands up for that. No complaints.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/5d820bcc130e61.72848189.jpg ","title":"in form keeper hamilton impresses mcpake after strong display for dundee against alloa","story":"Dundee boss James McPake hailed the influence of his No  Jack Hamilton for taking the pressure off his defence when it was needed against Alloa.After saving a second-half penalty with the score at - to the Dark Blues, Hamilton was strong when the Wasps came chasing a late equaliser.And he’s backed his goalie to keep up the good early-season form, where he’s picked up six clean sheets.James said: “Jack made a great save from the penalty.“He’s been great since I came in and was too when I was with the reserves last season.“I’ve said before how good a character he is around the dressing-room but above all he is a good goalkeeper and he proved that again on Saturday.“He was excellent.“He came for crosses late on that took real pressure off us.“I thought the defence did well there as well, it can be tough when you’re winning - at home and you need to see the game out.”The Dens gaffer admits it will be strange travelling outside of the city after playing each of their last six games in the city, five at home and one at Tannadice.Heading to Greenock, James knows it’ll be a dficult day against David Hopkin’s Morton.He added: “It’s weird because it feels like we have hardly been away from home.“Every game since Dunfermline on the opening day has been around about here.“The derby was away –  yards away!“Morton are a bit like Alloa in that they are another one of those teams who have been consistent in this league over the last few seasons.“They have made a lot of changes but they will be tough opponents.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/5d820bcd4e82f7.13305143-476x564.jpg ","title":"match winning performance is the standard for dee goalie jack","story":"Dundee goalkeeper Jack Hamilton says his match-winning performance in the win over Alloa is the standard he has to live up to for the rest of the campaign.The -year-old put on a strong showing in the - home win over Alloa Athletic including a second-half penalty save from the Wasps’ penalty king Alan Trouten.That save and dealing with a number of late crosses as Peter Grant’s side chased an equaliser earned Hamilton the Man-of-the-Match award as he played a big role in the club’s first three points since August  against Ayr.Hamilton admits he has goalkeeping coach, and Dens legend, Bobby Geddes to thank for a bit of background penalty knowledge.The former Hearts keeper told the Tele: “It was nice to save the penalty, just to give me a wee feelgood factor.“This season has been good so far and it’s where I want to be, where I want to continue.“I’ve set myself standards and it’s about keeping them up.“The goalie coach, Bobby Geddes, is good with us and we look at things like penalty takers and things like that.“He gets all the stats and I was looking at it and it said Trouten had never missed a penalty so I’m glad to spoil his record!“We watch what he’s done before andthere’s a pattern forming then you go with that.“However, you can look at all his previous ones but you still don’t know what he’s going to do on the day.“It’s about trying to watch the run up and the way he moves.“There’s loads of dferent factors but, at the end of the day, it’s just about keeping the ball out of the net!”Hamilton is happy with his start to the campaign and he’s keen to continue that – and continue picking up points – at Cappielow this weekend.The Dark Blues leapfrogged Morton in the table after the Greenock side lost out on the road to Queen of the South.That was after a decent start from David Hopkin’s men, a dark horse for the play-offs for some people, and Hamilton says that just shows how up and down the Championship can be.“Saturday will be another dficult game,” Hamilton added.“We’ve been working all week to prepare and we go into the game with a wee bit of confidence after the win last week. Alloa are a right good team with some really good players and it just showed there’s no one you can take for granted in this league.

That just shows you can only concentrate on yourselves.”Saturday’s victory over Alloa ended a testing spell for the Dark Blues with very disappointing results against Dundee United and then League Two Elgin City.Hamilton said: “It was a well-earned three points on Saturday, I’d say.“There were a lot of challenges flung at us and it was horrible at times, not particularly nice to play in, but a wee bit of character from the boys ground it out and we got the three points we needed.“Saturday was a dficult game and it was good after the previous two weeks just to get that three points and get going again.“We know we’re going to have to face times like that through the season and it’s about learning from things and moving forward as a group.“We have good lads in the dressing-room and a good manager and that’s the direction we want to go.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/03/DNic_Taw_Teams_Podcast-2-e1553252194766-940x564.jpg ","title":"shock as driver flips car in city street before fleeing the scene","story":"Residents of a city street say they are “amazed” no one was seriously injured after a car overturned in the early hours of yesterday.Police and fire crews closed off Fountainbleau Drive in Linlathen shortly after am to clear the scene and cut down a lamppost damaged in the smash.A police investigation has been launched in an effort to trace the driver who ditched the car.It is understood the vehicle may have been stolen from the Kirkton area before the crash.Neighbours said they saw three young men wearing dark clothing who fled the area shortly after the incident.An unnamed resident said the yellow Vauxhall came to a stop near the skate park before she contacted the fire service. vw, px\"  She said: “I’m amazed no one was seriously injured.“The car landed on its driver’s side and I contacted the fire brigade – I was worried the car might have gone up in flames.”Another neighbour confirmed she had witnessed a group flee the scene.She added: “I’m amazed they came out of that unscathed.”Another resident described hearing a “loud bang” and said he couldn’t understand how the car had ended up landing in that position, near the junction with Rowantree Crescent.He added: “There was no screeching to imply the car was out of control.“It was facing in the direction of Morrisons but it was on the wrong side of the road to be heading that way.“I can’t understand how it’s managed to end up like that.“There were at least  fire crew members on the scene before a lamppost was cut down.”The fire service confirmed two appliances from the Kingsway station attended the scene.Police have urged anyone who may be able to help their investigation to get in touch.A spokeswoman added: “Officers were called to Fountainbleau Drive in Dundee at around .am yesterday following a one-car collision.“The driver had left the scene prior to police arrival and inquiries are ongoing to trace them.“Anyone who witnessed the crash or has other information relevant to the investigation should contact police on .”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/09/5d8341b3949c25.26246097-846x564.jpg ","title":"theatre company bringing a z of dundee production to dundee rep","story":"After a warm reception in community spaces across the city, a theatre company is bringing its “A-Z of Dundee” production home for its first run in a theatre.The Dundee Rep production is billed as a fast-paced musical comedy which tells some of the stories that have made the City of Discovery the place it is today.It is written by John and Gerry Kielty and directed by Ewan Donald.The Tele spoke to Ewan about the production.He said it was the perfect show to premiere in a community setting. “We take one production into the community each year and this one just made perfect sense for our th year,” he said.“There’s a curiosity in Dundee that’s built up over the years about the events that have shaped the city.“The live element of theatre gives the audience a real opportunity to connect with the stories being told.”Ewan says that the A-Z of Dundee will tell some stories that are familiar but there will be lots of surprises for even the most knowledge-able of Dundonians.He said: “The focus is on all the good bits of Dundee.“We’ve tried to focus on some of the lesser-known stories of the city.” vw, px\"  A section of the production focuses on the role pioneering women have played.

He trained twice last week and we could have done with him on the bench last week.”Despite his youth Campbell has a track record for rising to the occasion when McInnes turns to him in big “must win” games.He made his first-team debut in the final game of the - season at Parkhead.It was a game where Aberdeen had to beat league champions Celtic to secure a second-placed finish in the Premiership.Campbell came on with  minutes remaining and played a pivotal role in securing a - win.Last season he was pitched in from the start in the Scottish Cup quarter-final replay against Rangers at Ibrox. Again the teen rose to the challenge with a strong sht as the Dons triumphed -.Campbell also started against RoPS Rovaniemi in Finland in the Europa League this season – with Aberdeen winning -.McInnes said: “In times like this, in adversity, you have to deal with problem solving and maybe give an opportunity to others.“Injuries are something we all want to avoid, particularly when you have a tight squad.“However, it is about how you deal with it. It is easy when things are going well but when things are not going well it is sometimes the test of a team.”Aberdeen’s injury problems are not isolated to the middle of the park as centre-backs Scott McKenna and Ash Taylor are also out with hamstring injuries.McInnes admits it is the worst injury crisis he has experienced in his six years at the club.He said: “Last season was the worst we had with injuries and this one is up there again.“We had  training on Thursday but we still have some good players available here and it is just finding that right blend.“We are really stretched in certain areas. Bryson and Ojo were brought in to have a big influence. Ojo has had that.“Bryson has been working hard to give us that influence.“We had that in the first half against St Johnstone but then we lost that in the second half.“We have been a better team when Bryson has been in it although we have still shown good levels of performances when he has not been in it.”Due to the injury problems McInnes admits he may have to reassess how Aberdeen set up.However, he is confident players like Campbell can step up and make a positive impact.He said: “We still have some very good players available although we may have to look at how we play and finding solutions to still getting those winning performances.”"},{"url":null,"title":"live blog aberdeen and inverness oor wullie statues go under the hammer1","story":"The Oor Wullie#s BIG Bucket Train auctions continue tonight with the Aberdeen and Inverness statues set to go under the hammer.The sculptures, which were on display in the north-east and Inverness, are set to raise thousands for the Archie Foundation.Aberdeen and Inverness’s Oor Wullie#s BIG Bucket Trail LIVE Auction!Posted by The Archie Foundation Grampian on Tuesday,  September Last night an amazing £, was raised for The Archie Foundation Tayside at an event at Dundee Rep.Tonight#s auction takes place at the Thainstone Centre and gets under way at .pm, you can follow all the action live below."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.41031801-240x180.jpg srcset=https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.41031801-496x372.jpg 620w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.41031801-752x564.jpg 940w, https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningexpress/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/09/2.41031801-240x180.jpg 300w ","title":"no late night working for aberdeen waste and recycling staff","story":"Refuse workers in Aberdeen will not have their shts changed following a consultation into the possibility of late-night collections.Changes proposed by Aberdeen City Council could have seen staff working until just before pm, with additional lights fitted to vehicles and head torches issued to workers.However, following a -week consultation, the council has confirmed there will be no changes to sht patterns.Discussions had been ongoing aimed at finding a budget saving of £,, with staff and unions asked about changing shts, as well as inviting suggestions for other savings.A statement from Aberdeen City Council said: #As part of the consultation process, staff came forward with alternative operational suggestions for making efficiencies which can meet the target saving, and these include a number of ideas that cumulatively will reduce the operational costs of the service without impacting on working hours or any reduction in jobs.#The changes include amalgamating some collection routes, reviewing other ways of working, and reviewing collection routes and seasonal resource requirements.#A spokeswoman added: #We are pleased that staff engaged so positively and constructively and we thank them for that.#We considered every suggestion that was presented and we believe this is the right outcome at this time.“The service will continue to engage with staff.”"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column august 16 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsLet#s face it.

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives. There is also support for parents and carers.At SDS centres customers can get information, advice and guidance about jobs, the local labour market, training courses and apprenticeships as well as how to prepare for interviews and help with CVs and applications.The work of SDS careers advisers in schools and centres is supported by Scotland’s careers website myworldofwork, where you can access advice  hours a day.

It was fantastic to speak to so many of my constituents.It was also wonderful to see many local business stalls promoting Islay#s dynamic and booming economy.The show was well attended with lots of families, both local and visitors, having a fun day out and luckily the sun was shining most of the day.A huge thanks to all the organisers and everyone  who contributed to the event.Councillor Alastair RedmanSir,I have real concerns about the deteriorating condition of some Argyll cemeteries.Constituents from Islay recently joined Councillor Alastair Redman in highlighting the poor upkeep of cemeteries in the area he represents.Councillor Redman reported that there were also problems at other cemeteries in his ward, including the cemetery at Carradale in East Kintyre.I understand that Argyll and Bute Council confirmed that they now, at last, have plans in place to address the problems at Kilnaughton.It remains disappointing, however, that things are allowed to deteriorate to the extent that the maintenance of cemeteries has become a matter of public concern.Frankly, it is very surprising that a cemetery where interments are actually still taking place has been undermined in this way and there must surely be an obligation to ensure this doesn’t happen.My experience is that communities in the Highlands and Islands pay special regard to the final resting places of fellow members of their communities and will be perplexed to discover that they appear to be uncared-for.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSP"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures august 16 2019","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowTayvallich reader Colin MacInnes captured this photo of these two fluffy cygnets at the Corran Burn in Lochgilphead back in July.A couple of adult swans were spotted floating nearby at the time on Loch Fyne and Loch Gilp around Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column august 30 2019","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsIt is sad to see yet another Mid Argyll community organisation fold due to a lack of suitable volunteers.We seem to be so obsessed with staring at our own reflections on mobile phones these days that we are losing sight of the real world.Look around many community groups and you will notice that there are very few volunteers without the odd grey hair.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day. In addition, they may have to limit the potassium and phosphate in their diet which means missing out on enjoying foods like chocolate, bananas and tomatoes.We want to make the kidney diet about all the things patients can eat and bring enjoyment back into food # which is why we have launched the Kidney Kitchen.We hope that the Kidney Kitchen will mean everyone living with kidney disease in Scotland can enjoy healthy and delicious food with their family and friends.If you are, oryou know a kidney patient, check out www.kidneykitchen.orgEwen Maclean, advocacy officer Scotland, Kidney Care UKSir,The death of a pet cat can come as a shock, and many owners can find it dficult to come to terms with their loss.The death of a pet is not always seen as a signicant loss, leading some people to hide their feelings which can cause them to feel very alone.On Grief Awareness Day, August , Cats Protection is highlighting its free and confidential Paws to Listen support service, so people facing the loss of a cat do not have to feel alone.The service is available on   .

Last year, it rehomed over , domestic pets and successfully released , wild animals back to their natural environment. The society now also delivers industry-leading animal welfare educational programmes to people of all ages.In my short time with the society I know of hundreds of examples of our dedicated people going above and beyond to do all they can for the animals and humans they come across. So, I can only imagine how many fantastic stories must be out there about the people who’ve worn our unorm since we were formed.As well as those who have had a positive experience with us in the recent past, we are hoping to uncover some long lost tales from descendants of those we’ve touched in decades gone by.The society wants anyone with any interesting anecdotes or memorabilia to get in touch via the website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.Kirsteen Campbell, chief executive, Scottish SPCASir,The likelihood of the UK exiting the EU has now shted from ‘possible’ to ‘probable’.That gives greater focus to our efforts to prepare and proof our farming industry from the impacts of no deal.Whilst it always has been  the position of NFU Scotland that the UK must secure a favourable deal on the terms of exit with the EU, we must also support our industry through any change in the operating environment.Many NFU Scotland members might think that their businesses won’t be impacted, but the reality is that there will be implications for all of us. Some will be direct and immediate, and others more indirect and emerging through time – but the one certainty is that these will be felt by all of us involved in the agri-food chain.There are a few things that would make a big dferenceapplied right across the board in the UK.First, the UK Government’s proposed import tarf schedule desperately requires revision. It would expose some produce # specically cereals, oilseeds, potatoes, eggs and horticultural produce # to a tarf going into the EU, but would allow that same product to come into the UK with no tarf.This is farcical.To apply asymmetrical tarfs on any products between us and the EU is to completely misunderstand the nature of food security in the UK and fails to recognise that trade is vital to both the UK and the EU.One thing that can be done, regardless of Brexit, is for our own governments to prioritise using our own products when it comes to public procurement.All our politicians like to talk about how good our agricultural industry is in comparison to others across the world in terms of standards and environmental benefits, but we don’t see near enough in the way of Scottish or British products being prioritised for use in schools, hospitals and other public services.Yes, it may add one or two pence to a meal – but I would challenge governments and public procurement buyers what the real cost is of bringing products in from other parts of the world.These products certainly don’t meet our standards – not to mention the impact on climate change with food miles taken into consideration.It’s only a couple of years since the kids in our schools were getting their chicken from Thailand. Things are improving, but it’s still not Scottish chicken.This is within the gt of both Holyrood and Westminster, but it might just be the catalyst for governments to work with local authorities to do the right thing when it comes to feeding those who use our public services.Martin Kennedy, vice president, NFU ScotlandSir,I read with interest the letter from Doctor Strain in the August  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.Might I suggest that to produce a meaningful logo for the GP practices the following criteria are applied:The logo will need to show:May I suggest there are better ways to provide a service to treat patients, without resorting to gimmicks.Name and address supplied.Sir,I was intrigued to read Finlay Craig’s ramblings in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser.Would he be willing to share the location of his magical bramble bush for it appears the fruits of this bountul bush, when mixed into a pie, contain mystical properties that can transport the diner to another world May I suggest he tries a cold slice of reality pie now and again which would snap him out of his biased reverie and bring him back to the reality of the UK parliament being suspended and the Scottish representative of the party responsible for that outrageous manoeuvre vacating her post in protest In contrast, the Scottish government is working, along with others, to stop Scotland being dragged out of Europe against its wishes. Or perhaps the suspension of democracy is okay in his dream world If Mr Craig or any of his friends eat too much of his prodigious pie, I am sure they will not hesitate to avail themselves of a free prescription for their malaise and, should they need it, free bus travel to the chemist to pick it up, all supplied by the Scottish Government. If they live on one of our beautul islands, they can soon jump on one of the new ferries being completed as I write, again thanks to the Scottish Government.All this aside, when he rejoins us on planet earth, Mr Craig might think of entering his mysterious pie in the baking section of next year#s Mid Argyll Show, though I think by that time we may all be in need of something a little stronger from Scotland’s political larder to extract us from the bitter reality of Brexit Britain.Charles Ambrose, Lochgilphead.Sir,The National Autistic Society wants to find exceptional people, schools and services making a huge dference to autistic children and adults and their families.

It keeps its money as close to home as possible so that, amid historically drastic cuts, the amount spent locally has gone up as featured inon January ,  which notes #where other authorities privatise, Preston grows its own businesses#.Preston ensures that its resources prioritise local providers and businesses wherever possible. Argyll and Bute Council#s Procurement Strategy   falls some way short of this. Its stated aims commendably include:There is no particular emphasis, however, on using its resources to grow Argyll and Bute businesses, to reduce carbon emissions and food transport miles or to foster healthy eating strategies that would benefit our local farmers through #joining up the dots# of local supply and demand.The climate emergency demands a bolder and more innovative respond, and demands it now.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,I wish to comment on Mr Henderson#s  open letter to Brendan O#Hara in the September  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser.The expression #crash out# of Europe is used by Conservative members of parliament, the BBC and the press. While emotive, this is what many people directly affected by Brexit feel is happening.For example, on the matter of Germans buying our fish without a trade agreement the tarf will be  per cent on our fish exports to the EU. The Germans will no longer buy our fish.We can all read about other examples of the harm being done in the press every day. The cost of implementing a no deal exit will be borne by all of us, through further austerity , increased taxes , increased national debt or a combination of all three. To my mind, such measures will indeed cause serious economic and social harm.While Brendan O#Hara received a minority of the votes in Argyll, the present government was elected  by less than  per cent of the  electorate.David Inglis, Ardrishaig.Sir,During this, National Air Ambulance Week , may I draw readers# attention to the amazing work of the country#s only charity-funded air ambulance service # Scotland#s Charity Air Ambulance .Since  this le-saving service has been flying help and hope to communities all across Scotland in response to serious illness and injury.From our base at Perth Airport, we have responded to more than , time-critical emergencies and impacted on the lives of thousands # and the need goes on.The recently-established Scottish Trauma Network has seen four key major trauma centres created at hospitals in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee.

This occurs when cats come in contact with chemicals such as fuels, lubricants and some solvents.Usually, self-grooming causes the cat to ingest the toxin, or in some cases they inhale it which can cause a severe pneumonia.The toxin can cause problems throughout the body and on the skin too.When Jonny had examined Tikka, he immediately sent her to our Tranent surgery for blood tests and intravenous fluids as she was dehydrated.Fortunately, Tikkarsquos blood tests were normal so she did not have kidney damage.She tolerated her fluid therapy well and was soon looking much happier however several areas of her skin had become red and she was losing hair especially on her front legs.Tikka did not want to eat or drink. She was given analgesics, antibiotics and soothing cream was applied to her skin.Our nursing staff ensured she was as comfortable as possible and as she was not eating by herself, they fed her via a feeding tube several times a day.Her skin became red and thickened and some areas sloughed off.She had to have cream applied frequently to the damaged skin, just asshe had suffered burns.Tikka was finally well enough to go home where Mrs Taylor continued to treat her skin. Tikka started eating well again and is improving daily. Her fur is regrowing and soon she will have her beautul coat again.Now Mrs Taylor was very vigilant and realised she had to do something to help Tikka immediately.If you suspect your cat may have had contact with petroleum-based substances, please contact your vet as soon as possible.Often the first sign you may have is your pet smells of petrol or diesel.There may be vomiting or diarrhoea. They may actually be dizzy or confused or showing other neurological problems such as staggering and trembling. There may be respiratory signs such as coughing or wheezingthey have inhaled the chemical.Do not try to make your pet vomit as this can exacerbate the toxicity.The first thing you should do is try to remove the chemical from the fur.In many cases, it is best to bring your pet straight to your vets as soon as possible. The nursing staff at veterinary practices are well trained in dealing with intoxication emergencies.With petroleum products there are three main areas where the body can be affected: l The internal organs especially the kidneys, so your vet will want to blood sample your pet to check for any damage to the kidneys or other organsl The respiratory system can be affected especiallythe toxin is inhaled. This often happensthe patient vomits then inhales some resulting in a very severe pneumonia. Your vet may wish to take x-rays to check for this.l The animalrsquos skin can also be affected. The petroleum products sit on the fur then soaks through to the skin where they are held in contact by the fur. This causes them to act as a caustic substance, damaging the skin and hair follicles. Often the first sign before the skin damage is seen is hair loss due to the follicle damage.The treatment for these causes is supportive at all times. There are no specic antidotes. Intravenous fluids are administered, this helps overcome dehydration and helps eliminate toxins from the body.Analgesics are given to help keep pain from damaged skin and internal organs to a minimum.Antibiotics are given, as damaged skin is very prone to secondary infection and they are always givenpneumonia is present. Skin treatment has to be intense to keep infection to a minimum and encourage damaged skin to recover.Thankfully Tikka has made an excellent recovery, thanks to Mrs Taylorrsquos quick thinking and the intense nursing care given by the nursing team at Dunedin Vets."},{"url":null,"title":"tim-39-s-tales-magic-real-39-s-around-us","story":"Of course, in stories magic is very real a frog or beast can transform into a prince, dragons and witches can fly, animals can talk, wishes can be granted by faeries and spells cast by wizards.

Itrsquos just that we have stopped noticing the magic that is real.In our world, a frog may not turn into a prince with a kiss, but a caterpillar turns into a butterfly, a tadpole into a frog.And such magic is all around us. Leaves change colour with the seasons, magic transformation is everywhere. Animals do talk, any dog lover will tell us that.Have you ever seen a hare and made eye contact and felt the connection or watched a squirrel hide nuts, and then come up to you asking for more Walk in a wood, or by a riverbank, or just sit in your garden or a park and the magic is all around you. We watched wood pigeons nest in a small elder tree outside our front window over the summer. Two eggs hatched and we watched as they were fed and finally flew the nest. It was, truly, magic.The magic all around us is still vast, and we could all make our own list the sound of birdsong, watching a butterfly flutter, a spiderrsquos web decorated with dew, the glimpse of a deer in a wood, the mist wrapped mountains, a red sparkling cloud during sunset, a wee beastie under a rock as it scampers for cover, the whisper of an ancient tree and the sweet smell of a wood.But I believe that sadly too many of us donrsquot notice real magic anymore.And when we donrsquot notice something we donrsquot feel connected to it, so we donrsquot care about it. And when we donrsquot care about it we donrsquot protect or value it.And when we donrsquot value it, we canrsquot feel the wonder and sense of awe it creates. And so we trash it, ignore and neglect it, exploit it. And we forget we are part of this magic that we are sons and daughters of nature too. And so we disconnect ourselves from what can truly make us feel happy, and instead drug ourselves with the articial magic of our own technology which makes us feel all powerful.But the truth is we are not.Ultimately we rely on the natural environment for our physical and emotional well-being, as much as the creatures we are making extinct.We need nature, it doesnrsquot need us, and eventually it is in control. Asto make this point huge waves hit the rocks of Prestonpans in a storm not so long ago, drenching the nearby houses in a display of naturersquos power. It was scary but also spectacular.In  such a storm was believed to have been the result of magic conjured by the ldquoNorth Berwick Witches.That storm, like the recent one, was indeed magic, conjured by nature, which can whip up a whirlwind more effectively than any wizard or witch.Magic is real.

later Herbert Coutts, of the community council, suggested it would be ldquobest-served being demolished.Plans to breathe new le into the building and turn it into ldquoa multi-al community space stalled, despite Trainspotting author Irvine Welsh and comedian and radio presenter Fred MacAulay backing the campaign.Mr Adams has written to Angela Leitch, chief executive of East Lothian Council, regarding funding for the building.He stressed the work at the venue would not be on a par with the previous plans to bring it back to le but would simply improve it and make it into a storage area or workshop.A spokesman for East Lothian Council confirmed an application for pound, had been considered by the area partnership, with the Christmas Lights group given pound, last

Landlords or letting agents who are the account holders for energy bills on their property should ask their energy supplier for a smart meter to be installed.Tenants who are the energy account holders should contact their energy supplier directly to ask for a smart meter. Smart meters can remove the hassle of working out how much is owed when they move out of a property and will also help when iding bills amongst flatmates.However, some tenants are hesitant to request a smart meter fitting as they think it is the landlord or letting agentrsquos responsibility. Therefore, itrsquos a good idea to let your tenants know that yoursquore happy for them to have one fitted.Housing associations should provide information to their tenants about the benefits of smart meters, such as the fact that tenants will always know what they are paying for their energy - with a smart meter, they get an easy-to-understand portable display that shows exactly what they are spending in near real time. More transparency around energy usage and costs will help people avoid getting into debt with their energy supplier. The display also shows exactly how much gas and electricity is being used, so tenants will be able to make informed decisions about what appliances might be more costly to use and where they can save both energy and money.Smart meters are a vital investment in the energy infrastructure of Scotland, England and Wales, delivering benefits beyond personal energy savings. And with over  million already installed across Great Britain, many letting agents, landlords, housing associations and tenants are already playing their part in helping to create a more sustainable energy system for the future.Getting a smart meter: FAQsIrsquom a landlord or letting agent, can I arrange a smart meter installation Whoever pays the gas and electricity bills can ask for a smart meter to be fitted. If you pay the energy bills for a tenanted property, you can arrange an installation and should speak to the tenant about an appropriate time for the installation.If your tenant pays the bills, you may wish to provide them with information about the benefits of smart meters and let them know that you are happy for them to arrange an installation.How can Housing Associations get involved There are a number of ways in which you can help support this rollout, includingWho installs the smart meter A qualied installer sent by your energy supplier will fit your new smart meter at the time agreed when arranging your installation. They will show you a photo ID card before they start and they will never request or accept financial payment.This article was paid for by Smart Energy GB. Smart Energy GB is a government backed organisation tasked with informing Great Britain about the benefits of the smart meter rollout."},{"url":null,"title":"Rosemary Goring  If we want to end sectarianism  we must abolish Catholic schools","story":"Glasgow Councilrsquos ban on a number of Loyalist and Republican marches and parades in the city last weekend led not to an outbreak of peace, as had been hoped, but to an angry demonstration in George Square.According to Tom Wood, former Deputy Chief Constable of Lothian and Borders police, the scenes of vocerous protest were reminiscent of the gilets jaunes in France, or recent pro-democracy clashes with police in Hong Kong. Wood denounced the councilrsquos decision to block the parades as ldquostupid. This seems harsh, although the immediate backlash does show this cautionary step backfired. As Wood commented in a newspaper article, outright bans simply allow resentment to fester and violence to erupt where.Explosions of sectarian aggression and abuse are an obvious outrage, but even entirely peaceful religious marches through Glasgow are a blot on the cityrsquos reputation. Whenever a Grand Orange Lodge goes past, banging drums, playing flutes and waving banners, I feel I have stepped back three centuries. In theory, Orange marches are harmless and legitimate expressions of faith and historical commemoration. In practice, in the west of the country at least, they are the unlit end of a fuse that doesnrsquot take much to ignite. Everyone knows these are potentially inflammatory occasions, and a marching season that passes without incident is the very definition of a miracle.As is all too evident, sectarian prejudice is alive and well. Those who say it is nearly extinct are either optimists or judge todayrsquos level of confrontation against a much bloodier and more ignorant past. By that measure, certainly, things are considerably better than they were even as recently as when I joined this newspaper when on my first day a new colleague commented on the arrival of yet another Protestant. Anti-discrimination laws have helped promote more enlightened attitudes, but even without this statutory inducement to scrupulous fairness, the majority of us these days make no distinction between Catholic and Protestant,indeed we even notice it at all.:Faith no more  Have catholic schools had their day, asks Kevin McKennaThe country has come a long way since the Church of Scotlandrsquos disgraceful and virulent anti-Catholicism in the s, and the barefaced discrimination and hurtful jibes Catholics of all ranks endured. No wonder separate schools were considered necessary. Yet while levels of abuse and discrimination are dramatically lower than before, in some quarters hoary old grievances and antediluvian attitudes continue to smoulder.You could argue that the answer is education: an ongoing challenging of closed minds that will eventually lead to a state where nobody cares what religion other people follow. It is Tom Woodrsquos contention, however, that in order to eradicate sectarianism we need to abolish Catholic schools. These, he believes, are the root of the problem.With some reluctance, I have to agree their time is up. This, despite knowing that endorsing this view would appear to be rejecting the liberal values that I consider essential for a fair and well-run country. If parents wish to send their children to a school whose principles are guided by the Catholic faith ndash or any other for that matter ndash surely they should be allowed that choice  By all accounts, the education students receive in Catholic schools is impressive, and in some cases so enviable that lapsed members of the church appear to have a Damascene reawakening in order to get their offspring into the classroom.Yet the existence of this archaic system of schooling is tangible evidence of a problem that refuses to wither. From early childhood, separate schools reinforce the idea of dference, segregation and distinction. Whatever side of that school fence you walk, you are made aware from Primary One onwards of the concept of Them and Us.Therersquos another distasteful aspect of segregated schools too. Richard Dawkinsrsquos new book, Outgrowing God, which is aimed at young readers, tries to help ldquobreak the cycle of indoctrination. That word will be offensive to those who think they are doing their best by their children in instructing them in their own religious beliefs and culture, be they Catholic, Protestant, Muslim or Jew. But, even when done with the best intentions, sending a child to a school affiliated to a church is a form of intellectual and emotional programming. It represents the opposite of liberal values.:Catholic schools are rated higher by inspectorsFor as long as it is possible to put a child through a denominational education, society is tacitly acknowledging the power of religion to define who people are. In an age when the state is increasingly non-religious in its decision-making, in order to maintain strict neutrality and equality, it makes no sense. When single-sex institutions are frowned upon as out-dated, when discrimination based on ethnicity, background or sexual orientation is considered abhorrent, it seems odd that this particular expression of dference is allowed to continue. Onlysectarianism were unheard of, rather than a persistent blight, would it ndash just about ndash be acceptable.Back in the real world, the existence of educational pigeon-holes like these means there is little hope of religious bigotry being eradicated. Those on either side of the school gates live in an environment that allows this shameful stain on our country to persist, and even flourish. Initiatives to raise awareness or to banish deep-rooted prejudices can never be wholly successful so long as the public statement of religious identity is allowed such a state-sanctioned .This is not to attack faith itself. What iniduals choose to believe, and the ways in which they introduce children to their religion or creed at home, is their business. Nor should schools cease to teach pupils about world religions, or to help them understand the huge cultural influence that Christianity, both Catholic and Protestant, has exerted on countless aspects of our lives, for good and ill.Complete integration, however, should be the goal. The building blocks of society must mirror the kind of world we want future generations to inherit. No matter how you look at it, denominational schools have become an anomaly. If sectarianism is to become a thing of the past, then so should they."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/10428582.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scotlands-economy-brink-recession","story":"Official figures found Scottish GDP fell by . per cent in the second quarter of the year.Two consecutive quarters of negative growth is the technical definition of a recession.SNP Finance Secretary Derek Mackay blamed Brexit.The UK economy shrank by .% over the same period.Over the year to June, Scottish GDP grew by just .% compared to .% for the UK.A key factor in the latest figures was a see-sawing of business activity on either side of the original Brexit deadline of March .In the quarter ahead of the date, many firms stockpiled goods in case of no-deal, with the increased economic activity lting GDP.After the deadline was extended, that process went into reverse as firms ran down their stocks and economic activity sagged.\"@context\": \"https:schema.org\",\"@type\": \"VideoObject\",\"name\": \"Countdown to Brexit:  days until Britain leaves the EU\",\"description\": \"Countdown to Brexit:  days until Britain leaves the EU\",\"thumbnailUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer v media sfpYlAw poster.jpg width\",\"uploadDate\": \"--T::+:\",\"duration\": \"PDTHMS\",\"contentUrl\": \"https:cdn.jwplayer manests sfpYlAw.mu\",\"embedUrl\": \"https:www.heraldscotland video  \",\"publisher\": \"@type\": \"Organization\",\"name\": \"HeraldScotland\",\"logo\": \"@type\": \"ImageObject\",\"url\": \"https:www.heraldscotland sitelogo \",\"width\": ,\"height\": A fallback in food and draink and pharmaceutical industries, which helped drive the .% rise in Scottish GDP in the first quarter, accounted for the whole .% fall in the second.Mr Mackay said: ldquoGiven the repeated warnings from business organisations and the contraction across the UK in the same quarter, it is unsurprising but deeply frustrating that we are now seeing the Brexit impact on the Scottish economy.\"The responsibility for this contraction lies entirely with the UK Government.ldquoWe are already taking steps to protect jobs and our economy from Brexit but not every impact can be mitigated.

More of us outside than in, it would seem ndash at times the flies on the wall in this fly-on-the-wall seemed to outnumber the journalists.The documentary began in , around the closure of the Sunday Herald newspaper, and the bold inception of two new ones ndash the Herald on Sunday and the Sunday National. Filmmaker Sarah Howitt must have been one of the few people glad to be there during a period of turbulence.Yet, while the viewer saw an ambitious new media venture, those who know the dark realities of modern newspapers could smell the gunpowder. Look there, just in the back of the shot. See the casualties of balanced budgets shuffling off down Renfield Streethellip The downturn in papers was acknowledged, and a senior editorial meeting left viewers and readers in no doubt about how todayrsquos executive newspapermen ndash and in most papers itrsquos still men ndash see the digital versus print conundrum playing out.Howitt did well to eke some subtle, telling character quirks out of those whose job is often to do the same themselves. Therersquos Richard, the Sunday National editor in Marlon Brandorsquos biker jacket. Kathleen, the political reporter without a smartphone, a mind yet to be addled by the compulsion to scroll. Kirsty, taking pictures in the rain for  years. Andy, assistant editor, always missing the bus.Wersquove yet to see the political dference between the papers laid bare, or the valiant battle mounted by the Evening Times, once the le and soul of Glasgow, against free newspapers and robust digital competition. Nor have we yet been privy to the harsh conversations about inidual futures, which take place behind closed doors.Yet despite the sense of inevitability, what The Papers revealed was a people resolute in their determination that their work mattered. And as one of their number, I offer a defiant cheer from the coffee shop.This is the second such documentary from BBC Scotland following rsquos The Paper Thistle, about The Scotsman. Editors of Scotlandrsquos other leading dailies must now justiably be wondering when they get their go on the telly in these days of dwindling newspaper sales.My first job in papers was delivering The Herald to the posh houses in Kilmacolm as a  year old. My first proper byline was as a student in The Evening Times. As David Leask put it, therersquos ink inside the veins, and one scene more than any other caught the breath.It was the sight of print presses in full flight, winged rollercoasters of ink on page, the collective endeavour of those whose place is to report, reflect, provoke, illuminate, inform, chronicle and entertain.Whatever  this documentary achieves, letrsquos hope itrsquos an appreciation of the value, importance and future of what we do.

My cousins will back me up on this, Im sure: our grans were the benchmark of classic grandmotherliness.On her th birthday, in these pages, I lamented that proper grannies are about to go extinct.At the loss of one more I reflected on that again.

My grans could knit, darn and sew .As standard, they could take a pattern and make a dress just as readily as going to the shops. Disposable fashion  No, not after all that effort and certainly not that level of waste - they lived through rationing, you know.Cooking for young women fell out of favour as anti-feminist but these grans could cook and bake, with recipes written on paper, and they would comfort you with food.Any time I visited Granny P the tea and biscuits would be on bone china and cups would rest on saucers.

Nobody is suggesting perfection, but when Mr Bone writes about an \"SNP-dominated Scotland\" he should remember that the SNP is only dominant in Scotland because the voters have awarded it their trust, voting it into power for a third consecutive term at Holyrood and into first place at the EU elections last May.As for \"Scotlands sensible and stoic past\", I believe I am correct in remembering that in the late s when the very idea of a Scottish Parliament was ridiculed by most Unionists, that the amount of time Westminster devoted to purely Scottish affairs was  hours per year. With the SNP as the third-largest party at Westminster these days are in the past and in the past they must remain Scotland has come a long way with the SNP, and the winning post is in sight.Ruth Marr, Stirling.Read more: David Cameron secretly asked the Queen to back the Union in the  Scottish independence campaign"},{"url":null,"title":"ben-nevis-lit-keep-mountain-peak","story":"A record number of walkers and climbers scaled the UKrsquos highest mountain last year.Overall, an astonishing , people conquered the Ben in , according to figures from the charity which manages the ,ft Highland peak.On the busiest days, more than , hikers, runners and charity racers trekked to the summit ndash leading to ldquolong tailbacks at certain points on the main path.Now up to  walkers will scale the peak at night tomorrow to raise money for the Nevis Fund, which is administered by the Nevis Landscape Partnership, with music, poetry and light to add to the experience.: Ben Nevis tragedy climber: \"I wish we had not done that climb\"The Nevis Landscape Partnership is a collective of environmental organisations, local and national, working together to protect and enhance the land of and surrounding Ben Nevis.Among those benefiting will be Lochaber Mountain Rescue Team, who carry out around  rescues on the Ben each year.The event has been organised by well-known mountain guide Mike Pescod of Abacus Mountain Guides.Mr Pescod said that around pound, had been spent on repairing the bottom end of the path in recent years but that money had now come to an end.ldquoThere is no central regular fund for maintenance of the path and it is getting busier and busier.

It was a great insight into the everyday challenges of producing the Scottish press at a time of huge material change for the industry.I was impressed by the passion and dedication of the reporters, editors and designers who put together venerable Scottish titles like The Herald and new newspapers like The National and Sunday National.As a regular reader of all three titles Irsquom very grateful for the heroic efforts that go into each issue!Alex Benchimol, GlasgowThe BBC programme, The Papers, increased our awareness of the rapid changes which have taken place within many occupations in recent years. None more so than in the ways by which news, whether domestic or international, is obtained and disseminated.The challenge facing the newspaper industry was brought home clearly in the programme with editors balancing print and digital output. The reliance on freelance contributors was a further indication of the reduction in the numbers of those employed directly in the industry and it was clear that the remaining permanent staff were skilled at performing many roles. It was a sign of the times that the Editor-in-chief, Donald Martin, was responsible for overseeing the production of three titles.While the time honoured expression ldquoHold the front page was not recorded, it was clear that the pressure to produce a topical front page in time to meet the production deadline is just as much to the fore as in times past.There seemed little scope for pursuing investigative journalism given the reduced level of funding, though it is possible that this aspect of journalism may be covered in the next episode.In a changing world, the programme provided a valuable insight into how the newspaper industry is, of necessity, adapting to the ways in which we communicate.It emphasised the responsibility which journalists have to maintain the high level of integrity in the industry in the face of others who would attempt to undermine the trust of readers through their attempts to spread ldquofake news.Malcolm Allan, BishopbriggsIrsquove signed up and subscribed to Herald Scotland this morning as a direct result of the first episode of The Papers documentary, which I thought was fantastic.I have been takingnews for free for years ndash but the programme made me clearly and deeply understand the importance of impartial newsand the thought of losing this vitally important voice and resource would be incredibly damaging.

The loss of forest, habitat and wildle is shocking to witness. In Scotland, as in the Amazon, a great forest has been here before but has now gone after centuries of use, depleted until the final old trees decline and fall. Across the Scottish Highlands, over many centuries, grazing by goats, sheep, cattle and wild deer along with felling for timber and farmland, has removed this precious woodland from the hills of Scotland. We need that great forest again ndash now more than ever. Capturing carbon, helping community resilience, reducing flooding risk, improving soils, nurturing bioersity and offering a wonderland for people to explore ndash these are some of the benefits that a rewilded Caledonian Forest can bring.While human activity has been the cause of the loss of so much forest in Scotland and around the world, people are vital to its future. Much of the work Trees for Le has done so far has been with the help of thousands of volunteers who have joined us toforest to remote mountains. As we work in more places at a bigger scale we know that landowners, local communities and businesses need to thrive alongside the wild forest. This means working together to strike the right balance between a forest that can take care of itself and humans being able to make a living from it. The Trees for Le vision is of a revitalised wild forest in the Scottish Highlands, providing space for wildle to flourish and communities to thrive.We welcome action that shines a light on the climate crisis. It is time for those who hold power, from landowners to Governments, to act on what the science has been telling us for decades. We believe that rewilding answers many of the urgent questions climate change is asking. We also recognise it is not the only solution. A mix of solutions is requiredwe are to reverse the effects of humankindrsquos damage to the environment.Scotland was the first country in the world to declare a climate emergency. As a nation leading this agenda we must recognise the time for discussion and debate is over. The solutions to reverse the effects of climate change are available now. Our children are asking for action now. We must respond with action now.bull Steve Micklewright is CEO of Trees for Le:CLAIRE MACKWith some of the planetrsquos most ambitious renewable energy and carbon targets, Scotland is already a world leader on climate action.The Scottish Renewable Energy Festival, which is underway right now , is highlighting our industryrsquos successes to date and our ambitious plans for the future.The announcement earlier this month that the UNrsquos th climate change conference is coming to Glasgow in  gives us a new opportunity, too.Itrsquos an opportunity to make Scotland one of the most climate-savvy nations on Earth.And thatrsquos an opportunity with energy at its heart.Globally, the energy industry is on a multi-trillion dollar journey to decarbonisation, but the production of energy is still one of the largest sources of the carbon emissions which are damaging our planet.Yes, Scotlandrsquos electricity sector no longer belches smoke skywards, and this is certainly something to be proud of.But heat makes up almost double the carbon emissions of electricity. We havenrsquot even scratched the surface of decarbonising it.Transport, too, is a huge issue, and one which can only be resolvedthe public changes the habits of a letime.Those of us who drive a petrol car know its emissions are an issue. But the excuses for choosing fossil fuel over an electric vehicle are all too easy to come up with.And itrsquos the same for heat. When your boiler breaks down, would you be willing to pay more in the short-term for a heat pump, or connect to a district heating network Again, the excuses are many: the short-term costs are too high. The long-term benefits of these choices are too distant. Itrsquos easier to stick our heads in the sand.But therersquos only so long we can ignore the truth: climate change is a threat multiplier.A poll this week found climate breakdown is viewed as the most important issue facing the world, ahead of migration, terrorism and the global economy.Therersquos no more important aspect of our lives to rethink than how we, personally, tackle it.Todayrsquosprotests are part of that story, but so too are the energy industryrsquos actions.The Scottish Renewable Energy Festival is an opportunity to look forward, past COP and medium-term targets, to a low-carbon energy system with renewables at its heart.Irsquom proud that my industry is doing so much to achieve that vision, and heartened that so many people share it.bull Claire Mack, is Chief Executive at Scottish Renewables: The full list of climate strikes taking place across ScotlandMARK RUSKELLThis week the figurehead of the climate strikers, Greta Thunberg, was in front of US Congress.ldquoI donrsquot want you to listen to me, I want you to listen to the scientists, she told US lawmakers.Instead of a written submission, the Swedish teenager handed over the landmark IPCC report, published last year, which gives governments only a decade to slow global warming.That stark warning, based on scientic evidence and which governments signed up to, is what our young people are articulating through direct action today.Thousands of Scottish children and young people share Gretarsquos message. They are telling us to look at the scientic evidence which tells us that the majority of fossil fuels must be left in the ground. They are telling us to plant more trees and save endangered species. They are telling us to get on with it, fast.The Scottish Government claim to be listening to them, butwe look at what our leaders are actually offering in , it seems to me that the message is just not getting through.For example, Nicola Sturgeon likes to talk about Scotlandrsquos lsquoworld-leading targetsrsquo to reduce emissions. But the timescale bares little resemblance to the ten years the IPCC gives us for meaningful change. By the time we meet the net-zero target of , the IPCCrsquos point of nowill be  years old. Greta Thunberg will be .I will be putting forward an amendment to the Scottish Governmentrsquos climate bill which will see an % reduction in emissions by the IPCCrsquos deadline, and I hope that every MSP will put our common future first and back it.But targets arenrsquot enough. Indeed, Scotland missed its existing emissions targets last year.Ultimately, itrsquos action that counts. Bold, ambitious action like a nation-wide programme of works to make every home in Scotland warm, efficient and low carbon, shting billions out of new motorways and into public transport up so people donrsquot need to rely on cars, and reforesting Scotland up to at least the European average.My fear is that this message has not got through to the majority of politicians in Holyrood and around the world. Rhetoric and eye-catching targets will not meet the demands of young people. Next weekrsquos vote on the climate bill must mark the beginning of transformative change.Like Greta told Congress, our young people are telling the UK and Scottish Governments: ldquoYoursquore not trying hard enough.bull Mark Ruskell is MSP for Mid Scotland and FeDR RICHARD DIXONWhen I met -year-old Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg briefly at the climate summit in Katowice in Poland last year I thanked her for all she was doing to bring attention to the need for more climate action. At that point she had been holding her own personal climate strike outside the Swedish Parliament for five months. This had sparked a global movement of school children striking for the climate and, already on her meteoric rise to global prominence, she at the climate conference to give a speech in front of the UN Secretary General.Of course since then she has spoken at the World Economic Forum, in front of huge crowds in a number of languages and to EU leaders. And she has just sailed across an ocean so she can speak at the UN climate summit in New York next week. Politicians who care about climate change are queuing up to be seen with her and last week she was protesting outside the White House with thousands of US students.The movement she started has gone from strength to strength, becoming the largest youth-led movement ever. There have been school strikes across the world and a week of action starts today with millions of people ndash children and adults this time - expected to take part in thousands of marches, rallies and strikes in  countries.Today there will be climate strikes in at least  places in Scotland, including marches with thousands of people expected in Edinburgh and Glasgow.Irsquove been outside Parliament several times to see the climate strikes including the two very impressive big rallies, one where about , young people came and went over a number of hours. The children had organised all this themselves.Over the last decade Irsquove mostly found the speeches at rallies and marches rather dull ndash even when itrsquos me giving the speech! But the children outside Parliament gave speech after speech that was really worth listening to.Irsquoll be there again today because it is really inspiring and heart-warming to see young people and their supporters taking action in such huge numbers on climate change. It is young peoplersquos future that we are all trashing with our lack of urgent action after all.

TThe festival was founded on the premise that shared cinematic experiences can support, ignite and sustain peoplersquos social change journeys: our programme offers audiences an opportunity to see the change they want to be.Exploring, questioning and challenging how we relate to global issues is the drive behind our work ndash and there are few global issues more pressing than climate change. Our Shared Planet strand interrogates current environmental challenges in the face of growing climate chaos and asks how we move beyond awareness ndash to meaningful action. Two of the films selected celebrate the role of youth activism in pushing the climate agenda forward. Grit explores a young womanrsquos evolving sense of her power as an activist, in an Indonesian community devastated by a fracking disaster.Inventing Tomorrow , sees teenage science students tackle some of the most pressing dangers faced by their communities, at the forefront of environmental destruction.Connecting with local issues is also crucial. The question at the heart of French documentary Time of Forests ndash the need to preserve forests as wild nature, not as tree plantations, and the potential role of rewilding in re-dressing bioersity ndash is particularly pertinent for Scotland, while Eating up Easterhas obvious echoes for Scotlandrsquos many island communities.Soyalism investigates the effects of industrialised meat production on humans, animals and the planet, while the latest film by photographer Edward Burtynsky, Anthropocene, explores the irreparable ways in which human activity has been transforming the planet over the last century.Many of the screenings are presented in partnership with members of Stop Climate Chaos Scotland all screenings are followed by audience discussions with campaigners, activists, scientists and journalists.

don#t act now to meet growing public pressure to tackle the global climate emergency risk being left behind.That’s the warning from Zero Waste Scotland which says organisations must do more and examine how they produce, consume and dispose of everyday items just to stay in the race – and urges them to embrace the circular economy.Zero Waste Scotland stresses firms achieving a more sustainable way of working would deliver huge results in cutting Scotland’s carbon footprint. This is because four fths of Scotland’s carbon footprint is generated through the heat and energy required to grow, make, process, transport and provide materials that are often tossed aside at the end of their le.Only by considering how to make products with less reliance on raw materials, and by remaking items at the end of their original le into goods that can be used time and again, will businesses be able to signicantly reduce global emissions.Iain Gulland, chief executive of Zero Waste Scotland, who launched the organisation’s corporate plan before an auduence of business leaders last week, said: “We must radically change the way we think about and consume our goods and materials, and we must do that now.” “Too many businesses assume that reducing the cost to the planet means increasing costs for them. “But as we have and will continue to make clear, the opportunities are plentul, with massive savings to be made. “The current way of working cannot continue in the years ahead and successfully adopting a circular economy approach is the only long-term option.”Everything has value and in a circular economy nothing should be wasted. In simple terms, it can be explained as ‘make, use, remake’ as opposed to ‘make, use, dispose’. The ultimate goal is to maintain and improve our quality of le, while simultaneously reducing our material consumption and, by extension, our impact on the planet.Mr Gulland added: “Many Scottish firms are already leading the way, with our help, changing how they design and trade goods to keep materials in use for as long as possible to maximise their value. “Successful circular economy enterprises range from refurbishing computers and upcycling furniture to producing sustainable animal feed using waste generated by our world-famous whisky industry.”data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.kincardineshireobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Felicitasis just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"   is just one of the many children supported by Marys Meals.\"  Throw a Porridge Party for Mary’s MealsviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.kincardineshireobserver webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Left to right - Fiona Cooper, treasurer, Katrina Suer, chair, and Catherine Houston, vice-chair\"  Scouts plea for hut renovation support viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"KINC | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"KINC | Article Teaser\"Zero Waste Scotland estimates that the circular economy would save Scottish businesses collectively at least £ billion every year through benefits including the creation of longer-lasting relationships with customers, as firms switch from a model centred on simply selling products to providing products as services.

Successful generators still sell the electricity they produce on the wholesale market but receive a #top-up# payment over the course of the -year contract.Changes made to rules which had forbidden all onshore wind projects from competing in the electricity market in  meant projects in the Western Isles, Shetland and Orkney were able to compete.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “The UK is leading the way in the fight against climate change, and it’s great news that millions more homes will be powered by clean energy at record low prices.“Seizing the opportunities of clean energy not only helps to protect our planet, but will also back businesses and boost jobs across the UK.”Though they may have won favour with the government, Hoolan#s two Orkney projects have previously been met with protest from the public and rejection by councillors. More than  protestors took to School Place, last September, when the projects appeared before the OIC planning committee. Though there were no statutory objections to either project, there were  letters of objection and  of support for the Costa project. The Hesta Project, meanwhile, received a total of  objections and nine letters of support.Though councillors elected to reject the wind farms, this decision was later overturned by the Scottish Government. This sparked criticism from former planning chairman, Councillor Owen Tierney, who accused the government of #lacking faith# in the local planning system.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I look forward to the project progressing.”Led by ZeroAvia, developers of hydrogen fuel cell powertrain solutions, HyFlyer will demonstrate a phased approach from battery power to hydrogen power, integrating the new technology aboard a Piper M-class six-seater aircraft which will perform test flights out of Cranfield and Orkney.Project partners Intelligent Energy will optimise its high power fuel cell technology for application in aviation while EMEC Hydrogen, producers of green hydrogen from renewable energy, will supply the hydrogen required for flight tests and develop a mobile refuelling  compatible with the plane.The HyFlyer project will see conventional piston engines in propeller aircraft replaced by electric motors, hydrogen fuel cells and gas storage.If all goes well, ZeroAvia, based in Calornia, are aiming to supply the technology to commercial manufacturers by .Following this demonstration, the next goal then is to power an aircraft, carrying up to  passengers, to travel  miles.According to the Air Transport Action Group, aviation is responsible for  per cent of CO emissions from all transport sources and is one of the fastest growing sources of global emissions.Val Mtakhov, founder and CEO of ZeroAvia, said: “The substantial backing provided by the UK Government underlines the potential that hydrogen holds as a fuel source for commercial aviation and provides signicant validation of ZeroAvia’s approach to zero emission flight.“Our project goal of  NM is equivalent to the distance from London to Edinburgh and will prove that zero emission aviation, powered by hydrogen, can play a key role within the UK and other countries’ transport strategies — enabling net zero targets to be met and improving productivity and regional prosperity.”Richard Ainsworth, Hydrogen Project Specialist at EMEC Hydrogen, said: “HyFlyer is another key step in Orkney’s aim to decarbonise leline transport services for islanded communities.#Hydrogen has the potential to help meet our emission commitments where electrons and batteries can’t.#This project sees us one step closer to meeting our fuel and energy needs from abundant local renewable energy resources using green hydrogen.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

All energy consumers pay for the cost of investment in new network capacity so the regulator ensures that it obtains the best deal possible for them.Ofgem launched a consultation in December last year on proposed changes to SSEN’s plan in an effort to ensure value for money for consumers.Following consideration of consultation responses and further analysis, the regulator has decided to approve the plan subject to the conditions set out in its decision.Approval is conditional on a total of at least MW of new wind farm projects on Orkney either being awarded a Contract for Dferenceor being judged likely to be developed by December .Ofgem would expect to be satisfied that new wind farm projects are likely to be developed despite not being awarded a CfDan independent audit states that the project is financially viable, has signed a relevant grid connection agreement and has been granted planning permission.However, SSEN has stated disappointment that the regulator is maintaining its position that the MW of new renewable electricity generation needs to secure planning permission and demonstrate financial viability prior to granting approval for the construction of the link.Ofgem has extended the date in which developers need to meet these conditions from December  to December .

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable.

Launched officially on July , it was a case of getting straight down to business! The volunteers cover quite a large area, including Broughshane, Kells, Ballymena and the surrounding rural local areas.The group has  volunteers, however by August it had responded to  purple and red incidents in support of the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service.This translates into  inidual responses. The group prefers to send more than one responder to each patient in case their needs are beyond the capacity of a single person. Cardiac arrest is a case in point and while only three of patients have been in this specic condition, many more have been suffering from chest pain.Responders grow in experience and expertise, with the group aiming to have an experienced person at each incident to support them. The four committee members have ided this task between them.The more active members are learning fast, particularly through their exposure to NIAS crews and rapid response paramedics, who have been patient and helpful with them.The group held their second monthly members meeting and training event at the end of August and used this to reflect on their experiences, share what they had learned and build vital patient care competence.More members are needed and they are asking people to get in touchthey want to volunteer. Working with the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service and Dalriada Urgent Care, there is a planning and training programme organised for January soyou are interested check the group out on Facebook.The group posted recently: “One thing has become clear in the course of our first month’s activity -we need to recruit and train more responders. “We are working with NIAS on dates for another training course and this will determine our recruitment timetable.”A spokesperson added: “We owe huge thanks to those who made our new service possible.“The people and organisations who contributed so generously to help us meet our funding needs.“The NIAS Community Resuscitation Development Team, who guided us through the complexities of setting up the scheme, trained our members for us and continue to support us.“The Governance team at Dalriada Urgent Care, who supported us in our recruitment efforts and other vital matters such as insurance.“The front line staff of NIAS who have supported and guided us on scene.“And, last but certainly not least, our volunteers, who continue to give the community their time and newly-acquired expertise and to meet their new challenges with great resilience and good humour.“Its a privilege to work with you.”Follow the Braid Valley Community First Responders on Facebook to keep up to date with all their news and to see how you can become involved.

Lea explained to Phil and Holly how she had been spurred on by Gareth’s kindness to carry on the good gesture: “I know it wasn’t absolutely the same circumstances, but I just thought I wanted to do a good gesture for somebody  so I paid off the same amount that he’d paid off our cake onto someone ’s. It carries on the story as well.”Gareth and his we Kirsty, who live between Loughbrickland and Rathfriland on the outskirts of Banbridge, were then introduced.Lea Ni Bhriain on This MorningTheir daughter Hannah Stella Bronte was born prematurely on September ,  weighing just two pounds, five and half ounces.

Bangladesh finally won its freedom from East Pakistan in  after a bloody, -month war of independence which left up to three million dead.Of late the developing country has been in the headlines for providing shelter to , Rohingya who have fled persecution in neighbouring Myanmar.“Coláiste Feirste was honoured to welcome the Bangladeshi delegation,” said Seán Mistéil. “Minister Chowdhuryexplained the importance of mother languages to nation building and economic well-being. That resonated powerfully with our students.”Minister Chowdhury toured the site of the Gaeltacht Quarter’s next development project: a triangle of disused land which represents one of the last building sites fronting the Falls Road.“We have bold plans to transform this triangle of land into a Gaeltacht housing and tourism project,” added the Coláiste Feirste Chairman. “This vibrant and visionary social development initiative will promote the collective economic capacity of the wider Spórtlann na hÉireann and Coláiste Feirste site. We believe that maximising this hub of interdependent and unique elements is best achieved through a one site vision that connects all of its parts. We have this coordinating vision in place and it has enterprise and exchange at its heart. It is infused with environmental and economic promise and includes a wealth of cultural, sporting and human potential.”The visit of the Bangladeshi delegation was hosted by London-based Study Circle and facilitated by the growing Bangladeshi population of Belfast."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"bone man at key palestine hearing","story":"A BONE man is in the Hague this week as an international observer at a historic hearing on the Palestine-Israeli conflict.Eddie Whyte, who has lived in Norway for over thirty years, is also a member of the Palestine Justice Campaign.Eddie attended the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands as the case got underway yesterday .The case has been brought by Dutch citizen Ismail Ziada against the former Chief of General Staff of the Israeli Defence Force , Benny Gantz, and former Commander of the IDF Air Force, Amir Eshel, over the bombing of the Ziada family home in Gaza.The attack in July  killed six family members from three generations of the Ziada family, including Ismail’s -year-old mother, three brothers, his sister-in-law, a -year-old nephew and a visiting friend. Mr Ziada, who is of Palestinian origin, contends that the attack on the family home was a violation of international humanitarian law and constituted a gross violation of internationally recognised human rights principles.Mr Gantz and Mr Eshel claim immunity from the Dutch court and contend that Mr Ziada should have presented his claim in an Israeli court. Mr Gantz is running for office against Benjamin Netanyahu in the Israeli national elections this week.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Eddie said: “The case is historical in that it is the first time a Palestinian has been able to make use of civil litigation on the basis of universal jurisdiction to gain access to justice for war crimes.“The pursuance of the case has been made possible by an online crowdfunder which received widespread support in Ireland from iniduals, trade unions and human rights organisations and prominent people like Senator Frances Black, award-winning filmmaker Seán Murray and musician Mick Blake.

Two of the sculptures from the popular Julia Donaldson-penned Gruffalo tale were completely destroyed after they were set ablaze while others were defaced. Colin Glen Forest Park is home to the unique Trail and has visitors and families from across the city visit daily to see the attraction. Mother-of-two Nicola Marley said that it is “upsetting” for her children when their “favourite character or activity is signicantly damaged or missing” along the Trail.“I participated in a project with the Princes Trust to create a small memorial garden for victims who have lost their lives as a result of mental health issues,” she said. “A lot of hard work and time went into it, many close friends and family of the victims use the garden as a peaceful space to sit and reflect. It is sad that this has now been destroyed too. The park would be a nicer and safer placethe constant vandalism stopped.”Another parent, Janine Belton, spoke of how the Gruffalo Trail “gives the children a wonderful experience and provides them with some learning within nature.” “However, the animal statues have been destroyed, leaving the children confused and sad as they believe that the animals were being ‘hurt’,” she said. Bernadette Devlin, from Colin Sure Start said that vandalism on the Gruffalo Trail was impacting the learning and development of children in the area.“We use that facility a few times a year to bring parents and our children from nought to four age range,” she said.“It promotes the kids’ speech and language, it promotes their social interaction, it helps them learn about their environment and, most of all, it allows them to have fun. It’s local and it’s free of charge, but they are unable to enjoy it as much because of the vandalism of the statues on the Gruffalo Trail. It’s a health and safety issue too because the children like to get their photos taken with the statues, but obviously they can’t do that now. There is one near the entrance and you wouldn’t even be able to identy what it is now.“We just want to make people aware of the impact it’s having on the families who are living in the community.“It’s resource that we’ve had many an enjoyable outing to, and we would like to continue to do that. It has so many benefits for community, butthis vandalism continues we’ll no be able to use it. The safety of the children is paramount to us. We would be very wary of bringing families there because of the vandalism.”Sinn Féin Councillor Séanna Walsh described those behind the destruction as “a handful of disgruntled vandals who are attacking their own community”.“Colin Glen Forest Park is a major asset for this area, the community, council and departments are investing heavily into it and we are looking at a £ million investment package for it,” he said. “The Glider has really opened up the opportunity for people and families to access the park and we have a handful of youngsters who are turning up to try and vandalise it.“The park is set to launch its latest attraction, the toboggan, soon and planning applications are in for zip lines and mountain bike trails. There are big projects planned for the park. We would ask those who behind this vandalism to stay out of it.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"it could pay to back the boks in japan","story":"World rankings are a funny thing. Apparently, Belgium are the top-rated team in world football, ahead of Brazil and the actual world champions France writes our rugby tipster Paddy Tierney.In golf, Englishman Justin Rose moved to world number one ahead of the US Masters despite his one and only major victory coming at the  US Open. With the Rugby World Cup taking centre stage over the coming weeks, it is worth pointing out that Ireland are back to being the top-rated team in the world. That’s Ireland, who are rated as   shots to lt the Webb Ellis Trophy.That’s Ireland who were obliterated - in last month’s warm-up game at Twickenham.It seems back-to-back wins over Wales at Cardf and then Dublin were enough to promote Joe Schmidt’s side back to number one. Yet, Ireland have a painful history at the Rugby World Cup and have failed to make it past the quarter-final stage in eight previous attempts. In , they topped Pool D, but were humbled - by a ravenous Argentina side in the quarters. Their pain was only lessened by the fact that hosts England failed to make it out of Pool A behind Australia and Wales. However, the  winners look a dferent proposition four years on and Eddie Jones’ side are a real threat. They are   to top a Pool C group containing France and Argentina and look set to take on either Wales or Australia, who should finish first and second in Pool D, in the quarters. Pool B looks a shoot-out between world champions New Zealand and South Africa, while Ireland’s opening game against Scotland on Sunday could well determine who tops Pool A. Hosts Japan might have something to say about that and neither side will take them for granted after they caused one of the biggest upsets in the history of the competition by beating South Africa in their opening game of the  World Cup when managed by the aforementioned Jones. Either way, Ireland will face an almighty challenge to better their horrendous World Cup record as they will face either New Zealand or South Africa in the last eight.I think both Ireland and the All Blacks will top their group meaning it will be Scotland versus New Zealand and Ireland against South Africa. While Ireland have proven that they can beat any team in the world on their day, I can’t help but feel like the World Cup arrives  months too late for Schmidt’s men, who seem to thrive when they are written off. The decision to leave Devin Toner at home has ided opinion, while captain Rory Best is now  and will retire after the World Cup. Fitness doubts continue to linger about Johnny Sextonand Keith Earls, while Robbie Henshaw has been ruled out of the Scotland game with a hamstring injury and Ireland look destined for another quarter-final exit with most firms going   on that outcome. Elsewhere, I like the look of Wales at   to top Pool D and I think they’ll end up playing France in the quarter-final. If my predictions are correct, that would leave Warren Gatland’s side taking on South Africa in the last four. Wales are one of the few teams who should match the brute force of the Springboks and I wouldn’t be surprised to see them reaching the decider.That being said, almost every betting preview I’ve read has tipped South Africa as the winner and as much as I hate hopping on the bandwagon, they looked to have assembled one hell of a squad. The other semi-final could be the game of the tournament with world champions New Zealand looking like they are on a collision course with England. Australia could throw a spanner in the works in the quarter-finals, but I’ve a gut feeling fear that England will go very close. Final Prediction Thankfully, their outright odds are   are far too skinny for me to consider the unthinkable, but they may well reach the decider with an England versus South Africa final priced at a tasty-looking  . Back in , the same countries contested the decider in France with South Africa winning - in a cagey affair at the Stade De France and I fancy a repeat of that result at the ,-capacity International Stadium in Yokohama.A certain Bryan Habana was the star of the World Cup  years ago, scoring eight tries and Cheslin Kolbe could be worth a wager in the top-tryscorer market at  . The -year-old winger scored two tries at the weekend as Rassie Erasmus’s side defeated hosts Japan in their final warm-up game -. When you consider that Ireland’s Jacob Stockdale is as low as  , Kolbe looks outstanding value while George North could also be worth an each-way punt at  .

Two of the leaders at the time Orla Nic Shíomóin and Orla Nig Fhearraigh thought I could sing and had a lovely voice. They approached my dad and askedit was okay for me to sing in the Scór na nÓg. I’ve been singing every year since.”Méabh spoke of how the club’s Cultural Officer, Ronan McHugh “asked me to come back last year to teach the kids how to sing the anthem”. “That is the thing about our club, the kids that attend the summer schemes, and there are now three running, end up coaching younger kids coming through which is fantastic,especially the U- girls.”“I then started singing the national anthem at club events such as juvenile and senior dinners. “Antrim Cultural Officer Bronagh Lennon asked my dadI could sing at some championship games and then onto County Antrim league games. Bronagh has been a great influence and mentor, not only to me but to other kids in the county with her encouragement.”Méabh’s extremely proud dad Joe said all the family will be travelling down to Dublin to support her on Sunday.“There is a big festival on at the club on Sunday and the game will be on in the club after that. We are just so proud.”The Blessed Trinity College student has always had a passion for the performing arts and has performed lead roles in New Lodge Arts High School Musical and Belfast Musical Drama Society’s Hairspray. Following her momentous pitch debut at the Jones’ Road stadium on Sunday, Méabh will be straight into rehearsals for her school’s production of Beauty and the Beast of which she will perform the role of Belle. “I sang the national anthem in front of the Artane Band at Clones, that was a huge honour and an amazing day so imagine what it was like when my dad broke the news to me that I had been invited to sing our national anthem in Croke Park in front of an estimated , people. I’m just so excited.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"one womans journey of discovery on lyric stage","story":"HOUSE lights dim, stage lights up and our scene is set.

She and her husband Joe have grown apart, both wounded by their marriage. Shirley is there to peel the spuds, put dinner on the table and tend to the grown-up children, Millandra and Brian, asthey are still toddlers. Shirley talks to the wall as there is no-one  to talk to.Her friend Jane has bought her a ticket for two weeks in Greece and the first act is the will she won’t she build-up to getting there.Shirley tells us how she wanted to be a “courier or air hostess” but was discouraged by less-than-patient teachers at school – “Only the clever ones get to do that.”Shirley Valentine has “disappeared,” we are told, worn down by routine and repetition and now “frightened of le beyond the walls.”By the time the interval came the audience was rooting for Shirley as she gets ready for her two weeks in Corfu.In Act Two, gone is the mousy dress, apron and sensible shoes of the first half and in its place is a striking Shirley: colourful bathing suit, tanned skin, feet encased in bright pink shoes. We learn that Shirley’s friend Jane abandoned her for four days ”to shack up with a man she met on the plane. “I was alone but it was lovely” – Shirley took her table down to the beach most nights to watch the sunset and sip her wine.Shirley Valentine is a timeless story – a woman stuck within four walls who needs to break out and break free.

He attended Holy Cross Boys Primary School in the district and is also a past pupil of the old St Gabriel’s school.Leaving school at , Thomas admits that the academic world was not for him and he left home soon after to work in England.“School just wasn’t for me,” he explained.“I wasn’t academic but always fascinated by art and photos in newspapers and magazines such as The Observer and Sunday Times magazines.“I left home at  and went to England. There wasn’t much work here at the time and I just wanted to get away from Belfast with all the conflict going on.“I saw so much trouble and bloodshed on the streets. My community was under siege.“You couldn’t get in or out of Ardoyne without getting checked by British Army or RUC.“I was away for a year and worked in construction on building sites in London. I decided to come back because to be honest, I missed the place.“I didn’t really like London at all. It was far too quiet compared to back home.”Thomas ed to Belfast and turned his attention back to one of his hobbies and interests he had from a young age – photography.“I wanted to pursue a career in photography,” he added.“I went to night school where I learnt the basics but I wanted a job so I could work for the community using photography.“I managed to get an interview with the founder of Andersonstown News in West Belfast, Basil McLaughlin and Máirtín Ó Muilleoir who told me they were starting a new newspaper for North Belfast.“I was familiar with the Andersonstown News and liked the fact that they provided a voice for the community in West Belfast during the Troubles.“My interview was  years ago and I haven’t looked back since.”In  years, Thomas has established himself as a well-known and talented photographer and there wouldn’t be many in North Belfast who haven’t recognised him out and about doing the job he loves.Still, much has changed over the years in North Belfast and in photography.“North Belfast has changed in some ways but many issues remain today like housing and the unfair points system.“Community relations have improved with integrated education but even today, there are still sectarian attacks and peace walls remain up iding communities.“There are still people out there fighting for peace.“As for photography, I started off developing my own black and white images before it moved on to the digital age which takes up a lot less time and I can produce more photos.”Thomas has enjoyed many successes over the years and in , showcased  years of his work in the local media at an exhibition for Féile an Phobail.Back in May of this year, he scooped four awards at the Northern Ireland Press Photographers Awards, including first place in the Inidual Study and Sports Action categories along with a Provincial Merit Award. He has been recognised multiple times over the years in the awards.“It is great to be recognised for the daily work that I do. It is great for the North Belfast News and Belfast Media Group to show we put our best efforts into the product.“It was a proud moment for me and the paper.”Away from his daily working le, Thomas may also be seen on his motorcycle on the road and he also enjoys music. Thomas is also a busy grandad to two grandchildren and has three children – two daughters and a son.Asked for any advice for any budding photographers out there, Thomas would encourage them to join a camera club – the long-running CB Camera Club on the Antrim Road who meet every Thursday night at pm.As for the future, Thomas concluded, “I am content with the job I do now – representing people in the local community.“I am proud of where I am from.

In fact, the backstop would have been good and it would have meant the best of both worlds. Youd have countries wanting to invest in Northern Ireland so that they would have traded with Europe and the UK. It would have brought a lot of inward investment and would have made Northern Ireland a very rich and wealthy country.\"He added: \"The DUP are completely against the backstop. I, on the other hand, dont believe the backstop would have any effect on the Union because...theres going to be any change to the Union there has to be a vote.\"A DUP spokesman said the party is working \"towards an agreement allowing a sensible and managed exit\".\"The backstop seeks to facilitate north-south trade, but does so by creating barriers between Northern Ireland and Great Britain where we sell and trade three quarters of all our goods. The backstop has been rejected on three occasions by Parliament and a new agreement is needed which can command support from both unionists and nationalists in Northern Ireland.\""},{"url":null,"title":"david cameron says he faced ira members during stormont negotiations in","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The up-and-coming Instagram personality, who left Belfast when she was only , is not her fathers keeper.Read MoreSocial media style icon Chloe Adair insists her familys past doesnt define her dream role as an online influencerTheres something ugly about this ancient superstition that who you are as a person is defined by kinship but too often here, people are still expected to be interchangeable with their blood relations.

It becomes a problem when someone decides they know everything about you just because theyre in possession of a few factlets.The Troubles produced many bad people. In due course, they had children of their own. It really shouldnt come as a shock that some of them took radically dferent paths, certainly not to anyone whos had children of their own.It would be an awful world in which children turned into carbon copies of their mothers and fathers.If Chloe was to defend her fathers paramilitary past, then it would be perfectly justied to criticise her for it. The same would applyshe used her social media  to spread hate or ision. But she doesnt. She posts harmless messages about fashion. Pictures of her parents must rouse dark memories to those whose lives were touched by Johnny Adair but its he who must answer for his crimes, not his daughter.That Chloe has forged her own way in le, independent of her parentage, ought to be seen as an achievement, rather than a puzzle. If anything, she is now the positive role model that he failed to be in his own le.Children should never be judged by the sins of their parents, but they can sometimes put right a few of those sins by rejecting the toxic example theyve been given and going on to live better, more productive lives."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38513717.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/_108859437_charlie.jpg","title":"farmer who appeared in dup campaign regrets brexit vote","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It is what it is fam. The dirty ****.”Other messages between Rowe and Coleman included advice for Wood to be flirty in messages to the footballer, to “keep him enticed and draw him in”.Rowe suggested that Wood, of Cleethorpes, should “play it smooth – make him want this now”.She sent the player a number of “provocative” messages ahead of their meeting, Simon Jones, prosecuting, said.“The picture that is really building here is how carefully managed all of this is – it is all a sting,” Mr Jones told the jury.In one message, Wood told Tyrone Coleman: “Something I’m hella nervous about. What other girl would be willing to do this for you  As well as it benefits all of us I know.”Coleman sent a screenshot of messages between Wood and the player – discussing football training and the cost of their hotel room – to Rowe.The player previously told how he and Wood had exchanged “general chit chat” on social media before meeting at a hotel.He would transfer money to Wood, who would pay for the hotel room and check in before he arrived – sending him the room number in a message.On the final occasion, the player said Wood seemed “nervous” and was using her mobile phone, which was odd as they were “only going there for one thing”.“All of a sudden, two guys just walked into the room,” he told jurors.“One of the guys said something like: ‘Is this what you are doing ’. It happened so quickly. It seemed so staged.“I managed to get out of the window without without thinking how high up it was.”The footballer took hold of a fire escape and was able to run down to a car park before fleeing into a nearby restaurant, where he took shelter until police arrived.His designer tracksuit and Rolex watch, which he had taken off in the room, were missing when officers went to it.Rowe was found to be wearing the tracksuit when he was arrested days later, awaiting a flight to Dubai.The watch was on the wrist of Ras Robinson, , who was charged with handling stolen goods.After leaving the hotel, the footballer received a message from Wood’s phone, stating that he had been in the “wrong place at the wrong time” and telling him to contact a number.“I don’t really want to expose you to the media butyou don’t respond within  hours then you leave me no choice,” it said.When asked about the message, the footballer told jurors: “Obviously it is blackmail.“That’s what they wanted to do – to get footage of me and take it to the papers.”Wood, who has admitted conspiracy to blackmail, said she took part in the plot after discovering that the footballer had a partner.“I had previously asked himhe did have a partner and he would always shrug it off and say why was I askinghe was single,” she said.“I wanted his girlfriend to know that he had been cheating because it is not fair, it’s not right.”She claimed the plan was for the footballer to be filmed in bed with her, then confronted by Rowe and Coleman, who would ask him for money.“He was kissing me, he started to take his boxers down,” Wood told the court.“The key in the door went and Prince and Nathan came in the room.”She said it did not go to plan as the footballer “jumped out of the window” before Rowe and Coleman could speak to him.Nathan Coleman, of Sussex, denies conspiracy to blackmail and two counts of thefts relating to the Rolex watch and designer tracksuit.His brother Tyrone Coleman, of Birmingham, denies conspiracy to blackmail.Prince Rowe, of Birmingham, denies conspiracy to blackmail and two counts of theft.Ras Robinson denies a charge of handling stolen goods relating to the watch.The trial will continue on Monday."},{"url":null,"title":"giant inflatable turtle on display outside parliament for climate strike","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Tragically, Dessie was killed in a car crash in .“Dessie was the best of us. Him and Brendan were the two runners. Dessie was a great runner at school and then at Sparta where he was captain. He was a very popular fella.“As well as being a great runner he was a great captain. He looked after his charges very well.“Brendan and his we both ran for Northern Ireland and were both very good athletes. Dessie ran shorter distances whereas Brendan ran anything from km right through to the marathon.”Harry was somewhat of a late starter when it came to running, his brothers talked him into it at a time he was overweight in the early s. About a year later he competed in his first marathon in Dublin.He was one of the founding members of Foyle Valley Athletics Club in . At the time they were told it wouldn’t survive six months, but  years later it now has approximately  members.It is an “all ability club” with dferent groups meeting weekly at Templemore Sports Complex and in the Waterside. “Anybody who wants to run will get the opportunity butyou don’t want to compete you can join to keep fit. We like people to compete but don’t put anyone under pressure to do so.”“I, to be perfectly frank, wasn’t brought in for my athletic expertise, I’m not saying I was useless but would’ve been average, but that fits into the ethos of the club.”Personal bestDespite his modesty, Harry has run impressive times over the years, recording a sub--hour marathon in Belfast. That is no mean feat, it requires dedicated training, and, on the day you have to run an average of around : per mile across the . mile course.Harry recalled his brother Dessie spurring him on as he neared the finish line that day, sadly, it would be the last time he saw him alive.“It was the st of May  and Dessie was killed ten days later on the th. I hadn’t enough long runs coming into it and at the latter stages I was absolutely out of it, really struggling.“Dessie was there at the  mile mark and, in Belfast I don’t know anybody, but I heard this voice shouting ‘Harry, get your head up out of your chest! You’ve come through  mile in : you can break  hours but you’re going to have to work for it’.“It just gave me enough encouragement to keep going. He came round to see me at the finish line. “He had just moved to Belfast and wanted me to see his new house but I had come with a crowd of boys on a train and said I’d be up in a couple of weeks to spend the weekend, to do a bit of running and play some snooker.“But he was killed ten days later.”Marty Gallaghergoogletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshTwenty years later, Marty Gallagher, a young prodigy of Harry’s, was killed in similarly tragic circumstances.Next month fty members of Foyle Valley will take part in this year’s Dublin marathon in memory of Marty who died after being hit by a car on the Racecourse Road while ing home on Halloween night.Martin was -years-old and it will be his th anniversary this year.Reflecting, Harry said: “Marty Gallagher was a lovely young fella, very modest, unassuming, and comes from such a nice family.“He was a member of the club and would’ve been one of my prodigies when he first came into running, I would’ve nurtured him, but then he got to the stage where he was too quick for me and I couldn’t stay with him. I’d have needed a bike to keep up with him.”Harry has been fortunate to avoid serious injury over the years aside from breaking his ankle in . Doctors warned that without an operation he would have chronic arthritis and would never run again.“You learn to live with the fact that on the long runs you’re going to be in pain. I was lucky to get away with running the Derry marathon this year.”After a more recent x-ray, a doctor warned thathe continued at his present rate he would need a new ankle.“I wear an ankle support and patella support, but you’re not going to let stuff like that stop you,” he added.CamaraderieSpecial club memories include a time when members competed in the All Ireland Marathon Championship in Mallow Co. Cork, in . They won the senior marathon and veteran’s championships.As winners they had the honour of hosting the competition in Derry the following year. It was a very successful event which stands out as one of the clubs highlights.Harry finished second in the veterans team and his brother Brendan competed well in the senior team.Looking back at other fond memories, Harry cited the Walled City Marathon in , which was the first marathon to be held in Derry for many years.“I thoroughly enjoyed it, along with the London marathon, I’ve done four of them, and the Great North Run, which I’ve done twice.“But the club itself, the camaraderie is just unbelievable. It’s a social outlet more than anything . In terms of the people, not just at Foyle Valley but running in general, there are very few people I’ve met through running that I could say I didn’t like, they’re all good hearted, good natured people, and help you in any way they can. They’re gracious in defeat and generous in victory.“Foyle Valley has a great family atmosphere,someone is training for a marathon they will always train with you and help you through. That’s part of the ethos of the club.”Fitness has become an essential component of many people’s lives as experts regularly expound on the benefits to both physical and mental health.Therefore, the emergence of new clubs, and the introduction of couch to k runs, has been “one of the best” things to happen in the city in Harry’s view. “The people behind these clubs love their running and are so friendly. They got people out who never would’ve necessarily been interested in running, and now they’re doing half marathons and marathons - that’s fabulous.”"},{"url":null,"title":"department weighing medical school options","story":"The Department of Health is assessing the cost-effectiveness of locating a Medical School in Derry and said any final decision will require ministerial sign off.The Medical School forms part of Derry’s City Deal proposals and as such the local council is engaging with the UK government to see “ this project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.”The Ulster University has been for some time considering the development of a Graduate Entry Medical Schoolto be located in Derry and this project proposal features heavily in the Derry City  Strabane District Council’s economic regeneration plans for the region.With the support of the Local Council the University partners have been engaging with a number of NI Departments in an effort to progress this proposal.A spokesperson for UU confirmed that as part of its latest business case it aims to have its first academic year of enrolments for the GEMS in  .The Northern Ireland Department of Healthis acutely aware of the pressures on the medical workforce across Health and Social Careand its key role in leading the transformation of services set out in Delivering Together.Accordingly, DoH commissioned a Medical School Places Review, led by Professor Keith Gardiner, to determine the optimum number of medical school places that Northern Ireland requires per year.

Feedback was provided on  July  to the fourth iteration of the OBC.Any commissioning of additional medical places for Northern Ireland must address comprehensively the full range of available options, with a particular focus on the assessment of value for money and affordability for health and social care, the report says.“For example, rather than simply expanding medical student numbers, it will be important to explore lower-cost measures likely to increase the supply of medics over the short-term and which enhance and maximise the signicant investment currently being made in undergraduate medical education.“DoH is developing a business case to consider these matters. Given the cross-cutting nature and potential for signicant associated costs with the Medical School business case, the DoH Permanent Secretary has advised that any decision on this or other long-term options, must be considered by Northern Ireland Executive Ministers.”It added: “The provision of HE places in NI or the establishment of a medical school in Derry is a devolved matter, however, the Derry  Strabane City District Council is presently engaging with UKG to considerthis project would be eligible for UKG funding under the City Deals programme or the Integrated Education Fund.“The medical school is one part of a wider package of proposals currently under consideration with other draft proposals included that could complement existing specialties at the Magee Campus.“The development of the Council’s final bids for a City Deal from the Inclusive Future Fund is still ongoing and as of August , there has been no official final bid submitted for either funding stream to UKG, including no formal bid to provide funding to a Derry medical school.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: projected image of what Magee will look likeexpanded with Graduate Entry Medical School by the riverfront."},{"url":null,"title":"derry homeowners left shaken burglary waterside area city","story":"Detectives are appealing for witnesses and information following the report of a burglary at a house in the Grovemount Court area of Altnagelvin, Derry, on Thursday  September.Detective Sergeant Boyd said: “It was reported that entry was gained to the property between am and pm on Thursday.

Alongside that are centres of innovation and excellence in data analyticsand robotics and automationand a Personalised Medicine Centre of Excellence .Julian Smiths report says the proposals to expand Magee had signicant funding consequences from a capital infrastructure perspective, approximately £m, and from a resource funding perspective.The proposal would require Higher Education in NI to be placed on a sustainable footing, comparable with England, from which expansion would take place.According to the report, there would also be, as with any requested expansion or increase to student numbers, resource grant consequences of funding the proposed additional places at UU and NWRC, and associated student support costs, circa £m.\"The £m capital cost was highly indicative and based on an assumed cost per square metre per student.\"The Department for the Economyundertook initial work to determine how it would look at the case,there was an agreement on how the sector as a whole could be sustainably funded, as any expansion in student numbers would not make sense without this in place,\" it said.In February , DfE wrote to, and is awaiting a response from, UU requesting that an update be made to the case, according to the report.DfE asked for a more accurate assessment of capital need, which was \"very theoretical\" in the original proposal and created a signicant cost requirement. It wants a review of the number and subject level mix of additional students required to ensure an underpinning alignment with graduate postgraduate economic need in subject areas proposed.Furthermore, the department requested information around phasing of the project to assessthere are \"more suitable break points\" in the proposal and a potential to scale any expansion both in terms of student numbers and capital development.And sought the \"rationale\" for locating additional higher education places in the Magee Campus, as opposed to other geographical locations with further and more detailed explanation in relation to sub-regional economic benefits.This information will be critical to enabling a strategic approach to HE provision and in feeding into any final business case that might be put forward for this proposal, it concluded.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"magherafelt based actor blown away role movie linked jurassic world franchise","story":"By Cathal McGuiganA Magherafelt-based actor has said he was “blown away” when he learned he had been cast in Battle at Big Rock, a short film thats part of the Jurassic World franchise.Chris Finlaysonplays American biker Greg in the film and aims to build on this role and some experience as an extra to land more acting roles.Battle at Big Rock was posted to Youtube on Sunday and had been viewed more than three million times by Thursday evening. Starring alongside Chris in the film were André Hollandand Natalie Martinez .Scottish-born Chrismoved to Magherafelt in , where he worked as a personal trainer. He said that his acting career really began when the opportunity arose to work as an extra on Game of Thrones.As well as appearing as a member of the Nights Watch in three seasons of the show, hes also featured in Superman drama Krypton and filmed sword-fighting scenes for the film Viking Destiny, which is available on Netflix.He first heard about the Jurassic World role when a friend tagged him on Facebook in a post from Louise Kiely Casting, which gave away very few details about the role.“They were looking for a biker with a flawless American accent. I just thought Id go for it and see what happens,” he said.Chris said that when it came to the day of the audition in Dublin he was “sweating bullets” and almost didnt go through with it.“Just as I was walking up to the door, I sort of freaked out. I went past it and I said to myself I cant do this just because of the nerves, because I wanted it so badly,” he said.“Then I was thinking to myself, youve come this far, you need to do this. I genuinely thought I didnt stand a chance as I knew Id be up against actors with more experience.”“I went and got myself two pints of Guinness, settled my nerves and went back. I was happy when I came out and thought Id done well but I thought it would just be good experience and that I wasnt going to get it.”A few weeks later the casting agent emailed Chris to let him know that the role was his, but he still didnt know exactly what he had been cast in.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh“I thought it was probably some low-budget thing, but I was happy to get the experience and a few lines. To me, that would be a start at least.”Chris found a few clues about the production by looking up Jurassic World  director Colin Trevorrow on IMDB, but it was only at a costume fitting that he fully realised how big an opportunity he had been given.“They werent even allowed to say it but it was so secret,” he said.“One of the girls said to me that all they tell could me was that it rhymes with schminosaurs and I just knew. I was just blown away because Ive always loved Jurassic Park.”The eight-minute film was filmed in January in Co Wicklow, which means that Chris is happy to finally be able to talk about the role hes had to keep under wraps for months.“The weirdest thing is just seeing my name in the credits. Thats one of the most surreal things,” he said.Chris said that he hopes to find an agent in the near future to help him land more roles. He believes that a talent for accents hes developed from a young age can help him secure some great parts.“Accents have always been something that comes naturally to me. Even when I was only about four or five years old, I would talk to myself in the mirror and try out lots of dferent accents.”This skill came in handy when Chris played redneck biker Greg with an American accent so accurate that the production crew assumed it was his regular speaking voice.“Most of the crew on the set thought I was an American actor,” Chris said.“It wasnt until Id done my first scene and I asked someone what time it was, that they realised I wasnt an American. They couldnt believe it when I said Id just came down from Magherafelt.”"},{"url":null,"title":"ulster university responds questions regarding city deal funds medical school","story":"The Derry News posed a number of questions to Ulster Universityover the continued uncertainty on the establishment of a Medical School at Magee College.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshFirstly, we asked does UU have any update or response regarding the medical school and concerns raised by David Sterling around the need for ongoing funding which UU is not prepared to invest   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Following cross-party political and health and social care support in  for Ulster University’s Graduate Entry Medical School, the University has continued to proactively develop the project, working closely with the Department and other relevant partners. Our responses to any remaining clarications within the Graduate Entry Medical School business case were submitted to the Department of Health at the start of July, following prompt and close engagement with the Department and other relevant partners. Our proposed first academic year of projected enrolments outlined within the updated business case is  .“As the Department of Health has previously confirmed that any decision on funding can only be made by Ministers, the University is not actively recruiting medical students as yet for  entry until that decision on funding can be reached.· If funding was confirmed, all other elements of the proposal for our medical undergraduate degree programme have been firmly on track including continued progress with the GMC, clinical placement opportunities and the development of a curriculum to meet the needs of healthcare locally.“We value the continued support of all those who share our vision for medical education and we continue to work with the General Medical Council, St George’s University of London and local clinicians and partners building on our existing leadership in medical and healthcare provision to take forward graduate entry medical education for Northern Ireland.\"What does UU say in response to local councillors representatives who have claimed that UU has neglected the Magee campus for decades and should not be given money as part of the City Deal but should instead invest its own money in Derry   A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"Ulster University continues to invest in the Magee campus, most recently with the state-of-the-art £m teaching block which signals our ambition for higher education in the city, already enhancing campus le and paving the way for enhanced future capacity at Magee.    This and other investment priorities for students have resulted in a very strong performance for the Magee campus across all elements of the  National Student Survey, reflecting the very positive reaction from our students to these recent investments in University le at Magee.  With all four faculties of the University represented on the Magee campus – across health sciences, arts and humanities, business and computing and engineering, we are pushing boundaries and breaking new ground in emerging sectors as a progressive university, shortlisted for the prestigious Times Higher Education University of the Year Award, .“Our contribution to the City Deal opportunity is a signicant step forward in our collective opportunity to realise the full ambitions of this vibrant university city.  Our City Deals proposal will see us apply our expertise to help maximize the city’s potential in this unparalleled opportunity to boost economic growth and prosperity.  In our continued collaboration with industry partners, we look forward to driving innovation in personalised medicine, cognitive analytics, robotics and automation, leading to both new research posts and learning opportunities for additional students.  The proposed riverfront innovation hub will build upon the expertise of our first data analytics Institute, opened in  and headquartered at Magee campus, and which cemented our reputation as a global leader in this field. Also integral to the City Deal remains our commitment to establishing a Graduate Entry Medical School in a bid to address the challenges of a healthcare system at breaking point.   City Deal recognises the crucial role our University can play as an economic engine in the North West and is a major boost to the collective ambitions of the city and region.  We look forward to the development of our projects in partnership with industry, civic and educational partners.\"How much money will be needed in total to fund the projects put forward as part of the City Deal A spokesperson for Ulster University commented: \"The funding contributions by project across City Deal and the Inclusive Futures Funds are indicative at this stage, based on the allocations provided by Council, and subject to adjustment as we go forward.  Our contribution of % University funding to the Magee projects within City Deal reflects our belief in the impact they will make, and our commitment to playing our part in the collective ambitions of City Deal.“City Deal enables us to build further on our academic strengths that are signicant for the region’s growth, and to make sure that this expertise across world class research and progressive student learning works hard for the benefit of all in the city region. The City Deal bid has education, innovation, job creation and skills development at its core and each of these priorities are also central to our work across both teaching and research.  We are therefore a natural fit and a committed partner in this ambitious bid.  A continued collaborative approach is essential as we prepare to take forward the projects through planning and design and development of the business cases.”"},{"url":null,"title":"food festival leaves newtown smiling","story":"Saxophone Sundae entertains festival goers at this years Newtown Food Festival. ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtPicture: Rob Davieslt spangtlt spangt\" Food festival leaves town smilingThree cyclist from Hafren Cycle Club who wil be competing in the Chrono des Natiltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtons in Les Herbiers ltspan classtruncate-full-screengtVendeacutee meet members from the twining association at this years Newtown Food Festival.

In the fth minute a free was given away by the lsquoFin defence and Cormac Venney slotted over from the m line.In the sixth minute a superb full-pitch move from the lsquoFin was finished by Breannain McComiskey, restoring the two-point lead.A minute later Garland was clinical when he drove to the net to put the lsquoFin firmly in the driving seat. Shea Croskery raced through moments later and drove for goal, but saw his effort go wide and Dundrumrsquos relief was palpable.Instead of going eight points behind, Dundrum did well to re-group and points from Aidan Fegan and a second Venney free cut the deficit back to three points.Oran Flanagan sent over the next three points in the second quarter of the game with Glavin doing the same for Dundrum. Garland and Croskery also raised the white flag with their strikes to leave the lsquoFin with a half-time lead of - to -.Fegan got the first point of the second half for Dundrum with three minutes gone and a third free kick of the game was landed by Venney by the end of the third quarter.While the lsquoFin had not yet scored, it wasnrsquot for the want of trying as a few opportunities were missed and Dundrum lsquokeeper Eamon King pulled off a superb double save, the first from Croskery and the follow up from Chris Doran.Oran Flanagan was having a good game and he sent over his fourth point of the match and a superb effort from Shane McCann restored the lsquoFinrsquos four point half-time advantage with ten minutes remaining.Dundrum continued to threaten, but other than two more excellent points from their standout player Kyle Glavin, the lsquoFin defence held strong and kept the dangerous duo of Venney and Fegan scoreless the remainder of the game.Dundrum half forward Fegan was sent to the line after getting a second yellow in the final throes of the game.

The upgrading of the pitch is certainly sustainable financially, given the amount of usage it would get.ldquoWe have lost  teams to other leagues in the past few years and they have all cited poor facilities as their main reason for moving to play in the the Lisburn or South Belfast Leagues, he added.Mr Torney said it was essential that proper facilities were put in place to enable the league to avoid weekly postponements of games.ldquoWe are left every year with a fixture congestion because of postponements and in order to arrest the haemorrhaging of clubs from the league we must address this issue immediately.The league are being supported by South Down MP Chris Hazzard, who has called on Newry, Mourne and Down Council to ldquofinally deliver fit for purpose pitches for the local community in Downpatrick.He continued: ldquoThe current provision of sports pitches at Dunleath Park is nothing short of a disgrace.ldquoDunleath Park is used extensively by the Downpatrick Youth Football League with hundreds of young footballers playing each weekend, but yet againthis week, parts of the pitches have been closed to the public as raw sewage has come to the surface.ldquoIt is an absolute shame that in the shadow of our fantastic new leisure centre here in Downpatrick our local young people are expected to make do with substandard pitches that not only flood for most of the winter months, but are regularly polluted with raw sewage.Mr Hazzard believes that Downpatrick deserves much better treatment.ldquoAs the county town, Downpatrick deserves to have the very best in local sports provision, and that simply isnrsquot the case at the moment.ldquoIt is deeply disappointing that so many of our young footballers are left to travel to Lisburn and Belfast each weekend to play football. That must not be allowed to continue.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWhilst there is no getting away from the fact that Dunleath Park is in a flood plain area, I would have sympathy with local sports clubs that feel that this is too easily put up as a hurdle to any investment, and that the council should actively consider a range of solutions in order to deliver suitable facilities.ldquoI want to thank those local sports clubs and Downpatrick Youth League representatives who continue to work tirelessly in order to provide local sporting opportunities for our young people and I will now be making representation to senior council management in order to make all their voices heard..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Castlewellan.jpg","title":"Castlewellan forest cycle in the park family event in aid of Knockevin Special School  ","story":"ALL roads lead to Castlewellan Forest Park this Sunday for a special event to raise money for Knockevin Special School in Downpatrick and celebrate the benefits of cycling for everyone.The lsquocycle in the parkrsquo event is being organised by the schoolrsquos Parent Staff Association to raise funds to help purchase new bikes for pupils to help them experience nature and the great outdoors.Sundayrsquos all ability event mdash which runs from am until pm ndash is being billed as a celebration of cycling and will have something for families and special needs adventurers, hard core mountain bikers, club riders, children and young people.The event is being hosted by the Kilmegan Velo Cycling Club with its chairman, Sean Warnock, inviting all cyclists to make their way to the forest park for the event.He said: ldquoThe aim is to get families and friends to experience cycling in a safe setting but full of adventure and we have events for all abilities.ldquoThere will be family trail quests, agility skills for kids, a full time-trial on the red trails, special needs bikes and a Sunday club fuel stop.

Title deeds, usually the easiest of documents to trace, have become impossible to track down.Three people are laying claim to the pier alone and a legal row is pending about whether a contract was broken over the sale of pier some time ago.Against this backcloth, Down council official have been trying to bring the harbour into public ownership since the publication of the Governmentrsquos cash-help promise in July .

A corporate body has almost been directed to include a political representative on its deputation. This will create tensions which this council and district can do without.Mr Sean Quinnthought it was ldquorather arrogant of the minister to make the suggestion and he believed that Mr Powell was like previous South Down MPs, who, he said, had not satisfactorily served the constituency.Official Unionist councillor, Mrs Ethel Smyth, said she would resent it as much as anybodyshe felt the councilrsquos powers were being usurped, but on this occasion she thought it was only natural that Mr Powell should join the deputation.She told councillors: ldquoMr Powell has worked consistently very hard for all sections of the community and nobody could accuse him of working for one party or another. He is one of the best constituency MPs at Westminster.A motion by Mrs Smyth to invite Mr Powell on the deputation was defeated by nine votes to seven mdash a defeat which did not go down well with Official Unionist, Mr William Finlay, who told the SDLP members: ldquoThat was just a political vote.

We appreciate that while this may only be the start of the process, we would call on the landowners to talk to us and the local council.Mr Gardiner added: ldquoOur door is open and we are happy to chat. We very much view ourselves as good neighbours. We hope that moving forward agreement can be reached.Since , work has progressed and a number of studies completed in an effort to advance the planned railway extension, including the completion of a revised business case, along a disused section of line.Council officials argue that the planned extension would help the local authority meet of one its key objectives in transforming the district into one of Irelandrsquos premier tourist destinations and help attract and promote economic investment, enhancing the visitor experience.In addition, council officials are confident that extending the heritage railway line would assist with the regeneration of a rural area.The local authority said attempts to negotiate a settlement with three landowners at the Ballydugan end of the railway line had not been successful.As a result, the local authorityrsquos lawyers are to be asked to proceed with a vesting application to allow heritage railway officials to progress discussions with prospective project funders.Downpatrick councillors Cadogan Enright and Dermot Curran have welcomed the proposal to vest the land.Cllr Enright mdash who formally proposed that the vesting process should commence mdash said the former Down Council earmarked finance to acquire the land to pave the way for the railwayrsquos extension.He said given the inability to persuade current owners of unused track bed toit to public ownership ldquovesting has become necessary.Cllr Enright added: ldquoWe have been trying to get this done voluntarily for the past  years and more and I am delighted that the Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee is backing the proposal to proceed with vesting.Cllr Curran said the local railway had been a ldquomajor success since it opened and had managed to secured hundreds of thousands of pounds in funding from a iety of sources to provide an attraction which is second to none.ldquoThe railway is one of the most popular attractions of its kind in Northern Ireland and has had ambitious expansion plans on the table for some time, he continued.ldquoThe local authority has put tourism at the top of its agenda and extending the railway, I believe, would be a major boost for the area. An extended railway would also be able to ferry punters to and from Downpatrick racecourse on race days.Cllr Curran said he hopes that the vesting process can be completed smoothly and relatively quickly with agreement between all the parties to allow the railwayrsquos extension plan to proceed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Safety.jpg","title":"Safety upgrade work begins at roundabout  ","story":"WORK has started on a major safety upgrade at one of the districtrsquos most busiest roads.Contractors moved on site at the Dundrum Rod roundabout in Newcastle on Monday to provide new puffin crossing points which will require traffic to come to a complete stop to allow people to cross the road.The new crossings are being provided at the Dundrum and Castlewellan road sides of the roundabout and will replace existing zebra crossings. The work is scheduled to last five weeks.Major concerns voiced by residents and local politicians about pedestrian safety at this part of the resort mdash where there have been countless near misses particularly at the Dundrum Road side of the roundabout mdash prompted roads officials to act. Some pedestrians have also been struck by vehicles.The provision of new puffin crossings will result in traffic lights being provided either side of the roundabout, with the move welcomed by Mournes councillor, Willie Clarke.He described the provision of the new crossings as a ldquolong overdue priority for pedestrian safety in Newcastle explaining that they will help reduce pedestrian collisions and near misses at a particularly busy part of the resort.ldquoAlong with other elected representatives, community and residentsrsquo groups, the local Policing and Community Safety Partnership and the public I have campaigned for the replacement of the zebra crossing with a controlled lights crossing, said Cllr Clarke.ldquoI have campaigned for this road safety measure for over a decade and am delighted work has started this week. I would also urge motorists to be patient and allow more time for their journeys over the next five weeks as the work progresses.Describing the new road safety measure as a lsquolong overdue priority, Cllr Clarke said the new crossings will be warmly welcomed.He said that also as part of the scheme, a new footpath will be created at the Castlewellan Road side of the roundabout linking the new puffin crossing at the Dundrum Road side.Cllr Clarke added: ldquoThe ongoing work will provide safe, controlled crossing facilities and will assist with reducing personal injury collisions recorded at the roundabout.News of work starting on the new crossings comes weeks after roads officials scrapped another proposal to address road safety and congestion issues at the roundabout.The Department of Infrastructure was planning to create a new dedicated filter lane at the Dundrum Road side of the roundabout, designed to enable drivers entering the resort from this direction, wishing to access the Castlewellan Road, to do so without causing major tailbacks.The scheme mdash which had not been fully costed mdash would have left two existing lanes for the exclusive use of traffic heading into the centre of Newcastle.Roads engineers were confident that the proposal would have signicantly reduced congestion, but it was recently confirmed at a special meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council that the plug had been pulled on the scheme.Local politicians were told that the project was not viable given the number of underground utilities at this part of the resort. However, roads officials confirmed that they are in the process of drawing up an alternative scheme, the detail of which they hope to unveil shortly..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/18th September 2019 Smyth.jpg","title":"Smyth first home at Finnebrogue Woods  ","story":"OVER  athletes took part in inaugural M B McGrady  Co Chartered Accountants Beer and Bubbles charity run at Finnebrogue Woods last Thursday night.Sunny weather made for perfect running conditions for the race that took place in Finnebrogue Woods, on the outskirts of Downpatrick.Prizes were awarded to fastest male, David Smyth and fastest female, Carissa McLister, who completed her first ever km race.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

We want to turn them into respectful iniduals with good values and an understanding of issues across the whole spectrum le has to offer.The school encourages pupils to voice their ideas, and shape their own education to a degree. They are asked what additions and activities they would like around the school, push for pupil engagement with a range of le experiences, and emphasis the development of their social skills to help them interact with others in dferent settings.The idea works well in practice. The students are friendly, confident, and respectful to the teachers. They smile, wave and say hello to the teachers in the corridors.ldquoThis is my eleventh year here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoI feel privileged to work in Fairfield. Itrsquos a school with a wonderful ethos and atmosphere, and skilled staff who know the children well, ensuring theyrsquore getting the best possible.ldquoThe children really exude enjoyment and enthusiasm for their learning.One classroom was filled with children learning their times-tables by singing and dancing, grins from ear to ear. In the schoolrsquos on-site nursery, youngsters concentrate on their basic arithmetic, rolling modelling clay into a single sunflower, or a pair of bananas.The nursery is the most recent addition to the school, having been opened in January of last year. Itrsquos the sort of place you can hear long before you see, as smiling toddlers enjoyed their break time.The nurseryrsquos addition to the school site would allow for an improved transition for pupils from nursery to reception.ldquoChildren benefit from being challenged with their learning at an earlier stage, explained Ms Lewis. ldquoWe want to make them feel safe and comfortable at the school, and make it as easy as possible to move up to reception.ldquoWe also give our older pupils a chance to experience both Stanwell and St Cyres secondaries around here to give them a smooth move into secondary education.Therersquos plenty on offer at the school, as well.Opportunities for extracurricular activities is vast, with local community groups using the hall throughout the week, for gym, dance fitness, karate, football and music tech.The introduction of a lsquoMid-week Muddle-Uprsquo allows pupils to work across age groups on half-termly projects, which use staff expertise in particular areas for a project that they collectively work on such as working on the environment in their own conservation area, or lsquoPizza Mathsrsquo combining elements of maths and fractions with cookery.Pupil groups cover School Council, Sports Council, Creative Committee, Sgwad Cymraeg, Eco-Committee, Team Captains, Digital Leaders, while other groups focus on global issues and the impact of their actions internationally.Jake Kidby, Ahmed Maher and Georgia Tomalin-Reeves are on the school council.Though each had a dferent focus for their enjoyment of the school site, they all agreed they were very happy at Fairfield.Jake said: ldquoI absolutely love my football and therersquos loads of chances to play that here. The new gym trail outside is great too.Ahmed said: ldquoI prefer maths and challenges. We thought school council would be a fun responsibility to look after the school, help people and share ideas.Georgia said: ldquo As part of school council we decided to build a lsquorelaxation stationrsquo for anyone who feels down. They can bring paper and pens and books. Itrsquos just a wooden den. But wersquore putting in shelves, posters. And therersquos lot of free space to run around front and back.The school has been lauded for its environmental efforts, securing a Bronze Welsh Charter Award last term, and earning a Platinum Flag for their approach to ecological and sustainability issues.Pupils Isaac Eley and Sophie Wilford were at the schoolrsquos conservation area.They explained to me that the area was first started around  years ago, but they had begun pushing for more lessons to be held outdoors.They hope to add tables, chairs and more outdoor classroom equipment, so they can take lessons in the open air.ldquoThe staff go above and beyond here, said Ms Lewis. ldquoWith increased pressure on funding for schools staff, governors and parents have to really put  per cent effort in.ldquoThe PTA has raised an incredible amount for us over the years and have done wonders for our IT departments.ldquoParents have helped out in raising money for the new gym trail.ldquoOne father built our relaxation station shed by himself, and the stage on the playground for singing and dancing was also built with parentrsquos help.ldquoThey ensure we can continue and we can be excellent for all the childrenrsquos learning.ldquoAttainment is high and all pupils make good progress specic to them, and this achievement is something of which we are extremely proud.Therersquos an underlying feeling of positivity in Fairfield, off the beaten path but quietly proud and it seems thoroughly well-earned. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is what it is fam. The dirty ****.Other messages between Rowe and Coleman included advice for Wood to be flirty in messages to the footballer, to ldquokeep him enticed and draw him in.Rowe suggested that Wood, of Cleethorpes, should ldquoplay it smooth ndash make him want this now.She sent the player a number of ldquoprovocative messages ahead of their meeting, Simon Jones, prosecuting, said.ldquoThe picture that is really building here is how carefully managed all of this is ndash it is all a sting, Mr Jones told the jury.In one message, Wood told Tyrone Coleman: ldquoSomething Irsquom hella nervous about. What other girl would be willing to do this for you  As well as it benefits all of us I know.Coleman sent a screenshot of messages between Wood and the player ndash discussing football training and the cost of their hotel room ndash to Rowe.The player previously told how he and Wood had exchanged ldquogeneral chit chat on social media before meeting at a hotel.He would transfer money to Wood, who would pay for the hotel room and check in before he arrived ndash sending him the room number in a message.On the final occasion, the player said Wood seemed ldquonervous and was using her mobile phone, which was odd as they were ldquoonly going there for one thing.ldquoAll of a sudden, two guys just walked into the room, he told jurors.ldquoOne of the guys said something like: lsquoIs this what you are doing rsquo. It happened so quickly. It seemed so staged.ldquoI managed to get out of the window without without thinking how high up it was.The footballer took hold of a fire escape and was able to run down to a car park before fleeing into a nearby restaurant, where he took shelter until police arrived.His designer tracksuit and Rolex watch, which he had taken off in the room, were missing when officers went to it.Rowe was found to be wearing the tracksuit when he was arrested days later, awaiting a flight to Dubai.The watch was on the wrist of Ras Robinson, , who was charged with handling stolen goods.After leaving the hotel, the footballer received a message from Woodrsquos phone, stating that he had been in the ldquowrong place at the wrong time and telling him to contact a number.ldquoI donrsquot really want to expose you to the media butyou donrsquot respond within  hours then you leave me no choice, it said.When asked about the message, the footballer told jurors: ldquoObviously it is blackmail.ldquoThatrsquos what they wanted to do ndash to get footage of me and take it to the papers.Wood, who has admitted conspiracy to blackmail, said she took part in the plot after discovering that the footballer had a partner.ldquoI had previously asked himhe did have a partner and he would always shrug it off and say why was I askinghe was single, she said.ldquoI wanted his girlfriend to know that he had been cheating because it is not fair, itrsquos not right.She claimed the plan was for the footballer to be filmed in bed with her, then confronted by Rowe and Coleman, who would ask him for money.ldquoHe was kissing me, he started to take his boxers down, Wood told the court.ldquoThe key in the door went and Prince and Nathan came in the room.She said it did not go to plan as the footballer ldquojumped out of the window before Rowe and Coleman could speak to him.Nathan Coleman, of Sussex, denies conspiracy to blackmail and two counts of thefts relating to the Rolex watch and designer tracksuit.His brother Tyrone Coleman, of Birmingham, denies conspiracy to blackmail.Prince Rowe, of Birmingham, denies conspiracy to blackmail and two counts of theft.Ras Robinson denies a charge of handling stolen goods relating to the watch.The trial will continue on Monday..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Premier League footballer blackmail trial: Messages between defendants revealed article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments are closed on this article. -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Their free dog welfare workshops, delivered as part of the Charity’s ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, enhance the National Curriculum and seek to provide children between the ages of seven and  years with the knowledge and understanding they need to act responsibly and safely around dogs in their homes and those they may see out and about.Each workshop benefits pupils by involving a pretend dog as its focus, with the aim of developing compassion and consideration for all living beings.Not only do children - whether dog owners or not - learn how to behave safely around dogs, they also learn all about the commitment involved in owning a dog through a creative and interactive learning experience.Last year, Cathy Clyde, Dogs Trust’s NI Education and Community Officer delivered workshops to , children. This year they are on track to improve on this number yet again. With the growing success of the ‘Be Dog Smart’ campaign, Dogs Trust now employs  education and community officers across the UK to provide workshops in their designated regions.Cathy said: “Through debate and discussion, our responsible dog ownership workshops encourage learners to embody important values around dog ownership such choosing the right breed or type of dog for your le style, as well as understanding that dogs are a lelong commitment and not a disposable commodity. I would welcome the opportunity to work with schools in the area and encourage them to get in touch, as pupils really do get a lot out of the workshops as do their dogs.”For more information about ‘Be

A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/da1.jpg","title":"clarity telecom building telecoms from the ground up","story":"Posted on Monday September  by Ulster Business Clarity Telecom helps businesses of all shapes and sizes develop their communications needs from the ground up, and is now rolling out its fast-growing cloud software across the UK and Ireland. Founder and managing director David Whelan speaks to Ulster Business about a business which boasts the right tools for the job David Whelan’s vision and mantra for what is now one of the leading telecoms businesses is clear – telecommunications services are only as good as the foundations on which they are built, with engineering front and centre. He’s the entrepreneur behind Clarity Telecom – a successful Belfast-based full-service telecommunications solutions company with almost  years under its belt, helping develop top-end connectivity – including lines, calls, mobile, broadband and cloud software – for businesses across Ireland and the UK. And for David, telecoms is all about engineering at the core of finding the best comprehensive solution to its customers, having the right tools for the job, and having world class people. For Clarity Telecom, it’s about developing a bespoke system for companies, focusing on engineering from day one. Since its inception in , Clarity Telecom has grown to have a greater engineering capability than any other independent telecommunications company in Northern Ireland, and is now rolling out its leading byphone VoIPsystem throughout the UK and Ireland. David also says through Clarity Telecom and its burgeoning byphone technology, the company could double revenues in the next three years as well as growing its workforce. “The phone network stops at a plug in the wall and from that point on, you have to provide the infrastructure and management,” David says. “What we do is focus on the engineering. It’s all about how well it works and adapts to your business. “By focusing on that we are looking at the way things are being built, and we can then get insights on how we can change and improve things.” Led by engineering, the Clarity team is driving change within the telecoms industry ensuring client infrastructure is fit for purpose and for the future. That starts with assessing a business’s needs, making sure the network is suitable, reviewing the workforce needs and bandwidth requirements. From there, Clarity Telecom can develop a bespoke solution – from cabling, to switching, cloud services, routing and phone systems. Clarity Telecom now has a team of  staff – a third of whom work directly within the engineering side of the business. But that number could grow further still, as the company expands its business across Northern Ireland, and develops its byphone technology. The company developed its subsidiary, Voxbit, in  – specically to design engineering solutions. And through that has come one of its most successful products, byphone. A simple to use VoIP , byphone is a drag and drop system that allows users to configure their own phone set up suited to the exact needs of the organisation and enables a range of analysis tools that can help business owners drive up efficiencies. “In  as VoIP started coming along, I realised that was a signicant opportunity,” David says. “Where the communications industry is going is into the cloud. It’s going from traditional storage within buildings, into something in the cloud. The traditional telephone systems are evolving. “We started making a series of innovations surrounding cloud technology. We realised you can make it simpler – we were asking ourselves, can you make it work without a manual, for example. “If you can, in the same way as Apple’s iPhone made things easier for users, people will start using the services. It’s about making everyone’s le easier. “The end user wants to be able to use the system easily, from managing their telephone number, to having access to voicemail. It’s about the ‘power of simple’. “We now have around  resellers for the byphone system in the UK, and we are looking at trebling or quadrupling those sales,” he said. One of Clarity Telecom’s customers is Mid  East Antrim Borough Council. The firm was tasked with bringing together the complex communication needs of the new ‘super council’ following the amalgamation in . “With bringing three councils together, one of the main problems was having a single phone number that people could call. If you have numerous sites, spread across three council areas, that would involve a lot of rip and replace,” David says. “But we gave them one telephone number and then managed the routing to all those bits of equipment across the council areas.” Hotel giant Andras House – which operates seven hotels and , rooms in Belfast including the Crowne Plaza at Shaw’s Bridge and the new Hampton Hilton – is also another major customer. “Businesses trust us to be able to provide the engineering solutions in order for them to run their companies,” David says. So, why should a business consider Clarity Telecom for its crucial and comprehensive connectivity needs  David says Clarity is all about improving how companies interact with their customers – making it easier, and thus, improving revenue and sales. “As you manage your telephone connections you become better at dealing with your customers – you become more efficient at dealing with them, and they will have a better experience. It’s about improving customer contact. “As a business you are able to do a lot more, such as listening to call recordings, access to statistics and using data which will help manage that contact, as well as saving on costs and making your business more efficient. “What solution depends on your business. That is where we come along. We never put a system in without doing a full engineering visit.” Some of the connectivity includes the ability to connect landline with mobile phones, call forwarding and being able to access voicemails as digital recordings, by phone or computer. “When companies deal with us, they can come along and say ‘this is what we are trying to do’, and we are able to work the engineering and infrastructure, before then providing the services,” David says. “It’s also about fighting against the view that it’s all about price. Yes, you have to be competitive, but you need the right infrastructure. For example,a shop loses connectivity for two days, then they lose two days of sales, simply because they don’t have the back-up for the credit card payment system. “It’s about getting businesses to think about the infrastructure and all of the issues. It’s not just about how cheap you can make a call. It’s about how customers can engage with your business – and we are at the heart of making that happen.” For further information, contact Clarity Telecom on    or visit www.clarityteleView all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/glyn_121.jpg","title":"ni business leaders to outline major job creation plan at downing street and westminster","story":"Posted on Tuesday  September  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland industry leaders will outline their plans to create tens of thousands of new jobs to Downing Street, hundreds of MPs and company leaders today as part of a major business delegation visiting London.
