Even Fergie’s daughter Princess Eugenie turned up to welcome the arrival of her first cousin once removed.For Charles, languishing in Scotland, the pain must be considerable.To many puzzled observers it may seem that the neglect in not yet having seen his new grandson, when the Middletons have, must lie with the Prince of Wales. But is that the case?On Wednesday, he understandably had to put duty first, travelling to northern France for the dawn ceremony marking Anzac Day and the centenary of the Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux. A long-planned trip, it involved the prime ministers of France and Australia.All the same, there was a sense of unease among courtiers this week as the prince found himself relegated behind William’s in-laws in the queue to see the latest addition to the House of Windsor.Despite the fact no other senior royals have called in to see the baby, the prince’s absence shines an uncomfortable light on the tricky and perplexing relationship between father and son.We have been here before, of course. Three years ago, Charles complained that he ‘almost never’ sees his first grandson, Prince George, and that he occupied a peripheral role in the little boy’s life.The dismay at seeing less than he expected of his first grandson was amplified because he hoped to become a mentor to the future king.Just a few days before George was born, Charles was happily asking a ladies’ circle for ‘any hints’ on being a grandfather.The anticipation was clear, and it was obvious to those ladies that Charles was determined to be the attentive and loving grandfather he never knew himself.The prince was only three when George VI died, and he never knew his paternal grandfather, Prince Philip’s playboy father Prince Andrew of Greece, who died in 1944.It is not difficult to see how this sparked his desire to be involved in the development of young George, particularly as Charles feels they have a special connection.For he knows that, like himself, George is probably going to have to wait almost a lifetime before he fulfils his destiny. But from the outset, according to insiders, William’s attitude was somewhat different. ‘Very strange,’ says one.On the day Kate’s labour began at St Mary’s Hospital in Paddington, Charles was on a train en route to a day of engagements.He had offered to cancel his duties, but was assured it was not necessary because William did not want visitors to come to the hospital immediately, fearing they would be disruptive. Instead, George’s first visitors were the Middletons, which established a pattern that, tellingly, repeated itself this week.When Kate’s due date with Princess Charlotte emerged, the same instruction not to visit and not to cancel engagements followed. But as a royal aide noted: ‘The Middletons don’t do engagements, so it didn’t apply to them.’In the event, Charlotte was born at the weekend and Kate quickly went home to Kensington Palace. When it became clear to Charles that the Middletons would be visiting, he made an immediate decision to go, driving himself and Camilla from Highgrove.According to a friend, he felt it would ‘look awful’ if he didn’t visit his new granddaughter at the same time as the Middletons.He was said to have ‘hared’ down the motorway to London, and even radioed ahead to London for an aide to collect a gift from Clarence House which Camilla had chosen for the baby, to be sent over to Kensington Palace.In the event, Granny Carole and Grandpa Charles arrived at the palace almost at the same time.‘When it suits him, William can be friendly and welcoming, but he can also be aloof and icy,’ says a close figure. ‘With his father, he can be cordial or effusive, especially if he wants more money, as he did for work on Anmer Hall – his house in Norfolk. He dispenses niceties like he is the owner of a sweet shop to a small child.’Nothing illustrates this wilful approach better than William’s reaction after Charles included a picture on his desk of him with George – alongside photographs of William and Harry – for one of the regular in-house videos the Prince of Wales makes for his charities in Commonwealth countries.William complained bitterly, even though the picture was one that had been issued publicly.Nor, say friends, has he made any secret of the fact that he views the relationship that Carole and Mike Middleton enjoy with their children as being just what he covets for his own family.It doesn’t take a genius to work out that he doesn’t think he has had that kind of relationship with his father.For Charles, who wants only to be a mentor and sounding board for his sons and his grandchildren, it is not just a puzzling situation. It is also a sad one.

Steven Spielberg considers it one of cinema\u0027s towering masterpieces.The ‘Mercury 13’ women who were ready for space: Incredible...IT\u0027S FRIDAY THEATRE: Absolute Hell depicts so much seedy...Share this article"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/05/4B98CC9E00000578-0-image-m-54_1524802115804.jpg","title":"Ann Curry says reported Lauer behalf woman 2012","story":"    Former Today co-host Ann Curry (pictured with Lauer) has claimed that she reported Matt Lauer as a sex pest on behalf of another woman in 2012, despite NBC Chairman Andy Lack saying last year\u0027s complaint against Lauer was the first of its kind  Curry said she approached two members of NBC\u0027s management team after a female staffer told her she was \u0027sexually harassed physically\u0027 by Lauer. \u0027A woman approached me and asked me tearfully if I could help her,\u0027 Curry said Though Curry did not tell NBC management the woman\u0027s name, she did point to Lauer as the person of concern.   \u0027I told management they had a problem and they needed to keep an eye on him and how he deals with women,\u0027 she said.The NBC staffer also confirmed to the Post that she went to Curry with her complaint.An NBC spokesman told the newspaper that there was no record of the report and no mention of it was in Lauer\u0027s personnel file. The network also noted that Lack was not with the company at the time.

Lauer was fired on November 29, 2017, shortly after NBC executives learned of allegations of sexual misconduct. At the time, Lack (center) said it was the first complaint lodged against Lauer in his 20 years at NBC, but the network said \u0027may not have been an isolated incident\u0027  Also on Thursday, former Nightly News anchor Tom Brokaw (left) was accused of sexual misconduct. Linda Vester (right), a former war correspondent for the network, has alleged that Brokaw made unwanted advances toward her in the 1990sAmong other things, Variety reported allegations that Lauer once gave a colleague a sex toy with an explicit note about how he wanted to use it on her that he exposed himself to another female co-worker that he would question female producers about their sex lives and that he would talk about which co-hosts he would like to sleep with.Lauer became the second morning host in a week to lose his job over sexual misconduct allegations. CBS fired Charlie Rose after several women who worked for him complained about his behavior.The 60-year-old has essentially been the king of television morning news since first being paired with Katie Couric on Today in 1997.For many years, Today was the unquestioned ratings leader, until it was eclipsed by ABC\u0027s Good Morning America following the ugly 2012 firing of Lauer\u0027s co-host Curry. The show had stabilized in recent years with Lauer\u0027s pairing with Guthrie. He joins a lengthening list of media figures felled by sexual misconduct accusations this year. Besides Rose, they include Lauer\u0027s NBC News colleague Mark Halperin, Fox News prime-time host Bill O\u0027Reilly and National Public Radio newsroom chief Michael Oreskes. Lauer\u0027s firing came just six weeks after the Harvey Weinstein scandal broke.The Washington Post also reported on Thursday about allegations against former Nightly News anchor Tom Brokaw. Linda Vester, a former war correspondent for the network, has alleged that Brokaw made unwanted advances toward her in the 1990s.One of those advances, she claims, was a forcible kiss. Vester, now 52, said she was 28 at the time of the alleged incidents.   Vester alleged that Brokaw, now 78, invited her for a drink when she was in New York on assignment in 1994. Vester said a similar incident occurred a year later in London.  NBC News faces skepticism in remedying in-house sexual harassment - The Washington Post"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/10/4B9AEFAF00000578-5663951-image-a-4_1524820367410.jpg","title":"Model reveals secret relationship Avicii planning children","story":"    Family: Avicii\u0027s girlfriend, model Tereza Kačerová revealed in a letter posted on Instagram that they were in a serious relationship and that Avicii was a doting step-father to her son Lucas          Secret is out: She writes that she wanted to keep their relationship private due to the \u0027madness\u0027 of Avicii\u0027s fame          Doting: The emotional open letter reveals that Avicii had a close relationship with Ms Kačerová\u0027s son and that they were planning to have children of their own in the future\u0027Dear Tim, \u0027 Ms Kačerová writes in the letter to the late 28-year-old. \u0027I\u0027ve spent the last days waiting to wake up, waiting for someone to tell me this is some sick joke, some awful mistake.

And they were wealthy enough to employ six servants, socialise with the great and good of Leeds, and involve themselves in the politics of the day.

Together, the tentacles of their influence reached across the city.But the family was also struck by tragedy.Arthur’s wife Harriot, who was a cousin of Beatrix Potter’s mother Helen, died in childbirth in 1888, at the age of 35, before her famous cousin published her first children’s book The Tale of Peter Rabbit, leaving her husband a widower with three children Arthur, two, Elinor, one, and baby Elizabeth.

Within 11 months he was dead. A year later his father Arthur succumbed to grief.It was Hugo Lupton, son of Arthur’s younger brother Hugh and cousin of Kate’s great-grandmother Olive, who was responsible for linking the Luptons to Arthur Ransome.An old Wellingtonian and Trinity College alumnus, who won a Military Cross for his service in France, he married the author’s sister Joyce in 1920 and had four children Francis, in 1921, Arthur, in 1924, Cecily, in 1927, and Geoffrey, in 1930, ensuring the name Arthur went down through the generations.

Her paternal grandfather and uncle were both known as Charlie, although they were both christened Stephen Charles.The elder Charlie Goldsmith – Kate’s great-grandfather – was born at home in Acton, Middlesex, in 1886, and brought up in Southall. When he left home he lived in Uxbridge, where he worked as a mechanic and met his future wife Edith.A tiny woman, under 5 ft tall and weighing 7 stone, she was disfigured by a huge scar on her torso, which she had got during a narrow escape from death when she was a toddler.‘Grandad used to light his cigar in his big oil stove in the hall of the big house where they lived,’ his daughter Alice Tomlinson, the only one of his children still alive at 106 told me.‘He would roll a piece of paper up and put it in the stove and light his cigar. of course, when he went out, my mum copied. She had a go doing the same thing and nearly burned herself to death.’Charlie and Edith got married at Uxbridge Register office in 1909. She was four months pregnant with their eldest child, whom they named after his father.When Charlie Jnr was five years old, his father signed up, serving in France with the Royal Fusiliers, initially in the trenches and afterwards in the cookhouse. He was one of Kitchener’s ‘shilling men’.Luckily, he survived the war but returned home with emphysema. The father-of-six died in 1938, when his oldest son Charlie was 28 years old, and his youngest son, Kate’s grandfather Ronald was just six years old. His widow Edith was forced to move into a condemned flat and go to work at the local factory.Less than a century later, their great-granddaughter is living in Kensington Palace.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/20/4B77441D00000578-0-image-m-21_1524856582755.jpg","title":"Is royal baby look like","story":"    How a forensic artist predicted Prince Louis of Cambridge will look in years to comeThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have finally revealed the name of their newborn son, and this is how he could look in years to come.A forensic artist, who is based in Washington D.C, studied recent photographs of Prince William, Kate and their two eldest children.Joe Mullins then put together an image of what he predicts Prince Louis will look like in the future.According to Mr Mullins\u0027 predictions the youngster will have blue eyes, dark blonde hair and full cheeks.He has previously released images of what he predicted Prince George and Princess Charlotte would look like as they grew up.At the time Mr Mullins\u0027 pictures suggested that the children would both have dark hair and blue eyes.  Royalists and bookmakers alike have waited patiently since Monday to find out the name of the new arrival and fifth in line to the throne.     Joe Mullins has previously released images of what he predicted Prince George and Princess Charlotte would look like as they grew upThe name serves as a poignant tribute to Prince Charles\u0027 beloved great-uncle, mentor and \u0027honorary grandfather\u0027, Lord Mountbatten, who was killed in 1979 when the IRA placed a bomb in his fishing boat.   More than 100,000 bets were placed across the UK betting industry on the baby name, with both Albert and Arthur leading the way as the bookmakers\u0027 favourite.Legoland to give free entry to anyone called Louis after...Share this articleBut William and Kate have plumped for a moniker used for centuries across the Channel by the French, who have had 18 kings called Louis.    Following the baby\u0027s arrival, Prince Harry shifts down the line of succession to sixth place. The Duke of York, who was born second in line, has moved to seventh and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie to eighth and ninth.             According to Mr Mullins\u0027 predictions the youngster will have blue eyes, dark blonde hair and full cheeksAndrew falling out of the top six means he will no longer have to ask the Queen for permission to marry - unlike Charles, William, George, Charlotte and Harry.The first six people in the line of succession must have the Queen\u0027s consent before they can marry on May 19, as set out by the Succession to the Crown Act 2013.The act\u0027s introduction also saw sex removed as a determining factor in the line of succession.It has also been claimed that the royal baby has been born a commoner.Royal historian Marlene Koenig told Town and Country: \u0027It sounds complicated, but in the UK, the only people who are not commoners are the Sovereign and peers of the realm, Duke, Marquess, Earl, Viscount, and Baron.\u0027  It was always thought that William and Kate would go on to have three children.Kate is one of three and had a happy home life with her sister, Pippa Matthews, and brother, James Middleton, and is close to both of her siblings.But William may need to adjust to caring for a newborn once again.Kate joked in the months leading up to her due date that her husband was \u0027in denial\u0027 about having a third.By having more than two children, William and Kate are following in the footsteps of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, who went on to have four children - although there was a gap of 10 years between their second child, Anne, and third, Andrew. Is this what royal baby could look like?

Mitochondria are present in every cell in the body apart from red blood cells.They are responsible for creating over 90 per cent of the energy we need to maintain brain and body function.  When they fail, less and less energy is generated within the cell and they eventually start to die.If this process is repeated throughout the body, whole organ systems begin to fail.The parts of the body, such as the heart, brain, muscles and lungs, requiring the greatest amounts of energy are the most affected.

which may in turn reinforce alcohol use.\u0027          Therefore drinking is likely to make you think the people around you are more attractive therefore you\u0027re likely to keep doing it. The study argues that it is surprising that researchers who study alcohol may have missed that an aspect of social functioning is perception of how attractive someone is. Researchers looked into previous studies on alcohol and reviewed the ones where people had to rate levels of attractiveness before and after drinking alcohol.  Their research proved that although difference was modest it still showed that alcohol had a significant effect. Due to the artificial set up of the experiment where iniduals were told to rate others in a laboratory experts believe that it would be heightened in a real-life

Shortly afterwards, Mr Elphicke was told the payment had gone through, the woman was withdrawing her complaint and the relevant files had been ‘destroyed’.Mr Elphicke’s friends also challenge the woman’s claim that he touched her leg while driving her to his constituency after the alleged ‘fondling’ incident.‘Much later in the day of the alleged leg touching, he dropped her off at a station so she could get the train home and she never mentioned it then or afterwards,’ said one.The ‘lunge’ complaint by a lobbyist surfaced two days after Mr Elphicke was suspended by Mr Smith. Police told the MP that the woman claimed he had ‘put his arm around her and leaned in to kiss her’ in a Commons lift in May 2015 after they had drinks in Parliament’s Pugin Room.Mr Elphicke denied it and said the woman’s claim was undermined by the fact that in the intervening period she had stayed in touch and regularly asked him out to drinks and dinner. He showed police one text message which she signed off with a friendly ‘X.’The MP had first met the lobbyist as part of his work for the Commons Treasury Select Committee. They had also discussed the possibility of her working for him as a press officer.That became impractical after the 2015 Election, when Mr Elphicke became a Whip – by custom, office holders do not speak in public. He invited her to the Pugin Room to break the news to her over a drink.Afterwards, he escorted her to the Commons exit via a lift.The MP told police they retained cordial relations for the next two and half years – until she complained to Tory HQ two days after his suspension in November 2017.Mr Elphicke declined to comment last night and Downing Street said: ‘We cannot comment on an ongoing police inquiry.’A spokesman for Mr Smith said he ‘robustly denied’ referring allegations against Mr Elphicke to police ‘in an effort to support suspension of the whip’ or that he knew of some allegations ‘some time before they were referred to the police’. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/28/23/4BA7E7A100000578-0-image-a-12_1524955729883.jpg","title":"Gosh Meghan POSH youve got Victoria Beckham leads new royal pal follows","story":"Pretty in cream: Meghan\u0027s high-neck sweater she wore on a visit to Birmingham this year was very similar to the one Victoria Beckham wore out and about in New York in 2016  City chic: The hat Meghan wore on a trip to London struck a similar chord as the one Posh wore in the capital in 2014  Strutting their stuff: Meghan and Posh both wore a flared pair of high-waisted trousers this year, with Posh working the look during New York Fashion Week and Meghan showcasing the ensemble on a trip to Edinburgh  Regal white: Meghan opted for a similar look to Posh when she took a trip to Westminster Abbey this year, showcasing a high collar coat very similar to the Spice Girl\u0027s ensemble as she strutted through JFK Airport in New YorkAnd no guessing whose style pointers Meghan has followed since landing on our shores.The two women have been friends for a few years, since Meghan first started visiting Britain. Victoria has introduced Meghan to British brands and even her favourite facialist, Chelsea-based Sarah Chapman.\u0027Now we\u0027re just trolling the French!\u0027 Social media explodes...Share this articleThe Mail on Sunday understands Victoria and husband David have even been invited to the royal wedding.So what is VB style, and why does it work?

Sceptics, though, will fret that there is no guarantee this will happen in reality. The mega-merger will also prompt suppliers to fear they will be squeezed even further in the relentless battle to drive down prices.The two chains are very different and will retain their own identities so as not to alienate their core customers. Sainsbury’s has traditionally had a genteel image and is strong in the South of England. Asda has a more cheap and cheerful approach and is a powerhouse in the North. \u0027Keep the shops well lit\u0027: Last words of the man who founded...Landmark ban on plastic: Over FORTY of Britain\u0027s biggest...Share this articleThe real rationale for the tie-up, though, is that both are feeling the chill of competition from German discounters Aldi and Lidl, which have been seizing larger and larger shares of the nation’s shopping basket. Online operators are also a growing threat.The pressure on wholesale prices following the Brexit referendum, with the fall in the pound ramping up the cost of imported goods, squeezed margins yet further.          A £15 billion merger with Asda is undoubtedly a bold and unexpected move by Sainsbury’s chief executive Mike CoupeUncertainty over the future of EU workers, who the stores rely on to stock shelves and pick their fruit and vegetables – added to the worries. But is a merger the best solution for the two firms and their consumers?Those of us with long memories will recall that this is the biggest deal in the grocery sector since Wm Morrison took over Safeway in 2004. That’s not a happy precedent.Coupe, whose modest demeanour belies a steely streak, could point to his successful takeover of Argos in 2016 as a counter-example, though at £1.4 billion it was a much smaller deal. Argos stores, already inside branches of Sainsbury’s, are likely to sprout up in Asda shops in future.That’s assuming the deal is waved through. City analysts reckon the Competition and Markets Authority will not block the tie-up, though regulators are likely to order some disposals.One reason mergers often come adrift is executive ego, as bosses clash over precedence. Here there is cause for hope. The relationship between Coupe and his counterpart at Asda, Roger Burnley, is a close one.The two grocers are former long-standing colleagues who get on well. They worked side-by-side at Sainsbury’s for years before Burnley moved to Asda last year, where Coupe also worked earlier in his career. After the merger, Coupe will be overall top dog while Burnley will keep his role as the supremo at Asda.Many questions remain, including how many stores might be closed. One thing is for certain, though: knitting together two large store chains is a task that will test even the most brilliant executives.  Asda stores set to become Sainsbury\u0027s if huge £15BILLION merger is approved that would give giant new supermarket group a THIRD of the UK marketSainsbury\u0027s and Asda are in talks over an astonishing £15billion mega-merger to create Britain\u0027s biggest supermarket chain.Sainsbury\u0027s confirmed last night that it is in \u0027advanced discussions\u0027 with Asda, owned by American giant Walmart.Sainsbury\u0027s and Asda have combined sales of £50billion a year and a merger is likely to mean lower prices for shoppers.             The tie-up is seen as a response to the relentless rise of German discounters Aldi and Lidl, which have been chipping away at the big supermarkets over the past few years, as well as online operations such as Ocado.Lidl and Aldi now have a combined market share of 12.6 per cent – more than fourth-largest grocer Morrisons. Tesco is currently the country\u0027s largest food retailer.But the combination of Asda and Sainsbury\u0027s, which together employ more than 350,000 staff, will leapfrog into the number one slot. However, shoppers would initially see little change, with stores still operating under their present names.But, according to Sky News City editor Mark Kleinman, who broke the story, Wal-Mart could \u0027reverse\u0027 Asda into Sainsbury\u0027s - raising the prospect of Asda stores becoming Sainsbury\u0027s. Some analysts also believe that hundreds of stores could close.The news of the merger has shocked the City and has been greeted with alarm by trade unions, which fear stores will be closed and thousands of jobs lost. There are also concerns over pensions.             The first Asda store is pictured in West Yorkshire. After running under the name of \u0027Queens\u0027, the Asquith family merged with Associated Dairies to form Asda (Asquith and Dairies) in 1965            John James Sainsbury and his wife Mary Ann opened the first ever Sainsbury\u0027s store (pictured) in 1869 in London\u0027s Drury Lane (pictured in 1920)Shopworkers\u0027 union Usdaw is seeking \u0027urgent talks\u0027.             Sainsbury\u0027s CEO Mike Coupe                                                    It is understood Walmart may keep a minority stake in the British business. That means a combined operation could benefit from the Americans\u0027 vast buying power, helping slash prices for electronics, clothes and toys. Walmart declined to comment.The proposed deal will come under intense scrutiny from the Competition and Markets Authority to make sure the combined business does not monopolise the sector.However, most analysts expect the merger to go through, although Sainsbury\u0027s and Asda could be told to sell or close stores in areas where they are too dominant.Retail expert Nick Bubb said: \u0027This has come like a bolt from the blue. Sainsbury\u0027s boss Mike Coupe is looking to defend the chain from competition from Tesco, discount retailers such as Aldi and Lidl, and online retailers such as Amazon and Ocado. The deal is a worry for smaller players such as Waitrose and Morrisons.\u0027 The merger would have to be approved by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), because the two entities are the second and third largest grocery retailers in the UK.

Shortly afterwards, Mr Elphicke was told the payment had gone through, the woman was withdrawing her complaint and the relevant files had been ‘destroyed’.Mr Elphicke’s friends also challenge the woman’s claim that he touched her leg while driving her to his constituency after the alleged ‘fondling’ incident.‘Much later in the day of the alleged leg touching, he dropped her off at a station so she could get the train home and she never mentioned it then or afterwards,’ said one.The ‘lunge’ complaint by a lobbyist surfaced two days after Mr Elphicke was suspended by Mr Smith. Police told the MP that the woman claimed he had ‘put his arm around her and leaned in to kiss her’ in a Commons lift in May 2015 after they had drinks in Parliament’s Pugin Room.Mr Elphicke denied it and said the woman’s claim was undermined by the fact that in the intervening period she had stayed in touch and regularly asked him out to drinks and dinner. He showed police one text message which she signed off with a friendly ‘X.’The MP had first met the lobbyist as part of his work for the Commons Treasury Select Committee. They had also discussed the possibility of her working for him as a press officer.That became impractical after the 2015 Election, when Mr Elphicke became a Whip – by custom, office holders do not speak in public.

Retirement housing provider Platinum Skies has a part-buy, part-rent scheme, which enables retirees to have more money at their fingertips. It is offering one-bedroom apartments in its Monterey development in Christchurch, Dorset, for £140,000 for a 50 per cent share of the property. At Wadswick Green in Wiltshire, a particularly popular fundraising activity was a fashion show, which was open to the public.           At Churchill Retirement Living’s King’s Lodge in Maidstone, several members of the weekly ‘Knit and Natter’ group made special Easter chicks to hold chocolate eggs, raising more than £100 for Heart of Kent HospiceA percentage of the event’s ticket sales went to Dorothy House hospice near Bath. Clare Jones, Wadswick Green’s marketing manager, says: ‘We are due to open our latest phase, Almond Close, soon, which sees an additional 45 apartments. With more residents moving to Wadswick Green, I’m sure there will be many more exciting initiatives and fundraisers taking place.’ In 2017, employees and residents at McCarthy \u0026amp Stone’s developments all around the country raised £269,000 for the Royal Voluntary Service, which helps older people stay active and independent. To help make this amount, McCarthy \u0026amp Stone developments opened their doors to welcome people in for fundraising vintage tea parties, craft workshops and choir performances. Another provider of retirement housing, St Monica Trust, shares McCarthy \u0026amp Stone’s attitude regarding residents mingling with their local communities, and holds a number of free events to encourage an inter-generational mix, particularly at its Chocolate Quarter development in Keynsham, near Bristol. As a charity it does not fundraise for other charities but awards gifts and grants to iniduals, families and organisations through the trust’s Community Fund.

Who today delivers the most magic in their prose?E Crawford, BeijingAmanda Craig, novelist and critic, whose most recent book is The Lie of the LandMagic may be evoked in many ways and Updike did it both in the sense of mixing the mundane with the supernatural (The Witches of Eastwick) and in conjuring contemporary fiction whose realism is threaded through with hypnotic lyricism (the Rabbit novels, Couples,\u0026nbspetc).If you are looking for the supernatural, Philip Pullman’s His Dark Materials channels the majesty of Milton and the enchantment of CS Lewis. In his multiverse, the anguish of witches who love mortal men, the ferocious joy of fighting and hunger, fear, love and protectiveness experienced by two children on the verge of adolescence are powerfully conveyed in the direct, exact prose of a master.Another gorgeously sorcerous writer is AS Byatt. Her descriptions of Victorian England in Possession, and her short stories, are saturated with sensuous intelligence even when not directly supernatural, these have the feel of a fairytale.If it is Updike’s realist magic you are after, then Meg Wolitzer is, like him, a lyrical chronicler of love and marriage – but unlike Updike, brilliant at female characters as well as male ones. Her descriptions in The Interestings and The Female Persuasion of loneliness, love, growing maturity and reading itself evoke quotidian joys and sorrows with humour, generosity and hope.Diana Evans is another superb domestic realist. Her new novel, Ordinary People, contains some of the best descriptions of happy and unhappy sex I’ve read since Ian McEwan’s Atonement. She writes about black south Londoners struggling with young families, ambition, adultery and disappointment with the wry insights Updike gave to his white east coasters.If you’ve got a question for Book Clinic, submit it below or email bookclinic@observer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f74ff792cf3ddf79fcef874c43eb407d925eb08/0_0_2665_1600/master/2665.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b94feca3ba75efbfbc24b5283a60b093","title":"george orwell down out london paris live performance","story":"The thief who took the last of an ailing George Orwell’s money from his Paris room in 1929 did a big favour to political literature.Cast into real poverty by the sudden loss of his savings, the young Etonian writer had to search about for dishwashing work in the kitchens of the French capital. Months of hard labour as a “plongeur”, coupled with time living “the life of the road” as a tramp in England gave the future author of Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four the basis for his remarkable memoir, Down and Out in Paris and London.This summer the influential ideas contained in Orwell’s first published book are to be turned into a one-off live theatrical event staged in both cities. Leading actors and writers will gather in tribute to the great English author’s brave attempt to understand homelessness and poverty.The planned immersive performance of readings from Orwell’s book and from other key works, including his essay The Spike and his novel A Clergyman’s Daughter, is to take place first in London and then in Paris, accompanied by modern testimony from refugees and rough sleepers and by poetry, musical performances and panel discussions. “It is thrilling to be able to connect to our colleagues in Paris in this joint creative and intellectual piece of work. But we are ashamed that it is so necessary,” said Jean Seaton, director of the Orwell Foundation, which has joined forces with the Joseph Rowntree Foundation to run the event as a response to growing levels\u0026nbspof homelessness in both capitals.“Now low pay, insecure work, high housing costs, debt and insufficient benefits are pushing people to the brink,” said the Rowntree foundation’s chief executive, Campbell Robb. “The idea is to use Orwell as he would want, to build a better understanding of modern poverty and build support to solve homelessness.”Orwell’s original words, coupled with those of today’s homeless people, will be read by a mix of leading actors, artists, politicians and campaigners throughout one whole day under the direction of Hannah Price, who said this weekend she feels honoured to be using Orwell’s thoughts as “the backbone of an immersive performance that places the shocking rise of homelessness at its centre”.It is to be a tale of two cities put together by Libby Brodie Productions, which collaborated with the Orwell Foundation for last year’s Nineteen Eighty-Four Live event – a start-to-finish reading of the book in a single day by a collection of actors, writers and members of the public. This performance featured readings from Dame Harriet Walter, Simon Schama, Frances Barber, Melvyn Bragg, Billy Bragg and David Olusoga, among many others, and was streamed online by a worldwide audience of tens of thousands.Once again the readings and performances will take place inside Senate House, London University’s landmark building and the architectural inspiration for Orwell’s looming Ministry of Truth in Nineteen Eighty-Four. The event on 6 June is part of UCL’s Festival of Culture and will be live streamed, as well as filmed by the award-winning artist and film director Edwin Mingard. In Paris, where the causes and symptoms of homelessness can often take a different form, the single performance of Down and Out will take place in late September. The city is coping with a tide of international homelessness – in February volunteers found nearly 3,000 rough sleepers, many of them migrants. Paris was also a tough place to find shelter between the wars. Orwell eventually found a job at the anonymous Hotel X, but he remained unpaid for 10 days and so was forced to sleep on a bench until he had rent money.“The Paris slums are a gathering-place for eccentric people – people who have fallen into solitary, half-mad grooves of life and given up trying to be normal or decent. Poverty frees them from ordinary standards of behaviour, just as money frees people from work,” he wrote then, although his sympathies were firmly with his fellow “beggars”.His resonant words on the pervasive social evil of destitution will be at the heart of this summer’s event: “The evil of poverty is not so much that it makes a man suffer as that it rots him physically and spiritually.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c0b0847b5f0ce18828c8279b52adcb5f4edc09b8/0_278_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1c8e3a427bcc4e4fd1080daa3ac2f50","title":"sainsburys and asda in shock talks over 10bn merger deal","story":"Sainsbury’s and Asda are in talks over a £10bn merger that would send shockwaves through the high street by creating a retailer more powerful than the current market leader, Tesco.A tie-up between the UK’s second- and third-largest supermarket chains would create a new group with huge share of the market in food, clothing, household goods and toy retailing. Sainsbury’s already owns Argos while Asda’s George clothing brand vies with Marks \u0026amp Spencer and Primark to sell the most clothing in volume terms. The enlarged supermarket group would have nearly 3,000 stores and annual sales of more than £50bn.Any proposed deal is likely to be closely scrutinised by the competition watchdog over concerns it would tighten the grip the four major supermarket chains – Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons – have on the UK grocery market. Analysts also suggest the combination could lead to thousands of job losses as the two chains cut out duplication. The big supermarkets have recently cut thousands of back-office and shopfloor jobs in a drive to cut costs. They are trying to rebuild their profits, which have collapsed as the fast-growing German discounters Aldi and Lidl have stolen shoppers, while online players led by Amazon have sucked sales out of the high street.Mike Coupe, the chief executive of London-based Sainsbury’s, is said to be in the driving seat, making the future of Asda’s Leeds head office look uncertain. A combination of the two groups would be expected to strip out costs by consolidating back-office operations. Asda is run by a former Sainsbury’s executive, Roger Burnley, who quit the group for a more senior role at the rival in 2015.Sainsbury’s confirmed it was in talks with the US retail giant Walmart, which has owned Asda since 1999. “Sainsbury’s confirms that it and Walmart Inc are in advanced discussions regarding a combination of the Sainsbury’s and Asda businesses,” the company said in statement rushed out on Saturday afternoon after Sky News and the newswire Bloomberg both reported the story. Sainsbury’s promised to provide more details to the stock exchange on Monday morning.It has previously been unthinkable that there would be consolidation among the UK’s big four supermarkets because of competition concerns, but the retailers are said to have been emboldened after the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) waved through the merger of Tesco and Booker, the UK’s biggest retailer and grocery wholesaler respectively.The deal comes at a time of major upheaval in the retail sector as Aldi and Lidl become increasingly powerful and the cost of running high street stores increases because of higher business rates and labour costs. Sainsbury’s is also looking for ways to shore up its market position in the wake of Tesco’s recent takeover of Booker. That deal increased Tesco’s buying power by creating a food group with sales of £57.5bn.Sainsbury’s has a network of more than 1,400 supermarkets and convenience stores while Asda has around 600 stores. Sainsbury’s also has 800 Argos outlets.“It’s hard to see this being good for consumers,” said Scott Corfe, the chief economist at the Social Market Foundation thinktank. “Recent experience, with the rise of Aldi and Lidl triggering a supermarket price war, supports the case for a less concentrated groceries sector - not a more concentrated one.”It is unclear how the deal between Sainsbury’s and Asda might be structured. Sainsbury’s is listed in London and it is understood US-listed Walmart intends to retain a large shareholding in the enlarged group. Further clarity is expected on Monday. The Usdaw union’s national officer, Joanne McGuinness, said it would be seeking urgent meetings with the businesses to get more detail on what a merger would involve. “Our priorities will be to protect our members and ensure any deal between the retailers does not impact on their jobs or incomes,” she said.If the merger happens it would be biggest shake-up in UK grocery retailing since Morrisons took over Safeway in 2004. Analysts debated the merits of the proposed deal on social media, with many convinced competition concerns would force the companies to sell off a large number of stores.Bryan Roberts, a TCC Global analyst, also questioned the logic of the deal. “I don’t see what problems this solves. They will still be unable to be cheaper than Aldi and Lidl because they have a unique operating model. I was also expect that there would need to be a chunky disposal programme once the CMA has looked at local competition issues.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/298f03d69c3a8896648cbf7583103552ebfe6342/107_160_5134_3081/master/5134.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92c846e908f69bcfe052524a22865e5c","title":"waterstones paul singer elliott secretive wizard","story":"A Republican billionaire hedge fund manager attacked by the former president of Argentina as a “financial terrorist” and “vulture lord” has just bought your local bookshop.Elliott Advisors, the UK ision of the $34bn (£25bn) activist hedge fund, Elliott Management, run by controversial New Yorker Paul Singer, last week bought Waterstones from Russian billionaire Alexander Mamut in a secretive deal thought to have valued the bookshop chain at more than £200m.It’s small change for Singer, 73, who has amassed a $2.9bn personal fortune according to Forbes. But it’s the latest in a string of deals his fund has made in the UK, where his son Gordon runs Elliott Advisors.Elliott, the world’s largest activist hedge fund, has sued Tesco over the 2014 accounting scandal and fought a very public battle with the management of coach and train operator National Express.Last month – after rapidly building a big stake in takeover target GKN – it threw its weight behind bidder Melrose, helping the business branded an asset stripper win the battle for control of the industrial giant. GKN’s then boss, Anne Stevens, said shareholders like Elliott did not “give a crap” about the best long-term\u0026nbspoutcomes.The firm’s renewed interest in British companies should allow Singer to indulge in one of his greatest passions: Arsenal FC. He is a regular at his local sports bar on New York’s exclusive Upper West Side when Arsenal are playing, and has been spotted in the crowd at the Emirates stadium with his son Gordon.Singer is also an accomplished pianist and has been known to perform with one son on guitar, the other on drums and his son-in-law on saxophone. On one occasion he rocked out with Meat Loaf at a party.But it is his aggressive attitude to business for which Singer is equally feared and respected. His hedge fund, which he started in 1977 with $1.3m raised from friends and family, has been involved in many of the most high-profile and bruising corporate and political battles of recent years.His strategy of buying up struggling countries’ debts in order to sell them on for big profits or sue governments to demand full repayment led to Elliott being repeatedly labelled a “vulture fund”, a term Singer is known to despise.He spent $20m in 1995 on defaulted debt from Peru, and then successfully sued for $58m. He acquired at a discounted price a $30m debt owed by Congo-Brazzaville, and in 2002 and 2003 won more than $100m in\u0026nbspinterest.He chased Argentina for debts for more than decade, including tracking the course of a Argentine navy ship, Libertad. When it arrived in Ghana, he persuaded one of the country’s judges to detain the vessel in port until he was paid the millions owed to him. Argentina won that round, successfully arguing in the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea that the ship should be released. But he won a later court battle resulting in the South American country defaulting on its debts.The former president of Argentina, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, memorably described Singer as “the Vulture Lord”, a “bloodsucker” and a “financial terrorist”.Singer guards his privacy fiercely and has given very few interviews, but the Financial Times reported that when a journalist from Euromoney magazine asked if legal skirmishes were fun, he was met with a look of incomprehension and astonishment. “Fun? Skiing is fun. This is work.”In a rare deliberate step into the spotlight, he corralled other hedge fund managers to join him in financially backing the 2011 vote to legalise gay marriage in New York state. The money, an estimated $10m of which Singer personally pledged, was said to have swung the vote.It was personal for Singer, as his younger son Andrew, a New York doctor, is gay and could not marry in the state, so instead married his husband in Massachusetts in 2009.“It was something that was beyond my understanding at the time,” Singer said of his son’s coming out during a debate on gay rights at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 2014. “After a series of mutually supportive conversations, I became very educated about gender and sexuality, and I became very enthusiastic about his efforts to stop discrimination.”Singer is a big donor to the Republican party, but funded the “Never Trump” movement before the 2016 election. But ever the pragmatist, since the election Singer has met Trump in the White House.After one visit Trump declared that Singer “was very much involved with the anti-Trump or, as they say, ‘Never Trump,’ and Paul just left, and he’s given us his total support and it’s all about unification.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a7d06a90b998a65757907ff10c74a77e8e5e8362/107_0_2480_1488/master/2480.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d56141521cb1af60385050a40e562430","title":"i have found out that social housing is not just a safety net for the few","story":"Although provoked by the Grenfell Tower tragedy, which drew attention to social housing in the UK, Shelter’s commission into the future of social housing will go much wider than one fateful fire and address concerns that people in social housing are being ignored.Alongside 15 others, including Ed Miliband, Doreen Lawrence and those from the Grenfell community, I have joined the commission and will spend the next few months hearing from social tenants about their experiences, setting out necessary changes and scrutinising the role the sector could play in easing Britain’s housing crisis.I am the first to admit that I’m an unlikely social housing commissioner. I have never lived in social housing. Even during my childhood, my parents turned to our wider family to support us during tough times. Social housing, meanwhile, was for people who had hit rock bottom and had nowhere to turn for help.Growing up, I was fortunate enough to seize the opportunities provided by social mobility. I was lucky that, as a young lawyer in Yorkshire, I was able to buy my first home – for around twice my salary. Yes, interest rates were high 25 years ago and I still had to work hard, but it didn’t occur to me that I wouldn’t be able to buy my own home.Now I meet young solicitors who, even with a promising career, know the prospect of owning their own home seems impossible. I used to assume that the market would always provide for people who worked hard, that any kinks in the housing market would iron themselves out in the end. Of course, a safety net would always be necessary for some, yet for the majority hard work would pay off and social housing would be as irrelevant as it had been to me. Housing would be a private matter, not a government concern.Now, this basic social contract is broken. Socially mobile young people find that working hard isn’t enough unless they have help from the bank of mum and dad. And that safety net for people at the bottom? It’s looking ever more stretched as more and more people need help.It’s clear that the housing market is fundamentally broken. Tweaks by successive governments have not rectified this and even the current Conservative government has published a white paper on the “broken housing market”. That’s because the effects are being felt widely, from the growing numbers of people being made homeless, to young people stuck in expensive and insecure private rents, despairing of ever finding a way out.Politicians cannot look young people in the eyes and honestly tell them that everything will be OK if they just work hard. Our broken housing market has become a major barrier to social mobility.This is an intolerable situation and demands politicians of all hues respond. Shelter’s commission will consider the role in which social housing, and government more generally, should provide an alternative.I start this process with a genuinely open mind. I admit that I have been innately sceptical of large-scale social housing. I’ve always seen it as a safety net, but a worsening housing crisis forces us to ask whether that safety net needs to be stretched far wider. Or, with the market no longer providing a housing ladder, does a wider group of people need to use social housing as a stepping stone?Shelter has embarked on a large consultation and fact-finding exercise, which will give me and my fellow commissioners the evidence we need to answer these questions. It’s a privilege to have the opportunity to debate this alongside 15 smart people from a range of backgrounds and political affiliations. We have met once and it’s impossible to guess what we will conclude, but what’s clear and exciting is a shared determination to set out a vision for social housing that everyone can support.• Sayeeda Warsi is a lawyer and a member of the House of Lords"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6689f6891154f1b0578be8646f260c2e7bb5c8d9/0_107_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0360e9995e66fe698cc12dc38a3d799a","title":"never have words meant so little for a generation of politicians amber rudd","story":"We live in a time when words have never meant less and cynicism has never been more widely accepted. Did I say “accepted”? That is too weak. The embrace of dishonesty is so clammy, politicians react with astonishment when naive citizens demonstrate their bad taste by supposing that they are somehow accountable for their actions.In near identical language, Amber Rudd said she was “surprised” that the Tories’ “hostile environment” for migrants had led to the state persecution of the innocent. Her contemporary Emily Thornberry was not just “surprised”, she was “really shocked” that racists were thanking her for the fine job she and her colleagues in Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour party were doing in baiting Jews.The personal is no longer political. In private, Thornberry and Rudd are forceful, friendly, intelligent and liberal. To use a phrase that falls from our lips too easily, they “don’t have a racist bone in their bodies” and appear genuinely outraged when their critics assume they are built with little else. They don’t understand that racist bones are neither here nor there when what they lack are backbones.After Ukip terrified the established parties, politicians on the make resolved to show their hostility to migrants. Rudd made the smart move of closing her eyes and blocking her ears as British citizens complained that the state was forcing them to produce documentation going back decades to rent a home, open a bank account, go to a doctor or hold on to a job.What did you expect her to do? Challenge the prime minister and take on the Tory backbenches and Tory press by creating a “just environment” for migrants? Come now. Conventional wisdom holds we should nod along and realise she had no choice. Not because Rudd is wicked, but because no one on the right can be liberal on immigration in the 2010s. It’s not personal, just political.As with Ukip, so with the Corbyn insurgency. Thornberry does not get on in his Labour party by showing solidarity with abused Jewish colleagues. She gets on by pleasing Vladimir Putin’s propagandists and announcing in defiance of all evidence that the United Nations, not Russia, was stopping chemical weapons inspectors investigating the gassing of civilians by the Kremlin’s Syrian ally. Once again we are meant to shrug. Wake up and smell the bitter coffee. This is how an ambitious Labour politician must behave if they want to appeal to Len McCluskey and all Labour’s cranks and conspiracists who will have their say when the next leadership contest comes.Rudd and Thornberry are mere appetisers. No historian can find a precedent for today’s parliament where the prime minister and most of the government and opposition benches will consciously vote for a policy they know will make the nation poorer. So complete is their abandonment of any conception of political integrity that they cannot tell the truth about the choices they are making as they push to leave the single market. They will not level with the public and say suffering is the price of a hard Brexit. In the words of the anti-Brexit campaigner Hugo Dixon, it would be an “electrifying moment” if Theresa May or any one of her ministers merely gave a plain account of the country’s future.If it’s not a constant of human nature to damn the present and romanticise the past, it’s certainly a constant of journalism. Hans Rosling and Steven Pinker have written with penetration on how, with the ominous exceptions of the environment and the human race’s mass extinction of species, life is becoming better. Whether you measure global poverty, access to healthcare, sexual equality, the experience of war and violence or life expectancy, the present is preferable to the recent past – overwhelmingly so.It sounds like mere nostalgia to unleash a heartrending “O tempora! O mores!” and lament our ill luck to have fallen under the rule of a uniquely cynical generation of politicians. Few have ever got to the top of politics or any other hierarchical system without compromising their integrity, after all. What’s new? To my mind, there are two solid reasons for thinking the British at least are in a new and worse place .The first is the difference in scale between the spin of the Hillary ClintonDavid CameronNick Clegg generation of politicians and bombast of today’s leaders. The Leave campaign won with barefaced lies: that Britain paid £350m a week to Brussels and Turkey was about to join the EU and send an invasion force of millions of (Muslim) migrants our way. Trump won by convincing tens of millions of Americans that the truth about him was fake news.There are many honourable political exceptions and we can only hope they will be steeled by today’s battles and provide the leaders of the future. But when all the caveats are made, we are still left with politicians who have learned that the more vehemently they deny, the more they succeed the greater the lie, the greater the reward.Then there is a difference in the stakes, which could not be higher. The Tories may not end up as a nationalist party, which appeals only to whites. Labour may not end up as the natural home for creeps. But in both instances the fight is on and the outcome uncertain. Beyond them lies Brexit, the greatest issue since the Second World War. I suppose it is asking too much to expect Conservative and Labour leaders to adopt a Churchillian pose and promise “blood, toil, tears and sweat”. But their inability to acknowledge the pain ahead for the most vulnerable people and most depressed regions is to use the word in its proper context for once more than a surprise. It is “shocking”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/56de1bc55fbbe7f3ade1054eb8e25fa43bb9a787/0_213_4151_2492/master/4151.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32a10fc323ac231edf0a74e269b10731","title":"old young housing contract generational","story":"Providing healthcare for the elderly and homes for the young requires a major shift in thinkingWe need to follow the lead of Britain’s families and put in the hard work to renew the contract between the generationsYou don’t get a better Britain by chance – you have to build it. Nor are we likely to overcome the ides facing our country by accident – we have to unify it. But when it comes to ensuring that Britain works for all generations, young and old, as a society we too often leave it to chance, something families would never do.The give and take of the generational contract, in which we support young and old, feels like the natural order of things. Contributing when we can and being looked after when in need is what we do every day as 14 million parents bring up their children. And just as that contract underpins our families, it has long underpinned our society and welfare state.But this intergenerational contract is under pressure. We are already failing to provide the social care our older generations deserve, need and expect. And this is before the real pressures, and a £24bn bill, from delivering on our health and care obligations in an ageing society arrive in the next decade. Solution after solution has been panned, binned or pushed into the long grass by government after government.Young people bore the brunt of the financial crisis. Everyone’s earnings have taken a hit in recent years, but young people’s pay packets were hit hardest of all. We have worked hard to avoid the high youth unemployment that characterised previous recessions, but new challenges have emerged, with one in 12 young workers currently on zero-hours contracts. Younger generations know they are paying the price of decades of failure on housing.Increasing numbers are bringing up children while privately renting a home, lacking the security to be sure they will call it their own in the years to come. They are paying more for less, with millennials spending a quarter of their income to live in smaller homes , with longer commutes.Families are responding to these new challenges: 6.5 million of us care for an elderly relative, and the bank of mum and dad is playing a growing role in helping young adults become homeowners. But collectively, as a society and through the state, we have not risen to the challenge of renewing our generational contract. But we must.The need to renew our intergenerational contract is clear and urgent, but doing so is far from easy. It requires new thinking and tough trade-offs – from how we deal with the fiscal pressures of an ageing society in a way that is generationally fair, to how we deliver the housing young people need while respecting the communities everyone values.And the politics are far from straightforward. Renewal should involve an agenda appealing to all generations, but voters’ party preferences have never been so starkly ided by age. This state of affairs – with the Conservatives reliant on older people who are most likely to vote, and Labour sitting on a lead amongst younger generations who represent the future of British elections – is not desirable for the parties themselves or our country as a whole.We need our political leaders to rise to this challenge with an appeal to all generations. It can be done, as the forthcoming final report of the Intergenerational Commission will lay out. We can deliver the health and care older generations deserve, without simply asking younger workers to bear all the costs. We can do more to promote education and skills, especially for those who have not chosen on the university route. We can provide more security for young people, from the jobs they do to the homes they rent. And we can show younger generations that owning a home is a reality not a distant prospect in 21st-century Britain.Such an appeal across generations is the route to building a better Britain – and a more united one, too.Torsten Bell is director of the Resolution Foundation"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c59cdc35b4461a30421229d8a82f5bc7ae35dde/0_509_5784_3472/master/5784.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57e47d11f1e8fc2e3eac8c5c67af7c63","title":"bird names origins blackbird yellowhammer","story":"It’s easy to assume, with bird names, that we know what they mean, and often that assumption is quite correct. Woodpeckers peck wood, bee-eaters feed on bees, and whitethroats are indeed white around the neck.Other names seem almost wilfully obscure: what on Earth does the name puffin mean? Or hobby? Why are turtle doves named after reptiles? And don’t get me started on some of the more bizarre bird names found around the world – from oleaginous hemispingus to zitting cisticola, leaflove to hardhead, and bananaquit to bearded mountaineer.Yet, as I discovered when I was researching my new book on the origins of bird names, if you dig deep enough, you unearth all sorts of fascinating stories about what the names mean, where they came from and, especially, the men and women who created them.The origin of some names may, at first, seem obvious, yet are not quite as straightforward as they appear. Take the simplest of all English bird names: blackbird. It’s a bird, and it’s black. Isn’t that all we need to know?But what about the crow, rook, raven and jackdaw? All of these would have been very familiar to our ancestors, and all appear – at least from a distance – to be black in colour. So why was just one species singled out as the “blackbird”?The reason for this apparent anomaly is that, until the late medieval period, birds were not called “birds” at all, but fowls – as in Chaucer’s poem The Parliament of Fowls. The word bird (originally the Anglo-Saxon brid), referred only to young fowls, or chicks. Then, sometime around the time Chaucer was writing, this meaning began to shift. From then on, although “fowl” was still used for larger birds such as members of the crow family, “bird” became the norm for all smaller birds, including the blackbird. So, at the time it was named, this really was the only truly “black bird”.Many of our oldest bird names – including raven, rook and crow – are onomatopoeic: they imitate the sound made by the bird itself. Cuckoo, chiffchaff and kittiwake are other well-known examples. Far less obvious ones include nightjar (from the “churring” sound made by this nocturnal bird), bittern (from its deep, booming call), and the aforementioned turtle dove. “Turtle” is a corruption of the bird’s soft “tur-tur” call, so has nothing to do with the aquatic reptile.Other ancient bird names relate to a bird’s appearance: its size, colour, shape or distinctive markings. Again, some are obvious: such as great spotted woodpecker, blackcap, long-tailed tit and collared dove.But with others it takes some linguistic detective work to uncover their true meaning. Take three familiar birds: the yellowhammer, redstart and wheatear. All three names superficially make sense, yet as soon as you look more closely, they become problematic. After all, the yellowhammer doesn’t have an especially loud or percussive song, redstarts are not noticeably jumpy, and I’ve certainly never seen a wheatear in a field of wheat.The reason these names appear puzzling is down to one of the most important events in British history: the Norman Conquest. Perhaps the greatest change that resulted from this invasion was in our everyday language: within a century or so, Anglo-Saxon had merged with Norman French to create a new, hybrid tongue known as Middle English – the precursor to the way we speak today.But as the old language fell into disuse, some of its words no longer made any sense. So, by a process called false etymology, people made up new versions, which sounded plausible, even if their original meaning had been lost. One famous non-avian example, the name “dandelion”, is in fact a corruption of the French dent de lion (meaning lion’s tooth, referring to the shape of the plant’s leaves).The same happened with bird names. Thus, the Anglo-Saxon “yellow ammer” (from the German word for a bunting) became yellowhammer “red steort” (meaning red tail) turned into redstart and “wheteres” – literally white arse, changed into wheatear. Norman French also had a major influence on the names of ducks (mallard and wigeon), game birds (pheasant and partridge), and raptors (peregrine and hobby).What these all have in common is that they were important to the Norman nobility – either as food, or for hunting and sport – so their French names took precedence over the older, English ones. Hobby, for example, comes from the Old French verb hober – meaning to jump about – and refers to this falcon’s dashing, acrobatic flight.The name hobby also played a role in the naming of the table-top football game Subbuteo. The story goes that when the game’s inventor, Peter Adolph, tried to register his idea at the patent office, he wanted to call it Hobby. When a jobsworth official objected, he cleverly substituted the Latin name of his favourite bird, Falco subbuteo, instead.From the 18th century onwards, existing names were codified by professional ornithologists who also coined new ones, such as black-tailed godwit or white-fronted goose. A trend also arose for naming birds after people: sometimes those who had discovered the species, such as George Montagu (Montagu’s\u0026nbspharrier).But birds were also named after polar explorers James Clark Ross and Sir John Franklin (Ross’s and Franklin’s gulls), the political radical Thomas Bewick (Bewick’s swan), and the vicar of Selborne, Gilbert White (White’s thrush). As is to be expected, given the patriarchal nature of society at the time, only a handful are named after women.One notable exception is the woman who gave her name to my book: Winifred Moreau, who during the 1930s studied the endemic birds of Tanzania’s Uluguru mountains, with her ornithologist husband, Reg, and after whom one of the world’s rarest birds – Mrs Moreau’s warbler – is named.The naming of birds is ultimately a purely human impulse: the birds themselves are, of course, completely unaware of what we choose to call them. Yet, without the wondrous variety of ornithological names, I believe that our world would be a far poorer place.Ultimately, the names we have bestowed on birds down the ages reflect key aspects of our own lives: our primitive superstitions, myths and legends, invasions and conquests, changes in language, rigorous scientific observation, our love of sound, colour and pattern, and a sense of place.Last, but certainly not least, some reflect the extraordinary achievements of the men and women after whom they were called – including, of course, Winifred Moreau.Mrs Moreau’s Warbler: How Birds Got Their Names, by Stephen Moss, is published by  Faber on 3 May"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d9904ffc17e870a869d95cdcec6953d5f27f69bb/0_230_3464_2079/master/3464.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da394a4dc6abce330d7ee9dfa1b99ff1","title":"budget earmarks 500m to mitigate great barrier reef climate change","story":"The money will help try to save the reef from crown-of-thorns starfish and reduce pollution, Malcolm Turnbull to announceThe Turnbull government will allocate $500m to mitigate the impacts of climate change on the Great Barrier Reef.The government will partner with the Great Barrier Reef Foundation in a $444m agreement to tackle crown-of-thorns starfish, reduce pollution and mitigate the impacts of climate change.The government will increase funding for the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the Department of the Environment and Energy by $56m to expand environmental management and compliance operations. • Sign up to receive the top stories from  Australia every morningBoth of the major parties are currently focused on winning hearts and minds in Queensland, with the state’s marginal seats likely to determine the outcome of the next federal election.The Coalition has been criticised by environment groups for not acting fast enough to protect the reef, and the government’s support for the Adani coalmine has also been controversial both locally and nationally because of its potential impact on the reef.In January  Australia revealed that millions of dollars of commonwealth money was being handed to tourism-linked groups for reef protection, despite official advice recommending against the projects, or repeatedly finding them to be failing.Earlier this year, the head of the United Nations environment program warned the battle to save the world’s coral reefs was at “make-or-break point”. Erik Solheim said governments needed to intensify concrete actions including limiting greenhouse gas emissions, plastic pollution and impacts from agriculture.In a statement issued in advance of Sunday’s announcement, the prime minister Malcolm Turnbull said the new funding was an investment in the health of the reef and the tourism jobs dependent on it.“Like reefs all over the world, the Great Barrier Reef is under pressure,” Turnbull said. “A big challenge demands a big investment – and this investment gives our reef the best chance.”Turnbull said the reef restoration science associated with the funding would be shared internationally and with Pacific neighbours.“As a highly respected philanthropic organisation, the Great Barrier Reef Foundation has a strong fundraising track record, and will seek corporate contributions to further enhance this work,” the prime minister said.The funding package includes $201m for improving water quality with changed farming practices such as reduced fertiliser use, $100m for reef restoration science, $58m to combat the crown-of-thorns starfish, $45m for community engagement, including drawing on Indigenous traditional knowledge for sea country management, and $40m for monitoring reef health.The study on coral mass mortality, published in Nature and led by Terry Hughes, the director of the ARC Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies – published in April – examined the link between the level of heat exposure, subsequent coral bleaching and ultimately coral death.“These widespread losses were not due to the attrition of corals that slowly starved because they failed to regain their symbionts. Rather, temperature-sensitive species of corals began to die almost immediately in locations that were exposed to heat stress.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1486c0616d60bef0ce61fcafbb84bc1bb6361f6a/0_0_4000_2662/master/4000.jpg?w=880\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=a0f02287dedf00bc41ad6b5daf2bd60f 1760w","title":"burnley brighton hove albion premier league match report","story":"Chris Hughton felt Brighton could have taken more than a point in their battle for survival but was more unhappy with the treatment of Gaëtan Bong by Burnley supporters. While the home fans could celebrate their team being virtually assured of European football next season for the first time in more than 50 years, some showed their backing for the club’s former striker Jay Rodriguez by booing Bong’s every touch.Rodriguez, now at West Brom, was accused of racially abusing the Brighton defender when the two Albions met in January. This month the charge was found to be “not proven” by an independent commission but both clubs continue to back their own player’s version of events. Hughton said of Bong’s treatment at Turf Moor: “I thought the reaction of the Burnley supporters every time he got the ball was shameful. They should look at the two statements that came out – one from the independent committee and one from the FA – because I thought their reaction was shameful.”Bong and co had the satisfaction of claiming a point towards survival, while Burnley are now six points clear of Everton with two games remaining and have a far better goal difference, so are almost certain to be in the Europa League.The Clarets, whose last European campaign was in 1966-67, came closest to scoring when Kevin Long hit the post in the first half. Sean Dyche said of the prospect of Europe: “It’s a fantastic achievement if we get there. We weren’t as good as we can be, a long way from it at times, but the habits were there, the will to play was there we were just short of quality. It’s hard to sit here on a soft performance to question the players. Over the season they’ve been absolutely fantastic and they’ve earned the right.“The points we’ve got on the table in the Premier League, you can’t cheat that. You can have a lucky spell but you can’t be lucky all season. It takes organisation, delivery of performance, the mentality to take on each game, and we’ve had that in abundance.”In a frenzied first-half passage of play Mat Ryan made two desperate saves from Ashley Barnes and Jack Cork, with the ball breaking for Long, who hit a post. The rebound off the woodwork and appeared to strike Lewis Dunk on the arm but Roger East refrained from awarding the home side their first Premier League penalty in more than a year.“There is no point in me talking about penalties,” Dyche said, jokingly. “Cartoon capers, someone just sneaks a club out on someone’s head, we might get one then, but they might not see it. Eventually we’ll get a penalty, you imagine.”It was also a point towards Brighton’s objective of survival, although Southampton’s victory over Bournemouth cut the gap between Hughton’s side and the bottom three to five points. The Brighton manager said: “I thought we were the better side we looked more like carving something out.“Burnley have a way of playing which is very effective. For the large majority of the game I thought we dealt with that threat.“There is probably a tinge of disappointment that we didn’t get the win. Out of the two teams, if there was one that deserved a win more, I thought it was us.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/120cb6e341d5755f7feb332c50a2f2207989893b/0_540_4226_2535/master/4226.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d3df8d335d521d6abd7fd49aaf35e81","title":"roma president jim pallotta fans morons","story":"The Roma president, Jim Pallotta, has launched a furious attack on a section of the club’s fans, warning that a violent minority of “fucking morons” are destroying the club’s reputation and hurting Italian football more widely.In an expletive-laden interview on Roma’s website, the US investor who took control of the club in 2011 criticised those supporters who cause unrest at and around matches and labelled Tuesday’s alleged assault of the Liverpool fan Sean Cox, which left the 53-year-old in a critical condition, the “most disgusting stupidity”.Two Roma fans have been charged for their part in the incident but there are concerns that worse could follow next week when 5,000 Liverpool supporters head to the Italian capital for the second leg of their Champions League semi-final, which they lead 5-2. Liverpool have held meetings with Roma, Uefa and Italian police in an attempt to ensure fans’ safety.Pallotta said: “These games are great – but they’re not life and death.

This was not everyday football manager‑speak. “The way you speak out is seeds in the brains of your players,” he said. “It is subconscious, it is interesting. I am very interested in the subconscious force of the memory of a team.”In a nutshell the concept is about how strongly certain messages, or raking up of past experiences, can come out in the way a team plays.Heading north, to Old Trafford for the final time as Arsenal manager on Sunday, Wenger will have to choose his words carefully. His storylines at this particular theatre are among the most vivid of his 22 years in English football. Wenger has scaled football emotions at the most extreme levels of the spectrum at Old Trafford.His three Premier League title wins all owed something extra to the shuddering results and pivotal performances at Manchester United. In 2002 Arsenal even stretched so high as to clinch the title with a victory on their rivals’ patch, much to United’s annoyance (needless to say they were not presented with the trophy there and then). But Wenger has also suffered some of his sharpest humiliations on the sideline of that same patch of grass. It still beggars belief that Arsenal could lose a Premier League game by a margin as harrowing as 8-2.The glass-half-empty section in Arsenal’s fanbase taking position in the away corner of Old Trafford is probably a little more concerned about that memory flickering in the current team’s subconscious than the good times. The timing of this fixture is about as welcome as Shkodran Mustafi falling into a heap at the worst possible moment in front of Antoine Griezmann.Wenger cannot be grateful for a game at Old Trafford squidged between the two emotionally loaded legs of the Europa League semi-finals. One last shot at farewell silverware has to dominate his approach, and a quick scan through Arsenal’s squad suggests this could be a long afternoon in Manchester if Wenger does the right thing and rests as many of his first-choice players as possible for Thursday’s second leg in Madrid.One can almost imagine him scanning his squad list and taking it from there. So, who have we got? Start by ticking off Petr Cech and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang at both ends. Defence: Calum Chambers, Rob Holding and Sead Kolasinac. Midfield: Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Ainsley Maitland-Niles, Alex Iwobi … erm.There are three more spots available and Wenger has to decide whether to play any of his Europa League picks or throw down the gauntlet to some of the youngsters who have been on the fringe of the first team this season. Reiss Nelson, Joe Willock and Eddie Nketiah have had some experience. Maybe there is a debut going for Konstantinos Mavropanos, the Greek defender signed in January.José Mourinho and his most experienced heavyweights may be licking their lips like a cartoon Big Bad Wolf.It was 20 years ago that Wenger first felt how an away game at Old Trafford could somehow seem bigger and deeper than an ordinary away game. Arsenal were not entirely at full strength at the time – the young Austrian Alex Manninger playing in place of David Seaman in goal and George Weah’s cousin Christopher Wreh filling in for Ian Wright – but still had enough of the ingredients that would show off the best of the new mix of power and panache that made Arsenal title contenders in Wenger’s first full season.United were favourites. The decade’s dominant team, champions for the previous two seasons, top of the league. Arsenal had games in hand but this meeting in the spring of 1998 would make or break them. Marc Overmars tormented United, nutmegged Peter Schmeichel to score the match‑winner, and stood there in celebration like a startled March hare while everyone around him sensed the significance of the moment – none more so than Wenger himself and Sir Alex Ferguson down the touchline, who could both tell this race had taken a mighty turn.Unsurprisingly most of Wenger’s Old Trafford highlights occurred during the early years. Sylvain Wiltord’s winner in 2002 completed a big test of character. Manchester United’s players naturally wanted to do anything and everything within the rules to stop Arsenal from waltzing in and prising the trophy directly from their hands. A year later came the infamous 0-0 draw, etched in the memory for Ruud van Nistelrooy smacking a late penalty against the woodwork and Martin Keown barging into the Dutchman at the final whistle.The following season United put revved up energy into halting Arsenal’s 49-game unbeaten run before it hit the half-century. The intensity of this series of matches, two proud powerhouses slogging it out, was utterly absorbing.Wenger has been devastated by trips to Old Trafford more recently. He will never reflect fondly on being sent off in 2009 after kicking a water bottle and forced to watch from within a crowd that has habitually sung despicable chants about him.The worst, naturally, was the 8-2 calamity in 2011, where the change in the nature of the contest between Fergie’s United and Wenger’s Arsenal was exposed in the Scot beginning to feel sympathy for an old foe who could no longer stand up with him in the same ring. Although that is an obvious nadir, Arsenal were soundly beaten by a pretty shameful 6-1 at Old Trafford in 2001 as well.As recently as February 2016 Arsenal experienced another painful low at Old Trafford when they were in a position to kick on for a title challenge after narrowing Leicester’s advantage to five points. But their performance against an under‑strength United was feeble. They lost and the challenge petered out.Sunday’s meeting is not remotely pivotal. The result means little to Arsenal and not much more to United, even though they would be glad to get closer to cementing second place ahead of Liverpool. Wenger has his memories and has to hope that for once this one is nothing special, so he can move on as calmly as possible to Madrid on\u0026nbspThursday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/91d49f8573616d1b09520402b0f4256060ec2798/0_0_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d8f27f8a46e6ddf8d2e0a0b184e80cd","title":"blind date becky daniel","story":"Does Becky, 26, barrister, find in favour of Daniel, 36, hospital doctor?What were you hoping for?Good food and company.What did you talk about?The criminal barristers’ and junior doctors’ strikes, port and Couch to 5K.Any awkward moments?I may have inadvertently drawn attention to the 10-year age gap.Good table manners?Impeccable.

I ended up going to a technical college, just to keep my mum and dad happy. Then the college asked me to leave.A child psychologist diagnosed me with Asperger’s, I must have been about 14. I don’t remember much about it, I just found it quite annoying. My mum seemed to take it badly, as if it was a slight on her. Neither of us really understood.I was an aeroplane pilot, but everyone I knew got killed. I’ve had four aeroplanes, and bought one for my brother too. I sold my last one when I moved to America. I ducked out of it when my children arrived.Eye contact is something I find incredibly difficult. I count all the time when I’m talking to someone to make sure I do it right. Anything less than two seconds is considered rude, more than five seconds is too intense, so I have to look away. I worked that out myself. I find conversations incredibly stressful.Being under house arrest in India on suspicion of smuggling and spying was unexpected. Another air-display pilot and I were flying around the world in a little aeroplane. We landed in a small village on the coast of India and got arrested on suspicion of smuggling and spying. It was madness. The policeman asked if we were taking photographs of the Russian submarine base. I said I wasn’t, but asked where it was. He told me it was 20 miles south!I voted for Thatcher. It was the only time I voted. She won her election by a landslide, I wasn’t the only one that got sucked in.

He and someone sat in a booth next to us and tried to impress people by opening his jacket and showing me a snake. I had a penknife.

Now brewers have gone one better and created a beer made from leftover sandwich bread.It is a tasty solution to the shocking daily waste of bread, with more than 24 million slices thrown away in Britain every day by consumers alone. Three new beers will soon be available at Marks \u0026amp Spencer made from surplus bread from its sandwich factory that would otherwise be discarded or turned into animal feed.Suffolk brewery Adnams is using the crusted “ends” of sliced sandwich loaves – frozen by M\u0026ampS supplier Greencore in Northampton and then sent to the brewery’s headquarters in Southwold – to create the new beers, which are already on sale in some M\u0026ampS stores and will soon be available to order online.Making beer out of bread isn’t new – its history stretches back 4,000 years to a time when brewers and bakers worked together. The difference is that the new beers use bread that would otherwise go to waste.Bread is made from grains such as barley, wheat and rye – exactly the same raw materials that are used to make beer. In this case, surplus crusts are mashed down into the mix and replace some of the malted barley traditionally used in brewing to create the Used Our Loaf range.Each batch of the new beer will use 700kg of surplus bread with three times the quantity of malted barley. And using bread has an added benefit of helping to reduce carbon emissions from the energy-intensive brewing process.The three Used Our Loaf beers are a triple English hop pale ale, a raspberry fruit beer and an Earl Grey pale ale. If the drinks prove popular with customers, the process will be rolled out across a wider range of beers.The ingredient switch is similar to that of the popular Toast Ale, launched two years ago by Tristram Stuart, founder of the food waste charity Feedback. Stuart was inspired to use leftover bread to make beer by a Belgian brewer who follows the same\u0026nbspprocess. Toast Ale is now brewed in the US, South Africa, Iceland and Brazil. All distributable profits go to Feedback to help end food waste while its original online open-source recipe – which replaces a third of the malted barley with bread (equivalent to one slice a bottle) – has now been downloaded 30,000 times.Richard Applegate, an M\u0026ampS beer technologist, said: “Consumers who are fans of beer will be familiar with Toast Ale, and we wanted to find a way to use the surplus bread from our sandwiches in a more useful and environment-friendly way.”M\u0026ampS launched pre-packaged sandwiches in Britain in 1981 and now sells 92.7 million a year, of which 72.4\u0026nbspmillion are conventional sandwiches and the rest baguettes and wraps.Fergus Fitzgerald, head brewer at Adnams, said: “Making malted barley is an energy-intense process, therefore by using bread this reduces the carbon footprint the saving from the three new beers is an estimated 1.2\u0026nbsptonnes of carbon dioxide.”Toast Ale notably works with Wold Top Brewery in North Yorkshire, one of the UK’s most sustainable breweries. And it recently became the first UK beer company to certify as a “B Corporation”, joining a global movement of people using business as a force for social good. A B Corporation is to business what Fair Trade certification is to, say, coffee or organic certification is to milk, and means the company meets rigorous standards of social and environmental performance, accountability and transparency.Meanwhile, the brewery has launched a new batch of beer brewed with surplus bread from the EAT sandwich chain.“It’s great that bakeries and retailers are teaming up with social enterprises and charities to stop so much food being wasted,” said Chris Young of the Real Bread Campaign. “But the real problem lies with the big industrial loaf manufacturers and the supermarkets. We’d like to see far less surplus being generated in the first place.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e3703821265222864451f228b78726f1dce7aa81/0_237_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c69e5ae160991f7d40fb8dc385ec6859","title":"night nanny tully wealthy mothers helper","story":"Charlize Theron’s latest movie, Tully, is billed as a comedy, but new parents will probably see it as something closer to a fly-on-the-wall horror film. Tully lays out the grisly anatomy of motherhood: from exhaustion and non-stop breast milk pumping to the overwhelming demands of a neglectful partner and the tantrums of the newborn’s siblings. Salvation for Theron’s character, Marlo, eventually arrives in the form of Tully, a night nanny.Cinemagoers without children will probably not have heard of these Mary Poppins-like figures, who are the subject of urgent discussions by many new mothers.Night nannies, or maternity nurses, will come to your house in the evening to spend all night looking after the baby – feeding and winding, changing nappies and soothing them to sleep – allowing frazzled parents some respite. Many promise to get the baby into a sleep routine and to train families in ways to make it happen.The number of night nannies has been increasing steadily, with several agencies providing maternity nurses. Anastasia Baker, a former BBC journalist, claims to have been the first when she set up Night Nannies in 1999 after her second baby. “I approached 17 agencies and no one was doing it,” Baker said. “Now we have about 200 nannies working in London and the south of England.” The agency has helped more than 10,000 families in that time, and demand is growing.Typically a night nanny will arrive at 9pm and stay until 7am at a cost of £155. If that only solves half the problem, it is possible to hire a maternity nurse who will be available 24 hours a day at a cost of £220 per day, plus a £100 agency fee.The opportunities for comedy are not obvious, but Julia Lannaman, who has been a night nanny since 2005, says there have been plenty of funny moments during her career. “One client had just had her first baby and she didn’t know anyone at all with a baby,” she said. “She gave me an empty Pepsi bottle and asked ‘can we use that to do the feed?’ ”Another client asked Lannaman to travel with her on a family holiday to a Spanish resort – but things went badly wrong when they embarked on the return flight. The mother refused to remove her baby from a car seat and hold it in her lap, as instructed by the cabin crew.“She had a proper meltdown,” Lannaman said. “The pilot became involved and we were escorted off the plane. We couldn’t get another flight, so they hired a private jet at a cost of €25,000. The cabin was so small I had to be sedated because I’m claustrophobic.”Most of her clients are much more easygoing. “I have worked for some lovely people,” Lannaman said. “Trust is crucial. When the client turns over a baby to you, they have to know that you will take care of it. You have to build a bond with the baby, and there are some beautiful moments.”There is a serious side to night nannying, because it is a way of taking the pressure off new mothers – if only for a few hours.Sarah – not her real name – was told about night nannies by a midwife after giving birth at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London. “I began going through a orce in my eighth month of pregnancy. We ended up in court in my ninth month. I also have a toddler. When my baby came two weeks early, possibly because of the stress, I knew I needed help.”She can only afford a night nanny for a couple of days a week. “But just having an extra pair of hands is so important. I need to look after both the children, so I need to have a sufficient amount of sleep.”Susie Whytock, one of the first night nannies to work with Baker’s agency, typically does a number of 24-hour shifts over a 14-day period to help cement the baby’s sleep pattern. “I met one client in Selfridges – she was a real high flyer,” Whytock said. “She said, ‘I’m having a meeting with my colleagues on Thursday to hand over, I’m booked in for a C-section on Friday, so I’ll see you on Saturday ... let’s see how this first week goes’.”By the end of the week, the second-time mother had gone through the hormone crash that affects many women and needed all the help that Whytock could give her.“At the end of the two weeks, she broke down. I could see she was in a dangerous place. I said ‘I’ll take you to my home for five days and you can stay with me.’ It helped head off post-natal depression, and now she’s like an adopted daughter to me.”She knows that her services are beyond the reach of most women but feels that early interventions could save the NHS a lot of money.“When I spot post-natal depression coming on I know I have to be quick to step in,” Whytock said. “Certainly, there are some dangerous situations that can develop that midwives and health visitors just won’t get a chance to see.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e891967e2c8f074f05b4caa3683ba329c02001f/98_340_5388_3233/master/5388.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c7ffa0cdb1c4e38103de2efbb469b8cb","title":"yotam ottolenghi tray bake recipes","story":"Let the oven do the hard work, then sit down to a butternut squash bake, a cheesy gratin or some saucy roast vegI’ve been making lots of tray bakes recently. I am not sure I like the term – 1970s convenience food springs to mind – but I love what it stands for: the idea that, after doing the prep, you can sit down with a cuppa or a glass of wine and relax for an hour or two while your meal more or less cooks itself. And, unlike a stew, which offers the cook a similar break, a bake retains much of the freshness and integrity of its components, particularly vegetables.This ‘cake’ was a revelation to me: who would have thought you could cook pasta for two hours and end up with something fresh, super-comforting and full of texture? Serve hot for lunch or dinner, or leave to cool, cut into wedges and have it as a portable cold lunch for work, school or as part of a picnic spread.

Bake for an hour and a half, then discard the foil, drizzle over the remaining tablespoon of oil and bake for another half-hour, until the top is crisp and browned. Leave to cool for 30 minutes, then remove from the cake tin, sprinkle with parsley and serve.Slow-roasting transforms garlic into a sweet and sticky version of itself, which, when combined with pungent, raw garlic, gives a dish a real umami kick.

Take out two garlic cloves from the head of garlic, then drizzle the rest of the bulb with a teaspoon of oil and sprinkle with a little salt and pepper. Wrap tightly in foil and roast for 40 minutes, until the cloves are soft and golden brown. Remove the foil and, when cool enough to handle, squeeze out the cloves and discard the papery skins.While the garlic is roasting, prepare the rest of the vegetables. Combine the potatoes, shallots and paprika in a bowl with two tablespoons of oil, half a teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper. Toss the cabbage leaves in a tablespoon of oil, a quarter-teaspoon of salt and lots of pepper. Roughly crush the two reserved cloves of raw garlic and mix with all the herbs, the spring onions, lemon zest and the cooked garlic. Set aside a quarter of the herb mixture – you’ll use it later as a garnish.Arrange a third of the cabbage leaves over the base of a 20cm x 30cm, high-sided baking dish. Cover with half the potato and shallot mixture, top that with a third of the herb mixture, then dot half the ricotta and gruyère over the herbs. Repeat these four layers again, then top everything with a final layer of cabbage and the last of the herb mixture.Combine the stock, lemon juice and a quarter-teaspoon of salt and pour evenly over the bake, lifting up some of the cabbage leaves so the liquid sinks down. Cover tightly with foil and bake for an hour and 10 minutes, until the cabbage and potatoes are soft and cooked through. Remove the foil, drizzle over the remaining tablespoon of oil and bake, uncovered, for 10 minutes more, until the cabbage begins to crisp up and turn golden brown.

Now the festival-within-a-festival, which ended in 2007, is the subject of a documentary, released to coincide with Glastonbury’s fallow year. The film, Lost in Vagueness, was shot over 12 years by director Sofia Olins, who describes it as a journey from “anti-society DIY debauchery” to “prescribed corporate anarchy” – a shift she believes is indicative of Britain’s modern festival culture. “I’d grown up in the rave scene when we all wore tracksuit bottoms and acted completely asexual,” Olins says. “So when I jumped into Lost Vagueness it felt scary, dirty and weird. But aesthetically, it blew my mind.”Lost Vagueness was born in the 90s out of Glastonbury’s battle with new age travellers – a convoy of drifters who believed Michael Eavis’s annual bash should remain true to its roots as a “free” people’s festival. “There was going to be a crunch time where all of us were either going to get beaten up by the police or thrown out. Something had to change,” said Roy Gurvitz, who emerged as the travellers’ unofficial leader.Gurvitz wanted to save the movement but knew it had to reinvent itself. After intense negotiations with Eavis, they carved out a piece of Worthy Farm, in the south-east corner, as the travellers’ new base.What happened next, though, nobody could have predicted. In a moment of inspired irony, Gurvitz persuaded his entourage to ditch their army fatigues and start wearing tuxedos and ball gowns instead.“We put on a disguise, and lo and behold everybody looked at us very differently,” he says. They set up a cafe, with a small casino and a tent for ballroom dancing. Almost overnight, Glastonbury’s “travellers’ problem”, as Eavis had called it, disappeared and ticket sales began to pick up. “It changed the image of Glastonbury forever, it meant that you could come and do something else. It wasn’t just a muddy field,” says Olins.Lost Vagueness took off big time. The tents got bigger, the number of bars grew and the shows and performances took on a life of their own. In its heyday, in the mid-noughties, 50,000 revellers would head to the “strip” for the late-night entertainment. But over the years, the sedate 1920s ballroom dancing gave way to hedonistic anything-goes parties.“People had a certain expectation of a Lost Vagueness gig: they didn’t want it to be sanitised, they wanted the whole thing to be completely debauched,” says Leila Jones, who produced many of the acts. “It was an excessive period, and part of the package was that we had to be super-excessive. It wasn’t sustainable.” The turning point, she says, was when Lost Vagueness, the brand, started to be approached by corporate groups to run their parties. “When people are coming to you with offers of proper money – how do you retain your integrity? They wanted us to be debauched idiots but then suddenly you’re hosting a party for MTV. The two things weren’t compatible.”By 2007, its final year, the Lost Vagueness site had tripled in size. Issues of health and safety were becoming a headache, and Gurvitz was getting harder to negotiate with. “In those final years, Roy was so full of anger and jealousy, and he was behaving irrationally,” says Jones. Gurvitz remains defiant. “You try organising 2,000 people who think they’re anarchists,” he says. The problem, as he sees it now, is that the monetisation of Lost Vagueness happened too fast. “We weren’t accustomed to working like that, nobody was. What we were doing was at the cutting edge of performing arts. But dealing with tens of thousands of people was stressful.”He insists, too, that the “powers-that-be” at Glastonbury wanted him out. “What we were doing had become too leftfield for them,” he says. “I started to feel like the enemy, like I was being demonised by people whose objective was to push me out and take over that area. They saw it had so much potential. They wanted me out so that they could tidy it up and use it themselves.”In another twist, many of those who run the current version of Glastonbury’s naughty corner – Shangri-La – are the same people who used to work for Gurvitz. “They’ve all got their own production teams,” says Jones. “It’s slick, well organised and doesn’t feel like everybody’s about to get squashed.” Gurvitz, who still lives “off grid” – currently in a solar powered vehicle on a disused airfield – has not been back to Glastonbury since he left, in a tank, a decade ago. “I think the festival capitalised on the popularity of Lost Vagueness,” he says. “Shangri-La had an easy ride. I mean, rather than having to invent themselves as an entity of the festival, they were handed it on a plate.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/533fa5a18c3ecaf787b49f156b8340fb316e2254/0_0_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d9a3d66eaed767b1b89273782f8188b0","title":"one to watch snail mail lindsey jordan lush","story":"From the age of five, Lindsey Jordan started having “really intense” classical guitar lessons, practising two hours a day.

As fast as the latest material arrives in vans from the printers, it disappears out of the door again, as canvassers grab handfuls and fan out across the streets of Wandsworth.This is the most important, closest and most keenly fought local election battle here in decades and canvass returns suggest the result is poised on a knife edge. “I would say the chances are 5050,” says Simon Hogg, the Labour leader on Wandsworth council, which has been held by the Conservatives since 1974.For Labour to storm this Tory fortress – Wandsworth was Margaret Thatcher’s favourite council and it boasts the country’s lowest council tax – would be a massive story. “It would be a political earthquake,” Hogg says. “And I think we can do it. More and more people are coming over to us in wards we have not won since the 1960s and 70s.”If you’re living in an area going to the polls in May we want to hear from you. Let us know which way you’re thinking of voting, and which issues are most crucial to you locally.You can share your thoughts using our encrypted form here. One of our journalists may contact you to discuss further and we will feature some of your contributions in our reporting.The aftershocks would be felt nationally as well as locally. With Theresa May under pressure over immigration and the Windrush scandal, and struggling to prevent her party splitting irreparably over Brexit, a Labour win in Wandsworth and other urban Tory heartlands would ask still more questions about the prime minister’s chances of long-term survival in No 10.Out on the streets, Conservative-to-Labour converts are not difficult to find. A third of residents in this part of south London live in rented properties and the lack of affordable housing is a huge issue not just for tenants but for those who own their properties and those who worry their children will never be able to afford to leave home. Brexit, too, is on many voters minds, with Remainers outnumbering Leavers by a large margin.As Labour activists turn into her street, Sheila Arnold, 71, comes to the door. She has voted Tory all her life, as did her father before her. But she has had enough. “I’m going Labour this time and I never have before. There are not enough houses for the young people round here and that is not right.”Other things have upset her about the Conservatives. She agrees with them that immigration needs to be controlled but when she heard how May’s government had treated the Windrush generation she was horrified. “I think it is awful. We do have to control immigration but these people were invited in by us, and they helped us. This is their country now, their home, and they have been treated like muck. It is really terrible.”Across the road Remi Tangian, a domestic helper who came to the UK from the Philippines 30 years ago, feels the same way about how the Conservatives have treated the Windrush generation and is switching her vote. “It is so unfair,” she says. “We have to have change. I cannot agree with what they have done.”Time on the campaign trail suggests the wind is driving hard into Labour’s sails ahead of polling day. Yet there is a nervousness. Fear of falling just short is competing in the minds of party activists with excitement at the prospect of winning. What could be a great night in Wandsworth and other urban areas could just as easily turn into one of deflation and dejection.An opinion poll on Friday suggested Labour would gain a large number of seats on Thursday – but still fall short of taking the two great London prizes of Wandsworth and Westminster. As one Labour activist out on the streets put it on Friday afternoon: “The challenge for us is leave no stone unturned and whip up the sense we can do it, without raising expectations so high that we shoot ourselves in the foot if we fall short.”Across the capital, it is same story in traditionally Tory Westminster. The council has never fallen to Labour before. Currently the Conservatives hold 44 seats to Labour’s 16, meaning Labour needs an even bigger swing than in Wandsworth.Concerns about Brexit among its largely Remain electorate, plus worries about a lack of affordable housing and the memory of the Grenfell Tower disaster across the border in Kensington and Chelsea, all mean this election could go any way. That Adam Hug, the council’s Labour leader felt it worth his while to tramp through the borough on a wet Friday was evidence enough that he believes he has a chance. “We are aware that we would be making history if we were to win,” he says.Across the country more than 4,300 seats are being contested in 151 mainly urban councils. Analysis by Colin Rawlings and Michael Thrasher at Nuffield College, Oxford suggests that the Conservatives will lose 75 seats, with Labour gaining 200 and the Lib Dems 30. Ukip could lose most, if not all, of the 163 seats it gained last time. As Rob Ford points out on page 10, where former Ukip voters put their cross on Thursday will be one of the key psephological questions of election night.The vote will also be a key test for the shrunken Liberal Democrats and their leader Vince Cable. The party’s strength was built from strong roots put down over decades in local government. Occupying a distinct position on Brexit, as the only mainstream party implacably opposed, its supporters hope it will be able to mop up votes in Remain areas.The party has been pouring its resources into trying to retake control of Richmond and Kingston upon Thames in London from the Tories, and if it can it will have a decent story to tell on election night. Failure to do so – coupled with an inability to defend the London borough of Sutton – would raise further questions about what the party is for these days.For all the major parties the verdict of the electorate on Thursday and their reactions to the results on Friday will send important signals.Will Labour and Jeremy Corbyn be able to convey a sense of momentum sufficient to suggest the party is on course to win back power at national level? For the Tories, will May and her party be able stave off symbolic defeats at the hands of Labour in London and elsewhere, and steady their nerves?Can the Lib Dems show they can again be a big force in local government and begin rebuilding? Can Ukip simply survive?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c09116fef4088a9bbda33b93015ed37786720df0/57_0_3941_2365/master/3941.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12e84c4a147f497b158d34b8b8442d6f","title":"polling station voter id plans are deeply flawed say critics","story":"Electoral Reform Society says plans are ‘calculated effort by the government to make voting harder for some citizens’Plans requiring voters to prove their identity before casting their ballot are deeply flawed, the Electoral Reform Society (ERS) has said. The group said it appeared the plans were a “calculated effort by the government to make voting harder for some citizens”. Pilot schemes will be in place at Bromley, Gosport, Swindon, Watford and Woking councils in the local elections in England on 3 May.The ERS said personification fraud, in which someone votes while pretending to be someone else, is “incredibly rare” and the introduction of mandatory voter ID poses more problems than solutions. The ERS chief executive, Darren Hughes, said: “It’s hard not to see this as a calculated effort by the government to make voting harder for some citizens. “As such it’s vital we think about the risks these changes pose to a free and fair franchise in the UK. We need policy based on hard facts, not rumour and innuendo. “With millions of people lacking the right photographic ID, and no government plans for a universal, free alternative, this can only mean another barrier for honest voters. “The government knows this, which makes this policy all the more concerning.” The ERS is part of a coalition of charities and campaign groups opposed to the change including Age UK, Stonewall, Liberty and the Salvation Army. The intervention comes after a leaked letter from the Equality and Human Rights Commission said the change could have a disproportionate impact on voters from minority groups. Hughes said: “These deeply flawed trials must not be a fait accompli for the government’s plan to roll out an ill-thought policy. “Mandatory voter ID is a sledgehammer to crack a nut. It’s time for an evidence-based approach instead.” In the Commons on Monday, the Cabinet Office minister Chloe Smith defended the plans and said no one would need to buy new ID documents to be able to vote. She told MPs: “We already ask that people prove who they are in order to claim benefits, to rent a car or even to collect a parcel from the Post Office, so this is a proportionate and reasonable approach. “Democracy is precious and it is right to take that more robust approach to protect the integrity of the electoral process.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f4ceb62ccd27aebb8de48c44484de92a8267acfe/0_400_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea409492e10bf8d5a1e66875241e7212","title":"sadiq khan labour local election wrest control hostile tories","story":"People in cities and towns up and down the country will go to the polls on Thursday to deliver their verdict on a government that seems to neither like us nor understand our values and way of life.Under Theresa May’s leadership, the Conservative party has turned its back on urban and suburban areas by pursuing policies and public spending decisions that discriminate against our cities and towns.If you’re living in an area going to the polls in May we want to hear from you. Let us know which way you’re thinking of voting, and which issues are most crucial to you locally.You can share your thoughts using our encrypted form here. One of our journalists may contact you to discuss further and we will feature some of your contributions in our reporting.Every new policy, decision and announcement seems designed to antagonise people living in urban areas. Not just the poor, the inner-city dwellers, the ethnically erse and the young – who the Conservatives have repeatedly failed – but also the middle classes, the commuters, those in the suburbs, and all who value Britain’s tolerance, ersity and proud traditions.This is hitting in particular people living in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Newcastle, but also places such as Milton Keynes, Swindon, Trafford, Walsall and Worcester. It is hardly surprising that residents in our cities and towns are turning their backs on the Tories when they have turned their backs on us.Public services have been decimated by years of austerity. Police numbers have been cut and crime is now rising. The housing crisis has gone from bad to worse across the country. We have a government using taxpayers’ money in the courts to avoid having to tackle toxic air pollution, and a prime minister who is willing to put our jobs, prosperity and rights at risk in pursuit of the most extreme and damaging version of Brexit possible – serving the Tory interest rather than the national interest.In the last week alone we have seen how little May’s government understands our values or our way of life. First, because of the heartbreaking, shameful and disgraceful treatment of the incredible Windrush generation. Second, because of the failure to have any plan on how to address the latest appalling national crime statistics. And third, with its refusal even to consider Britain remaining in the customs union after Brexit.There are three layers of state-enforced or enforceable departures of immigrants from the UK: deportations, administrative removals and voluntary departures.Deportations apply to people and their children whose removal is deemed \u0027conducive to the public good\u0027 by the home secretary. They can also be recommended by a court.\u0026nbspAdministrative removals refer to cases involving the enforced removal of non-citizens who have either entered the country illegally, outstayed a visa, or violated the conditions of their leave to remain.Voluntary departures are people against whom enforced removal has been initiated the term \u0027voluntary\u0027 simply describes how they leave. There are three sub-categories:\u0026nbspa) Those who depart via assisted voluntary return schemes. b) Those who make their own travel arrangements and tell the authorities.c) Those who leave without notifying the government.As the scandalous treatment of the Windrush generation emerged, Conservative politicians tried to give the impression that it was an anomaly, an accidental series of mistakes. But the British people know this is a lie. We know that it was the deliberate intention to create a “hostile environment” for migrants. We know this because the Conservatives have repeatedly bragged about this for years.Thousands of British people have been subject to inhumane treatment at the hands of the immigration system designed by May – a system that has turned lay people into unofficial immigration officers, requiring landlords to check the nationality of tenants, and forcing NHS staff to check the nationality of patients.May is also responsible for vans saying “go home” that were driven around the most ethnically erse parts of our country. The “hostile environment” of which she is the architect has played a role in fuelling ision and mistrust.This weekend’s revelations have exposed Amber Rudd even further as someone who appears completely unaware about what is going on in her own department. It frankly beggars belief. What the home secretary and prime minister don’t appear to understand is that the Windrush scandal is the direct consequence of their policies and not just another example of the administrative chaos at the Home Office.It is about a generation who have lived here all their lives suddenly feeling they are not wanted here. Rather than hiding behind process or blaming civil servants yet again, the time has now surely come for the home secretary to resign.What viewpoints do you think need to be heard that aren’t currently?

It seems there is a lot going on in the Home Office of which she is unaware.When the statistics were released, the home secretary, astonishingly, refused to even comment on them, never mind announce any policies to address the unacceptable rise in crime. The government should now be committing to invest in our police forces, public services and communities – resources desperately needed to enable us to be both tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime.The same story is also true of the government’s ideological pursuit of the most extreme and reckless version of Brexit.Westminster is now in paralysis – tied up with the pursuit of a hard Brexit and a Tory government in chaos. So it is left to Labour to stand up for our cities and towns, to fill the leadership vacuum left by Westminster, to fix the challenges people face in their daily lives, and to fight for our public services and our values.The Tories have nothing to offer the voters of our cities and towns, not a single positive offer – just more of the same austerity and cuts. They are tired and devoid of any ideas. So it is now incumbent on all of us, but especially Labour – with our proud history of fighting for the many not the few, and fighting discrimination and racism – to ensure that our cities and towns are fair, inclusive, safe places for everyone. This includes redoubling our efforts to stamp out the antisemitism that has risen in recent years, wherever we find it.I urge everyone in every city and town across Britain to vote Labour this Thursday. To elect a Labour council that will stand up for you. To send a message to this Conservative government that we have had enough of its continual assaults on our values. And to take the crucial next step on the path to electing a Labour government, led by Jeremy Corbyn, that will understand our way of life and deliver the real change we so desperately need.Sadiq Khan is the mayor of London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/224784826858992f79ee628ffdad6d351b6b84d8/0_343_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=894dfd1ebe5da9c92f619bd08d431d7e","title":"support for cross party plans take no deal brexit off table","story":"Theresa May is facing another major rebellion over Brexit amid a cross-party move to kill off any attempt to crash out of the EU without a deal.A group of MPs and peers has been carefully crafting new laws that will hand parliament guaranteed powers to soften any deal and send the government back to the negotiating table.Tory sources already think there is enough support in the Commons for the plan, which they believe would end the threat of a “no deal” outcome. The move is being described by senior figures as one of the most significant amendments of the Brexit process.Ministers have previously warned that should the deal negotiated with the EU be voted down by parliament, Britain could simply leave the bloc with no agreement. However, the cross-party group’s proposal ensures that if the agreement were voted down, parliament could alter it and ask the government to reopen EU talks.The measure is expected to win a three-figure majority in the Lords on Monday and Tory Remainers are confident it will not be overturned in the Commons next month. The government is already being urged simply to accept the measure.It could open the way for parliament to back staying in the EU’s customs union and single market –something currently ruled out by the prime minister.It comes with rebel Tory MPs beginning to believe that there could now be a Commons majority for staying in the customs union and its single market, through membership of the European Free Trade Association.One well-placed Tory said there were “a few in cabinet who now see it as a possible solution”. However, the cabinet’s Brexiters are preparing a big push this week against any suggestion Britain should remain inside the customs union, which would make it impossible for the UK to negotiate its own trade deals.While Brexit minister David Davis indicated last week that parliament would have a real “meaningful vote” over the Brexit deal on offer, both peers and Remain MPs want to enshrine the guarantees in law. Labour regards the proposal as extremely significant because it would allow its MPs and Tory rebels to vote against the agreement on offer without the fear of triggering a disastrous “no deal” outcome. Keir Starmer, Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary, told the Observer: “This is one of the most important amendments of the entire Brexit process – and indeed of the parliament. We have always been clear that the vote must be truly meaningful. It cannot simply be a take-it-or-leave-it choice as the prime minister has suggested.“This amendment, which has cross-party support, would provide a safety net in the Brexit process. It would remove the possibility of a No vote leading to a no-deal. It would bring back control to parliament.”The measure is being presented in the Lords by a group of peers led by former Tory minister Lord Hailsham.However, the government describes the measure as a meaningless attempt to frustrate Brexit.Lord Callanan, the Brexit minister in the Lords, said: “Labour’s flawed amendment seeks to tie our hands by inserting false deadlines and shifting the power to negotiate from government to parliament. It asks for meaningless votes on the deal before the deal is done. Those who want to overturn the referendum call this the ‘no Brexit’ amendment.“The Conservatives are taking the scrutinising role of parliament seriously, to improve an essential piece of legislation. Labour are using it to frustrate Brexit.”Senior Labour MPs, meanwhile, are directly appealing to their counterparts in the Lords to back attempts to keep Britain in the customs union and single market. Chuka Umunna, Heidi Alexander, Alison McGovern and Chris Leslie have written to Labour peers urging for their help.“We are writing to ask for your support for an amendment which requires the government to make the UK’s continued participation in the European Economic Area (EEA) an objective in the Brexit negotiations,” they write. “The EEA provides a platform on which we can continue to be part of the EU single market if Brexit occurs, with the protection for workers, consumers and our environment that our party believes in.”Another Labour MP, meanwhile, is attempting to engineer the first Commons vote on whether or not the final Brexit deal should be put to a second referendum. Gareth Thomas, the former trade minister, will introduce a backbench bill next month, which will trigger a non-binding vote on the issue.“A people’s vote would give the British people the chance to take back control over Brexit from a small cabal of Leave ideologues and instead, on the biggest question facing our country, determine together our country’s economic, social and cultural future,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80186cedc46eb336d5cd13eeb6c52d496e2326b0/0_68_2512_1507/master/2512.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eb31ace60e3ba3528c0621e253cd8e8c","title":"ronnie osullivan knocked out bitter clash ali carter world championship","story":"Ronnie O’Sullivan clashed with Ali Carter at the Crucible as the five-times winner crashed out of the World Championship.O’Sullivan, the title favourite, snapped at Carter in the 19th frame of the second-round match, describing the 38-year-old as “Mr Angry” after also appearing to barge him.Carter went on to clinch a 13-9 victory, his first win over O’Sullivan in a major tournament after years of trying. O’Sullivan beat Carter in two world championship finals, in 2008 and 2012.O’Sullivan had just fluked a snooker when he and Carter collided at the side of the table in a flash point that defined the match.Once back in his seat, O’Sullivan said: “That’s for being Mr Angry.” He then told Carter it was his turn\u0026nbspto play, sparking Carter to respond: “Thank you very much, very nice of you.”The referee, Paul Collier, intervened and said: “Right, fellas, just play on,” with O’Sullivan then saying he was “cool as a cucumber”.Carter, who has twice overcome cancer and suffers from Crohn’s disease, said of the incident: “I just thought, ‘Listen, I’m not intimidated by Ronnie like a lot of other players are. I’ve been through harder things than that in my life.’”He added: “It would have been easy for me to sit back in my chair and be like, ‘I’d better be the little boy in the corner’.“But no, it was my day today and I’m delighted.”O’Sullivan was asked whether he would apologise to Carter. “I don’t think there’s anything to apologise about. There’s no hard feeling there,” the 42-year-old said.O’Sullivan claimed Carter also barged him during the match. Asked if he thought he might be fined by disciplinary chiefs, O’Sullivan added: “I don’t really know. They can send a letter to my lawyer and they can happily deal with it.“Have you never been angry in your life? We all get angry sometimes. If someone’s going to shoulder-barge into me, do I have to walk around him, tiptoe or do a little curtsy as if he’s the Queen? Sometimes you have to stand your ground. I’m not a limbo dancer, you know.”O’Sullivan trailed 11-9 at the mid-session interval but he had been off his game for most of the match and it was no surprise that he inched no closer.

Youth had head-butted the champions, and, for the time being, had been repelled by its oldest warrior.But back to that fourth round. What is seared in the memory is not so much the drilled, acutely angled backhands and powerful line drives on the run by Djokovic (not to mention commensurate responses by his precocious tormentor), because he has delivered so many of those delights in the past. As he strains now against time and the degradation of his tennis, it is easy to forget that this is the player regarded by his peers as the finest defender of the modern era.A YouTube highlights reel of Djokovic’s extraordinary stamina, flexibility and determination under pressure lasts 10 minutes and 28 seconds. But the image that endures this time is of Djokovic, sweating hands on weary knees, seconds after over-cooking a stretched backhand in the first game of the third set which, had it landed legally, might have given him two break points and a glimmer of hope to eat into Chung’s two-set lead.Within the hour, the deed was done. Djokovic, who had won the title six times, had suffered his first straight-sets loss in Melbourne in 11 years. The 30-year-old, so used to victory, had to reset his goals.The previous European spring, after Monte Carlo, he had split with Marian Vajda, his coach since 2006. We were told it was mutual. Djokovic had been searching for spiritual sustenance through a life-coach called Pepe Imaz, formerly a fringe Spanish player. Seemingly content in Pepe’s world, he nevertheless continued to look bewildered on the place that had always offered him familiar comfort, the tennis court.Djokovic grew short-tempered with journalists who inquired about his private life – understandably so – and his game suffered along with his mind and his body. He needed to reinvent himself. But, even with Andre Agassi on board as he headed for Roland Garros, he could not get past the quarters in 2017’s second slam – nor at Wimbledon, where he quit in the second set against Tomas Berdych, despondent and injured. Where once he reached finals almost by right, now he was red-lining five matches into the quest. His body was rebelling loudly. He would not play again that season.While he smiled through the clouds, speaking more now about personal contentment, about wider social issues and responsibilities, there was no hiding his public angst. He arrived in Melbourne in January living on the vapours of hope rather than experience.Condensed into that 35-shot rally with Chung were all the elements that inspire and deflate. The difference this time – and subsequently – was that Djokovic would not prevail. His despair in that exhausted last gasp was not just because he lost a point, but that he had been bested by a younger, equally ambitious opponent. He was staring at the future.The elbow injury that troubled him so much that he had to rebuild his serve, then resort to minor surgery, had been chronic rather than passing, he later revealed. It is testimony to his grit that he played so often through the pain. The dilemma for him in the autumn of his career – as it is for Andy Murray returning soon from a hip operation – is how to tap into what worked for him in the first decade, to trust his core talent and skill, much as Federer continues to do at 36.Djokovic was almost an asterisk in Barcelona during the week. His three-set loss to Martin Klizan in the second round was his fifth in 10 matches since he went back on the Tour in Australia. It was not a wipeout: he played brilliantly in the second set – but he collapsed where it mattered, in the third – against an erratic if gifted opponent ranked 140 in the world. Djokovic again looked spent, keen to get away, to forget the experience and move on.He also did not appear as physically robust as he had done at his indomitable peak, in 2011 when he won 41 matches in a row. He was 10-1 against Federer and Rafael Nadal that year, and set to dominate the game for as long as he chose. He knew it wouldn’t last. He told us so. But he surely did not anticipate the tumble would be so tough. It is said one of the reasons Agassi left him was the player would not heed his advice to put on some bulk.There is a lot of goodwill out there for Djokovic. One British fan tweeted after the Klizan embarrassment: “Totally unwavering support, no matter what. You will always be our favourite. You have given us so much joy over the years and for a few more years I’m sure. It’s not just your play, but you, as a person. Kind, fun, honest, charitable, strong, humble, perfect.“Perfect is not a word that fits tennis (sport in general, or life, for that matter), because there are as many moments that bode ill as bring success. The quality that binds elite athletes is their willingness to overcome imperfection. As Tiger Woods says of his golf: it’s about managing the bad shots.For all that he can occasionally be hard to fathom, Djokovic is an open and engaging personality, charming and intelligent. Of the many public testimonies, a chat he had with a friend when he was seven years old in war-torn Serbia is the most enlightening. Asked by his junior inquisitor if tennis is “for you, a game or obligations?” he replies: “Tennis is for me an obligation. The goal for me in tennis is to become a champion.”Even allowing for a mangled translation and the innocence of childhood, the message was unambiguous. Winning is what matters most to Djokovic. Without it, he is not complete."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81d98505a16e683fcac471844753e4979a680334/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59dfaf84a5eabc970998e0700a6a56bd","title":"stationery that looks good enough to eat in pictures","story":"When he turned seven, Neal Whittington’s uncle gave him a £7 WH Smith voucher: this started a lifelong obsession with stationery.

It is presented by Sara Cox, a one-time farmer’s daughter who absconded to the city and thus understands the gulf between town and country living. Farming is a round-the-clock job and finding a partner can be tough in a place where sheep outnumber humans 100 to one.A further 150 miles north of Pete is Christine, a smart, sweet-natured thirtysomething who runs a remote beef and sheep farm in Dumfries and Galloway. Christine has had her heart broken and is low on confidence, though that doesn’t stop her from getting potential boyfriends to rummage in her rams’ nether regions to check whether their balls have dropped. Other subjects include Mark, a Norfolk blacksmith who doesn’t believe in central heating a orced pig farmer, Wendy, on the lookout for a younger man and 28-year-old equine vet Heather, whose time is largely spent up to her armpit in horse.After viewing Pete and co’s dating profiles, potential suitors are asked to write old-fashioned letters for the hopefuls to sift through and narrow down for a speed-dating session. While Wendy and Christine look dolefully at their meagre offerings, Pete struggles to conceal his delight as he is handed 30 letters. Such is his bashfulness that he asks Wendy to read out an extract from one in which the applicant extols his “round, masculine features” and apologises for the drips of water on the page on account of her being fresh out of the shower when she wrote it. This is about as racy as Love in the Countryside gets. In a world in which dating shows ask contestants to size up would-be lovers’ genitals before their faces (hello Naked Attraction), and in which people are asked to score their partners on their looks (greetings Your Face Or Mine), Love in the Countryside trades in an unusually chaste form of courtship, so much so that there’s a collective gasp when a man sends Heather a picture of his arse. Bum shots aside, however, there is no nudity, no engineered antagonism and no unpleasantness here, only polite small talk, tentative hand-holding and closeups of bewildered-looking cows. Back in Yorkshire, there is frolicking in the cowshed as the three women on Pete’s shortlist explore the pens. “Ooh, it’s trying to nibble my bottom,” shrieks Francesca from Essex, as a calf greets her a little too warmly. Amid the undulating hills and gallons of cow shit, the search for a two-legged partner goes on.

On a visit to the area a few weeks previously, Đurić had been arrested by special forces, bundled into a police van, and unceremoniously deported. This time, Serbia’s point man for Kosovo issues was allowed to stay, albeit with a helicopter hovering noisily overhead to keep watch.Đurić was in Kosovo, which Serbia still officially regards as its province, to tour a microbrewery producing beer named in honour of a medieval battle which is key to Serbia’s emotional attachment to Kosovo. He also visited a spa resort, under construction to cater to Serbian pilgrims to the 14th-century Banjska monastery.“It is my duty to be here and to stand proudly with our people,” said Đurić to the gathered throng of television crews. “I invite all Serbian citizens to come here without prejudice, and experience their holy sites here in Kosovo and Metohija,” he said, using the Serbian name for the province.Under an agreement signed in Brussels in 2013, the Kosovo government was supposed to set up a so-called Association of Serbian Municipalities, which would bring Serb-majority areas into its system but would also give them a collective voice. Belgrade and Pristina are still jostling over the final format, as they edge towards a comprehensive deal to normalise relations and potentially usher in an EU future for both.Avni Arifi, chief of staff to Kosovo’s prime minister, said cultural guarantees and political representation for Serbs were already enshrined in its constitution, and he accused Belgrade of wanting to create a Trojan horse, akin to Republika Srpska, the increasingly autonomous Serb entity inside Bosnia. “They’re asking for us to give something more, but forgiveness is all they can get because everything else is taken,” said Arifi.Serbia’s president Aleksandar Vučić last week claimed that Kosovo had done “zero potato” to implement any of its promises. Vučić has been working the diplomatic circuit, trying to drum up support for concessions to Serbia, the details of which still remain vague, as well as prepare public opinion at home for potentially painful compromises.One of Belgrade’s suggestions, increasingly mentioned in the media, is a partition along the Ibar river, with North Kosovo going to Serbia possibly as part of an exchange involving majority-Albanian districts of southern Serbia. “All Serbs would say that’s one of the solutions,” said Vučić, while declining to comment on whether it was a specific goal in negotiations.Kosovo’s president Hashim Thaçi has ruled this option out. “There will be no ision of Kosovo. There will be no exchange of territory,” he has said. Western diplomats are also strongly opposed, at least in part because of the precedent it could set for other disputed borders in the Balkans.Additionally, many Serbs live in enclaves south of the river, such as Gračanica, just a few miles outside Pristina. A vast photograph of Vučić dominates the main square, where Serbian flags fly. Serbian dinars are accepted, as well as euros, the official currency. Gračanica’s Orthodox monastery, completed in 1321, is filled with frescos of biblical scenes, most notably a rendering of the Last Judgment complete with burning sinners. It is Kosovo’s medieval monasteries which create the emotional draw for many Serbs, who see it as the heart of their nation and religion.Here, the police force offers a rare glimmer of hope for those who would like to see an integrated, multi-ethnic Kosovo. Of the officers based at Gračanica’s station, 41 are Serbs and 12 are Albanian. Svetlana Kapetanović, a 43-year-old ethnic Serb policewoman who speaks fluent Albanian, said that in recent years ethnically motivated incidents have been extremely rare, with most of the force’s work hours dedicated to fighting petty crime. The officers all wear uniforms emblazoned with the Kosovo flag, at odds with the Serbian flags around the town.Kapetanović said she decided to learn Albanian after an incident at the beginning of her police career in 2003, when she was called with a group of Albanian officers to a domestic violence incident involving a young Albanian woman.“I was the only female officer there, and the girl was giving me looks, like she wanted to communicate something to me without saying it to the men. I could see she wanted help from me and I wanted to talk to her but I couldn’t speak Albanian and she couldn’t speak Serbian. I suspected there had been a rape, and reported it to my commander. Later, it turned out I had been right. It was then I realised that I needed to learn Albanian.”As a fluent Albanian speaker, Kapetanović is a rare Serb. While there is still a generation of Kosovo Albanians who remember Serbian, among the youth crossover it is rare. Children at Serbian-language schools, which still run on the Serbian state curriculum, learn no Albanian, and vice versa.“Unfortunately we still have a situation where Serbs and Albanians live separate lives,” said Dalibor Jevtić, the Serb deputy prime minister, who speaks Albanian. While dodging the issue of his own views on Kosovo’s status, Jevtić said all sides need to take a constructive approach to the language issue. Although his party, Serbian List, has strong links to Belgrade, he said it was not for Serbia to tell Kosovo Serbs how to live.“Ninety per cent of Serbs in central Serbia have never been to Kosovo. They don’t understand our lives and I don’t take it very seriously when they tell me how I should live my life with my neighbours,” he said.Although most Kosovo Serbs are still uneasy at the idea of independence, many now see unemployment and economic disenfranchisement as bigger threats than ethnic tensions. There are also ides within the community, starkly illustrated by the assassination in January of Oliver Ivanović, a Kosovo Serb politician who opposed Serbian List, which dominates the Serb political scene. Ivanović was shot dead in Mitrovica, split into Serbian and Albanian sides by the Ibar. Nobody has been arrested for the murder.“It’s not safe to speak freely in this town, but let’s just say it wasn’t Albanians who killed him,” said Marko Jakšić, a political associate of Ivanović, during an interview in North Mitrovica.Some Kosovo Serbs say Belgrade and Pristina are equally frustrating in using their predicament to score points. The high-profile Kosovo visits of Đuric and others often seem aimed at public opinion in Serbia rather than making material improvements for them. “For Belgrade, Kosovo is just a poker chip to be played on the path to Serbia’s EU integration,” said Jakšić. “Vučić is willing to play it, and Đuric is just meant to be the sedative that makes things easier for us.”Additional reporting by Una Hajdari"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5351384b7f4ecf373f100d38aed380445039636e/838_210_2790_1674/master/2790.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=453f1b81168db9aeb78b1e23457c1e51","title":"north korea state media plays down kim jong uns nuclear pledge","story":"Kim Jong-un’s promise to denuclearise the Korean peninsula given little coverageNorth Korea’s state media is playing down Kim Jong-un’s pledge to pursue denuclearisation, made at a summit with South Korea, raising the stakes for Donald Trump’s upcoming talks with the young leader.Eliminating the nuclear weapons that North Korea claims could hit US cities is Washington’s core objective in talks with Pyongyang. It wants a process that is “complete, verifiable and irreversible”.Experts, however, have long warned that Kim is unlikely to give up missiles and warheads that have taken decades of work to build, particularly when they are the very reason the US president is coming to the negotiating table.While North Korea has repeatedly signalled it is willing to give up its nuclear weapons, the conditions for that to happen may be too high a price to pay for the US and its allies.“The worst case scenario is learning the North Korean definition of denuclearization is untenable with international community’s expectations,” says Jenny Town, the assistant director of the US-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. “When they think of denuclearization, they think it will come about over decades.”“It’s also dependent on having good relations with the US, and North Korea has seen the US pull out of many international agreements, so they won’t trust a simple promise, they want to build trust over time.”Kim is acutely aware of the fate of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, who gave up his weapons programmes only to have European and US forces bomb the country during an uprising against him.Other possibilities include a meeting relatively light on substance, focused on building goodwill between both sides and positive photo opportunities instead of touching on issues that could cause conflict.There is little chance of a concrete agreement of any kind resulting from the summit. Beginning negotiations with a meeting between the two leaders, before any details have been hammered out, is always risky. The meeting will likely be followed by months, if not years, of negotiations at the lower levels before anything is signed.Read a full explainer on the Korea summit here“It would be extremely strange – by basically any theory of human or political behaviour – for Kim to give up a deterrent right after attaining it,” said Alex Wellerstein, a historian of science and nuclear weapons. “Nothing is impossible, but it would be very unexpected, the strangest possible outcome.”North Korea’s state media only published details of the historic summit with South Korea on Saturday, the day after the rest of the world watched the meeting unfold on live television.State TV’s semi-retired anchor Ri Chun Hee, who has announced most major news in the isolated state for decades, returned to the nation’s screens to report on the talks with the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in.The meeting also filled a number of pages of the Saturday edition of the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper, including dozens of photos. Among the images of the leaders, their wives and the summit site, the text focused mostly on promises to try to bring lasting peace to the peninsula, rather than the goal of getting rid of nuclear weapons.“The emphasis is all on peace, the nation, dialogue and unification. Denuclearization is a small side issue,” wrote Peter Ward, a north Korea watcher based in Seoul, wrote in a detailed analysis of coverage in Pyongyang’s paper of record on Twitter.The Rodong Sinmun reproduced the two leaders’ joint declaration in full, which mentioned denuclearisation. It did not specify any details, however, and the newspaper did not otherwise touch on the issue, despite Trump’s repeated insistence that destroying North Korea’s nuclear capacity lies at the heart of US concerns.After months of sabre rattling, many in Seoul and further afield saw the talks as a welcome move to reduce tensions and the risk of miscalculations.North Korea, however, has a history of seeking rapprochement with the south, brokering deals to limit its nuclear ambitions in return for aid or other support – and then breaking them.North and South Korea have been ided since the end of the Korean War (1950-53), and except for about a decade ending in 2008, relations between the two have remained frosty. The two nations technically remain in a state of war, since a peace treaty was never signed.\u0026nbspThere have been occasional outbreaks of violence, most recently in 2010 when 50 people were killed when a South Korean navy corvette was sunk and several islands close to the border were attacked.This meeting\u0026nbspcould touch on a formal truce\u0026nbspbut this is also not the first time North Korea has expressed a willingness to abandon its nuclear ambitions. A deal with the US, Japan and South Korea in the 1990s was meant to give the North civilian nuclear power without the ability to build a weapon, but the reactor was never finished.North Korea\u0026nbsppledged to relinquish its nuclear programme\u0026nbspin 2007 in exchange for sanctions relief and fuel, but later pulled out of that agreement and expelled inspectors in 2009.Read a full explainer on the Korea summit hereTrump has warned that Washington will not be “played” by Kim, and that he will keep up a campaign of maximum pressure until the nuclear weapons are gone. If the two sides are unable reach a deal he will walk out of any summit, he has said. North Korea has its red lines too. The fate of leaders such as Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gaddafi, who gave up illegal weapons programmes and were then toppled by the west or western-backed movements, is well known in Pyongyang, and likely to add to Kim’s reluctance to abandon the country’s nuclear project. “It is still unclear whether North Korea still believes that it can have its cake and eat it too,” said Victor Cha, who until January was in the running to become US ambassador to South Korea.The meeting had positive atmospherics but did not clarify whether Kim was genuinely considering giving up his nuclear weapons or just hoped to freeze programmes in return for sanctions relief and aid, he told the Associated Press."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a0f8af50cbf34a55ec7c08f133769afbec7c4fbc/0_222_4568_2741/master/4568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=13c269868e2e3322cf3951c9288a242f","title":"six months metoo how soon guys come back hadley freeman","story":"Months are like dog years for men, so four months on the sidelines for a man is definitely the same as decades of groping for a womanGosh, remember the #MeToo movement? That was exciting, wasn’t it? All that talk about how nothing was ever going to be the same again. No longer would men get away with sexually exploiting women, and powerful men who once seemed untopplable were duly toppled. Red lines, everyone said, had been drawn. And six months on from the beginning of this movement, there’s only one question, really, that is being asked: how soon can these guys come back?“Several powerful men, in several industries, have had their worlds kicked out from under them as the #MeToo movement has gathered momentum… Is a comeback possible?” an article in the New York Times recently asked about the American chef Mario Batali. Yes, the poor men! Those accusations really came out of nowhere for them. It might be worth interjecting at this point that Batali, a popular and powerful media figure in America, is alleged to have sexually harassed women for decades. But the allegations came out in December, and it’s April now, and we all know months are like dog years for men, and so four months on the sidelines for a man is definitely the same as decades of groping for women.Similar pieces have also run in the past few weeks about US journalist Matt Lauer, whom you might remember as the one who allegedly had what was referred to as “a sex button” on his desk, allowing him to lock his office door from his desk while he harassed women. Similarly, Garrison Keillor, who reportedly made female employees feel “mistreated and sexualised” for years, is “determined America still wants to hear his voice”, if, perhaps, not feel his hands and receive his creepy emails.The Hollywood Reporter recently ran a heart-tugging profile of the once eminence grise broadcaster Charlie Rose, depicting him as “broken, brilliant and lonely”, miserably playing tennis at his $4m-$6m home. “I think he is trying to understand,” a friend told the reporter. Allow me to help you with that, Charlie. You have been accused of harassment by multiple women, who say you groped them, made gross late-night phone calls to them, exposed yourself to them and put your hand down their trousers while they cried. Your habit of giving women surprise massages was so established, it was referred to by your colleagues as “the crusty paw”. So ponder on that while you and your crusty paw are hitting those tennis balls, Rose.Last November, Louis CK finally admitted, after years of denials, to masturbating in front of women. Some of his victims had gone public with their accusations in the past, and CK’s denials had left them open to abuse from his fans – something, incidentally, all those who question the credibility of anonymous allegations in similar situations could do with bearing in mind.This argument has come up a lot since the start of the #MeToo movement, with men solemnly explaining to women that a grope is really not the same as a rape, which is super helpful of them because if there’s one group who really aren’t clear about the severity of rape, it’s women. But increasingly when I hear someone say, “Harassment isn’t as bad as rape”, what they seem to be saying is, “It isn’t that bad at all.”All of these men are multimillionaires, so concerns about their current lack of employment are not based on them no longer being able to pay the gas bill. Rather, it shows that, despite the alleged realigning of power dynamics by #MeToo, men are still seen as the stars of the show and women as faceless background nobodies. You know, it’s that classic Hollywood plot: man strives for success, man gets success, man frantically masturbates in front of women and gives them the crusty paw, man makes glorious comeback. In the case of Batali, Rose, Lauer and Keillor, it’s the men wanting this storyline in the case of CK, it seems to be others wanting it for him. In all cases, it’s the diminishing of the women who were harassed. Are the women these men exploited being interviewed about how their careers were hampered? How they were denied opportunities because they spoke up, or said no? The answer, of course, is ha ha ha. Increasingly it looks like #MeToo didn’t topple the patriarchy – it showed how tenacious the patriarchy is at enforcing its stranglehold."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d88c56cc39a9859cf189bf41e27add5dadeae3c2/0_308_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5efaef059c31d66e36435859ac41f4f5","title":"armenias ruling party bows out of pm race to avoid confrontation","story":"Opposition leader Nikol Pashinyan calls on parliament to elect him after mass protests oust longtime ruler Serzh SargsyanArmenia’s ruling party will not put up a candidate for prime minister as it attempts to ease tensions after more than two weeks of street protests. Demonstrations against the party and official corruption forced Serzh Sargsyan, a former president, to resign as prime minister on 23 April and the parliament is due to pick a new one on 1 May. While its majority in parliament means it should be able to choose who that is, the Republican party announced on Saturday it will not to put forward its own candidate. “By not putting forward a candidate, we will avoid confrontation and an increase in security risks,” party spokesman Eduard Sharmazanov said. “We are not putting anyone forward in the state’s interest.“ Protest leader Nikol Pashinyan, a member of parliament who describes himself as “the people’s choice”, has said the parliament should elect him prime minister next week. He then wants snap parliamentary polls under a new election law. On Saturday he called on supporters to continue protests and to organise big, non-violent demonstrations in the capital Yerevan on 1 May. “All protest actions, actions of civil disobedience, should be renewed with new force. The victory of the people must be recognised,” Pashinyan, 42, told a rally in the town of Ijevan.The Republican party has 58 seats in the 105-seat parliament, so Pashinyan is unlikely to be elected without the party’s support. However, the second biggest party in the parliament, Prosperous Armenia, hinted it might support him. “My team and I will vote for a people’s candidate, whether it’s Nikol Pashinyan or anyone else nominated by the people,” the Prosperous Armenia leader, Gagik Tsarukyan, told Kentron TV. A junior coalition member, the Dashnaktsutyun party, said this week it was quitting the government and favoured an early election, but it was unclear whether it would vote for Pashinyan, who has a history of political activism and opposition. Although the demonstrations have been peaceful, the upheaval has threatened to destabilise Armenia, an ally of Russia, in a volatile region riven by Armenia’s decades-long, low-level conflict with neighbouring Azerbaijan. The next parliamentary elections are not due until 2022. But if the parliament fails twice to elect a new prime minister with majority support, early elections must be held."},{"url":null,"title":"more than metoo 10 ways workplaces can turn the hashtag into action","story":"In an edited extract of a speech given at the Global Summit of Women, Tracey Spicer urges employers to step up and stamp out sexual harassmentMy first job was working behind the Yummies Bar at our local roller-skating rink, swirling soft serves ice-creams into crispy cones to a soundtrack of Sweet with Ballroom Blitz for the speed skate and Barbara Streisand for the couples’ skate.I remember being so proud to be 14 years old in the workforce, earning the stellar sum of $2 an hour. One day a man swaggered over to the counter and asked for a soft serve with extra sprinkles.  “Don’t worry about the change, luv,” he leered. “Just give us a kiss.”  I did not want my first kiss to be with an unkempt chap in his early 30s. But, I had no choice. Before I could step back, he grabbed me by the elbows and began eating my face. It wasn’t a kiss: he was biting, chomping, devouring. • Sign up to receive the latest Australian opinion pieces every weekday When he finally let go, I could taste blood. My lips and tongue were numb. “See ya!” he smirked, slouching off. I stood, in shock. I finished my shift. Then I went home.I thought, what’s the point in complaining? No one listens to teenage girls. The victim is always to blame.  My first kiss – supposed to be a sweet, consensual event – was actually my first experience of workplace sexual harassment. Countless encounters followed on a spectrum from indecent assault to attempted rape, which I wrote about in my memoir The Good Girl Stripped Bare. I’ve worked on documentaries around the world about the plight of women and girls. My own experiences are not as serious as using rape as a weapon of war. But as the #MeToo movement has shown, every woman has a story. That’s why we launched Now Australia. For everyone. For the survivors in some of the lowest-paid sectors in the workforce. For the nurses, the cleaners, those on the factory floor. For the marginalised women, and those from erse cultural backgrounds.  Now Australia is a nonpartisan, not-for-profit coalition with one aim: to end sexual harassment in the workplace. We’re nearing the end of our initial stage of crowdfunding to build a triage service, connecting anyone who has experienced sexual harassment with the right counselling and legal support. Long-term, we plan to collate research to create education programs for schools and businesses.  The message emerging is that there are a number of proven strategies to eradicate sexual harassment in the workplace, but none of them will work in isolation. We need revolutionary cultural change requiring quantum shifts in legislation, education and corporate structures, with cooperation across multiple sectors, from the grassroots to those above the glass ceilings.  These are our top 10 suggestions to activate the hashtag: Research shows consistently that companies with more women in management have fewer instances of sexual harassment. This is partly because harassment flourishes when men feel pressured to laugh along with the sexualised behaviour of their colleagues and superiors. Many women then internalise this misogyny and, yes, become offenders as well. This is an issue identified in multiple papers. As Frank Dobbin and Alexandra Kalev in the Harvard Business Review explain, “Executives … have installed training and grievance procedures and called it a day. They’re satisfied as long as the courts are. They don’t bother to ask themselves whether the programs work.”Around a third of people who formally complain are demoted, fired or – believe it or not – further harassed. Several large-scale surveys show people who file complaints are much more likely to lose their jobs than those who experience similar levels of harassment and say nothing.Many large workplaces around Australia provide anonymous whistleblower hotlines. These are confidential electronic systems, operated by an external third party, allowing employees to report harassment. Sometimes the report is embargoed until someone else complains about the same person, to expose serial harassers. A note of caution here: this was put in place at a television network in this country, but few people use it because of a lack of trust in the workplace. CEOs must take a strong public stand against harassment and keep repeating that message. They should be first in line for training, and chair the committees tasked with solving the problem. Training must be mandatory for all levels of management – not just staff.In 2017, the writer Nora Caplan-Bricker warned that telling people what not to do tends to trigger their “inner toddler”, causing defiance and tantrums. Trying to impart knowledge and skills – for example “this is what harassment looks like” “this is what you can do if you witness harassment” – works better than trying to change attitudes. Managers need to feel like they’re part of the solution. Sadly, people who enter sexual harassment training with the most biased attitudes tend to exit having learned the least. As Claire Cain Miller explains in the New York Times, “Bystander training equips everyone in the workplace to stop harassment, instead of offering people two roles no one wants: harasser or victim.” At its heart, this is about having a conversation with a friend about the way they talk about women. This sounds counterintuitive. But fundamentally, we are all really tall children. Offering us a treat now and then is incredibly motivating.  We know that most women don’t report harassment for fear of retaliation, or fear that it won’t be taken seriously. The way to fix this is to reward managers if harassment complaints increase, at least initially, because it means employees have faith in the system.  You can’t solve a problem you can’t see. Our investigations at Fairfax and the ABC revealed a system that promoted the perpetrators, and silenced, sidelined or sacked the survivors. Sometimes, HR departments characterise sexual harassment complaints as examples of poor management or interpersonal difficulties, rather than as violations of the law.  There need to be consequences and follow-through.  Consider making compliance with sexual harassment guidelines a condition of doing business. Especially if you have a family business: it reflects your values.  This is the perfect way to amplify your influence. After all, money talks. But so does storytelling. Yes, we need data.

But is there a third way?Sitting firmly in the middle of the millennial generation (those born 1981-2000) and I’m told I could easily afford to buy my first home in London if I just give up: coffee, my gym membership, an annual weekend away, takeaway food, and a mobile upgrade, or one night out a week, for five years – or avocados.Sure, London living is afforded by renting the equivalent of a dodgy hostel dorm, nights out revolving around two-for-one deals, and “side-hustles”, which is a glorified term for my three jobs. So, should I accept that I can’t have my brunch and eat it too? Living paycheck to paycheck isn’t the dream and maybe neither is owning a home, but there must be a way I could at least consider the option.I’m certainly not alone, but maybe we’re placing too much value on “Yolo” – apparently a typical habit of young people today – so I’ve asked Paul Bridgwater, head of commercial and proposition at financial services provider OneFamily, and millennial lifestyle and personal finance expert Lisa Rowan from The Penny Hoarder what they think – and luckily neither suggested a five-year period where I give up all that I hold dear.Is it really that hard to save in a big city or am I being led astray?Rowan suggests that, unfortunately, it’s not all in my head. “Affordable, low-amenity units are being replaced with luxury buildings that are simply out of reach for many people, especially young people in the early stages of their careers,” she says. “This competitive housing environment means more workers in their 20s and 30s are enduring long commutes from the suburbs or are living with several roommates in order to make the most of their budgets.” But, Bridgwater says, while it can feel unattainable without the help from “the bank of mum and dad” we do have the benefit of living in a connected, digital age that can help us achieve our financial goals.I really value my social life – do I have to give up a chunk of it for five years?No, says Rowan, but there are some hacks to help make sure you don’t spend most of your monthly wages during the excitement of payday. In short, be at least a bit prepared. “Knowing the type of activity upfront can help you determine whether an event is a social and financial priority for you – then, it’s easier to make compromises. You may skip on the 12-person birthday dinner at a fancy restaurant, but you can still meet the group for drinks or dessert afterward. You can still go on a bar crawl with your friends, but perhaps eat a hearty meal before you leave the house,” she says.Bridgwater agrees, and says it’s safe to assume that most of your friends are in the same boat, so be straight up with them. “Money is a bit of a taboo subject for any age group, especially in the UK. On a practical level, earnings, savings and debts are not really discussed and perhaps they should be,” he says. “Like anything else in life, by talking and sharing issues, interesting solutions will come to light.”OK, so maybe I should be budgeting. What are some handy guidelines?Bridgwater says that budgeting isn’t the same for everyone, but taking away the temptation to spend is often the easiest way to save. “Create different accounts for your big expenses (housing, bills and savings) and then set up a standing order into these accounts one to two days after your wages go in from your main account. You’ll then know the money you have left in your main account is money you can spend,” he says.So, can I think about saving for a big purchase and still keep seeing my friends?Yes, says Rowan: “You can have your instant and delayed gratification at the same time.” A product like OneFamily’s stocks and shares Lifetime Isa is a good start when considering your options. With a Lifetime Isa, for every £4 put in, the government adds £1 – so save up to £4,000 a year and get £1,000 as a bonus (available after 12 months). Lifetime Isas are available either based on cash investments, which can be preferable for first-time house purchases in the short-term or stocks and shares investments, which might be preferable if you are aiming to buy your first home in five or more years, as they offer potentially better returns over the longer term, but be aware that capital is at risk.For information on the OneFamily stocks and shares Lifetime Isa, visit OneFamily.

Photograph: Collins CourtsThe clinical director of the national cervical cancer screening programme advised a Limerick gynaecologist to file some audited test results rather than to tell women in certain cases that all-clear smear tests they had received years earlier were wrong.Dr Gráinne Flannelly, clinical director of CervicalCheck, told gynaecologist Dr Kevin Hickey in an email in July 2017 that several women in the mid-west region should not be told about the false negative tests discovered in an audit after he wrote to her to confirm that she felt some women with cervical cancer should not be informed about them.The private correspondence was submitted in the High Court case taken by Vicky Phelan, a 43-year-old mother of two with terminal cancer from Annacotty, Co Limerick who was not told about an incorrect 2011 smear test until September 2017, despite a 2014 audit by CervicalCheck showing that the test was wrong.The records emerged after Dr Flannelly publicly acknowledged that she could not say for sure that all of the 206 women who missed early treatment for cervical cancer had been made aware of the situation.Dr Hickey wrote to Dr Flannelly on June 20th, 2017 referring to a list of patients with cervical cancer noting that in three highlighted cases the women should be told about the false smear test results after a 2014 review.“There were other ladies where the review process has altered the original smear report and it looks from your notes that you have felt that these should be filed in the patients’ notes and that no review is necessary,” Dr Hickey wrote to her at the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street in Dublin.“I just wanted to confirm that you are happy with this whole process centrally from the Cervical Screening Unit given that it looks that some of the review smears were different from the original.”Dr Flannelly replied on July 7th, 2017 in an email with the subject line “clarification”.“Yes – a balance needs to be struck in deciding who needs a formal communication of the outcome of the audit. The possibility of resultant harm is crucial,” she wrote.In cases where women have not had cancer or who have “local and fertility-sparing surgery”, Dr Hickey should “simply file” the audited test results in the patients’ medical notes, Dr Flannelly wrote.“The concept of delay is important,” she said. “I based my judgment on the medical information available to me and using the same criteria I use in my own practice when dealing with these cases. Only three of the women merited a closeout meeting using these criteria,” Dr Flannelly wrote.On August 8th, 2017, after being told by Dr Hickey that he had taken it upon himself to inform all the affected women, Dr Flannelly wrote to him again, noting his decision and saying that this “underscores the value of the local clinician reviewing the clinical context”.“The advice I gave was based on the limited information available to me and was given as an honest assessment of what seemed to be the best way to proceed with these cases,” she said.“It is right and fitting that your own clinical judgment should take precedence.” Yesterday, Minister for Health Simon Harris appointed a senior team of experts to examine the cases of the 206 women who missed early treatment for cervical cancer and to assess how many were not made aware of the delay in diagnosis.The appointments followed Mr Harris’s failure to declare confidence in the leadership of the programme. A HSE spokeswoman said Prof Flannelly would be “continuing in her role” and was “directly involved” in the process to provide assurance around the communications with the 206 women whose cases were under review.Asked about doctors using their “judgment” on whether to inform patients of wrong test results, the spokeswoman said the “practice was deemed to be appropriate and is in line with the practice in the UK for the communication of cancer audit reviews”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Controversy after figures show 206 women may have had a delayed cancer diagnosisPhelan\u0026rsquos court case brought to light failings of the CervicalCheck screening programmeInitiative follows rise in number of collisions and death of boy (12) in Dublin incidentAnnual Irish Red Cross ceremony recognises contribution to communities across the StateSister says Limerick artist Liam McCarthy (52) paralysed from eyes down after stroke\u0026lsquoIt is critical that Ireland joins with this coalition and supports efforts... the EU\u0026rsquos climate commitments\u0026rsquoIPU president criticises lack of progress in rolling out proposed healthcare strategyConcerns raised that cancers potentially missed during screening processGarda\u0026iacute thank the public for their help in finding the teenagersThe 18-year-old died after the car he was driving collided with a second vehicleDeceased who was in her in 70s was killed in incident near Boula, PortumnaDr Gr\u0026aacuteinne Flannelly told Limerick gynaecologist to file audited test results insteadHarris to sign regulations on voluntary open disclosure in health service by end of JuneFormer Ulster Farmers Union president elected as Sinn F\u0026eacutein backs Fine Gael candidateCrevan Mackin prescribed cocktail of drugs at time of Garda Tony Golden murderGroup to examine how CervicalCheck dealt with their cases and report back to HSESam Coulter-Smith calls for urgent review of outsourcing of Irish tests to US companiesEmployer group says Ministers must hold firm line on pay even if it means strikesPresident, who returns from visit to US on Saturday, says \u0026lsquoultimately\u0026rsquo the people will decide"},{"url":null,"title":"bertie ahern abruptly ends interview after being questioned on mahon tribunal","story":"  April 21, 2018Former taoiseach \u0026lsquohappy\u0026rsquo he cleared his name after allegations he received payments   April 22, 2018Fianna F\u0026aacuteil leader praises former taoiseach\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquotireless work for peace\u0026rsquo in Northern Ireland "},{"url":null,"title":"cork looks set to go to the wire in referendum on eight amendment","story":"  April 28, 2018Both sides in abortion referendum believe they have the edge.

Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3476904.1524855004!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"six decades on a ray of light reaches franco s resting place","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tLawyer Eduardo Ranz, with  family members of Spanish Civil War victims who want their dead relatives exhumed, at the entrance of the Basilica of the Valley of the Fallen. Photograph: Juan MedinaThe monument known as the Valley of the Fallen, containing the body of the dictator Francisco Franco, has barely been touched since its completion in 1959. But that may be about to change.Last Monday, a group of relatives of men who were also buried at the site gathered at its entrance amid a swarm of TV cameras and photographers. These people have registered requests for the bodies of their loved ones to be dug up in order to be given a decent burial elsewhere.A team of experts entered the site and carried out preliminary checks to see if a search for the bodies in question is feasible.Eduardo Ranz, the young lawyer representing the families, described it as a historic day.“It’s the biggest mass grave in Spain, ” he told The . “This place is outside the bounds of democracy.”Situated in a wooded area 60km north of Madrid, the Valley of the Fallen is Spain’s biggest and most controversial reminder of its 1936-1939 civil war and the four-decade dictatorship that followed. Its construction began after the war ended and republican prisoners who had fought against Franco were used to build it.The monument’s centrepiece is a 150m-high stone cross. Beneath it is a basilica, drilled deep into the mountainside at the end of which lies the tomb of Franco, who died in 1975, just a few steps away from the main altar.On either side of the tomb, the remains of 33,700 people killed in the civil war lie grouped together in boxes in underground crypts, most of them unidentified. It is from these crypts that those gathered on Monday want to find and exhume their relatives.For Rosa Gil, the granddaughter of one of those buried there, the opening-up of the basilica to the team of experts was “a day of hope and happiness”.Her grandfather, Pedro Gil Calonge, died in 1937 in northern Spain, fighting for Franco. But his remains were exhumed from a cemetery in Zaragoza in the early 1960s and transferred to the Valley of the Fallen without his family being informed, as part of an initiative to make the site a cemetery for victims of the civil war.Rosa says that when her father, Silvino Gil, who had been a pro-Franco politician, found out the truth a few years ago, he said: “Why should Franco be able to move my father’s body?”The families of eight men whose bodies were moved to the Valley of the Fallen are now hoping to get them exhumed, although initially only four are being searched for. The fact that the eight are from both sides of the civil war – six were leftist republicans and two fought for Franco’s right-wing nationalists – reflects the potentially groundbreaking nature of this case.It was put in motion in May of 2016, when a court authorised the exhumation from the Valley of the Fallen of two republican brothers, Manuel and Antonio Ramiro Lapeña, at the request of the former’s granddaughter. Other requests followed.However, the prior of the Benedictine monastery at the Valley of the Fallen, Santiago Cantera, refused to open the crypt, blocking the procedure. The families hoping to exhume their relatives filed a legal complaint against Cantera for disobeying a court order. The standoff was resolved last month, when Archbishop Ricardo Blázquez, chairman of the Spanish Episcopal Conference, stepped in.The legacy of the civil war and the ensuing dictatorship has long been a thorny issue. In 2007, the then-Socialist government introduced a historical memory law, which included the removal of public symbols of Franco and his regime. But although statues of the dictator and street signs bearing his name and those of his officials were taken down, many symbols remain and no steps were taken with regard to the Valley of the Fallen, which is today visited by tourists and Franco nostalgists.The bodies of over 100,000 victims of Franco from the war and its aftermath lie in unmarked graves across Spain and volunteers who identify and exhume them do not receive state funding.The issue tends to ide Spaniards along political lines, with those on the left more inclined to favour tackling the historical memory issue and those on the right often warning such an approach risks reopening old wounds.It is still early days and the forensic experts might yet decide that locating the bodies in the Valley of the Fallen will be too difficult. The lawyer, Eduardo Ranz, urged caution, but said he and his clients are prepared to wait.“The work will be completed when the families can give their loved ones a dignified burial,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

In practice, this means the infection is resistant to all commonly used antibiotics.The figures have emerged as Lord O\u0027Neill, the former Goldman Sachs banker who led a government-commissioned review into superbugs, accuses senior ministers of a lack of leadership on the issue. Lord O’Neill, former commercial secretary to the Treasury, said the Prime Minister, Theresa May, had allowed the issue to fade and that actions promised had not been taken.Lord O\u0026#39Neill has urged senior ministers to do more to tackle the threat of superbugs“It is disappointing to see that the UK government’s global and national efforts to fight AMR seem to have faded, he saidWriting exclusively for the  Lord O’Neill said that the UK was once seen as a leader in the field but that May had allowed the issue to slide.“The government should put this part of \u0027global Britain\u0027 back at the top of its priorities,” he writes. “There has been a lot of talk, but no action.Lord O’Neill’s review warned that if left unchecked antibiotic resistance would kill 10 million people and the world economy could lose up to $100 trillion by 2050.Antibiotic resistance | The true cost in Britain and around the worldOfficial figures suggest antimicrobial resistance claims the lives of 5,000 people a year in the UK, though experts have argued the real figure is at least double that. Getting global figures on the problem is difficult but reliable estimates suggest 700,000 are already dying each year – one person a minute.Lord O’Neill also attacked the major pharmaceutical companies for doing little to counter the problem, despite signing up to the Davos Declaration in 2015, where they pledged to combat the threat.He wrote: “Since then, no major pharmaceutical company has taken any fresh action.”Lord O’Neill said that since investigating the issue the number of reports of antibiotic resistance was rising faster and “in more places than we ever dreamt of.”.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}There has been a lot of talk, but no action.Lord O\u0026#x27NeillIn addition to the ‘super gonorrhoea’ case the PHE figures, obtained under a Freedom of Information request, show 29 people suffered from pan-drug-resistant-infections from Pseudomonas bacteria.Pseudomonas is a bug often found in soil or water (hospital sinks are tested for it) that usually affects people with a weaker immune system such as cancer patients, newborn babies, people with diabetes or patients with severe burns.Up to 11 per cent of Pseudomonas bacteria are now resistant to ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic commonly used in combination with others.A further six patients suffered pan-drug-resistant Klebsiella infections. New antibiotics to treat multi-drug-resistant Klebsiella infections were introduced last year in light of rising resistance, said Professor Peter Hawkey, a public health and bacteriology expert at the University of Birmingham. But they don’t work against every strain, he said.Antibiotic resistance | Global consumption fuels spread of superbugsProf Hawkey added that the cases show antimicrobial resistance is not a hypothetical or future threat but a real one currently affecting patients in British hospitals.These are organisms which are resistant to most antibiotics and then you’re in a tricky place, he said. The threat is very real. These figures are a wake up call,” he said.The pan-resistant infections recorded by PHE were from gram negative bacteria: rod-shaped bugs with thinner cell walls than their gram positive counterparts.Gram negative bacteria, some of which live in the human gut, are fast becoming resistant to antibiotics and are known as an emerging global threat. The government aims to halve the number of healthcare-associated gram-negative bloodstream infections by 2021.Prof Hawkey said pan-drug-resistant-infections are much more common in other areas of the world with lax surveillance and poor infection control, and these will spread to Britain.He said: With huge movement in populations people are coming back to the UK with these bugs in their guts. If you get it and you’re given the wrong antibiotic, you will die.Dr Susan Hopkins, deputy director for AMR and healthcare acquired infections at Public Health England, said: “While there is only a small number of bacteria identified that were resistant to a number of treatments in recent years, they serve as an example of the threat antibiotic resistance poses to public health.Madlen Davies is a reporter with the Bureau of Investigative JournalismProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Kim Jong-un: North Korea to allow foreign experts to witness nuclear site closure in MayDonald Trump says he will meet Kim Jong-un in \u0026#39next three to four weeks\u0026#39Peers to decide on ‘no Brexit’ amendment to remove Government’s power to negotiate with BrusselsThousands protest for third day in Pamplona over \u0026#39wolf pack\u0026#39 gang rape caseEd Balls Day: Star Wars actor Mark Hamill joins in the fun on TwitterRevealed: The local election Labour candidates with criminal recordsRussian Twitter \u0026#39bots\u0026#39 attempted to influence election by supporting Jeremy Corbyn, investigation findsWhat will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0026#39s titles be after their wedding?What\u0026#39s in a name?

It is also one of the Duke of Cambridge\u0027s own middle names.Kensington Palace said: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are delighted to announce that they have named their son Louis Arthur Charles.The baby will be known as His Royal Highness Prince Louis of Cambridge.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge showing their third child to the world outside the Lindo Wing on MondayThe name is a significant tribute to the Royal Family, with the newborn Prince sharing names in common with his brother Prince George Alexander Louis, his father Prince William Arthur Philip Louis, and his grandfather Prince Charles Philip Arthur George.Kensington Palace announced the name of the Royal couple\u0027s third child, who was born on Monday at 11.01am weighing 8lb 7oz.The Duke and Duchess will have shared the name with the Queen and the rest of their family before making it public.The announcement had been eagerly anticipated since the couple showed off their new son to the world on the steps of the exclusive maternity unit, the Lindo Wing, on Monday evening.Popularity of the boys\u0027 name Louis since 1904Since then, the Duke and Duchess have been kept busy settling in to life as a family of five at Kensington Palace.Born fifth in line, the baby is the Queen and Philip\u0027s sixth great-grandchild and Kensington Palace said the couple, along with the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, Prince Harry, and the Middletons, were delighted with the news of the new arrival. The Duke of Cambridge joined his brother Prince Harry and soon-to-be sister-in-law Meghan Markle at Westminster Abbey for an Anzac Day service on Wednesday afternoon.But the topic of conversation quickly turned to the new Prince.It\u0027s a boy Celebrating the Royal baby - in picturesAsked how the Duchess and the baby were doing, Prince William said: They\u0027re very well thanks.The now father of three said they are in good form, luckily, and added: Sleeping\u0027s going reasonably well so far, so he\u0027s behaving himself which is good news.Prince William greets his brother Harry\u0026#39s fiancee Meghan Markle as they arrive for an Anzac Day service at Westminster Abbey A delighted Prince of Wales welcomed the birth of his third grandchild, saying it was a “great joy”.Speaking for himself and the Duchess of Cornwall, presumably with a twinkle in his eye, he said: “We are both so pleased at the news.  “It is a great joy to have another grandchild, the only trouble is I don’t know how I am going to keep up with them.”The Prince is now a grandfather to Prince George, four, Princess Charlotte, who will turn three on May 2, and the baby boy.The Prince of Wales already has two grandchildren in Prince George and Princess Charlotte, pictured arriving at the Lindo WingThe Duchess of Cornwall also has five grandchildren who are regular visitors to their home, with the Prince said to delight in reading the youngsters stories.The Prince’s words chimed perfectly with those of his son the Duke, who had held up three fingers - one for each of his children - when departing from hospital and laughed that he had “thrice the worry now”.The Duke of Cambridge holds up three fingers as he tells the media he has \u0026#39thrice the worry now\u0026#39 as he leaves the Lindo Wing Louis was the first name of the Prince of Wales\u0027 beloved great-uncle Earl Mountbatten of Burma.Charles will be touched that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge decided to pay tribute to Lord Mountbatten, who was murdered by the IRA in 1979, by naming their son Prince Louis.The name, also one of Prince George\u0027s middle names, is French and German in origin and means renowned warrior.Louis was the 71st most popular name in England and Wales, according to the latest available figures from the Office for National Statistics.In 2016, just 911 boys were given the name Louis in England and Wales.It was more popular in the early 2000s when it ranked around 39th, but was not popular throughout the 20th century.Louis has been the name of many rulers across the world, including 18 kings of France.Lord Louis Mountbatten pictured in 1977, two years before he was murdered by the IRAFamous people named Louis include pop star Louis Tomlinson from One Direction and jazz trumpeter Louis Armstrong.Lord Louis Mountbatten was also the Duke of Edinburgh\u0027s uncle and the brother of Philip\u0027s mother Princess Alice.He was the last British Viceroy of India before independence in 1947.He was very close to Charles but Uncle Dickie, as he was known in the family, was assassinated by the IRA in August 1979.His boat was blown up on a fishing trip off the coast of County Sligo in the Republic of Ireland.Prince George and Princess Charlotte had already been introduced to the new baby at St Mary’s Hospital and were likely being eased into their new roles as big brother and middle sister in their own home on Tuesday.Pippa Matthews, the first visitor seen driving into the Palace, spent several hours with her sister, the Duchess, and infant nephew before being photographed driving away.Pippa Middleton pictured leaving Kensington Palace on Tuesday afternoonParents Carole and Michael Middleton were unlikely to have been far away, famously supportive of the Duke and Duchess and their growing brood.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, too, could surely not have kept away from joining the first eager visitors, living just next door and both adoring children.The Prince once called George and Charlotte “the most amazing things ever”.The Queen, who was in Windsor, is unlikely to meet her sixth great-grandchild imminently, with further duties at the castle on Wednesday, while the Duke of Edinburgh is recuperating privately from a hip replacement operation.The Queen horse riding at Windsor on Monday before the latest Royal baby was bornThe Prince of Wales, who was on Tuesday travelling to France in time for a dawn service to commemorate the Battle of Villers-Bretonneux on Anzac Day, will pay his first visit to hold the baby on his return from duty.Other family members earlier remained tight-lipped about the baby\u0027s name. The Countess of Wessex, who was conducting a string of engagements near Truro, Cornwall, said during a visit to Tregolls School on Tuesday: “I’m thrilled for them all, it’s lovely - really good news.”Asked about the baby’s name, she added tactfully: “The jury’s out on that one. I don’t know, we’re all just going to have to wait and see.”Sophie, Countess of Wessex meets pupils during a visit to a school in Truro on TuesdayAs the outside world clamoured for details, the Duke and Duchess appeared to simply get on with life: with two older children, even with the help of a nanny, they could hardly do less.The Duke, sporting a light stubble, was seen driving out of Kensington Palace on Tuesday afternoon, on an unidentified errand.Prince William leaves Kensington Palace by car on Tuesday afternoonOfficial celebrations were already under way, with the bells of Westminster Abbey ringing out from 1pm and gun salutes fired in London at 2pm.The soldiers, horses and Guns of The King\u0027s Troop Royal Horse Artillery rode out from Wellington Barracks into Hyde Park for a 41 round salute, and the Honourable Artillery Company (HAC), the City of London\u0027s Army Reserve regiment, fired a 62-round Gun Salute from The Tower of London.Video: Moment royal birth was marked by gun salutesThe baby joy extended not just to the Royal Family and avid monarchists.A young politan Police constable, Tyler O\u0027Hare, who took centre stage during the Royal baby\u0027s first public appearance outside the Lindo Wing was also celebrating.Sharing pictures of himself sternly keeping them safe by standing guard, he wrote on Twitter: “An honour and utter privilege to have been the ‘Door Officer’ for the birth of Their Royal Highnesses new baby boy!“Today was an amazing day and a highlight of my career!”The official commemorative souvenirs marking the birth of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s baby son have gone on sale - before the new prince\u0027s name had been announced.Featuring a lion cub and unicorn inspired by the Royal Arms, the Royal Collection china is decorated with gold ribbons, silver pompoms and a coronet-inspired pattern.The pieces bear the words Welcome to our new royal baby and display William and Kate\u0027s coronet.The range of official commemorative chinaware to celebrate the prince\u0026#39s birth The official range includes a pillbox costing £35, a tankard for £39 and a plate priced at £49.Each item in the range is gilded with 22-carat gold and made in Stoke-on-Trent using traditional methods.There is also a pram-shaped woven decoration, made with glistening threads, delicate pearl detail, and embroidered on the back with Royal Baby 2018, for £14.95.Duchess of CambridgePlease review our commenting policyKim Jong-un: North Korea to allow foreign experts to witness nuclear site closure in MayDonald Trump says he will meet Kim Jong-un in \u0026#39next three to four weeks\u0026#39Peers to decide on ‘no Brexit’ amendment to remove Government’s power to negotiate with BrusselsThousands protest for third day in Pamplona over \u0026#39wolf pack\u0026#39 gang rape caseEd Balls Day: Star Wars actor Mark Hamill joins in the fun on TwitterRevealed: The local election Labour candidates with criminal recordsRussian Twitter \u0026#39bots\u0026#39 attempted to influence election by supporting Jeremy Corbyn, investigation findsWhat will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0026#39s titles be after their wedding?What\u0026#39s in a name?

Indeed they say it has already had a detrimental impact on rare breeds such as the Mediterranean Gull, curlews and lapwings.Mr Allaway estimates the number of visitors arriving by boat has risen from 40 a day, to around 200, with a significant increase in kayakers and paddleboarders.They predict recent moves by the trust to promote Newtown as a visitor attraction - a large poster urging people to “explore” the reserve greets arrivals at Lymington Ferry Terminal a bear hunts for children have been organised at the site - will only exacerbate the problem.Mr Allaway said: “Our concern is that over promoting it and over commercialising it will only lead to its destruction by the sheer number of visitors who will come. The number of people who visit needs to be carefully controlled. The more publicity there is the more people will come, with visitors cutting through the woods and driving away wildlife such as owls, lizards and nightingales.“Mediterranean Gulls have recently started breeding in the lagoon, but they will be under threat from any further increase in visitor numbers and from growing numbers of dog walkers.”A view of Newtown Nature Reserve on the Isle of Wight Matters came to a head when the National Trust30. unveiled plans to refurbish the nature reserve’s visitor centre, which Mr Allaway and Ms Gwynn said had the effect of sidelining a much loved mural by local artist Anne TomsThe pair say the refurbishment was symptomatic of a tendency by the trust to excessively commercialise attractions to the detriment of the unique environment that makes them so appealing in the first place.“After we objected to their plans for the new visitor centre we were told that our services were no longer required as we were ‘contrary to their values’. It was particularly upsetting for Val, who has been associated with the trust for 30 years. It’s sent shockwaves through the community here.”The National Trust defended its plans for Newtown National Nature Reserve, - the only such reserve on the island - saying they would protect the site while still making it attractive for visitors, But it admitted it had faced opposition from volunteers and that its relationship with two of them had “broken down”.A black headed gull at Newtown Nature ReserveThe charity said: “Our absolute priority is – and has always been – to ensure wildlife can thrive at this special habitat and that people can continue to enjoy visiting it. We recently proposed some minor changes to the existing workshop space on the site, which will include a basic reception point where visitors are able to find information about the nature reserve and make themselves a hot drink. It’s clearly not a commercial venture and would have little impact on revenues.”It added: “We always appreciate honest views about our plans, and on this occasion we did have some opposition from a group of volunteers. We invited them several times for discussions to listen to their concerns and to reassure them that we would never do anything to compromise conservation.”“Unfortunately, we eventually reached a point with two iniduals where the relationship had completely broken down and we felt it was in the interest of both parties to go our separate ways.”A board showing recent bird sightings at Newton Nature ReserveIsle of WightKim Jong-un: North Korea to allow foreign experts to witness nuclear site closure in MayDonald Trump says he will meet Kim Jong-un in \u0026#39next three to four weeks\u0026#39Peers to decide on ‘no Brexit’ amendment to remove Government’s power to negotiate with BrusselsThousands protest for third day in Pamplona over \u0026#39wolf pack\u0026#39 gang rape caseEd Balls Day: Star Wars actor Mark Hamill joins in the fun on TwitterRevealed: The local election Labour candidates with criminal recordsRussian Twitter \u0026#39bots\u0026#39 attempted to influence election by supporting Jeremy Corbyn, investigation findsWhat will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0026#39s titles be after their wedding?What\u0026#39s in a name?

The witness, who was a passenger in another car, filmed Patel as the car drove past.Witness accounts stated that traffic was heavy due to congestion and it has been estimated that the vehicle was travelling at approximately 40mph at the time.Footage of the incident was first posted on social media before it was reported to police and a Notice of Intended Prosecution was then sent to Patel in the post.He was later interviewed by officers at Stevenage Police Station, where he admitted that he knew what he had done was \u0027silly\u0027, but that the car was capable of something \u0027amazing\u0027 and that he was just the \u0027unlucky one who got caught\u0027.As part of the investigation, officers obtained a statement from a Tesla engineer who described autopilot as a \u0027suite of driver assistance features\u0027.They stated that these are hands-on features intended to provide assistance to a \u0027fully-attentive driver\u0027.Traffic-Aware Cruise Control (TACC) assists with acceleration and deceleration of the vehicle whilst Autosteer provides assistance with steering of the vehicle.Further literature provided by Tesla states that drivers should \u0027never depend on TACC to adequately slow down model S, always watch the road in front of you and be prepared to take corrective action at all times. Failure to do so can result in serious injury or death\u0027.Investigating officer PC Kirk Caldicutt, from the Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Hertfordshire Road Policing Unit, said: What Patel did was grossly irresponsible and could have easily ended in tragedy. He not only endangered his own life but the lives of other innocent people using the motorway on that day.History of TeslaThis case should serve as an example to all drivers who have access to autopilot controls and have thought about attempting something similar. I want to stress that they are in no way a substitute for a competent motorist in the driving seat who can react appropriately to the road ahead.I hope Patel uses his disqualification period to reflect on why he chose to make such a reckless decision on that day.In addition to his 18-month disqualification, Patel was given 100 hours unpaid work, ordered to carry out 10 days rehabilitation and pay £1,800 in costs to the Crown Prosecution Service.Kim Jong-un: North Korea to allow foreign experts to witness nuclear site closure in MayDonald Trump says he will meet Kim Jong-un in \u0026#39next three to four weeks\u0026#39Peers to decide on ‘no Brexit’ amendment to remove Government’s power to negotiate with BrusselsThousands protest for third day in Pamplona over \u0026#39wolf pack\u0026#39 gang rape caseEd Balls Day: Star Wars actor Mark Hamill joins in the fun on TwitterRevealed: The local election Labour candidates with criminal recordsRussian Twitter \u0026#39bots\u0026#39 attempted to influence election by supporting Jeremy Corbyn, investigation findsWhat will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0026#39s titles be after their wedding?What\u0026#39s in a name?

Yoon quoted Kim as saying.North Korea this month announced it has suspended all tests of nuclear devices and intercontinental ballistic missiles and plans to close its nuclear testing ground.Kim reacted to skepticism that the North would only be closing down the northernmost test tunnel at the site in Punggye-ri, which some analysts say became too unstable to conduct further underground detonations following the country\u0027s sixth and most powerful nuclear test in September.In his conversation with Moon, Kim denied that he would be merely clearing out damaged goods, saying that the site also has two new tunnels that are larger than previous testing facilities, Yoon said.Yoon said Kim also revealed plans to re-adjust its current time zone to match the South\u0027s.Korean detente How did we get here?The Koreas used the same time zone for decades before the North in 2015 created its own Pyongyang Time by setting the clock 30 minutes behind South Korea and Japan.North Korean then explained the decision as an effort to remove a legacy of Japanese colonial rule. Local time in South Korea and Japan is the same - nine hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time. It was set during Japan\u0027s rule over the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945.Yoon said that the North\u0027s decision to return to the Seoul time zone was aimed at facilitating communication with South Korea and also the United States. Mr Kim\u0027s comments were revealed as Mr Trump told a campaign-style rally that a meeting with the North Korean leader could happen over the next three to four weeks.U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally in Washington Township, Michigan With the region cautiously welcoming the summit on Friday, the US president discussed the developments with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Saturday during a 30-minute phone call.The leaders welcomed the inter-Korean summit as a positive move for denuclearisation and a historical step towards peace and stability in northeast Asia, Mr Abe\u0027s office said on Sunday.However, Trump said he would maintain pressure on Pyongyang through sanctions ahead of his own unprecedented meeting with the North Korean leader.Mr Abe and Mr Trump also agreed on the importance of concrete steps towards denuclearisation by Pyongyang, the Japanese premier\u0027s office said in a statement.The important thing is whether North Korea will take specific actions in the future, Mr Abe told reporters late on Saturday, according to remarks released by his office.Please review our commenting policyDonald Trump says he will meet Kim Jong-un in \u0026#39next three to four weeks\u0026#39Peers to decide on ‘no Brexit’ amendment to remove Government’s power to negotiate with BrusselsThousands protest for third day in Pamplona over \u0026#39wolf pack\u0026#39 gang rape caseEd Balls Day: Star Wars actor Mark Hamill joins in the fun on TwitterRevealed: The local election Labour candidates with criminal recordsRussian Twitter \u0026#39bots\u0026#39 attempted to influence election by supporting Jeremy Corbyn, investigation findsWhat will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0026#39s titles be after their wedding?What\u0026#39s in a name?

Flybe said it cancelled 994 flights in the three months to 31 March, compared to 372 in the same period last year.Sky News, which first broke the story, said it was unclear how the shock merger could be structured or whether it would be approved by regulator the Competition and Markets Authority.Companies can discuss prospective mergers with the regulator in advance, or it can initiate investigations up to four months after any deal is announced.The CMA has the power to demand changes by firms and ultimately block mergers, although companies normally find a solution or scrap plans before that stage.Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable said the possible merger threatens to create “even more concentrated local monopolies”.The grocery market - and the British shopper - already suffers from the mid-market being dominated by just a handful of big players,“ he added.It is obvious that there must be an investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority.A representative of US-owned Asda declined to comment on the claims.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Possibly complicating matters was the fact that Denzel Washington was sitting next to him at the table.“When someone says you’re like your idol,” Jordan said, “It’s like: ‘Really? You see that in me?’ I’d only done that one movie. But then I started using it as motivation,” he said. “I wanted to pop up on Denzel’s radar. He’s the OG. If I could get recognition from him, I know I’m going down the right path, you know?”Denzel: We’re only getting further apart in this technological ageFinally, Washington broke in with a booming laugh: “And here we are, Mike! Looks like it’s working out already,” he said.In truth, it would be hard for an actor to choose a better role model than Washington. In a career ning more than 40 years and 50 films – and kicked off by the hit TV drama St Elsewhere – Washington, 63, has been nominated for nine Academy Awards. He won twice: for best actor as a terrifying rogue cop in Training Day and for best supporting actor as a Union soldier in an African-American army unit in Glory. And he was nominated for best actor Oscars in both of the past two years.Jordan (left, with Kevin Durand) in the 2013’s ‘Fruitvale Station’ (Weinstein Company)In the past decade, Washington has ruled the stage, too. He won a Tony Award for best actor in the revival of August Wilson’s Fences in 2010, later directing and starring in an Oscar-nominated film version. He led the acclaimed revival of A Raisin in the Sun in 2014. And today (26 April), he will open again on Broadway in a revival of Eugene O’Neill’s play The Iceman Cometh, a searing and (at four hours long) monumental drama about the lies we tell ourselves to get through life.Like Washington, Jordan, 31, got his big break on television: on HBO’s The Wire, when he was just 15. After his heartbreaking performance in Fruitvale Station, about the last day in the life of a transit-police shooting victim, he starred in the popular Rocky reboot Creed. And this year, he played the villain, Erik Killmonger, in the Marvel juggernaut Black Panther, winning perhaps the best reviews of anyone in the extremely well-reviewed cast.Next month, he stars in Fahrenheit 451 on HBO, a dystopian film based on the novel by Ray Bradbury. Jordan plays a “fireman,” part of a state-sanctioned brigade that hunts down readers and burns books. His company, Outlier Society Productions, is one of the film’s producers and also among the first to adopt inclusion riders, requiring ersity among cast and crew, as called for by Frances McDormand from the stage of this year’s Academy Awards.Over a cocktail hour at the Lambs Club in Manhattan (a Diet Coke for Washington, a sauvignon blanc for Jordan), the actors traded notes about creating characters and the socially minded work that really matters to them. These are excerpts from the conversation.Galanes: If Mike reminds people of a young Denzel, who did young Denzel remind people of?Washington: I never saw it that way. I never even thought about movie stars. My goal was to be on Broadway, to earn $650 a week. My hero was James Earl Jones. And I came to acting green. I was taking pre-law courses, then journalism courses. Then I took an acting class and got bit by the bug. So I came down to Lincoln Centre and saw plays and stage actors.Galanes: But all those things you did – law, journalism, acting – they’re all about getting to the bottom of a story, right?Washington: I like that part: building a character. You start with the material that gives you clues. If you’re playing a boxer, you want to throw out punches. If you’re playing a conductor, you want to get on a train.Galanes: And the script?Washington: Sure, but you don’t know who the character is just by reading the script. I don’t read a script and go, “Now, I get it!” That’s just the beginning. The first thread you pull.Jordan: The script tells you what’s going up on screen. But the biggest part, the fun part, is figuring out what happened to that character before page one of the script. What kind of food does he like? Did he get into fights going to school? That back story determines the choices you make within the confines of the script. And going through that process with the director is a big part of the collaboration. Now I’ve got notebooks and notebooks of back stories. Some directors may want you to add something or change your version. That’s when you try to find common ground.Washington won an Oscar for his role as rogue cop Alonzo in 2001’s ‘Training Day’ (Warner Bros)Galanes: Is that why you’ve both worked with directors repeatedly? Mike with Ryan Coogler Denzel with Spike Lee and Antoine Fuqua. Your common ground?Washington (laughing): Maybe they’re the ones who called. What you’re saying is part of it, but I don’t think it’s just one way.Jordan: Those are the roles I was lucky enough to get. Ryan and I have worked together three times, and I have a really close relationship with him. But I said no to lots of other things with other people in between. They weren’t right. Personally, I think you’re defined by what you say no to.Washington: I say yes to everything!Galanes: Why do I doubt that? Managing a career as big as yours must take a lot of work.Washington: Not now. Maybe early on. Now, I just do what I want to do. And you don’t want to walk down the same road twice. I’m sure after doing Iceman Cometh, I won’t be looking to do another play.Washington: Yeah, not for a while.Galanes: You’re too young to remember this, Mike. But early in his career, Denzel was so beloved for playing good guys – in Glory and Cry Freedom – that we all freaked out when he started playing villains: in Training Day, American Gangster. And he was even better at bad guys! Was that about walking down different roads?Playing Killmonger (right) in ‘Black Panther’ brought rave reviews for Jordan (MarvelDisney)Jordan: So much trickles down from the director. That’s why I try to choose the ones who make the best environments to work in, so we can maybe make something as good as Training Day. You don’t want to go into a project with somebody who won’t be helpful to your process – or vice versa.Galanes: I read this funny thing about you, Mike: you started choosing projects where you wouldn’t die in the end?Jordan: It started with my mom, who’s super emotional. When I shot my death scene in The Wire, she was on set. And the PAs kept coming to me and saying: ‘You may want to check on your mom.’ I go see her, and she’s sitting there bawling. I’m just a kid. I’m going, ‘Come on, Ma. You’re embarrassing me.’ And after Fruitvale Station, I was like, ‘Man, this is really affecting her.’ But there was another thing, too. Look at Denzel’s career. I want people to see me win. I want audiences to see me ending up on top – not dying. I want to be the leading man.Washington: Man, I got underwear older than that.Jordan: That was the real thought process: How do I become a leading man? I know phenomenal actors who can’t open movies overseas. How do you become the guy who can carry a film?Washington: So, you study the game?Galanes Is that why you went down the superhero route?Galanes You probably made up for it with Black Panther. Why no superheroes for you, Denzel?Galanes: Superheroes have changed. When Denzel might have played one, they were dull. The villains were interesting: Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger. Like you in Black Panther, Mike.Washington: When I was a teenager, Shaft and Super Fly, those were our superheroes. I remember watching Super Fly with my boy Carl, and when we got back to the projects, he carved the character’s name – Priest – on the elevator door. And Richard Roundtree in those long leather coats in Shaft.Galanes: Both of your new projects are dark. Iceman Cometh is brutal. And in Fahrenheit 451, competing ideas are so scary that people decide to burn all the books and kill the readers. Why choose them now?27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 Galanes: It’s powerful to watch a black man in your role.Jordan: But it wasn’t all there on the page. I needed to make sure that he was willing to collaborate, to change some things to help me, as a black man, feel more comfortable in that role. And my company’s co-producing it alongside HBO was important to me too. This is my first time working with the director and the network, giving my opinion and hoping that it’s taken seriously.Washington (laughing): Getting your big boy voice.Galanes Like coming back to the stage, Denzel?Washington: Yeah. Then we boiled it down to Iceman and King Lear. And he said: ‘Let’s do Lear five years from now.’ I said: “OK, we’ll do that next – God willing.”Washington: Eugene O’Neill. That simple. The chance to interpret his brilliant material. You know, my first role on stage, when I was a student at Fordham, was in The Emperor Jones. I’ve always loved O’Neill. And here I am, 40 years later, coming back to him in Iceman.Galanes: Your character, Hickey, seems like the life of the party at first, but what a tortured soul he turns out to be. What drew you to him?Washington: His desire to see people happy. Even when he knows he can’t make that happen, that desire is still there in him.Galanes: It’s a mountain of a play – four hours long. Is it hard to maintain that intensity every night?‘Fahrenheit 451’ sees Jordan plays a ‘fireman’, part of a state-sanctioned brigade that hunts down readers and burns books (HBO)Washington: Listen, this is what I love: acting on stage. And I don’t have to do anything else. Just be in this play. So, don’t feel sorry for me compared to most workers in America.Galanes: Is theatre on your radar, Mike?Jordan: Down the line. But right now, I want to take care of my family financially and grow my production company. That’s the big thing I want to do: set my family up.Jordan: As a kid, you don’t see your circumstances. I didn’t. It’s not until you look back and think, ‘Man, we were poor!’ My parents really hid that from me. They kept me safe.Washington: It wasn’t that tough. I was having a good time. A lot of my boys went to prison.Jordan: That’s why I want to take care of my family now. Then let me go and work on my craft, do something to fulfil me on the inside. That’s what I think theatre is going to be for me – when I’m older. What do you love about it, Denzel?Washington: The energy from the audience is immediate. And you get to develop a full life. See, in film, you might shoot the end first, then the middle. But on stage, it’s the full score of the character’s life. And you always get another night.Washington: In film, you don’t get another night to shoot a scene. You can try to fix it in other scenes. But film is a director’s medium. Theatre is for actors. We’re directed, but once the curtain goes up, it belongs to us. And every night’s as different as the audience. Some nights, they cheer the whole way through others, they don’t cheer at all.Galanes: Let me shift gears. We’re living through a time right now where men in power who’ve done ugly things –Washington: No. We’re not ‘living through a time right now’. It’s always been this way, from the beginning of time. Pick one: from Caesar to Caligula. Now, it’s just on the news cycle every 15 seconds.Jordan: And opinion is now fact – because anyone with a Twitter handle can say it.Washington: It doesn’t even have to be true it just has to be first.Galanes: Hang on, I’m asking something different: Based on your years as a powerful figure, why do you think some guys turn to ugly behaviour, and others don’t?Washington: Nobody’s perfect, man. Don’t put me on a pedestal, if that’s what you’re trying to do. I’m just a human being. I made mistakes I’ll make some more. Hopefully, you learn from them. My mother always said, ‘Keep it simple.’ The older I get, the more I understand her: cut away the fat. When you’re younger, you want to see, taste, touch.Washington (laughing): There you have it. But when you get to be my age, you learn you don’t have to. I have a beautiful wife, beautiful children, a great job. What more do I need?Jordan: And people like us, actors of colour, we don’t get a lot of second chances. It’s a different type of scrutiny. Knowing it’s not all fair and equal, you’ve got to make smart decisions in the moment.Washington: I remember going home one time and saying to my mother, ‘Hey, Ma, did you ever think that I...’ And she said: ‘Stop right there! Do you know all the people who’ve been praying for your raggedy butt?’ You don’t get there by yourself.Jordan: That’s crazy! I was just thinking: I’m going to church in the morning – because I know the people there have always prayed for me. Their blessings have protected me from terrible situations. That’s how I think about keeping it simple: remembering where it started – that village, that tribe that kept you safe.Galanes: And it was 38 years between Sidney Poitier’s Oscar for best actor and yours.Galanes: How about opportunities for people of colour?Washington: That’s why I’m here! That’s why I’m still in the race. And I’m passing the baton. What a lot of people don’t know is: when you pass the baton, you keep running behind the other runner, you don’t just stop. I’m like, ‘Make the turn, bring it home!’ I like helping people. I want to see them do well.Black Panther star reveals Denzel Washington paid for his acting classDenzel schools journalist with response to \u0027fake news\u0027 questionHow to stop Denzel Washington stealing your sceneJordan: That’s why I want to produce so much. I like creating opportunities for people.Galanes: You were right out of the gate on inclusion riders, Mike. The first to say, ‘My company guarantees that casts and crews will be erse.’Jordan: That’s super important to me. No matter what community we’re talking about. Everybody should be in a position where they can win.Washington: I’m just wired that way.Jordan: My path is my path. I can’t take nothing away from nobody, and nobody can take nothing away from me. I’m running my race. But we can still encourage each other.Washington: What’s the harm in that? You’ll never see a U-Haul behind a hearse.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

I see it as a huge big exercise of trust and I do believe everyone breathed a sigh of relief’A bus stop and red post box stand in the border town of Jonesborough, Co ArmaghEarlier this week a cache of documents from the Northern Irish government were leaked, including a report on the Brexit negotiations written by two experts from Queen’s University Belfast.It asked whether avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland – which the UK has committed to – would mean “backdoor access” for people into Britain.The experts concluded that keeping the border open would indeed mean “backdoor access … is inevitable”, a reality which may be pushing UK negotiators to build better access for EU citizens into their offer anyway.Avoiding a hard border in Ireland also has implications for customs arrangements between the EU and UK in the future, with Brussels adamant it must mean Northern Ireland, and possibly the whole UK, remaining in a customs union.Liam Fox says staying in a customs union would betray Brexit votersMs May’s publicly stated position, that she will take the UK out of any customs union, has been thrown into doubt after home secretary Amber Rudd said on Thursday that the cabinet was still deciding on the matter.Ahead of a meeting at which key ministers will discuss it this Wednesday, cabinet office minister David Lidington said: “We’re very clear that when we leave the European Union we leave the single market and the customs union, but the prime minister has also said that she wants a customs agreement with the European Union.”May ‘may have to bow to parliamentary pressure’ over customs unionTen days ago the government failed to prevent the House of Lords passing a motion that seeks to keep the UK in a customs union, while on Thursday the Commons approved a similar motion without a vote.During the debate, enough Conservative MPs backed the idea of a customs union to potentially defeat the government in a binding vote on the issue expected in coming weeks.But while the new offer on immigration would correlate with the more open Irish border the UK is committed to, and the implicated customs arrangements, it is yet to be approved by the cabinet.Anything which allows a high level of access or preferential treatment for EU citizens is likely to be viewed dimly by Brexiteer ministers like Boris Johnson and Liam Fox, who are seeking a cleaner break from Brussels.Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

In his capacity as head of the CIA, Mr Pompeo travelled to North Korea to lay the groundwork for the high-stakes summit.While Mr Trump has heralded the opportunity for a deal to dismantle North Korea’s nuclear weapons programme, both Mr Bolton and Mr Pompeo have evinced scepticism about the sincerity of North Korea’s motives.In addition to helping prepare the North Korea summit, Mr Pompeo will help the White House navigate a crucial and fast-approaching deadline for the Iran nuclear deal.Mr Trump must decide by mid-May whether to continue lifting sanctions on Iran, as dictated by the pact. Both the president and Mr Pompeo have heaped disdain on the agreement, and Mr Trump said in January that he was agreeing to waive some sanctions “only in order to secure our European allies’ agreement to fix the terrible flaws of the Iran nuclear deal”.“This is a last chance. In the absence of such an agreement, the United States will not again waive sanctions in order to stay in the Iran nuclear deal”, Mr Trump said at the time.During a visit to Washington this week, French president Emmanuel Macron worked to persuade Donald Trump to preserve the deal. But Mr Macron conceded he faced slim odds of succeeding.“My view – I don’t know what your president will decide – is that he will get rid of this deal on his own, for domestic reasons,” Mr Macron told reporters.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The patent pump touched down on the shingle of history. One short waddle for man. But, perhaps, one giant leap into the international bantersphere.We cannot yet know the course on which the world was set, in that portentous moment under the April sun. The lamp of history never lights the path ahead. But the world is nonetheless a brighter place. A new star shines in the firmament. Two wide bottomed black puddings now bestride the narrow world. And the early indications are clear enough: Kim Jong-un is a massive banter lad.That the North Korean leader should have so terrorised neighbours far and near with wild threats of annihilation, and then nipped over the border for a spot of peace-treaty signing is already troubling the mercury on the bants-o-meter, but it’s clear there’s so more to come.Why presence of Kim\u0027s blushing sister could be so significantWhat pulled history back from the tempest of war to the shallows of peace is already a contested matter. Was it eight years of pressure from Obama to apply meaningful economic sanctions to their out-of-control neighbour? Was it Donald Trump calling him “rocketman” on Twitter? Was it that, in scenes Austin Powers didn’t even dare to dream up, his indoor nuclear testing facility now appears to have accidentally blown up the mountain inside which it was meant to be hidden?These are questions to be pored over by the analysts in the coming months, ideally on live TV, as their wives struggle to keep the children bursting in before bedtime like championship wrestlers.In the meantime, what can we know for certain?Well first of all, if you’re prepared to overlook long years of reports of death camps and public execution by anti-aircraft tank, it’s clear that this, the latest and perhaps the last in line of despotic Kim Jongs likes a laugh almost as much as he likes a snack.It had perhaps been imagined that it would peak with his dragging his South Korean counterpart, Moon Jae-in, back over to the dark side of the 38th parallel, for a handshake on his turf that was definitely not in the script, but the lols kept coming.We should celebrate peace in Korea but remain scepticalWhy presence of Kim\u0027s blushing sister could be so significantOff-script moment and missile jokes at Korean border summitKim Jong-un crosses into South Korea for historic meeting North and South prepare for historic Korea summitThe Korea peace talks wouldn\u0027t be happening without TrumpIn what were among the very first words he had ever been heard to say in public, he apologised to the South Korean president for “interrupting your early morning sleep”. At first this was assumed to mean with the various nuclear bombs he has been detonating inside his nearby mountain, but the truth was more prosaic. It was merely that his renegade actions had forced Moon Jae In to have to convene his own National Security Council every time, to discuss the growing likelihood of their own annihilation.Then there was the early morning jog, Kim Jong-style, which is to say, a short ride in a blacked out Mercedes, surrounded by 12 goons, jogging to keep up. At some point, someone may have to tell him, this is not how Keep Fit works.And then, as if nothing in the past 65 years of war had happened, the two men were sitting at a picnic table, set atop what can only be described as turquoise peace decking, chatting like two old friends who’d just bumped into one another in the park.It may be, in the coming months, the world suddenly doesn’t find it all quite so funny.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It was early evening, and we were at a collective shelter in the outskirts of Damascus, waiting for the long lines of buses bringing these families to safety.There was a palpable sense of relief amongst those who were arriving. Many had spent months living in basements, hiding from constant attacks and only venturing out to get what little water and supplies they could find during lulls in the fighting.  Some of these basements were sheltering up to 200 people in humid, cold conditions with only one toilet to share. “We can finally see the sky,” a mother told me as she walked with her daughter, husband and elderly mother towards the room they had been assigned at the shelter. But for many of the 80,000 evacuees, getting here wasn’t straightforward. Eastern Ghouta is made up of several towns and villages under control of various factions that don’t always agree among themselves. For some families, this meant walking through areas where they were shot at or caught amidst fighting. Many only reached me and my colleagues after a journey that took many long hours – if not days. Our teams have been here since the displaced families started arriving at the shelters, making sure people have the water, sanitation, health and protection services they need. Many of these shelters had been identified just days before they were barely prepared to receive such a large number of people. The first weeks were very chaotic.Emergency toilets were being installed, water tanks hoisted on top of roofs, trucks of water and food were ready to be unloaded. There wasn’t enough space in the eight shelters, and some children got separated from their parents in the rush of fleeing from Eastern Ghouta. Aid workers were overwhelmed and limitations on movements between shelters made it hard to reunify families.But as tired and weary parents tried to figure out what to do next, children revelled in their new freedom. School-age girls and boys ran around the crowded shelters using anything and everything as a playground: bundles of blankets were re-purposed as horses or used as jungle gyms to climb on.  I was deeply relieved to hear happy shouts as they played. Last time I met children from Eastern Ghouta was in June 2016. Eastern Ghouta was still under siege and the UN was only able to access the area through convoys to bring in supplies.No child should ever face what those children were going through – violence, loss, deprivation, hunger.Rather than talking about favourite games and friends they told me about adult concerns: how expensive basic foods like bread had become because of the tightening siege (the years of siege meant that food supplies were hard to come by).In January this year, basic items like bread or rice cost ten times more in Eastern Ghouta than elsewhere in the country. But at the shelter, there was no more talk of hunger: “I had a sandwich this morning,” one boy told me, “Back home my mother would make us a soup out of wheat and sugar and that was the one meal we would have in a day.” Another girl asked me with disbelief whether I had seen the price of biscuits in the little shop in the shelter – five times cheaper than in Eastern Ghouta.During the siege, medical care was a huge challenge as well.In one of the shelters I met the mother of 13-year-old Ahmad. He was lying on a mattress at the corner of the room with his head and arm wrapped in bandages. Days before the humanitarian exits were opened, the building where Ahmad’s family lived was hit and the walls of their living room collapsed. Ahmad was under one of these walls. “If his father didn’t see his hand peeking out of the wall, we wouldn’t have found him at all,” says Ahmad’s mother.“There were no hospitals in East Ghouta,” she adds. “When we heard that we could leave, we carried Ahmad on our backs and he was taken to hospital when we arrived at the shelter.” We noticed that when children first arrived, they wouldn’t talk to other children if they were from different communities or towns years of fear and violence made them very weary of other communities. But now, children now participate in art, music or sports activities – forging new friendships to play, share and learn together. Amid the suffering that I witnessed, one thing that filled me with hope was that most school-aged children had at least learned some basic reading and writing skills.Even during the long months of hiding from the fighting in basements in Eastern Ghouta, mothers had set-up community circles for their children to continue learning.Twelve-year-old Shaima told me that for a while, before the schools closed completely because of the fighting, they would go to school at five in the morning and come back to the basements at eight – before the fighting would start. But now they are safe, mothers wanted to know when a school would open in the shelters, eager to ensure their children wouldn’t miss out on their education. Just last week, a school made up of 16 prefabricated classrooms opened its doors in one of the largest collective shelters. It can accommodate 6,000 children, but seats are filling up so fast and we are working to find more space for additional classrooms. As the weeks went by, half of the families in these shelters left to live with relatives in Damascus or Rural Damascus. But still many remain, either because they don’t have relatives they can live with or they want to wait to return to their own villages in Eastern Ghouta once it is safe to go back. These collective shelters - makeshift refuges which were never designed to be used as living quarters - are their homes for now and that’s why we need to keep supporting them. When I tell people that my job is to get children and families access to the essential services they need for their wellbeing, it’s hard for them to imagine what that really means. But when you’re on the ground with the children, you know that safe play spaces, protection services, good schools and healthcare are lifelines for their very survival.Children are the future of my country, Syria. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because expectations are so low for the Tories, they are almost bound to surpass them.Mrs May’s own position is also stronger than it was in January thanks to her handling of the Salisbury attack.At the start of the local election campaign, the talk was of how the Tories were facing a wipe-out in London, how they would do well to end up holding on to even one council.But senior figures involved in the campaign now admit they should do much better than that.Conservative Campaign Headquarters’ biggest worry in London is simply being outgunned on the day.They fear Labour’s return to being a mass membership party under Jeremy Corbyn will enable them to get nearly all their voters out, while the Tories will struggle to get more than 40 per cent of their supporters to the polls.There is, though, still cautious optimism that the Tories will hold at least one of their two flagship London boroughs, Wandsworth and Westminster.Then they could claim the results were respectable for a government in mid-term.This is especially true as results outside London are expected to be quite good for the party.One former Cabinet minister loyal to Theresa May tells me: “Things outside London really aren’t bad.”The Tories are particularly hopeful of making gains in the West Midlands.It will be tempting for the Tories to declare the local elections are further proof the capital and the rest of country are diverging politically, and so their decline in London doesn’t matter much as it will be made up for elsewhere.But this would be a catastrophic mistake.Labour’s rise in London is quite remarkable.They have gone from 37 per cent of the vote in 2010 to 55 per cent in 2017.There are several reasons why the capital is turning red but one of the biggest is the decline in home ownership.Home ownership in London peaked in the 1990s and has been falling since.Homeowners became a minority in London in 2011, the first time that has been the case since Margaret Thatcher’s Right To Buy revolution in the early 1980s.On current trends, 60 per cent of Londoners will be renters in seven years’ time.It is no coincidence that this rise in renting has coincided with Labour’s surge in the capital.For one of the things that makes you most likely to vote Tory is owning your own home.Labour’s surprise success at the last election was largely down to a big increase in turnout among renters who swung heavily to Labour.Labour London offers a preview of what happens to the Tories when homeowners become a minority.If the Tories want to win elections they need to get more homes built — and fast.CABINET Brexiteers are getting increasingly frustrated.They feel that key decisions are not being taken in Cabinet, or even the Cabinet Committee tasked with managing the negotiation, but elsewhere.One senior Brexiteer complains to me that Olly Robbins, the Prime Minister’s chief Europe adviser, is, “Running around telling everyone we have to back down on pretty much everything”.This grumpiness has been exacerbated by this week’s meeting of the Brexit inner Cabinet not discussing the big issue of the moment, customs.One member of it tells me: “When people left, they all felt a greater level of frustration.”There is a sense No10 is not respecting the political process.This all ups the ante ahead of the Brexit inner Cabinet’s meeting next week.This will discuss Theresa May’s plan for a hybrid customs model which would see the UK leave the customs union but collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf.Brexiteer ministers regard this as complicated and as having no chance of being accepted by Brussels. They think persisting with it just wastes valuable time.One tells me Mrs May has been told this hybrid plan is unworkable on eight occasions but doesn’t show any signs of abandoning the idea.Part of the problem is that Mrs May remains deeply worried about whether she has the votes in the Commons to leave the customs union.No10 is extremely concerned about the customs union amendment to the trade bill, which is expected to come to a vote in June.Its hope is the hybrid model is close enough to a customs union to see off a rebellion on this issue but if the model is unworkable, as pretty much everyone thinks, it doesn’t solve anything.Mrs May would be better off making the argument that Brexit won’t mean Brexit if Britain doesn’t regain the ability to run its own trade policy and that she couldn’t continue as Prime Minister in these circumstances.CHRIS GRAYLING wants to make it a criminal offence to cheat on auto emissions tests.This law change, which will be part of Grayling’s road to zero plan to cut exhaust emissions and improve air quality, will enable the Government to prosecute car manufacturers who try to diddle the system.The law won’t apply retrospectively.But the Department for Transport hope it will help prevent a repeat of the Volkswagen scandal.OUR political class needs to remember we are NOT Americans.The question about Donald Trump isn’t whether we would have voted for him or if we think he is the right person to be President of the United States.But how we should deal with the country he leads – which is our most important security ally.No country expelled more Russian diplomats following the Salisbury attack than the United States.Mrs May should make clear that she is delighted, not embarrassed, to welcome Donald Trump to Britain on his “working visit”.Why, because a strong relationship with the United States is in this country’s national interest.French President Emmanuel Macron, on his state visit to Washington this week, didn’t hold back in either cosying up to the president, quite literally at times, or in making clear where he disagreed with him.This is a far more sensible approach than acting all embarrassed about observing the necessary diplomatic niceties.Without Trump, yesterday’s moment of history would not have happened. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

smeeth","story":"Marc Wadsworth said he had received behind the scenes support from the Labour leaders office during his disciplinary hearing - a claim denied by sources close to Corbyn.Wadsworth had accused Jewish MP Ruth Smeeth of working hand in hand with the Daily  during a tirade at the launch of the Chakrabarti report on anti-Semitism in 2016.His expulsion followed a hearing by Labours disciplinary body which found his behaviour had been grossly detrimental to the party.But the veteran activist claimed Corbyn had told mutual friends he doesnt see that I did anything wrong.The Leader of the Opposition’s office disputed Wadsworths account and insisted no member of staff had called to offer him support.A source said a call was however made by a member of Labour staff to one of Mr Wadsworths supporters to reduce the risk of incidents outside the disciplinary hearing, which began on Wednesday.According to a Labour source, Wadsworth then made clear he was unhappy that Corbyn had not supported him or responded to attempts to contact him.Wadsworth hit out at the disciplinary process used against him and claimed he had been made a scapegoat.He said: The first letter I got, cancelling my membership summarily, was based on an alleged verbal attack on a member of the Parliamentary Labour Party which was uncomradely, brought the party into disrepute and embarrassed the leader.Well, the leader has told mutual friends he wasnt embarrassed because he doesnt see that I did anything wrong.Asked if Corbyns office had been supporting his case, Wadsworth said: When they called me on the first day of the hearing, they said to me that they had been working behind the scenes, that what I said wasnt anti-Semitic.He acknowledged Corbyn did have a bit of a go at me at the time of the incident and said perhaps I could have used kinder language.Asked who from the Labour leader’s team had been in touch with him on the first day of the disciplinary hearing, Wadsworth said: Im not going to get into names.Wadsworth said the claims against him changed from the verbal attack to one of anti-Semitism under the IHRA (International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance) definition, which the party apparently had adopted later on, after, and were applying retrospectively.He claimed he had been the victim of a purge and said some people have called it a kangaroo court.Smeeth said she was relieved that the ordeal was over.Stoke-on-Trent North MP Smeeth said: Abuse, bullying and intimidation have no place in our movement, as todays announcement has proven.I hope that this decision represents the first step towards a return to the values of decency and respect throughout the Labour Party.Dozens of Labour MPs had marched in support of Jewish colleague Smeeth as she prepared to give evidence at Wadsworths disciplinary hearing this week.But Wadsworth accused the gang of white MPs of bullying behaviour, saying it was a crude attempt to influence the outcome of my hearing, and it seems to have had an effect.A Labour spokesman said: The National Constitutional Committee (NCC) of the Labour Party has found that two charges of a breach of the Labour Partys rule 2.1.8 by Marc Wadsworth have been proven.The NCC consequently determined that the sanction for this breach of Labour Party rules will be expulsion from membership."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000249301348.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"obese kids capital of england revealed where does your home

capable of something amazing and that he was just the unlucky one who got caught.As part of the investigation, officers obtained a statement from a Tesla engineer who described autopilot as a suite of

Failure to do so can result in serious injury or death.PC Kirk Caldicutt, from the Road Policing Unit, said: What Patel did was grossly irresponsible and could have easily ended in tragedy. He not only endangered his own life but the lives of other innocent people using the motorway on that day.This case should serve as an example to all drivers who have access to autopilot controls and have thought about attempting something similar.I want to stress that they are in no way a substitute for a competent motorist in the driving seat who can react appropriately to the road ahead.As well as his 18-month disqualification, Patel was also given 100 hours unpaid work, ordered to carry out 10 days rehabilitation and pay £1,800 in costs to the Crown Prosecution Service.Patel of Alfreton Road, Nottingham, was sentenced at St Albans Crown Court after the incident that happened on M1, between junctions 8 and 9 near Hemel Hempstead, Beds."},{"url":null,"title":"james kate wright wedding mexico resort riviera maya building site","story":"James and Kate Wright fell in love with the Grand Sirenis Hotel when they visited it two years ago - and vowed to save enough money so they could become man and wife in the resort.The lovebirds splashed out £7,000 to make the journey - and other family members paid £9,000 to attend the sunshine ceremony.But when they arrived they found themselves stepping over piles of rubble - and piles of paint pots everywhere.Dad-of-one James, 39, said: “On our wedding day my partners dress was ruined due to walking through the building site, it really has been a holiday from hell.“We visited the Grand Sirenis on the Riviera Maya two years ago and had such a great time we wanted to return with our son and also close family for our wedding and honeymoon at the same resort.“From arrival there was just a catalogue of disasters.“The lift to our room was broken - but when we complained that we had my son and his pushchair we were again asked to pay for an upgrade.“The next day we discovered the settee was also broken and couldn’t be used.“But that wasn’t the end of our problems.“A couple of days later we were absolutely dumbstruck and shocked to see a large part of the resort turned into a complete building site.“Two large buildings were being shut and ripped out, the main pool by our accommodation was also shut off and drained with workmen chipping all the tiles on the pools interior. “This was the main pool with a swim up bar that we had seen in the brochures and online.”Our pictures show the dramatic difference between the TUI website pictures - and the Wright family’s reality.When James’ mum Sally, 64, later arrived she found her accomodation block was already under construction.The family, of Warwick, say they complained to the onsite TUI rep as well as head office and James’ mum and sister were offered a transfer to another resort - but because of the impending wedding James and Kate were not given the same option.Regardless of the problems the wedding went ahead as planned - but it was an experience marred by the ongoing construction work around them.James, a bar manager, added: “We endured the constant building works and the depressing surroundings, the constant brick dust and solvent smell has become an everyday occurrence.“I am quite sure that ABTA state any families should be informed of upcoming building works in hotels and resorts, we should have been told long before we travelled and had the option to change hotels or receive a full refund, this never happened.“The TUI reps said they had no idea of building works until they arrived at the hotel in the morning, there is now a sign stating about “maintenance” works, but this isn’t a scenario of fixing a lift or repainting walls… whole blocks of rooms are been ripped out and the main pool is simply a no go building site.“To call it maintenance is ridiculous.”The couple are due to fly home from their nightmare wedding today.A spokeswoman for TUI said: “We’re really sorry to hear of Mr Wright and Miss Wagstaff’s experience, especially given it was for such a special occasion.We rely on our partners in resort to advise us of any maintenance work and regrettably this did not happen of this occasion.

It’s patronising rubbish.It’s no surprise that this latest rebellion is being led by the Lib Dems, a party whose anti-Brexit platform was so popular at the last election that they managed to win 12 seats — just under 2 per cent of the Commons.Hardly shocking then that they’re no fans of democracy.What they’re doing is downright dangerous, and not just because a trolling guide produced by one Remoaning pressure group ominously promises “direct action”.The risk is that they put up enough barriers to our departure that the Government ends up compromising on membership of the customs union.That would be a knife in the heart of Global Britain and mean that Brussels bureaucrats would still be setting the rules.That simply cannot happen.The Prime Minister must stand firm.THE tragic death of Alfie Evans has touched the nation.There are real questions to be asked about who has the final say on treatment for terminally-ill children.But for now those debates should be put to one side.Our hearts go out to his parents who have fought so hard to give their son a chance.We also want to offer a tribute to the NHS staff who did all they could for him.And who will do the same, again and again, for hundreds of kids in the future.MO Salah is one of those sportsmen that you just want to succeed.But he’s proved himself much more than just a footballer.He’s broken down walls between different communities and has given back to those in his home town who weren’t blessed with such a cultured left foot. He’s even forgiven a thief.He is an inspiration to us all.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A source said: “They are devastated.Social services have been dealing with them since last year and told them to make improvements in how the child was being looked after.“They then decided that the called-for improvements had not happened and took the child into care.”The couple from the north of England had the baby using a surrogate mother in her 30s. She is believed to have been impregnated using the 65-year-old’s sperm and a donor egg.The adoptive parents spent more than £100,000 on the procedure and used a clinic abroad as most in the UK would not deal with a couple their age.The child’s British birth mother and her husband were named on the birth certificate, but they signed a parental order letting the older couple adopt.Social services closely monitored the situation and, after the concerns were raised, the child was taken away and is thought to be in foster care.The adoptive parents have failed in one bid to regain custody but are still fighting. They are thought to be allo-wed some contact in monitored visits.The source said: “This is a very unusual situation. Although it is upsetting for all, social workers have done what they think is best for the child.”The adoptive mother refused to comment, as did the couple’s local council.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is absolutely unacceptable.”Russia has already been accused of using such tactics to back President Donald Trump in the 2016 American election.However this is the first time that it has been documented in the 2017 general election, in which Corbyn had an extraordinary success and defied all predictions.GOT a story?
