Among the tweets were ones that pictured Jarrett next to a character from Planet of the Apes, and a doctored image of Whoopie Goldberg wearing a t-shirt that shows Trump shooting himself in the head      Despite apologizing for her previous comments about George Soros and Valerie Jarrett, Barr retweeted a stream of content that backed her remarks while wading into other right-wing causes and conspiracies      Barr also said she thought former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett was white when she penned the racist tweet that got her show pulled from television          Barr said she though Jarrett \u0027was Jewish and Persian\u0027 amid a bizarre flurry tweets penned late on Tuesday night          Valerie Jarrett was born in Iran but both of her parents are African American, and her great-grandfather was the first credited African American architect. She appeared on MSNBC on Tuesday (pictured) to lay blame for Barr\u0027s rhetoric at the feet of President Trump, saying: \u0027The tone comes from the top\u0027          The shamed star also blamed her racist rant on sleeping pill Ambien. Users have previously reported going into blackouts and performing complex actions such as driving and making food without recalling it           Roseanne\u0027s show was the most viewed program on ABC before it was cancelled over a tweet in which she said Jarrett was the lovechild of the \u0027Muslim Brotherhood and Planet of the Apes\u0027          Actor John Goodman, 65, stepped out to walk his dog in New Orleans on Tuesday soon after news broke that his show \u0027Roseanne\u0027 had been canceled because of his castmate Roseanne Barr\u0027s racist tweets          She then went on to rant about what she described as a Soros plot to overthrow America \u0027by buyingbacking candidates 4 local district attorney races who will ignore US law \u0026amp favor \u0027feelings\u0027 instead-and call everyone who is alarmed by that \u0027racist\u0027.\u0027Following on from that, she called on Americans to unite against his narrative while throwing a reference to MK Ultra, a discontinued CIA program that right-wing conspiracy theorists believe is still ongoing, into the mix           It was during this rant that Barr made the comment \u0027muslim brotherhood and planet of the apes had a babyvj\u0027, using Valerie Jarrett\u0027s initials, that would see her show axed.Barr subsequently deleted the tweet but not before it had been copied and shared across social media, leading to swift calls for her show to be pulled from the air.          After Barr\u0027s now-infamous Planet of the Apes tweet had been sent, Clinton replied around 9am to say that she was not in fact married to a Soros, though she admired the work his foundation does.Barr subsequently sent a Tweet apologizing to Clinton for the mistake, though launched another broadside at Soros by claiming he was a \u0027Nazi\u0027 who betrayed Jews during the holocaust.The actress also launched a salvo at Clinton\u0027s actual husband, Marc Mezvinsky, saying: \u0027HER HUSBAND IS THE SON OF A CORRUPT SENATOR.\u0027Clinton\u0027s father-in-law is a former congressman and convicted felon who in March of 2001 plead guilty to 31 of 69 felony charges of mail, bank and wire fraud.            But as the Clinton saga wound to a close Barr\u0027s tweet about Jarrett was catching a massive amount of attention, forcing the actress to brand her remark \u0027a joke\u0027.She also defended herself against allegations of racism by countering that Islam \u0027is not a race\u0027.The remarks were not enough, however, and around an hour later she offered a full apology to Jarrett and announced that she would be leaving Twitter.           Shortly after midday Wanda Sykes, an African-American comedian and writer working on the Roseanne reboot, announced that she was walking away from the program.Around an hour later ABC broke its silence over the controversy to say that Roseanne was being cancelled.We now know that the network spent this time contacting Jarrett to apologize and inform her of the cancellation.Barr later said that the network had bowed to pressure amid calls for a boycott of Roseanne\u0027s advertisers, though ABC did not immediately respond to her remark.In its statement, ABC said Roseanne\u0027s remark was \u0027abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values\u0027.       Soon after the news broke, Goodman, who played Barr\u0027s husband Dan on the TV show, was spotted looking very glum as he walked his dog          Goodman, 65, is yet to offer any comment on Barr\u0027s tweets or their show being axed          Gilbert, who played Darlene Conner on the series, had earlier slammed Barr\u0027s tweets as \u0027abhorrent\u0027  Barr also lashed out at former costar Sara Gilbert for her reaction to the racism row, in which Gilbert called her comments \u0027abhorrent\u0027 and \u0027disappointing\u0027, by saying \u0027wow! unreal\u0027  Bar clapped back at Michael Fishman, who played DJ Conner for the entirety of the series and was featured in the revival with a biracial daughter, accusing him of throwing her under a bus      Barr was widely condemned after she tweeted that Jarrett looked like \u0027Muslim brotherhood \u0026amp planet of the apes had a baby\u0027.Jarrett responded to the ordeal when she spoke at a town hall on MSNBC called \u0027Everyday Racism in America\u0027 later on Tuesday. She revealed that Disney CEO Bob Iger had called her to apologize.\u0027He wanted me to know before he made it public that he was canceling the show,\u0027 she said. \u0027First of all, I think we have to turn it into a teaching moment. I\u0027m fine. I\u0027m worried about all the people out there who don\u0027t have a circle of friends and followers coming to their defense. \u0027The person walking down the street minding their own business and they see someone clinging to their purse or walk across the street... or every black parent I know who has a boy who has to sit down and have a conversation, the talk as we call it.\u0027Those ordinary examples of racism that happen every single day.\u0027     ABC has decided to cancel Roseanne Barr\u0027s television show just hours after the comedian posted a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett          \u0027We have decided to cancel her show,\u0027 Channing Dungey, President of ABC Entertainment, announced on Tuesday afternoon           Disney CEO Bob Iger  tweeted about ABC\u0027s decision, saying: \u0027There was only one thing to do here, and that was the right thing.\u0027 Disney owns ABC Television Group   Barr came under fire for a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett during an unhinged rant on Tuesday morning          Many on Twitter were appalled by Barr\u0027s tweet, which was in response to an article from a conspiracy website The Disney CEO also tweeted about the decision to terminate the show, saying: \u0027There was only one thing to do here, and that was the right thing.\u0027Shortly after Barr\u0027s show was cancelled, talent agency ICM Partners revealed they were dropping her as a client. \u0027We are all greatly distressed by the disgraceful and unacceptable tweet from Roseanne Barr this morning,\u0027 ICM said in an internal note to employees that was obtained by the Hollywood Reporter. \u0027What she wrote is antithetical to our core values, both as iniduals and as an agency.\u0027 \u0027Consequently, we have notified her that we will not represent her. Effective immediately, Roseanne Barr is no longer a client.\u0027 It appears the cancellation of the show will also affect the cast\u0027s Emmy prospects, as ABC revealed it is suspending the show\u0027s FYC (For Your Consideration) campaign. Other networks including Viacom also dropped reruns of the original Roseanne as the industry turned its back on the show and its star performer. The swift fallout from the tweet began when Wanda Sykes  quit her role as the show\u0027s consulting producer and celebrities condemned Barr\u0027s words.   Emma Kenney, who played Sara Gilbert\u0027s daughter on the show, also revealed on Twitter that she planned to quit before finding out the show had been cancelled. \u0027I am hurt, embarrassed, and disappointed. The racist and distasteful comments from Roseanne are inexcusable,\u0027 the 18-year-old wrote. \u0027As I called my manager to quit working on Roseanne, I was told it was cancelled. I feel so empowered by @iamwandasykes , Channing Dungey and anyone at ABC standing up for morals and abuse of power. Bullies will NEVER win.\u0027Tom Arnold, who co-starred on the show from 1989 to 1993 and was married to Barr from 1990 to 1994, praised the decision to cancel the show.   \u0027Ton of respect for Bob Iger. Tough decision with financial consequences for his company but right for America,\u0027 he wrote. Michael Fishman, who played DJ Conner for the entirety of the series and was featured in the revival with a biracial daughter, said he was \u0027devastated\u0027. \u0027Today is one of the hardest days of my life. I feel devastated, not for the end of the Roseanne show, but for all those who poured their hearts and souls into our jobs, and the audience that welcomed us into their home,\u0027 he wrote on Twitter. Comedian Wanda Sykes had earlier revealed she would not return to the show following the comedian\u0027s racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett (Pictured L-R: Sykes, Russell Peters, Barr, JB Smoove, Keenen Ivory Wayans in 2014)          Sykes, a consulting producer for Barr\u0027s eponymous show on ABC, revealed the news on Twitter          Emma Kenney, who played Sara Gilbert\u0027s daughter on the show, revealed on Twitter that she planned to quit before finding out the show had been cancelled           Tom Arnold, who co-starred on the show from 1989 to 1993 and was married to Barr from 1990 to 1994, praised the decision to cancel the showFishman said he condemned Roseanne\u0027s statement \u0027vehemently\u0027, saying they were \u0027reprehensible and intolerable\u0027 and \u0027truly offensive\u0027.  \u0027My character was designed to represent the inclusive nature of my views. To represent potions of society often marginalized,\u0027 he wrote. \u0027In this moment it is important to be clear. We must stand up against bias, hatred, bigotry, and ignorance to make society a better place for all.\u0027  Many called on ABC to fire Barr or drop the show as others criticized the broadcast network for its enduring silence amid recent controversies with the comedian.Others were skeptical that ABC would dare touch the hit series, which is the third highest-rated show this year following Sunday Night Football and This Is Us.The revival of Roseanne was a ratings juggernaut when it premiered on ABC to a whopping 25 million viewers in April.It\u0027s surprising success even elicited a congratulatory phone call and tweet from President Donald Trump. Ratings dropped steadily thereafter, with last week\u0027s season finale garnering 10.33 million viewers.ABC  initially ordered 13 episodes for the second season and said the show would move away from its controversial politics and focus on family.    Roseanne\u0027s mention of the \u0027Muslim brotherhood\u0027 seems to be due to the long-running conspiracy theory that Jarrett is Muslim, despite there being no supporting evidence           She also retweeted an article with the headline: \u0027Valerie Jarrett...was her mommy a Commie?\u0027The show most recently came under fire for featuring an episode in which Barr\u0027s character believes her new Muslim neighbors are terrorists. Roseanne\u0027s mention of the \u0027Muslim brotherhood\u0027 in her Tuesday tweet seems to be due to the long-running conspiracy theory that Jarrett is Muslim. Jarrett, who was Obama\u0027s senior adviser during his presidency, was born in Iran to American parents and lived in Shiraz for six years. The family had moved to Iran because her father was part of a program that sent American physicians to help developing countries. He ran a children\u0027s hospital.There has never been any indication that Jarrett or her parents are Muslim.  Barr later claimed the comment was a \u0027joke\u0027 when she was called out on Twitter by CNN reporter Andrew Kaczynski. \u0027ABC is doing their best to ignore some of these statements from Roseanne and she is making it really hard for them by taking it to the next level here,\u0027 he wrote. After Roseanne responds, Kaczynski replied: \u0027understand it\u0027s a joke, but can you see why some people think comparing a black woman to Planet of the Apes might be racist and find the Muslim Brotherhood reference to be conspiratorial and Islamophobic?\u0027  Caravans seen outside Thwaites Brewery as 100 travellers take overRacist man tells hiic woman he\u0027ll buy ticket \u0027back to Mexico\u0027Young boy tries multiple times to give President Trump a hugA sudden hail shower saw large balls of ice fall in Daventry townHilarious moment cheeky kangaroo farts and wafts away smellValerie Jarrett says government will only be as good as we make itPolice officer makes obscene hand gesture to bikersHow to survive a knife attack: Chinese police\u0027s 12 second advice goes viralSuspected agent arrested for allegedly ordering journalist murderWorkman bites off the head of a live PIGEON in shocking videoHorse takes her weekly dip in the equine swimming pool    A number of stars have since condemned Barr for the tweet, including Patricia Arquette and Julianne Moore. Rev Al Sharpton used ABC to fire Barr, while Rosie O\u0027Donnell defended her          Not everyone was happy with ABC\u0027s decision to cancel the show. Some stood by in their support for Barr, while others said the network should have continued without her A number of celebrities  also condemned Barr for the tweet, with some urging ABC to fire her from the show completely.\u0027I am repulsed that Valerie Jarret had that racist and bigoted \u0027joke\u0027 made at her expense and I am sickened that any Black or Muslim person has to keep hearing this sickness in 2018,\u0027 Patricia Arquette tweeted. \u0027You can take @RoseanneOnABC out of racism but you can\u0027t take the racism out of @therealroseanne,\u0027 Don Cheadle wrote. \u0027I told y\u0027all about Roseanne. I told you. So,\u0027 author Roxane Gay added, to which Julianne Moore replied: \u0027Yes you did. #FireRoseanne.\u0027 Reverend Al Sharpton also criticized the comedian and called on ABC to \u0027take action now\u0027. \u0027The comparison by Rosanne Barr on ABC of Former Obama aide, Valerie Jarrett to an APE is racist and inexcusable,\u0027 he tweeted. Tomi Lahren was a rare prominent conservative voice to hit out at Roseanne. \u0027What Roseanne said was wrong,\u0027 she tweeted. \u0027I\u0027m sure she knows that. She made a mistake.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know why fellow conservatives are playing mental gymnastics trying to justify it. Come on. Wrong is wrong.\u0027 Only Rosie O\u0027Donnell appeared to lend some support to Roseanne, writing that she loved her \u0027quite a bit\u0027. \u0027The comment Roseanne tweeted was racist and childish and beneath her best self,\u0027 O\u0027Donnell wrote. \u0027She has apologized. Twitter is a dangerous place.\u0027 Caravans seen outside Thwaites Brewery as 100 travellers take overRacist man tells hiic woman he\u0027ll buy ticket \u0027back to Mexico\u0027Young boy tries multiple times to give President Trump a hugA sudden hail shower saw large balls of ice fall in Daventry townHilarious moment cheeky kangaroo farts and wafts away smellValerie Jarrett says government will only be as good as we make itPolice officer makes obscene hand gesture to bikersHow to survive a knife attack: Chinese police\u0027s 12 second advice goes viralSuspected agent arrested for allegedly ordering journalist murderWorkman bites off the head of a live PIGEON in shocking videoHorse takes her weekly dip in the equine swimming pool    Barr came under fire on the very night the revival of Roseanne premiered in April when she accused Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg of giving a \u0027Nazi Salute\u0027.Barr swiftly took the tweet down and claimed that she had seen a \u0027doctored\u0027 image of Hogg. But internet sleuths found a grab of Barr\u0027s original tweet, which revealed she was commenting on picture of Hogg raising his fist at the March For Our Lives rally. That same week, Barr also made headlines when she tweeted about a bizarre right-wing conspiracy theory claiming Trump broke up a pedophile ring created by Democratic politicians.  Barr claimed that it was Trump who had freed \u0027so many children held in bondage to pimps all over this world\u0027.           In 2015 Barr made headlines after tweeting she \u0027hope UC Davis gets nuked\u0027 after the student body voted to est from companies that have ties to Israel\u0027He has broken up trafficking rings in high places everywhere. notice that. I disagree on some things, but give him benefit of doubt-4 now,\u0027 she added. The tweet was similar to when, in 2015, Barr revealed that she believed the Pizzagate conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton was running a child sex-ring in a pizza shop. \u0027Americans! The reason #DEMOCRATS aren\u0027t approving #Sessions is bc he will prosecure #HRC – and make arrests over PedoGate RT THIS!! WAKE UP!!\u0027Barr was slammed and derided for the tweets. She later apologized for mentioning child trafficking and said Twitter was \u0027not the place for it\u0027. In 2015 Barr made headlines after tweeting she \u0027hope all the jews leave UC Davis and then it gets nuked!\u0027 after the student body voted to est from companies that have ties to Israel           In 2012 the comedian came under fire after she spoke out against transgender bathroom rightsIn 2012 the comedian came under fire after she spoke out against transgender bathroom rights. \u0027Women do not want your penises forced in their faces or in private bathrooms. Respect that,\u0027 she wrote.  After the comedian\u0027s most recent Twitter controversies came to light, Walt Disney President Ben Sherwood responded that \u0027you can\u0027t control Roseanne Barr\u0027.\u0027Many who have tried have failed. She\u0027s the one and only,\u0027 he added. But as Tuesday\u0027s news has proved, you can still cancel here.                         \u0027You\u0027re a racist pig \u0026amp ABC should be ashamed that they give you a platform,\u0027 another added. Roseanne later tweeted, in an attempt to defend herself, that \u0027Islam is not a race\u0027. \u0027Islam includes EVERY RACE of people,\u0027 she added, still without acknowledging the fact that there is no evidence Jarrett has ties to the Islamic faith. She also retweeted an article whose headline read: \u0027Valerie Jarrett...was her mommy a Commie?\u0027 About an hour later, Roseanne apologized and said she was leaving Twitter.     \u0027I apologize to Valerie Jarrett and to all Americans,\u0027 she wrote in a separate tweet. \u0027I am truly sorry for making a bad joke about her politics and her looks. I should have known better. Forgive me-my joke was in bad taste.\u0027         Caravans seen outside Thwaites Brewery as 100 travellers take overRacist man tells hiic woman he\u0027ll buy ticket \u0027back to Mexico\u0027Young boy tries multiple times to give President Trump a hugA sudden hail shower saw large balls of ice fall in Daventry townHilarious moment cheeky kangaroo farts and wafts away smellValerie Jarrett says government will only be as good as we make itPolice officer makes obscene hand gesture to bikersHow to survive a knife attack: Chinese police\u0027s 12 second advice goes viralPolice officers attend stabbing crime scene in Chelsea, LondonSuspected agent arrested for allegedly ordering journalist murder    Much like its revival, Roseanne was an almost instant success when it premiered in 1988 and quickly became the umber one show on television It also turned Barr, who previously performed stand-up comedy on Johnny Carson\u0027s Tonight Show, into a household name. The show ran for nine seasons, featuring numerous storylines that were rare for network sitcoms in the nineties.   The show  tackled episodes that focused on taboo topics for the times like homophobia, abortion, teen pregnancy, masturbation, and domestic abuse.Barr, who has a lesbian sister and a gay brother, also made sure to feature a number of LGBT characters on the show. One episode of the show even featured Roseanne contemplating whether or not she should have an abortion, while others discussed previously taboo topics like masturbation.           The show ran for nine seasons, featuring numerous storylines that were rare for network sitcoms in the nineties - such as issues paying bills and homophobia The show won both Barr and Laurie Metcalf, who played her sister, respective Emmy Awards for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress. It also won the prestigious Peabody Award in 1992. ABC announced in May 2017 that it planned to do a revival of the beloved series, which aired in March of the following year. The news garnered controversy from the beginning when it was revealed Roseanne would return as a pro-Trump grandmother. It also featured episodes that include her husband Dan, played by John Goodman, losing his job to an illegal immigrant and Roseanne\u0027s fears after finding out her new next-door neighbors are Muslim.

And the thing that really matters for people is to feel that they matter.\u0027For what would every cancer patient want? To know that the best, the latest science was being used and available for them.\u0027Her daughter Jess added: \u0027The only time I\u0027ve seen mum cry since she got ill, she was sat in the waiting room and had what she described as the absolutely heartbreaking realisation that those who had that privilege of access or income may well live longer because of that and those that didn\u0027t may well die much sooner because of it.    Dame Tessa is pictured with her daughter Jess (right) and her daughter-in-law Ella Mills (left, holding Jess\u0027 child)\u0027And in her words, that is just the most despicable example of inequality. In those moments, her mission was really identified.\u0027The Health Secretary admitted that there was much about the trials he wasn\u0027t aware of until Dame Tessa brought it to his attention.\u0027There is so much we can do with the data, on the adaptive trials that I didn\u0027t know much about until Tessa brought that to my attention. But there is so much we can do.\u0027The documentary also includes a number of interviews with doctors and academics as well as patients who have been diagnosed with the same aggressive form of brain cancer as Dame Tessa.

I can\u0027t tell you how excited we are that the fence is down.\u0027Our fear now is that it will put it back up again - we just hope it is gone for good.\u0027I was nervous about coming to the press but I am so glad we did now - it may have saved us months of dispute.\u0027Thomas and Rebekah moved into the £220,000 four-bedroom property on Persimmon Homes\u0027s Brook View development just before Christmas.They arrived home from their honeymoon earlier this month to find their home\u0027s outlook blocked by the intrusive wooden panel.And they said that since their return, their lives had been ruined by the fence - and they even considered moving out.  The couple moved into the £220,000 four-bedroom home just before Christmas last year and found the wall metres away from the side of their home when they returned from honeymoon Furious Thomas thought the fence was erected by the owner of nearby Upper Mickle Hay Farm in a dispute with Persimmon over land borders.However, Persimmon insisted that none of its development encroaches on land it does not already own.Thomas said before the wall was toppled: \u0027This was our dream home and now it\u0027s turned into a nightmare - it feels like we are imprisoned in our own house by this fence.\u0027We are being held hostage in a land dispute which is nothing to do with us.\u0027Rebekah and I have just started our own business and had to fight to get a mortgage and then to get this house.\u0027We bought it because of the view which has now been replaced by a huge wooden fence nailed to our own little one.          The wall has fallen: The Entwistle\u0027s home in Blackburn is pictured without the 6ft around it           The couple said they are fearful the wall could be put back up again but a planning meeting will decide whether it was a planning breach or not \u0027Rebekah is always in tears. She is in despair - there was no warning and the fence just appeared.\u0027It is 2ft from our front window and front door - it\u0027s like having the Berlin Wall in front of our home.\u0027 Thomas and his wife, who married in July, said they would not have even considered the property if they had known the trouble in store for them.Thomas said: \u0027We\u0027re not even sure we want to live here now.\u0027Even if the fence gets taken down there is no guarantee it won\u0027t come back later or even be extended around the back - we are in fear of that.\u0027The couple, who had moved from rented accommodation, considered employing their own solicitor.          The wooden structure is pictured on the ground after developers took it down with the help of local council officials Thomas added: \u0027At first I was tearful but now I\u0027m angry.\u0027We specifically bought this house, beating off a lot of competition, for its beautiful views and now they\u0027ve gone.\u0027We now keep the curtains closed in the front room and spend most of our time upstairs - Rebekah is too upset to be in the living room.\u0027We just want it sorted out quickly and permanently so we can enjoy our new home in peace.\u0027          Mr Entwistle was shocked to find that the enormous fence stands just two feet from his living room windowDevelopers Persimmon removed the fence after Blackburn with Darwen Council planning officials visited and told the firm the fence was constructed on land they owned.The council officials will now see if it was in breach of planning regulations.A spokesman for Persimmon Homes said: \u0027Our staff have taken down the fence after consultation with council planning officers.\u0027Local councillor Sylvia Liddle said: \u0027I am delighted for this young couple who have been so distressed - it is a victory for common sense and we now need to ensure it is a permanent solution.\u0027A spokeswoman for the farmer\u0027s land agent Gary Hoerty Associates of Grindleton declined to comment.A spokesman for Persimmon Homes said: \u0027We are confident none of our development encroaches on land not legitimately within our ownership.

At his eighth birthday, he had exceeded his father\u0027s height of 5 feet, 11 inches. At 13, he became the world\u0027s tallest Boy Scout, at 7 feet, 4 inches and by the time he graduated high school, he was 8 feet, 4 inches tall according to Guinness World Records. Robert was diagnosed with hyperplasia of the pituitary gland which caused him to grow rapidly due to an abnormally high level of human growth hormones in his body.Despite his  size, Robert\u0027s parents tried to make his life as normal as possible.

Hie presence drew a huge crowd, turning him into quite a celebrity.A couple of years later, in 1938, the International Shoe Company contacted him, offering him a job and becoming the face of the brand. He received all of his specially-made, size 37AA shoes free of charge according Mashable.When he wasn\u0027t taking part in circuses or travelling the world promoting shoes, Robert lived a quiet life. Friends and family describe him as a \u0027gentle giant.\u0027   Day-to-day life to Robert wasn\u0027t easy with houses, public spaces, and everyday household items which were not designed for a man of his height.            Robert was 7 feet 4 inches tall and weighed 290 pounds at the age of 13.

His body was laid to rest in a casket measuring 10 feet, 9 inches, and weighing 1,000 pounds.A life-size bronze statue of him stands in his hometown of Alton, Illinois, while three others stand in Guinness Museums around North America with several wax models of him  in Ripley\u0027s Believe It or Not Museums for people stand alongside and pose next to him.

It would involve using technology and ‘trusted trader’ arrangements to keep customs checks to an absolute minimum.Last week Jon Thompson, the chief executive of HMRC, told MPs that Max Fac would cost between £17billion and £20billion and take up to three years to bring in. He also told the Treasury committee yesterday that under the plan, customs declarations would cost businesses an average of £13billion a year, with billions more to be added for EU rules of origin checks.But last night Dr Gudgin, a member of the 50-strong group of pro-Leave academics Briefings for Brexit, said the figure was ‘hugely inflated’. Along with John Mills, chairman of retailer JML and chairman of Labour Leave, he warned that no Government policy decisions should be made on the basis of the HMRC’s ‘shoddy calculations’.They said: ‘The Treasury and HMRC have taken to presenting hugely negative calculations of the economic impact of Brexit without formal analyses that can be checked for accuracy. This must stop. We fully expect that HMRC’s wild forecasts will also be confounded by reality.’Global think tank upgrades growth forecast for Brexit...Trump\u0027s commerce secretary claims new European privacy laws...Share this articleThe pair highlighted the real experiences of Mr Mills’s firm as evidence of how apocalyptic claims about post-Brexit customs practices are unfounded. They said: ‘The retail company JML judges that customs administration costs amount to around 1 per cent of the value of consignments.‘JML does close to £100million of trade per annum with 85 countries and ships roughly 2,000 containers a year from one place to another in the world. About 80 per cent of these movements are on World Trade Organisation terms outside customs unions or free trade areas.          Jon Thompson, the chief executive of HMRC, told MPs that Max Fac would cost between £17billion and £20billion‘The only additional paperwork requirements for business from being outside rather than inside the customs union are the production of certificates of origin and any necessary compliance certification. This can’t possibly cost £7billion a year or anything like it for firms trading with the EU after Brexit.‘As things stand at the moment inside the customs union all shipments from the UK to the EU27 involve invoices and dealing with VAT. If this sort of paperwork is a manageable burden, why should the addition of certificates of origin and compliance documentation be such a huge additional cost?’Last night, major European business leaders met with Theresa May and said they needed ‘clarity and certainty’.The European Round Table of Industrialists, comprised of around 50 firms including energy giant E.On, warned that ‘uncertainty causes less investment’ following a meeting with her at No 10.The group said in a statement: ‘The uninterrupted flow of goods is essential to both the EU and UK economies.

(Zimbabwe, for example, was allowed to continue trading diamonds despite the Mugabe government’s involvement in massacring gem miners.)Although some fear De Beers’s move could devastate its core mining business by knocking the floor out of diamond prices, its executives have come round to the view that people are increasingly happy to buy diamonds for their sparkle alone, rather than their high value and exclusivity.And from a PR point of view, it plays to the public’s growing concern about the ethics of the business — and may well empty the pockets of dictators, terrorists and shady middlemen who still make billions from the trade in illegal gems.The science behind the man-made gems set to revolutionise the market is far from new. It was in the early Fifties that technicians at the American industrial giant General Electric took a tiny fragment of diamond (called a ‘seed’) and subjected it to intense pressure and heat (4,000c) in a hydraulic press, while carbon-containing gas was passed over it.    Djimon Hounsou (left) and Leonardo DiCaprio (right), starred in the 2006 film Blood Diamond — which highlighted the illicit trade in diamonds mined by workers in war zonesThis mimicked the conditions that create diamonds over millions of years underground: carbon atoms in the gas stick to the seed one by one, building up the intricate carbon lattice structure of a diamond at a rate of roughly 0.0002 of an inch per hour.The end result, a chunky cube of diamond, can be cut and polished into the traditional shape. Manufactured diamonds produced in this way have sold for a discount of 20-40 per cent on the real thing.De Beers is well versed in the technology, as the world’s leading supplier of synthetic industrial diamonds through its UK-based subsidiary Element Six.Diamond, long regarded as the world’s hardest-known material, is used for cutting, grinding, drilling, oil extraction, marble polishing, and in precision electronic sensors for cars.As well as this high-temperature technique (which also requires pressure equivalent to placing the 7,300-ton Eiffel Tower on a single can of Coke), De Beers has been developing a cheaper synthetic diamond-making process called chemical vapour deposition.This involves pumping carbon-containing gases into a low- pressure vacuum around the diamond seed, again building up in layers to create a single stone.In the past decade, the technologies involved have advanced so much that synthetic diamonds are now much cheaper to produce.What’s more, their quality is such that it is no longer possible to tell the difference between natural and lab-produced gems with the human eye. Even professionals, using magnifying glasses and microscopes, find it difficult.\u0027I\u0027ll treasure it forever\u0027: Heartbroken bride whose fiance...Share this articleThis was amply demonstrated six years ago when 600 lab-grown diamonds were found in a collection of 1,000 gems. The synthetic stones even included intentionally created impurities to make them look more natural.The only people who could detect the difference were experts at the International Gemological Institute in Antwerp.So if the synthetic versions are that good, should buyers care that they are not ‘real’?Well, there is always the small matter of value. One of the biggest fears of traders, collectors and owners of diamond jewellery is that a flood of comparatively cheap, lab-made diamonds will result in a dramatic devaluation of mined diamonds.But in fact, contrary to Marilyn Monroe’s claim, diamonds were never really a girl’s best friend in terms of investment or resale.While large rare diamonds may command a premium, the small ones found in rings, bracelets, pendants and earrings are too common to appreciate in value. They seldom even keep the price paid for them at a jeweller’s.But clearly there will be an impact, not least because synthetic gems are unlikely to have any resale value in a world that could be awash with them.There is no question that this is a canny move by De Beers. The cost of getting natural diamonds out of the ground is continually growing, which cuts both production levels and profits.

Anti-establishment leader Luigi Di Maio (pictured) made a move on Wednesday to resurrect a populist coalition in Italy that collapsed at the weekendWhile a clear majority of Italians favour 5-Star and League forming a government, a large majority also want to remain part of the euro.Two polls show that between 60-72 per cent of Italians want the country to remain part of the euro while 23-24 per cent would choose to drop the common currency. On Wednesday, 5-Star Movement leader Luigi Di Maio attempted to resurrect the populist coalition by offering to withdraw Eurosceptic Paolo Savona as his choice for finance minister. Italy\u0027s \u0027populist\u0027 parties get MORE popular: Anti-EU League...\u0027Brussels has no shame!\u0027 Italian populist leaders demand an...Share this article    Sergio Mattarella vetoed the appointment of Paolo Savona (pictured) who has described the euro as a \u0027German cage\u0027 and said that Italy needs a plan to leave the single currency \u0027if necessary\u0027The euro, bonds and stocks initially rallied on Monday after President Sergio Mattarella vetoed Savona\u0027s nomination, but relief turned to fear over snap elections. The gap between Italian and German 10-year bond yields, a measure of Italian risk, widened to its highest in over four years.\u0027The election is going to resemble a referendum, de facto, on the European Union and the euro,\u0027 said Francesco Galietti, head of political risk consultancy Policy Sonar in Rome. \u0027It\u0027s an existential threat for the entire euro zone.\u0027If Italians were to cast a protest vote against the EU and euro at fresh elections, it would deliver the bloc\u0027s biggest challenge since Britain voted to quit the union two years ago and raise questions about the future of the single currency.As the euro zone\u0027s third-largest economy, heavily indebted Italy also represents a far bigger potential threat to the single currency than the Greek economic crisis.Polls show the League has gained support since winning 17 percent of the vote in inconclusive March 4 elections, climbing as high as 24 percent. The 5-Star has been drawing about the same 32 percent it got two months ago.Former prime minister Massimo D\u0027Alema, caught speaking on an open microphone on Saturday, summed up the fears of traditional parties: \u0027If we go back to elections because of a veto on Savona, they (anti-establishment parties) are going to win 80 percent.\u0027On the street, some voters believe Salvini is right to challenge the president\u0027s veto and go back to the polls.\u0027I\u0027m really ticked off. The president sold out the country,\u0027 said Giancarlo Sacco, 54, owner of a cafe in central Rome. Sacco said he wanted Italy to remain in the euro but that its concerns needed to be taken seriously by EU partners.\u0027It just has to make itself respected again.\u0027The president\u0027s veto of Savona as economy minister has put the currency, which was little discussed in the last election campaign, at the centre of the debate.\u0027Membership of the euro is a fundamental choice,\u0027 Mattarella said in a televised speech, explaining his veto. \u0027If we want to discuss it, then we should do so in a serious fashion.\u0027In February, Salvini railed against the euro, saying it was a \u0027mistake for our economy\u0027.\u0027We don\u0027t have a euro in our pockets. We have a German mark which they called the euro,\u0027 he said.The 5-Star dropped its previous calls for a non-binding referendum over Italy\u0027s euro membership, though its founder, comic Beppe Grillo, recently revived the idea.Political tensions are running high, with the League threatening street protests against Mattarella.On social media, League and 5-Star sympathisers made death threats against the president, while supporters crowding around Salvini and Di Maio during live TV interviews late on Sunday shouted insults at him.On the other side are Italians who, like many Britons devastated by the Brexit vote, see the country\u0027s relationship with Europe as fundamental.\u0027I am absolutely pro-European and I believe that Italy is connected, must have a connection with Europe for our future,\u0027 said Irene Teramo, a shopper at a street market in Rome, who supported the president\u0027s decision.Italians will also be weighing concern about their savings as financial markets put the country\u0027s stock market and bonds under pressure and borrowing costs increase.\u0027In his heart, the average voter will probably be cheering for the anti-establishment forces, but his wallet will be saying the opposite,\u0027 said political risk expert Galietti.\u0027It will be a heart versus wallet election.\u0027                                                              Luigi Di Maio offered the president a compromise over a controversial pick for economy minister          The League has so far insisted on new elections as the party\u0027s polling ratings soar. Pictured, League leader Matteo Salvini          But on Wednesday evening, Salvini was reported as saying that he would discuss the issue with Di MaioMattarella\u0027s veto of Savona and subsequent nomination of Cottarelli as caretaker prime minister angered lawmakers, most of whom had been ready to back the Eurosceptic as economy minister.There is almost no chance of his formation gaining parliamentary approval now that Five Star - the largest single party in Italy\u0027s hung parliament - have confirmed that they like the League will vote against.In the meantime factions in both houses had been trying to reach agreement over how long Cottarelli\u0027s caretaker mandate would last before new elections are held, with officials from the centre-left Democratic Party calling for the country to go to the polls as early as July.That could only happen if the parliament was dissolved before Friday.A more likely scenario is new elections in early October, should Di Maio and Salvini not agree on moving Savona to another ministry.So far, Salvini has made no secret of his hostility to trying again with Mattarella before fresh elections.      Investors have been dumping Italian government bondsImpact on Britain\u0027s economy?Britain is not in the Eurozone and UK banks have already reduced their exposure to Italy, so the impact is limited, for now. However, the FTSE 100 has been pummelled, with £25 billion wiped off the value of the blue chip index on Tuesday.Italy abandoning the euro would also be bad for Europe as a whole as it would be likely to trigger a financial crisis in one of the continent\u0027s biggest economies.The pound would normally benefit from a continental crisis as investors flock to safe haven assets, but since the Brexit vote the pound has fallen out of favour and has moved up only marginally against the euro.Political implications for the UK?Analysts fear that the Euroscepticism of the League Party and Five Star Movement could ultimately spill over into a Brexit-like disaster where Italy not only crashes out of the single currency but also out of the EU.But that is a long way off and Britain has its own political crisis brewing. Theresa May\u0027s Conservative Party is yet to ink a Brexit transition deal or give any indication whatsoever of how it plans to honour its pledge to deliver the \u0027exact same\u0027 benefits of EU membership from outside the bloc.What are the experts saying?Some believe that a full blown crisis is under way. Others, such as UBS chief economist Paul Donovan, think it is overblown.\u0027Everyone needs to take a deep breath and calm down,\u0027 he said.\u0027Bond market moves do not break up monetary unions. Bank runs do. There is no evidence of bank runs.

Pictured: One of the first Hydrogen detonation on the islandThese included skull deformities, missing or extra teeth and spinal problems.Two of his four children with Shirley were born with abnormalities, as were some of their grandchildren and great-grandchildren.RAF hero Eric was involved in early tests into the radiation caused by atomic and hydrogen bombs.In 1958 he was stationed in the Pacific Ocean on Malden Island and Christmas Island - the site of Operation Grapples, which saw the UK carry out some of its earliest nuclear weapons tests.Eric was ordered to fly his Canberra B6 bomber through a mushroom cloud left in the wake of a 2.8 megaton nuclear explosion on April 28, 1958, documents reveal.X-ray badges were stuck to his seat to measure the barrage of radiation as he and two others entered the mushroom cloud.They were placed behind his head, on both armrests and by his groin.The documents reveal \u0027care was taken to ensure as little shielding effect as possible\u0027 was given to the X-ray badges. Of course, this meant Eric and his crew became vulnerable to the deadly radiation.

The MoD continues to deny that Eric and his crew was subjects of an experiment, despite the emergence of new papersThey also note the time spent inside the cloud, the height of the plane and the time the bomber entered the cloud after the bomb detonated.The documents goes on to set out the pros and cons of the badges in measuring radiation. They also suggest re-running the experiment with moire badges.When Eric\u0027s bomber touched down after the test he began to experience vomiting and developed a rash - common symptoms of radiation poisoning.The documents, written by scientists running the experiments, show that Eric, who was 24 at the time, had his head exposed to 65 years\u0027 worth of normal ­background ­radiation.This amounted to 17,500 dental X-rays worth of radiation during just six minutes of flight.The badge placed near Eric\u0027s groin recorded a dose of 8.8 Roentgens - about 30 years\u0027 worth of background radiation.In total he received 18.8Rs, the worst of the three-man crew which flew that day.However, the MoD denied Eric and his crew was subjects of an experiment, citing the tests as necessary steps in keeping the country safe.

She was joined by the former MPC member Kate Barker and Richard Hughes, the Treasury’s director of fiscal policy.A Women’s Equality party (WEP) spokeswoman said the appointment of Haskel sent the wrong message about the Treasury’s commitment to improving ersity in important areas of public life. “It suggests that even if they had an all-female shortlist, they would probably still appoint a man,” she said.“Macro-economic policy affects men and women differently because of their different positions in the economy and outside of it. Austerity has disproportionately hurt women, and trade liberalisation and changes to interest rates can have negative consequences for women’s employment. “Unless and until the Treasury pays greater attention to these issues, we cannot hope to make progress on women’s equality.”Rachel Reeves, the Labour MP for Leeds West and chair of the business select committee, said it was “truly staggering that the Treasury has failed to appoint a woman to this role”.“The fact that four women were shortlisted shows that there are plenty of capable and well-qualified women but yet again the top jobs seem to be reserved for men.” The decision comes only weeks after Threadneedle Street’s deputy governor, Ben Broadbent, was forced to apologise for likening the economy’s lack of productivity to the menopause.Ministers have also come under fire after the publication of figures that showed women chair only four of the 47 public bodies overseen by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. A report by the department also showed that of the 36 public bodies that work in partnership with BEIS, only seven are led by female chief executives. FTSE 100 bosses were criticised by the business minister Andrew Griffiths after his department released a report that revealed their objections to promoting women to senior positions, leaving only a handful of women on the boards of large companies. Griffiths said the Hampton-Alexander review showed that women had a long way to go before they gained parity in Britain’s boardrooms.WEP said that while the government protested its dismay with the lack of women in the boardroom, it appeared to be unable to promote women when it had the opportunity.It said: “The government has today decried the pitiful excuses for women’s underrepresentation in the boardrooms of listed companies. The question is, what’s their excuse?”Reeves added: “On the day the Hampton-Alexander review has revealed that firms are dragging their feet on ersity and making excuses for their own failures, this appointment demonstrates the true extent of the challenge that still exists in changing the face of our corporate and financial sectors.”Haskel came to prominence last year following the publication of his book Capitalism Without Capital: The Rise of the Intangible Economy, and for his success in the Indigo prize for economics, which he shared with the Manchester University economist Diane Coyle.Haskell’s team put forward a plan to extend GDP to measure intangible and free goods, and also to measure the welfare of societies. His views chime with those of several MPC members who believe officials statistics fail to capture the workings of a sophisticated economy in the digital age.Carney said: “His broad academic experience and the depth of his knowledge on productivity and innovation will be hugely valuable to the committee as we seek to promote the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary stability.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/725683888aee718d09b98989ac1d9bd0c79f78e7/0_70_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5b6a949a7a13f32ec7ebc97a750253c4","title":"rail firm thameslink apologises for poundland slight","story":"Tweet compared disrupted service to retailer’s chocolate, prompting legal threatOne of Britain’s largest train companies has apologised after Poundland threatened it with legal action for comparing the current problems with rail services to the budget retailer’s chocolate.Thameslink has faced criticism over disruption since the introduction of a new timetable on 20 May.

He wrote that the new timetable had been finalised “much too late to permit adequate logistical planning” due to delayed Network Rail infrastructure works.

They portrayed European countries as morally depraved, harbouring a visceral hatred of Russians. The foreign ministry warned travellers abroad against the risk of being “seized” by vengeful western intelligence agencies.For residents of Russia’s vast heartland – the overwhelming majority of whom have never travelled to Europe – it was a potent and powerful propaganda campaign. Anti-European sentiment rocketed to its highest level since the cold war (the first one, that is). But in Kaliningrad, it was a much harder sell.A little parcel of land smaller than Wales wedged up against the Baltic Sea, Kaliningrad has no common border with Russia, which is almost 300 miles to the east – and unlike most Russians its residents travel frequently to the EU. The city centre is 75 miles from the Lithuanian border, and a mere 30 miles from Poland. At weekends and on public holidays, there are long tailbacks at both border crossings. Gdansk, the nearby Polish port city, is a particularly popular destination.“I travel to Poland a lot and see how people relate to Russians. Everything is fine, there are no problems,” says Alexander, a 35-year-old office worker. “The Poles are people, just like us.” Like many others here, he dismisses the state-run Russian media’s unflattering depictions of European countries as “lies”.Many Kaliningrad residents travel to Poland and Lithuania to stock up on western foodstuffs banned by Putin in 2014 in response to European and US sanctions. Although the quality of Russian-produced cheeses and hams has improved slightly in recent years, there remains a deep hunger for forbidden culinary delights: parmesan, camembert and jamón.“It’s just like when I was a kid in the Soviet Union,” says Alexei Chabounine, the 48-year-old editor of a local news website. “Back then, we used to go to Lithuania all the time to get meat, milk and other things that we couldn’t get hold of in Russia. Of course, there were no borders then.”“They see Europe for themselves and not through a television screen.”That’s not to say that Kaliningrad is a bastion of liberal values. In the compact city centre – a mishmash of Soviet-built flats, public squares and modern shopping centres – it’s not uncommon to see people wearing T-shirts depicting Russian Iskander nuclear missiles, which the Kremlin deployed to the region in February. Local authorities have cracked down on independent media and opposition activists, while NOD, the ultra-nationalist pro-Putin movement that blames westerners for most of Russia’s ills, has a thriving local branch. “Most of these people still go to Poland or Lithuania to do their shopping though,” laughs Chabounine.During the communist era, getting from Kaliningrad to Moscow by land involved nothing more complicated than an overnight train journey through neighbouring Soviet republics. But when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Kaliningrad suddenly found itself cut off from Mother Russia by the newly independent countries of Belarus, Latvia and Lithuania. A decade later, when Latvia, Lithuania and Poland joined the EU, Kaliningrad residents required visas to travel overland to Russia. This sense of geographical isolation is reflected in common expressions: ahead of trips to Moscow, people will routinely say “I’m going to Russia” one local laughed when I pointed out he was already there. On national TV, Kaliningrad is sometimes left off weather maps. The Soviet collapse was the latest twist in Kaliningrad’s strange history. Founded by Teutonic knights in the 13th century, it was previously known as Königsberg, the capital of East Prussia, where Prussian kings were crowned. At the end of the second world war, the city was annexed by the Soviet Union and renamed in honour of Mikhail Kalinin, a Bolshevik revolutionary.After Stalin expelled the ethnic German population, Soviet citizens were shipped in to repopulate it – many were Russian military families who described their move to Kaliningrad as “moving to the west”. Lyudmila Putina, the Russian president’s ex-wife, was born here in 1958. A key outpost for the Soviet military, the entire Kaliningrad region was strictly off-limits to foreigners until 1991.Yet Kaliningrad’s proximity to Europe, and its Baltic port, meant it was exposed to far more western influences than the rest of the USSR. Soviet sailors would bring back clothes, books and vinyl from western Europe and beyond.“People have always likened themselves to Americans – our families all came here from different places across the Soviet Union and created a melting pot with what was practically a new ethos,” says Oleg Kashin, a well-known Russian journalist who was born in Kaliningrad.The defining symbol of that era is the foreboding House of the Soviets, a world-famous example of brutalist architecture. This unfinished 28-storey building, which locals say resembles a robot’s head jutting out of the earth, stands on the former site of the 13th century Königsberg Castle, whose ruins were blown up in 1968 on the orders of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. (The area around the House of Soviets will house the fan zone for this summer’s World Cup.)Otherwise, very few of the city’s pre-Soviet buildings survived the twin assaults of an RAF bombing campaign and the Red Army’s three-month operation to capture the city. Today, the most high-profile architectural remains of Kaliningrad’s Prussian past are seven neo-Gothic gates that ring the former city limits, along with the Lutheran cathedral, a redbrick Gothic construction where Immanuel Kant, the German philosopher who died here in 1804, is buried. Souvenir stalls do a roaring trade in fridge magnets reading “Kant touch it” and “Yes, I Kant”. Also for sale: miniature busts of Putin and Stalin decorated with amber, the fossilised tree resin for which the region is famous. As the Soviet past recedes, Kaliningrad is rediscovering its Prussian history: there are calls for the use of alternative Prussian street names and to reconstruct Königsberg Castle.The phenomenon has been condemned by local Kremlin supporters as a sign of “Germanisation”. “It’s infantile,” says a state-media journalist, Nikolay Dolgachev, of the interest in Prussian heritage. “It would be like today’s Americans feeling nostalgic about Native American culture.” Pro-Putin political analysts in Moscow have gone further, suggesting that growing enthusiasm for the city’s Prussian past is a sign of creeping separatism.Critics say the accusations of “Germanisation” are ludicrous. “The term has no basis in reality,” says Dmitry Selin, a former gallery curator. There have been consequences, though. In 2016, the German-Russian House, a local cultural and educational centre, was forced to close down after being declared a “foreign agent”. And earlier this year, an Aeroflot steward was fired after referring to Kaliningrad as Königsberg ahead of a flight from Moscow. “Sometimes,” sighs Selin, “I can’t get help but get the feeling that the authorities want to fence us off from Europe.”For more on life inside the Russian cities hosting the World Cup, visit  Cities or follow on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05814a917d843000c0e30c1195d36f7cb4c85de6/0_110_5313_3188/master/5313.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e14447f72f9d61a961120a5eed31fcb","title":"lack women boardrooms metoo bored male excuses","story":"‘Women don’t want the pressure’ is the business world’s version of: ‘Well, she was wearing a short skirt’The age of #MeToo has also become the age of the excuse. The two come together, naturally: “I didn’t know she was uncomfortable” “she did come to my hotel room” “that was the culture then”.We also saw it when the gender pay gap data came out, men (it is almost always men) in these companies first denied it existed altogether and then, faced with the numbers, merely offered shoddy excuses.Now the excuse-mongers are out in force again: this time they feature in the government’s report on the lack of women in boardrooms, with the reasons given by companies for the disparity labelled “pitiful and patronising” by the business minister Andrew Griffiths. Do these firms use the same staff members to provide their lame explanations, one wonders, or have other men been promoted for the task?Excuses given included such gems as: “Most women don’t want the hassle or pressure of sitting on a board”, and: “There aren’t that many women with the right credentials and depth of experience to sit on the board – the issues covered are extremely complex.” The people making these statements are no doubt oblivious to the prejudice that underpins them, and that this prejudice is the seed of the whole depressing problem. It’s draining, watching sexist statements being used as excuses for why such and such person or organisation isn’t sexist. “Women don’t want the pressure” is the business world’s version of: “Well, she was wearing a short skirt.”I am tired of thinking about women in boardrooms, just as I am tired of thinking about the pay gap, and sexual harassment, and all the myriad other inequalities that come from living in a sexist society that mean we can’t just get on with our days in peace. There are feminists who deride such middle-class concerns as the proportion of women on boards, and, while I certainly agree that single mums and domestic violence and low pay all need more of our focus, I also wonder what kind of revolution so readily dismisses the fact that men overwhelmingly control most of the money in the world. My mother was a single parent, and both she and I have been carers, but I still feel it’s important for there to be more women at the top, too.All companies and some public sector bodies in Great Britain, except Northern Ireland, with more than 250 employees had to\u0026nbspreport their gender pay gap to the Government Equalities Office. All companies were due to report by 4 April 2018.Commonly known as the average, the mean is calculated by adding up the wages of all employees and iding that figure by the number of employees. The mean gender pay gap is the difference between mean male pay and mean female pay.The median gap is the difference between the employee in the middle of the range of male wages and the employee in the middle of the range of female wages. Typically the median is the more representative figure, because the mean can be skewed by a handful of highly paid employees.This is the reality of the revolution, I suppose – it’s a slow, trundling war of attrition, with the same issues cropping up again and again. The excuses from FTSE firms are particularly provocative. I feel sorry for the women working under these men, busting their arses every single day, working long hours, trying to climb the ladder, while the men in charge of them simply say women can’t take the pressure, that the issues are too complicated for their little lady brains, that there are no good women left ... But we should be wary of focusing only on the out-and-out dinosaurs here. As Philip Hampton, who has challenged all FTSE 350 companies to make sure at least a third of their board members and leadership are women by 2020, said: “Leaders expressing warm words of support but actually doing very little to appoint women into top jobs – or quietly blocking progress – are really not much better.”Pressure is mounting, and companies that pay lip service to equality but where men mysteriously continue to appear in well-paid senior positions, are under the microscope now. A male-dominated board and management structure simply doesn’t have a place in the 21st century. And tiring though it might be, we must keep drawing attention to it. It’ll be a slow change, but it’s coming."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf0ddd28c0dd0d386b190e61e651a399242b483b/0_104_3504_2103/master/3504.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d377592617bb6da810aeba818cf59b1f","title":"men victorians women harassed public etiquette","story":"Many women have similar experiences to me of being harassed. Adopting some historic etiquette could make a differenceWe tend to think of Victorians as stuffy and patriarchal. Images of trussed-up women and imperious men. Recently though I’ve been wondering if perhaps they had things right when it comes to etiquette and dating.I’m currently in Oslo at the Freedom Forum, an annual conference where the world’s most engaging human rights advocates, artists, tech entrepreneurs and world leaders meet to share stories. Last night I was sitting in the hotel bar with two female film-makers. We were having a brilliant and enthralling conversation … with prosecco. The best kind of chat.At the table next to us was a man on a business trip. He wasn’t part of the festival, but the kind of boorish English man I hate meeting abroad. He leaned in and said: “What is this event then? Why is everyone wearing badges?”I knew immediately his question wasn’t one of genuine interest but rather an attempt at an in with us. One of the women I’m with politely explains what is happening. He replies: “Oh, that’s why I couldn’t get a room tonight!” His friend repeats, in case we missed it: “He couldn’t get a room tonight.” My level of interest in his problems with hotel booking websites is minimal. So I reply: “Actually we are in the middle of a work chat.”His friend thinks this is some kind of invitation and sidles over to our table: “So what is this thing then?” These guys know how to repeat a question, maybe they’ve been watching Jeremy Paxman. Slightly exasperated I repeat what the festival is and elaborate slightly, mentioning activists from Sudan before repeating: “Sorry we are just in the middle of work chat.” I’m annoyed at myself for apologising but I’m trying to stay polite. He looks irritated, as if he can’t understand why we wouldn’t want him there. The boorish friend starts offering drinks. NO WE DON’T WANT DRINKS DO NOT BRING YOUR DRINKS OVER HERE!!!“In my London residence I have a painting by a Sudanese artist, it says ‘Freedom’ underneath it,” he continues. Now the conversation has become all over the place, none of it makes any sense. I think he’s trying to tell me he is rich. I still don’t care , what I care about is the conversation I was having before he interrupted us. Boorish man and the art collector mean nothing to me (although it would be a great name for a detective duo).He still won’t leave – maybe the floor is too sticky? We tell him that if he is interested he should find the organiser of the festival at the bar. He didn’t. Eventually we had to call it a night because of the persistence of these men. They wouldn’t leave, so we had to.It comes down to consent. We didn’t invite those men to join us and we made that perfectly clear. Everything was met with such base entitlement. Bar screaming in his face that he should go procreate with himself I don’t know what more I could have done, and even that doesn’t always work.On a similar night in Soho a year ago, I was out with fellow comics Roisin Conaty and Jen Kirkman. Some men offered us drinks in a bar, we refused. They wouldn’t accept that. We tried every tactic – polite, firm, funny, angry yet the men followed us from bar to bar. Eventually Jen flipped out, screamed in their faces and we nearly got arrested. One of the men told us his girlfriend had died in the bath and that we were horrible women. More emotionally manipulative than a Pixar film.It’s no wonder society has a problem with consent – it starts in bars, and clubs, in apparently innocent meetings where men just won’t take no for an answer. This isn’t a case of flirty persistence but an absolute demand to have the attention and energy of women. If a man can’t pick up social signals in a bar, what hope is there for the bedroom? I shared the Oslo incident on Twitter and had so many other women tell me their stories. One said that after explaining she was married a persistent man had said: “Why the hell are you out then? If you don’t want men to talk to you.” Her attention was his ine right.In Victorian times if a young woman saw a gentleman friend, she would have to take the initiative and offer her hand. The gentleman had to wait for the lady to recognise him before lifting his hat – using the hand farthest from her. These days men don’t really wear hats unless they want to appear interesting or not bald. However, letting the woman take the initiative is a great first step. Ask if they mind you joining the table. If they say no or the sentence begins with “Actually …” then take the hint. Better still wait for an invite from them. That way you can be certain that your company is wanted.According to Victorian etiquette, if a gentleman was calling he would bring his hat and riding whip to indicate that he didn’t intend to stay long. The gentleman would keep his hat in his hand. Sure if we did that now most people would assume it was some weird cosplay, but I think we can translate. If you have invited yourself over to a table maybe don’t take your coat off and start ordering beers until a member of the group has said: “Join us.”How long has it been this way? Maybe it is getting worse? Now “incels” have appeared, pushing the old idea that women “owe” men sex. I refuse to believe that women need to adjust their behaviour to accommodate men with rampant horniness and no boundaries. We know where that ends up … Gilead. So perhaps the way forward is to start educating the next generation of men – with a pinch of Victorian etiquette thrown in.• Tiff Stevenson is a standup comedian.

The time has come to balance things outIt’s often said that you can walk from Oxford to Cambridge without leaving land owned by the colleges. That’s almost certainly a myth. But as the ’s recent investigation has revealed, they sure own one hell of a lot of land.England is owned by a tiny number of people and organisations – and the Oxbridge colleges, with their 126,000 acres of land and property portfolios worth some £3.5bn, are among the largest institutional landowners. ’s analysis is the most comprehensive since 1873. But why has it taken so long to find out?Land ownership remains one of England’s darkest secrets. When I started sending freedom of information requests to Oxford colleges back in 2016, asking them to reveal what land they owned, many were cagey. It seemed no accident that the colleges that were happiest to respond were also the ones who owned very little, while some of the richest, like St John’s (total property assets: £250m) refused point-blank to disclose the information. It’s taken huge persistence by investigative journalist Xavier Greenwood to unearth the full picture.These latest revelations beg further questions about the responsibilities of our oldest universities to wider society. As places of learning first and foremost, Oxbridge’s admissions policies – and their shockingly poor performance in admitting students from more erse backgrounds – has rightly attracted recent attention. But the colleges are also corporate bodies with huge purchasing power, whose investments also demand scrutiny. The fossil fuel estment movement has made extraordinary gains in turning the spotlight on how universities are funding climate change, and successfully pressured many into ditching coal, oil and gas from their portfolios.I believe equal scrutiny is now required on land ownership, in order to solve the housing crisis, tackle a catastrophic decline in habits, and reverse spiralling inequalities in wealth. Many landowners, by monopolising valuable land in prime development locations, may be unfairly profiting from the housing crisis by hoarding land in the hope that they can sell it for more in future. How many of the fields and brownfield sites owned by Oxbridge are effectively land banks? Do the colleges’ property empires include any of the 60,000 long-term empty properties known to lie vacant across England and Wales? Where a college has sold its land to a developer, how many of these homes are genuinely affordable? On all these counts, Oxbridge might emerge blameless – but we can’t yet find out, because most of this information isn’t public. The colleges have not readily published full details of their landholdings, and the Land Registry’s datasets remain highly opaque and difficult to map.The colleges might respond that they are businesses whose responsibilities lie in turning a profit and then reinvesting that in education and research, and whose investment decisions are commercially confidential. But the universities are public bodies in receipt of public funding, and the colleges are charities, with a particular social obligation towards future generations – the students they educate – and a wider responsibility passed down by history. This historic inheritance includes large chunks of the land they own. That poses further questions – and ones that apply not just to the Oxbridge colleges, but all landowners. “Land … is the greatest of monopolies,” averred Winston Churchill, in a blistering invective penned during the battles over the “People’s Budget” of 1909, which threatened landowners with a land value tax. Churchill’s argument was that land becomes valuable thanks to the efforts of everyone – people who choose to live and work in a particular area governments who invest in public transport and amenities to make such places attractive to live in. But it’s always the landowner who pockets a disproportionate amount of the increase in the value of such land. Churchill, in common with many liberals, socialists and even some radical Tories of his generation, believed that land ownership was a special case – a share in the country that brought with it particular responsibilities. Land is inherently scarce. It’s also the bedrock of the economy: the food we eat, the homes we live in, the natural world that supports human civilisation. The idea that landowners should pay back some of the windfall gains they receive from rising land prices to wider society is something that all parties, in principle, now agree on. The Greens and Lib Dems have long believed in this, and Labour has made very encouraging recent strides. Even the Conservatives’ 2017 election manifesto included a pledge to ensure “communities themselves … benefit from the increase in land value from urban regeneration and development”.But getting big landowners to accept their wider social responsibilities is going to take public pressure. What we need is a new movement on campuses – taking the fossil fuel estment movement as its inspiration – to pressure universities into revealing their land and property investments, and encourage them to invest in housing that would be affordable to Generation Rent. That could light the touchpaper of a wider movement to fix the housing crisis by addressing its fundamental driver – the value of land, and who owns it.

A pause. “And back.” It must be hard not to look smug – he’s probably been dying for someone to ask him that all day.This is my first taste of audax: a noncompetitive form of long-distance cycling that traces its history to the 1890s, not long after the invention of the modern bicycle. I was expecting old men on steel-framed bikes with calves cast from iron and glasses held together with gaffer tape, cake and clipboards in dusty village halls, and checkpoints on bleak petrol station forecourts. Only part of that was true.A few years ago I wouldn’t have been far wrong. The London-Wales-London ride had been running for decades under the name of Severn Across, and until recent years the average turnout was around 35 riders.But ultra-distance cycling has surged in popularity. Just as runners who have tackled a few regular marathons might think “what now?” and have a go at an ultramarathon, increasing numbers of cyclists are looking for something more than a 100-mile sportive. This appears to be down partly to self-supported races like the Transcontinental across Europe and the 6,800km Transamerica, partly to the profile of riders like the late Mike Hall and partly to that familiar human urge to try for a little bit more.Spend any time looking into ultra-distance and audax events and you’ll soon hear about the 1,200km Paris-Brest-Paris and the 1,400km London-Edinburgh-London, which are both held every four years.Last year, organiser Liam FitzPatrick rebranded the Severn Across ride as London-Wales-London. This year the event sold out in under eight hours. FitzPatrick opened a waiting list but closed it once he had another 75 names. The flow of emails from disappointed riders continued right up to the big day.So what I got when I arrived at Chalfont St Peter community centre at 6am on a bright May Saturday morning was a lot of fit cyclists, some expensively cut Lycra and merino, a clutch of carbon bikes … and the odd crusty old-timer. Conscious that it’s all too easy to overdo it early on – a lesson learned from a few ultramarathons – I pottered along comfortably enough to the first checkpoint at Woodstock after 70km. I was somewhat surprised to be greeted by a full fry-up – some of the old reputation clearly still rings true – but I’d missed breakfast so wasn’t complaining.There is time to chat to fellow riders, so I struck up conversations, asking people about their setups (lots had dynamo hubs to generate electricity for lights and GPS units) and trying to pick up ideas for future events. Many are aiming for Paris-Brest-Paris next year, and a fair few tackled London-Edinburgh-London in 2017. The growth of ultra-distance cycling can be seen in the participation numbers for that event: 29 starters in 1989, 1,500 last year.FitzPatrick had warned me before the event that the mental challenge could be tougher than the physical. “What makes it difficult isn’t so much the speed, it’s that you’ve got time to think,” he said. “If your thighs hurt or you’ve got saddle sores then you might have another eight hours of this, grinding you down. When it’s three in the morning, when you’ve had a couple of punctures, when it’s cold and wet … that’s when it gets to you.”His advice for finishing successfully was to pay extra attention to staying hydrated (easy to forget on long events) and not to spend too long riding alone, especially at night.Following his first suggestion, I stopped to refill my water bottles outside the three staffed checkpoints – which meant I did spend some time on godforsaken petrol station forecourts. For the second, I teamed up with fellow rider Alex Kew when we found ourselves at the same pace.It’s not always easy to know when to hold back or when to press on, but I eased off when he was struggling up Yat Rock he paid that back many times once he’d recovered. As a time trialist, Alex couldn’t help himself every time we hit a long straight A-road – he was on the front, head down, powering away, and all I had to do was stick to his back wheel. The miles flew by. Darkness fell. Surrounded by silence but for the whirr of wheels and the sound of breathing, we negotiated gravelly, potholed single-track roads at 30mph with just a pair of small lights to fight the pitch-black night. The company took a lot of stress out of it.London-Wales-London is not a race (technically it’s a randonné). Riders are free to complete the 407km at whatever speed they want so long as they average 15-30kph. That made the earliest allowable finish 10.30pm the latest was 9am the next day.With no serious mechanicals, Alex and I rolled into Chalfont just before midnight. The fastest riders – including world 24-hour time trial champion Jasmijn Muller – were back before it got dark. The last rolled in at 8.20am. London-Wales-London (or Chalfont-Chepstow-Chalfont, as one wag had it) certainly lives up to its epic new name. Whether you’re an old-school audaxer or someone dressed head to toe in Rapha with a fetish for sleeping in bus shelters, it’s a welcoming way to explore. And it’s an antidote to overblown sportives. Rolling in after 407km, we got our brevet cards stamped and tucked into warming bowls of homemade daal. There were no spectators lining the finish chute, no bag of freebies, no medals – but it was all the better for it.London-Wales-London 2019 will run on 4 May"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29e5636f85fd43bc99cdf7264d72e25c64a67130/0_183_3600_2159/master/3600.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4c687012dc99958afd6934af5eb0c1b7","title":"adrift review shipshape shailene woodley keeps survival drama buoyant","story":"The Divergent star puts in a career-best performance, while director Baltasar Kormákur keeps interest levels up on this fact-based lost-at-sea adventureCall her Tami. Some years ago (never mind when in the 1980s precisely) having little or no money in her purse, and nothing particular to interest her in San Diego, she thought she would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. And does she have a story for you!Tami is played by Shailene Woodley, one of the producers of Baltasar Kormákur’s effective lost-at-sea survival drama Adrift. Woodley is in almost every shot of this based-on-a-true-story film. She’s a free spirit falling in love with fellow far-from-home drifter Richard (Sam Claflin) on the way up, and holding on for dear life before nature’s violent indifference on the way down. Adrift’s screenplay moves back and forth in waves, so we open in medias mess the fancy yacht she and Richard were hired to sail from Tahiti to California has been almost completely destroyed and is meandering somewhere in the Pacific. We learn how our two nautical heroes ended up in such a predicament just in time for the well-plotted twin climax.The interlaced plotting is quite clever, and those story smarts are mirrored in Kormákur’s shooting style. When most of your movie is set on a very small boat you’ve got to get creative, and his camera is constantly plunging overboard or framing Woodley and Claflin in peculiar ways. The storm sequence is terrifying to the point that my head soon throbbed, and I almost became nauseous. I hope the effects team will take this as a compliment.But it wasn’t just due to the effects. The high seas terror had such impact because, by this point, we’ve grown to really care for Tami and Richard. Their French Polynesian courtship isn’t revolutionary film-making, but it is sweet and sincere. Kormákur lets the far-flung setting and a particularly romantic Tom Waits cover do a lot of heavy lifting, and one can’t ignore that Woodley and Claflin, who are rarely seen in anything other than swimwear, are quite appealing frolicking in the surf or smooching in the fo’c’sle.Then there are the moments of great peril, in which horrifying gashes are revealed, and the audience all inhales through their teeth as one. (This phenomenon, for which I don’t think there is a proper name, happened at least three times during the New York mixed press and public screening.) Adrift works best when we’re watching smart people figure confront their next obstacle before time runs out, be it a tripped-up rudder or decreasing water supply. A bad injury keeps Richard on his back, so Tami is the one left to do all the hard work as they hope to steer their nearly collapsed vessel to Hawaii.Adrift doesn’t have quite the existential gut-punch of JC Chandor’s similar All Is Lost or the recent Cannes debut Arctic , but what it lacks in the department of pure howling cinema, it makes up for with the emotion of its central relationship. Woodley, whom I’ve never considered a great thespian, pushes herself to the limit, and runs the gamut from traumatised to triumphant. It’s leagues ahead of anything she’s done before. The row of sobbing teen girls behind me suggests this might even be a hit. I, for one, am now more committed than ever to travelling by rail."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a1b50cff2d36db06c88b5a43a9ebc25dc16ac36/646_0_2832_1700/master/2832.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4fa202da2df7702970fbbe3fad6c78d8","title":"my friend dahmer review jeffrey dahmer marc myers john backderf","story":"This eerily unsettling biopic explores the tormented high-school years of multiple murderer Jeffrey DahmerThe Childhood of a Serial Killer could be an alternative title for this queasily gripping movie from writer-director Marc Meyers. It’s about the teenage years of Jeffrey Dahmer in the 1970s and especially his high-school penchant for pretending to have epileptic fits – to the hilarity of his nasty and fickle friends. What sort of a creep mocks people with a physical disability do you imagine? And what sort of a community rewards such a creep with anti-establishment hero status? The film shows the teenage Dahmer going on a school trip to Washington DC, entering the White House and meeting the vice-president, Walter Mondale. The film has embellished things a bit. In real life, Dahmer only got to watch Mondale working and didn’t actually speak to him. But this brings Dahmer closer to America’s current zeitgeist than is comfortable.My Friend Dahmer is based on the 2012 autobiographical graphic novel by cartoonist John “Derf” Backderf, all about his true-life, high-school acquaintance with Dahmer, who was later to become one of the nation’s most notorious serial murderers. This film shows how Derf (Alex Wolff) and his cool-outsider nerd friends cruelly took up the unhappy and lonely weirdo Dahmer (Ross Lynch), entranced by his loser glasses, short-sleeved shirts and intensively laundered blue jeans. They kept him around as their mascot and cartoon muse, laughing sort-of with him and sort-of at him.Derf drew him in various ironic poses and encouraged Dahmer to do his bad-taste comedy routine: pretending to have epilepsy or cerebral palsy, moaning and keening and thrashing in shopping malls or school corridors to freak out teachers and members of the public who could never be entirely sure it wasn’t genuine. Gradually, the humiliation dawned on Dahmer and added to the nightmare of his unhappy home life and his festering obsessions.Before Donald Trump’s notorious impersonation of the disabled New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, the key pop culture reference for this grisly situationist wheeze might have been Lars von Trier’s 1998 film The Idiots, all about a group of people dedicated to “spazzing” in public as an anti-bourgeois theatrical stunt. But this movie puts a different light on things. Did Derf himself create Dahmer the serial killer with his gigglingly ironic drawings? From Ghost World to Napoleon Dynamite, nerds are traditionally the good guys and the underdog heroes. The revenge of the nerds means that victimised geeks will inherit the earth, from Mark Zuckerberg and Steve Jobs to Trey Parker and Matt Stone, who emerged from their own unhappy schooldays to become creators of South Park and Team America: World Police. My Friend Dahmer taps into something else: the dark side of geekdom, geek rage and geek hate. And mightn’t Dahmer himself have congratulated himself on his nerd destiny: the loser who became super-famous while his tormentors just peaked in high school?Ross Lynch is eerily good as Dahmer, like a very young Philip Seymour Hoffman – stolidly silent, heavy-footed, incubating his resentments. He has a shed out in the yard for dissolving roadkill animals in acid, a preoccupation very much disapproved of by his dad Lionel (Dallas Roberts) who nonetheless senses that Jeff may have inherited this obsessional quality from him. Anne Heche is hilarious as Jeff’s boozy, unstable mother who is a terrible cook and insists the family eat her calamitous dishes as a learning experience. “We eat our mistakes,” she says cheerily – an unfortunate motto, considering her son’s later adventures in cannibalism – and she will later hurt Jeff’s feelings during the orce proceedings by appearing to argue that she should be given custody of his younger brother Dave (Liam Koeth) while not caring about Jeff. Meanwhile, Jeff cultivates his own obsession with animal cruelty and with stalking the town doctor (Vincent Kartheiser) who jogs past his house every other day.As ever, it is high school that is the theatre of cruelty, an arena of fear and harm and an unforgettably important place where, for many, life itself is real in a way it will never be again. The film bears the traces of its graphic-novel origin in the black-comic foregrounding of faces, characters, situations marooned in ennui and dismay. Derf himself never quite faces up to what he has arguably done, although there is a cold-sweat moment when it looks as if he will receive the serial-killer version of poetic justice. His friendship with Dahmer was never to be consummated."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/765c566f8efaebe6553bb4b40cce0c61fdee4f16/0_281_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac676f6d378d473814663ea1ad6fb3a2","title":"picturehouse staff to picket again during sundance london","story":"An ongoing pay dispute between union members and the cinema chain over pay and benefits looks set to affect diffusion festival, first disrupted in 2017Cinema workers are set to disrupt Sundance London, the capital’s independent film festival, for a second year in a row. Workers at the Picturehouse Cinemas chain, which hosts screenings and evenings, will picket Thursday’s opening night event, as well as striking for two days. Members of cinema workers’ union, Bectu, have been engaged with Picturehouse management for two years in a dispute over pay and union recognition. Striking workers say Picturehouse refuses to negotiate over issues such as sick and parental pay, and the London living wage (currently £10.20). Sundance London, which screens selected titles from the Utah-based festival in the spring, runs for four days at Picturehouse Central, near Piccadilly Circus. Key UK premieres include Debra Granik’s Leave no Trace, much-acclaimed horror Hereditary and Paul Schrader’s comeback, First Reformed.Workers plan to picket on Thursday evening, and strike at Central, Hackney, East Dulwich and Crouch End Picturehouses on Thursday and Saturday. Their roles will be filled by cover staff, who also understudied at last year’s festival and during numerous other strikes. Speaking to the , Alisdair Cairns, a projectionist at Hackney Picturehouse, said workers felt “let down” that Sundance had renewed their relationship with the chain. Cairns described the decision as “disappointing”, particularly given that Sundance London’s programming highlights issues of wealth inequality. In a statement, representatives for the strikers pointed out that the likes of the Human Rights Watch Film Festival and the London Short Film Festival had severed ties with Picturehouse over the dispute “because of the negative impact on their reputations”.“We call on Sundance,” they continued, “as well as others including the BFI London film festival to encourage Picturehouse to resolve this dispute, or withdraw from their partnerships moving forward. This industrial dispute is widely recognised within the industry, and workers will continue to use their human right to withdraw labour until the industry itself treats financial inequality in the same vain as all other abuses.”Sundance confirmed they were aware of the dispute. “As an arts organisation that champions independent voices,” they said, “we have long believed in the importance of free speech and support the right to take industrial action. We understand and acknowledge this is a complex issue between Picturehouse and their employees.”Picturehouse was bought by Cineworld in 2012 the chain currently includes 24 boutique-style cinemas. A standard adult ticket at Picturehouse Central costs £16.50. Last year, Ian McKellen, Susan Sarandon and Mark Rylance were among high-profile names backing a boycott of the chain until staff were paid the London living wage. At their AGM in May 2018, a substantial pay increase was agreed for Cineworld CEO Mooky Greidinger, who is already thought to receive a seven-figure salary. Currently with the employment tribunal is the case of two union reps dismissed over cyber-picketing. Obi Saiq, a striker at Hackney Picturehouse, told PA: “We take no pleasure in disrupting the festival – but unless Picturehouse is willing to sit down and talk to its workers, we have no choice.“We staff a chain of cinemas which makes over a hundred million pounds’ worth of profit – but we go home to flats we can’t afford to rent, and regularly have to choose between heating and food.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ff68bc5cef4df3598b9910c4c1bc9139d4fa7d6/0_419_3777_2266/master/3777.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ed0b914142bda24a5db5fa371f0e67c","title":"a beginners guide to the world cup 2018 when does the world cup start","story":"From when does the World Cup start to who’s likely to win football’s greatest prize – the 2018 tournament explainedThe Fifa World Cup is an international football tournament contested by 32 nations every four years. This year’s competition kicks off on 14 June, when hosts Russia play Saudi Arabia in Moscow’s Luzhniki Stadium. After a total of 64 matches played in 12 venues across 11 different Russian cities, the champions will be crowned in the same arena on 14 July. It is, without question, the biggest, most prestigious sporting event on the planet.OK, so who organises it and for how long has it been “a thing”?Fifa stands for the Féderation Internationale de Football Association and their third president Jules Rimet was the innovator behind the first World Cup, an invitational tournament contested by just 13 teams that was staged and won by Uruguay in 1930. This year’s tournament will be the 21st.With just 32 teams taking part, an awful lot of nations must miss out. That hardly seems fair.With the exception of Russia, who qualify automatically as hosts, the other 31 teams all had to go through a rigorous two-year qualifying process to make it this far. Fifa has 211 national association affiliates spread across six different confederations around the globe.Did any traditionally “big” countries not make it?England were the only “home nation” to qualify, while Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland all failed with varying degrees of predictability. The USA, the Netherlands, South American champions Chile, Africa Cup of Nations winners Cameroon and the four-times World Cup winners Italy are among the most high profile nations to miss out on qualification for Russia 2018. For many international powerhouses, qualifying is invariably little more than a formality. For others it is an incredible achievement.Iceland will contest their first World Cup finals this summer and with a population of just 335,000 are the smallest country to qualify in the history of the competition.How will a winner be decided from those who did make the cut?The 32 countries have already been drawn into eight groups of four teams which will be decided on a round robin basis. The top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stages, which is when things start to get really tense.What happens if any of these knockout matches end in a draw?If the sides are level after 90 minutes, they play an additional 30 minutes of extra time.And if they’re still level?The outcome is decided by a penalty shoot-out. There have been 26 in World Cup finals history and both Brazil (1994) and Italy (2006) have actually won finals by this very stressful method.Who is expected to win this year’s tournament?It’s a tough one to call. Germany are the holders and are expected to be in the shake-up again, while Brazil, France, Spain and Argentina are other former winners who many expect to do well.Have England ever won the World Cup?Once, in 1966 and they’re still dining out on it over 50 years later.Tell me more ...As tournament hosts, they beat Germany 4-2 in the final at Wembley Stadium to win the Jules Rimet Trophy.The what now?The Jules Rimet Trophy. It was originally called Victory but later renamed in honour of the Fifa president who dreamt up the World Cup. Brazil got to keep it after winning it for the third time in 1970, but it was stolen 13 years later and has never been returned.So what do the winners get now?Acclaim, medals, hero status in their homeland and a hefty financial bonus from their national Football Association. They also get presented with the Fifa World Cup trophy, which is just shy of 37 centimetres in height and weighs 6.1 kilograms. Made of 18 carat gold with a malachite base, it depicts two human figures holding up the earth. It is arguably the most iconic trophy in all of sport.Such a popular event must generate a lot of cash. Who gets it all?Anything else I should know?This year’s tournament will be the first World Cup in which Video Assistant Referees (VAR) will be used to help referees avoid making potentially match-deciding mistakes when it comes to such important issues as awarding goals, penalties or doling out red cards. It will also referees avoid cases of mistaken identity, as has been known to happen from time to time.Sounds like a good idea ...It certainly does in theory, but many are predicting disaster once it’s put into practice. VAR has been tested in a number of tournaments around the world, often with hilarious consequences and a number of referees will arrive in Russia with no prior experience of using it. While Fifa are confident it will be a success, many doom-mongers are predicting that VAR could become the main, unwelcome talking point of Russia 2018.If I want to sound knowledgable in front of people who know more about the World Cup than I do, what should I say?“It’s strange that nobody is mentioning Uruguay as likely winners even though they finished ahead of Argentina in their qualifying group.”If I want to sound knowledgable in front of people who know more about the World Cup than I do, what should I not say?“It’s strange that nobody is mentioning England as likely winners even though they finished ahead of Scotland in their qualifying group.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/827ce48d7537b7de46febba5b75e84e9bc0ab9dc/0_1_4424_2655/master/4424.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8bffc1bc8c5fdba3e252b2c0e5ebef15","title":"chelsea shelve stamford bridge investment climate","story":"Chelsea’s new stadium project has been put on hold “due to the current unfavourable investment climate”.

It would be encouraging to think the country has finally grown out of such cliched insularity, or belatedly realised that the rest of the world finds our endless optimism amusing, though the truth is rather more painful.England has simply learned not to expect very much any more. We are now a country who could not hold on to a one-goal lead against Iceland. The team that went to Brazil for the last World Cup and crashed out before the group stage had concluded. England have not won a knockout match at a World Cup since beating Ecuador in Stuttgart in 2006, so long ago that Antonio Valencia had not yet signed for Wigan Athletic, never mind Manchester United.Looking back it is easy to form the conclusion that England have lost the knack of playing well in tournaments, or that players are too exhausted by the Premier League season to be at their best in summer. If history tells us anything, it is that England are getting worse at performing on the world stage, so it is probably wise not to build up hopes that will quickly be dashed. There are even people suggesting that England ought to simply use this World Cup as a practice run for the next one. The squad is so young it will still be more or less intact in four years, the argument runs, so rather than burdening the players with unnecessary hope and expectation why not allow them a free hit this time in order that they might hit the ground running in Qatar.Refreshingly, this defeatist notion is being rejected by the players themselves. Give us a chance to show what we can do is the common refrain emerging from press conferences. We are a new squad with a new manager and we believe we have an opportunity to impress.This has got to be the right attitude for several reasons, the first being that conditions in Qatar, where temperatures will be very high, are unlikely to suit English players as much as conditions in Russia. The second is that while qualification for the 2022 World Cup should not prove too great a hurdle, England as yet have no idea who they will find in their group or how difficult progress might be. Whereas at the moment they know they are in a group with Panama, Tunisia and Belgium, and though the last might sound a little scary, depending on points and performances from the first two games it need not be a win or bust situation.Belgium seem to have a remarkable generation of players at the moment, though their tournament record is not that impressive. Roberto Martínez is untried as a tournament manager, having got the job only because Marc Wilmots was dismissed two years ago after Belgium were knocked out of Euro 2016 by Wales. England do not find themselves in a group of death, to put it mildly, and if they can make it out of Group G the only opponents it is possible to face will be Poland, Colombia, Senegal or Japan. England are perfectly capable of losing to any of those sides, of course (after the last couple of tournaments nothing can be taken for granted) though any self-respecting side ought to view this draw as a possible route to the quarter-finals rather than something too daunting for a young and inexperienced group to take on.Yet the main reason for urging the present squad to go for broke is because the fallow year argument is just the negative flip-side of the old, discredited, golden generation theory. What World Cup experience has tended to show is that it does not matter how many great players you have, or think you have. What is more important is how well they gel as a team and how confidently they get to grips with the tournament.Just as England never recovered from a bad start four years ago, a positive result early on – maybe in the first game, maybe as early as the upcoming friendlies against Nigeria and Costa Rica – can help generate the sort of momentum that enables a team to grow in a tournament. You do need good players, you will not get far without them, but you also need confidence and something best described as stickability or tournament savvy.Germany are the most obvious example of a team with all three attributes, because the more they succeed in tournaments the more confident and self-assured they become. Contrary to popular supposition this is not a uniquely German thing. England played with the self-belief one would expect of holders in 1970 and briefly gave a tidy account of themselves in 1998 as they built on the feelgood factor from Euro 96. If their most impressive post-1966 showing was in reaching the semi-final in 1990, when confidence and composure were found along the way after an unpromising start, at least it shows anything can be done.Players such as Sterling, Kyle Walker, Harry Kane and Dele Alli are confident at the moment after good club seasons, and looking forward to delivering on a bigger stage. Their time has come. Not to bestride the world, perhaps, although somebody has to. Just to do themselves justice, play without fear and show the world how good they are."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8e5f492666bb437b717e073ae9a77db18d0fe6b2/0_7_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=642d82f07ffab2438919cb3692d767e8","title":"frank lampard appointed derby manager","story":"• ‘I’ve worked closely with some of the best coaches in the game’• Lampard takes over from Gary Rowett at Pride ParkFrank Lampard has been named as Derby County’s manager after signing a three-year deal at Pride Park.The former Chelsea and England midfielder has been looking to take his first step into management and confirmed over the weekend that he had been talking with officials at Derby. The East Midlands club, who lost to Fulham in the Championship play-off semi-finals, have been without a manager since Gary Rowett left to take over at Stoke City last week but have now confirmed the 39-year-old’s appointment.Lampard told Derby’s website: “I’ve always wanted to manage a club with a big tradition and history like Derby County, so this is a huge opportunity. I have spent considerable time discussing the role and the club’s objectives with the chairman and board members.“We want to build on the top-six finish in the Championship last season while at the same time bringing through some of the excellent youth and academy talent we have at Pride Park.“This is my first job as a manager, but I’ve worked closely with some of the best coaches in the game and I’m confident in my own abilities and those of the team around me, including the board. I know it won’t be easy – managing a football team never is – but I’m really looking forward to the challenge ahead.”Lampard retired as a player in 2016 after a spell at New York City. He started his career at West Ham and, either side of his long period with Chelsea, had stints with Swansea City (on loan) and Manchester City. He made 106 appearances for England.Derby’s executive chairman, Mel Morris, said: “His passion and humility shone through in equal measure. The board were unanimous that he was the stand-out applicant with many highly desirable and unique capabilities. Few players have achieved what Frank has in his career to date.

Two decades of frustration made fans almost renounce their right to see the national team play at the highest level of international competition.But the arrival of the former Cambridge United manager Renard at the start of 2016 changed everything. The Frenchman brought a fighting spirit: most of the players had been around many years, but Renard added his touch of salt. First, he made Mbark Boussoufa step back from his attacking duties. Along with Karim El Ahmadi, the experience in midfield is consolidated by Younès Belhanda who completes a triangle when the team lose possession. The other main change brought by Renard involves the role of Romain Saïss, who became a central defender, switching from his box-to-box natural habitat. This has made the team stronger in the air. After Hamza Mendyl’s injury Renard made another transformation, using Real Madrid’s Achraf Hakimi as a left-back, a role he had never played. Achraf is a more technical player and has a fine rapport with the real playmaker of the team, Hakim Ziyech. The Ajax man usually starts on the left, before taking over the central midfield and sometimes swaps positions with Nordin Amrabat, the team’s raging bull.Up front Khalid Boutaïb plays a role of the traffic control tower and is a sharp finisher. Beyond the starting XI, players coming off the bench include Fayçal Fajr. “Fayçal is somebody who is essential to this group,” said Renard in March. “He’s capable of playing in the midfield five positions and helps me manage the ones that are not happy staying on the bench.”Renard is likely to renew his faith in a 4-2-3-1 formation, switching from 4-4-2 in defensive phases to 4-3-3 in attack.Which player is going to surprise everyone at the World Cup?Undoubtedly Hakim Ziyech. The playmaker is the most talented player in the squad and helped Ajax reach the Europa League final in 2017.Which player is likely to disappoint?The goalkeeper Munir has got the group’s confidence but hardly played this year with the Spanish second-tier side Numancia. He struggled when coming for the ball in the friendly against Serbia in March.What is the realistic aim for Morocco at the World Cup 2018 and why?Despite conceding only one goal in qualifying, Morocco will struggle extend their defensive streak. Everything depends on the first game, against Iran. They need to win, before facing Portugal and Spain, to have a chance of a place in the last 16, which could be the realistic aim.Amine El Amri writes for Le Matin.Follow him here on Twitter.Click here for a profile of Morocco’s Mbark Boussoufa."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80ab09f40927df8caf73e4b22230b8cf5f536e70/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2025770777df0c9dc2df02ab9688cf0","title":"world cup favourite tournament","story":"Maybe it’s the first your remember, the first you attended or the one when you had nothing better to do but watch every minuteAs Cat Stevens (and PP Arnold and Rod Stewart and Sheryl Crow) nearly put it, the first cup is the deepest.

For me and for everybody, I think the moment to change has arrived.

At this point we usually do a summary of events, a bitesize breakdown of what has occurred, but on this occasion it should be quite simple...Thanks for reading, and thanks for your emails. Oh, lovely shout here from Joseph Lam: “Xabi Alonso is getting into management: maybe he could jump right into the deep end.”Sounds like (most of) the Real players had quite a nice time under Zizou...“Left field suggestion...Jürgen Klopp, right playing style and would probably bring Salah and maybe Firmino with him.”Michael Edgar has a suggestion: “Ronaldo pretty much won the European Championship as interim coach for Portugal for all of 70 minutes or so? No?”It would be entertaining if one of the Real players tweeted ‘Good riddance, let’s get a manager in who knows what he’s doing.’ But for now, we’ll have to make do with this...Any left field nominations that haven’t already been mentioned here? And would just like to head off at the pass any ‘banter’ suggestions: I’ve set a filter on my email to block any emails mentioning the names Allardyce (Allardici), Pardew or Curbishley. Email me here.Some other names in the betting: Massimiliano Allegri, Joachim Löw, Diego Simeone (!), Laurent Blanc, Carlo Ancelotti...and then from that point it starts to get really silly. As I was saying about the look on Florentino’s face...Social media’s Toni Kroos is - I think - the first Real player in with the appreciation post.So attention turns to who comes next, and inevitably there will be some nervous clubs in the Premier League. Well, nervous club. Mauricio Pochettino is the favourite with some bookies, while Antonio Conte is also in the running. The sentimental might think Arsene Wenger could do it, having been approached a few times before, while Mauricio Sarri is technically currently unemployed. Guti is also high up in the betting - he’s their under-19s coach - as is Santi Solari, who has Zidane’s old job as coach of Real Madrid Castilla.Nobody saw this coming. If you believe him, not even Florentino Perez. But what a move it is: you sort of hope that Zidane now retires from coaching altogether, because what will top winning three Champions League titles in two-and-a-half seasons with Real Madrid, the club at which you were already a hero? Maybe picking up the shambolic pieces from France after their disappointing first round exit under Didier Deschamps at this summer’s World Cup, and winning in 2022? Actually, definitely that...but probably only that.And that’s the press conference over. There’s a hearty round of applause from the assembled media, and Zidane disappears through the press room door. Well then. Zidane is asked if this has anything to do with Cristiano Ronaldo. The question gets short shrift. “I think it would be difficult to keep winning if I stayed.”Interestingly, he says he was close to signing a new contract, but changed his mind. Zidane has spoken to Sergio Ramos, who supports him, and has sent a message to the rest of the squad. He says he doesn’t have plans to coach next season. If anyone has earned a long lie down, it’s him. He also mentions that he’s pretty tired, which tallies with this, as he said a few months ago: ““Being a coach is extremely tiring - more so at a club like Real Madrid, When I feel there is nothing more to give, I’ll walk away.”Zidane has repeated the line that he thinks change is required. “Big players need change,” he says. Which is true enough. Stop blubbing excessively, Madridistas, he could be back: “Of course, I could return, I’ll always be near to this club as it’s close to my heart. I think many won’t understand but I know it’s the right time. Time for a change. And for the players too.”Zidane said he “doesn’t forget the hard times” as he reflects: as he’s won the Champions League in all three of his seasons in charge, there weren’t that many hard times, Zizou...Floretino Perez is next to Zidane and has that look on his face of a man trying to stay calm but panicking under the surface. He said they didn’t see this coming and have no earthly idea who will replace him. Paraphrasing, obviously. Well then. Zidane, wearing a blue jacket with jeans, said: “I’ve taken the decision to not continue next year as Real Madrid coach.”Zidane has resigned from his post as Real Madrid manager, having won three consecutive Champions League titles, and the 2016-17 Liga title, it was announced at a news conference at the Santiago Bernabéu stadium"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0ec6e87c133f90c0cad5d128d89424f764b964e/0_346_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ae3e99f8abc10dc87680270f88398883","title":"how have a zero waste kitchen tips from jamie oliver tom kerridge skye gyngell and more","story":"Restaurants have a daily battle against wasting food. We asked top chefs for their home hacks that will save you money and give your cooking a flavour boostAccording to the campaigning waste charity Wrap, UK households bin 5m tonnes of edible food every year. That is 1.1m tonnes less than in 2007, a drop that, in CO2 terms, is equivalent to taking 2.2m cars off the road each year. But, clearly, there is still a lot that could be done to inspire us to use the ingredients we buy with greater diligence.Tom Tanner, a spokesperson for the Sustainable Restaurant Association (SRA), says: “It’s all very well telling people that the average UK household throws out £700 of food each year, but it can be tough playing Ready Steady Cook at home.” The SRA is attempting to help with its new One Planet Plate recipe site, a global inventory of sustainability-focused restaurant dishes complete with recipes.But faced with a fridge full of turning veg, the wreckage of a Sunday roast or pans of leftover rice, there is no such thing as too much inspiration. In that spirit, we asked a range of chefs who grapple with this issue daily to give us their waste-saving tips. Some are eco-conscious practitioners of nose-to-tail and root-to-fruit cooking (Silo in Brighton is Britain’s first “zero-waste” restaurant), while others are simply trying to keep costs down. Here are their household hacks, aimed at saving you a few quid and giving your cooking a flavour boost. Who said that saving the planet can’t be a win-win?We keep all vegetable peelings. Almost the best flavour is to be found in carrot, beetroot or celeriac skins. We make a simple puree using potato peelings cooked in salted water with herb stalks, then pureed with butter, pepper and buttermilk. To turn that into soup, omit the butter and thin using stock. We also make a peel coleslaw – at this time of year, from asparagus, young carrots, leek tops, beetroot and radish leaves – which you can dress with creme fraiche. Stir in honey, salt and any soft herbs for a nice summer accompaniment to roast chicken.Bread should never be wasted. If you look at great cooking from around the world, bread is often used stale and transformed into all sorts of tasty things, such as the classic Italian tomato and bread soup, pappa al pomodoro, or panzanella (tomato and bread salad). Turn already-stale bread into croutons or, if you know you won’t finish your loaf before it turns, thinly slice it and leave to go stale for perfectly crisp toast – it is a fantastic vehicle for tapenade or bruschetta toppings. And you can always blitz stale bread into breadcrumbs for crispy coatings on fishcakes or to toast and scatter over pasta dishes. Delicious.Take the breasts off a chicken, use the leg meat in a curry and, for a third meal, roast the wings and carcass to make a lovely bone broth. Add madeira wine and roasted vegetables, top it up with water and cook gently with fresh herbs and salt. Don’t boil it it will go cloudy. It surprises people that this clear liquid delivers so much flavour.You can pickle pretty much anything with a 3:2:1 mix of vinegar-water-sugar. If it can’t be pickled, it can usually be frozen. In the restaurant, we sweat vegetables in fat, puree and freeze them. That’s a good soup base. You can freeze herbs or salad leaves and mix them with oil to make sauces and pestos. I use the freezer loads at home. Label everything, though. It’s really important. A permanent marker pen is essential kit.Don’t discard meat fat after cooking. As a child, I’d eat my Filipino mum’s vegetables cooked in pork fat. In a Spanish kitchen, we use traditional recipes that emphasise the need of fat for flavour. We’ve used rendered ibérico fat to cook eggs, to flavour garlic soup and whipped like aioli to accompany fish. You can store most fats in jars in the fridge and they will be more effective than constantly using that posh olive oil that you should only use for dressing, not frying.Shop little and often. When I used to shop for the week, I’d end up with everything in the fridge going off, especially quick perishables such as salad leaves, tomatoes, cucumber and mushrooms, or going out of date before I got around to cooking it.Why not use the leftover vegetables from your Sunday roast to make pakoras? Any vegetable you have is fine. Thinly slice, add chopped onion, ginger, garlic, whatever spices you like and chickpea flour (about one-fifth of the total), make into balls in your hand, then deep-fry until crispy.The best way to reduce household waste is putting less on your plate. You can always go back for more. As for leftovers, dried fruit skins blitzed into a powder add an intense orange or lemon zest to cakes.Rather than a supermarket cauliflower that has been stripped of all its leaves and wrapped in cellophane, I’d encourage people to get one that has still got its beautiful green plumage. Don’t be afraid of using everything. It’s a versatile vegetable. We saute the florets, stir-fry the leaves or toss them in turmeric and ras-al-hanout and griddle them, and make a puree from the caramelised stalks.When we have a roast on, any ‘leftyeovers’, as we call them, go into the following day’s beef and potato cakes, shallow-fried with a poached egg and hollandaise. That would work a treat at home too.We dry vegetable peelings to make into flavoured salts which we use to season vegetables. It’s really easy: put the peelings on a rack in a really low temperature oven – a lot of modern ovens have a 50C degree setting – leave for three hours, blend in a processor and mix through sea salt.Once squeezed, good unwaxed lemons can be finely sliced, massaged with salt, packed in a jar and, after four days at room temperature, ferment into this lovely sour condiment. Use that as a relish or in any dish to replace lemons. The other day, I made olives, feta and pasta with preserved lemon. It was the best pasta I’ve had for ages.At home, prepare in bulk. Prepare dishes on a larger scale, freezing portions, and leftovers won’t exist. Not everything freezes well, such as rice, but you can cook those items fresh and be precise. Saucy things such as soup, curries and braises can be batch-frozen ready to pull out whenever it’s convenient."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1dc5dad67781274e8c4548341b87f25b5e6cae3/0_221_3319_1992/master/3319.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf04ca10ebfbb0e75807f2ada06c0d71","title":"truth about only children insular confident worry","story":"This week, Elizabeth Hurley said she would like to have had more children, as only children are insular.

Soon afterwards, another psychologist called Eugene W Bohannon offered a devastating analysis of the only child. They were “less venturesome” and “oversensitive” prone to “priggish self-conceit”. An only boy was likely to be “effeminate, both because he associates too little with boys and too much with the mother”. Bohannon did concede that only children were imaginative, though he put this down to “a lack of companionship” and besides, he pointed out, such talents could well be used for “the practice of deception and lying”.Such stereotypes about spoiled, lonely and peculiar only children have endured for more than a century, despite a wealth of research showing lone children are usually none of those things and often do better in many areas than children with siblings. But despite one-child families becoming far more common, our fascination with their implied unusualness endures. This week, the actor and model Elizabeth Hurley – who has a 16-year-old son, Damian – offered her own take on the issue, saying her one regret was not having more than one child. “I was one of three, a big sister and a little brother to squabble with and to love,” she said in an interview with Grazia. “Damian doesn’t have that. They’re very different, single children, more insular but very at ease with themselves, very self-possessed, focused.”There are obvious reasons for this. Often it isn’t due to a choice to stick with one child – or it doesn’t feel like a choice. Delayed parenthood, fertility problems, relationship breakdowns and financial pressures including housing and childcare costs can all result in a single-child family. But at the same time, evidence is mounting to show a one-child family can be a positive choice for both parents and child.Much of the only-child myth-debunking has been done by Toni Falbo, a professor of educational psychology at the University of Texas, who has researched only children since the 1970s. In one meta-analysis of studies, with Denise Polit, the pair found that “across all developmental outcomes, only children were indistinguishable from firstborns and people from small families” and did better than children from large families.As for being awkward and antisocial, one study from 2011 found that while adults who had been only children engaged in fewer social activities with relatives (which may possibly be explained by having fewer relatives to begin with), they found no difference in the number of social engagements with others, such as friends and colleagues. A survey of more than 2,500 Spanish teenagers found only children experienced higher rates of peer victimisation, but Hughes points out this may be affected by their perception of victimisation: “To some extent, siblings really teach you how to take the rough with the smooth.” A study last year, by Southwest University in Chongqing, China, on more than 250 college-aged students, suggested only children were more flexible in their thinking, and therefore more creative, though showed “lower agreeableness”.The clinical psychologist Linda Blair, author of the book Birth Order, says there can be huge benefits to this family structure, as parents can focus all their time and energy on an only child, “and also continue to have your own life. That means, in terms of the child’s point of view, you make growing up look pretty interesting.” In previous generations, being an only child “didn’t used to be so good for two reasons. One was that parents usually couldn’t have another child – it wasn’t because they chose not to – and the problem was that then they overprotected the child. The other reason was only children were in the vast minority, so they often felt bullied and left out. But nowadays, this is a positive choice for a lot of parents so the kid feels not that unusual and also they don’t feel overprotected, they just feel valued.”There are also downsides, Blair says. “One is that, even with the best efforts of parents to get their child to spend lots of time with kids their own age, they often feel a little bit awkward.” This is partly because these encounters usually happen in a supervised setting – nursery, or school, for instance. “So you don’t get the ease of street smarts that kids learn when they have siblings – not to get your Lego knocked over, not to get beaten up.” Children with siblings “learn to read other kids more quickly and easily. It still comes with single children, but it’s just not quite the same.” Blair advises going on holidays with other families with children of similar ages: “That’s the nearest you’ll get to a situation like siblings.”What may be great for a young child or teenager – having more resources, more attention – doesn’t necessarily hold true when that child is an adult, dealing with ageing parents and, eventually, being alone, with nobody who remembers the idiosyncrasies of your family or who shared your childhood. Although this assumes that most people have a reasonable relationship with their adult siblings. For every only child who remembers a lonely childhood there will be others who were traumatised by a bullying brother or sister.Hughes says it is not the number of siblings that is important, but the quality of the relationships. “There is no guarantee if you had a second child that your children are going to get on beautifully. I personally think that having a sibling is an amazing thing, but I wouldn’t want people who have one child, and don’t think they’re going to be able to have a second, to feel their child is inevitably going to lose out.”As for the perfect family size, says Blair, there is no such thing. “The perfect family, if you want the most psychologically well-adjusted children, is the number of children you have, because if you love them, they will be happy.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/005f17f40e080f04b984b4060ad9f0239e747f02/60_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f43f40efdba1329350cbb9026163924a","title":"we need to talk aboutveganism","story":"In this monthly podcast,  supporters share their experiences and put questions to a panel of journalists and industry experts.

The Financial Conduct Authority’s 18 month review into high-cost credit stepped back from a cap on overdraft fees amid fears that it would be challenged in court by the banks. Customers will instead be given more alerts via mobile phones, warning of charges as well as requiring the introduction of online tools to make the cost of overdrafts clearer.Messages on cash machines that customers have “available funds” that include their overdraft will also be banned. However the FCA said it would consider introducing a price cap on rent-to-own, where stores such as BrightHouse sell cookers and household appliances on weekly payments. It found that customers ended up paying more than £1,500 for cookers that sell in other high street shops for less than £300. The price cap, estimated to benefit about 400,000 people, is likely to come into force next April after consultation with the industry. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the FCA and frontrunner to be the next governor of the Bank of England, told BBC Radio on Thursday that “we don’t want to screw up” on price caps following a supreme court challenge that went in favour of the banks in 2009. But he opened the door to a possible price cap in the future. “Our immediate proposed changes will make overdraft costs more transparent and prevent people unintentionally dipping in to an overdraft in the first place. However, we believe more fundamental change is needed in the way banks charge customers for overdrafts.”Customers in rent-to-own shops such as BrightHouse will also no longer face a hard sell on warranties, which add significantly to the cost of an item. The FCA is proposing that shoppers can only be sold a warranty a day or two after they have bought an item, giving them more time to decide if a warranty is a good buy. Meanwhile catalogue credit and store card firms will be required to do more to help customers avoid persistent debt. In total, the FCA said the crackdown will save consumers about £200m a year. But campaigners said it has not gone far enough. Gareth Shaw of Which? said: “Just last week we revealed that unarranged overdraft charges can still be more than seven times more expensive than a payday loan – it’s wrong that the regulator continues to delay taking action, leaving consumers affected by this unfair practice trapped in debt.“Last summer, the FCA expressed serious concerns about how unarranged overdrafts work, and now almost a year later it is still refusing to take action. As the FCA continues to drag its heels, the government must urgently intervene to ensure unarranged overdraft charges are brought into line with arranged overdrafts, to finally help all those struggling from these rip-off fees.”The Bank of England has become increasingly concerned about rapid growth in personal borrowing, which is returning to levels unseen since the financial crisis. The Hollywood actor Michael Sheen, debt charities and the Labour party have applied significant pressure on the regulator to act.On the stock market, shares in banks and doorstep credit providers were largely unmoved. Goodbody Stockbrokers said: “The high-cost credit market will face little turbulence as a result of new regulation, a bit of a relief for the major players in this space.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4acde064b90eed0ebbc08c2d5a1365b86f7c94b/0_18_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=50531fb93c98e96fedee71e99dcb4402","title":"kanye west every album ranked","story":"As the rapper’s new album arrives on the usual sea of ego and controversy, we rate everything he’s done so far – from The College Dropout to The Life of PabloAs close as Kanye West has come to that least-disarming of hip-hop phenomena – the posse album – Cruel Summer was wildly uneven: stimulating and underwhelming in equal measure. Ghostface Killah and Jay-Z turned in strong work and West himself sounds imperious throughout, but all the big-name patronage in the world isn’t going to turn lesser names such as Cyhi the Prynce into premier-league talent.Recorded live at Abbey Road with an all-female orchestra, Late Orchestration is more impressive as an act of screw-you ostentation than as an album in its own right. It’s certainly not bad, especially on the urgent version of Jesus Walks, but it’s not an essential listen, other than as a signifier of West’s vaulting ambition.Devastated by romantic failure and by his mother’s death, West, who cannot sing, elected to spend an entire album doing just that, through Auto-Tune, to sparse electronic backing. The good bits are great – single Love Lockdown among them – but it’s wearyingly monotonal, so lost in personal misery that it dispenses with the wit and ambiguity of West’s best lyrics. Still, its sound continues to echo through pop.West hooking up with Jay-Z was perhaps less about music than a super-sized, follow-that event, and there are moments when listening to the pair discuss how rich they are starts to pall. But some of the music boasts the same ambition as My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and the lyrics occasionally flame, as on New Day and Made in America. At turns infuriating, superb, utterly original and deeply flawed – occasionally over the course of the same track – The Life of Pablo is a rambling mess, liberally splattered with moments of greatness (Famous, Waves and Fade) and haunted by the sense that its failings might be less down to hubris than the fact you are listening to a mind unravelling.The least appealing of his opening trilogy of albums – the superstar narcissism tending to the-paparazzi-are-worse-than-Nazis idiocy, the sound a little too calculated in its lunge for stadium-filling vastness – but still frequently fantastic. Forget Chris Martin’s ill-judged cameo and luxuriate instead in the euphoric Good Life and the Daft Punk-sampling Stronger.As striking a debut album as 2000s hip-hop produced, the endlessly delayed and tampered-with College Dropout was almost as good as West claimed it was. The sugar rush of his then-signature production quirk – old soul samples sped up to chipmunk squeakiness – matched by lyrics that already hinted at the complex, ambiguous figure behind the elephantine ego.College Dropout has better lyrics, but Late Registration just edges it in musical terms. The orchestral arrangements of Jon Brion add a new weight and depth to West’s sound, the hits – Touch the Sky, Gold Digger – are among his most impermeable, and there’s the unmistakable sense of an artist keen to reach beyond the usual confines of his genre.Forty minutes of abrasive, distorted hostility that drags everything from bovver-booted glam to industrial music to acid house into the mix, Yeezus is faintly marred by the feeling that West’s no-filter approach to lyrics is getting disturbingly out of control. It’s a still a stunning, bold piece of work, utterly unlike anything his peers were making.Its sound ranges from grandiose pop to straight-up hip-hop to head-spinning sonic overload, the key to this album’s ambitions may lie in its preponderance of prog-rock samples: from King Crimson, Manfred Mann’s Earth Band and Mike Oldfield, among others. Like prog, the album was dense, sprawling, complex and occasionally confounding a gripping, brave, sometimes contradictory meditation on fame, race, sex and money made by a man who occasionally sounds at the end of his tether – witness the uncomfortable cocktail of braggadocio and self-loathing on Blame Game and Runaway. But more often, Kanye is at the top of his game: pulling together wildly disparate strands of music (it’s a rare album that features Aphex Twin, Elton John, Gil Scott-Heron and Fergie from the Black Eyed Peas) into an endlessly fascinating whole that he’s yet to equal."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1d2bb52c515ec0ddac888fa6152f82e96e6d5b3/0_419_5176_3106/master/5176.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7dd7a1d7fd6d749b8d1cb138b4725ce3","title":"natalie prass the future and the past review musical magpie channels karen and janet","story":"(ATO) The singer from the Spacebomb collective scrapped two albums on the way to this brilliant final version, where old styles – soul, R\u0026ampB, tropicalia – never feel retroOf the steady trickle of albums to have emerged from Virginia’s Spacebomb Studios in recent years, the best might well be Natalie Prass’s eponymous 2015 debut. It seemed like the perfect collision of artist and place. As much a mad folly as a recording facility, Spacebomb is a studio dedicated to making records in the way they were made in the 1960s and 70s, complete with a house band: in Prass, they found a local songwriter whose tough nine-year apprenticeship in Nashville had left her with an impressive ability to craft songs that weren’t so much retro as timeless. Filled with glancing references to old southern soul, show tunes and classic Brill Building songwriting, you could imagine the songs on her debut tumbling out of a radio at pretty much any point in the last 50 years its opening tracks My Baby Don’t Understand Me and Bird of Prey imbued with that weird, covetable quality of instant familiarity, sounding on first listen less like a new song than old classic you’d known for years, somehow forgotten about and were charmed to be reminded of.But her Nashville apprenticeship had also left Prass extremely prolific. By her telling, The Future and the Past isn’t so much the follow-up to her debut as the third album she’s written since it was recorded: only one song on it survives from its two scrapped predecessors, which might account for how different it sounds. There’s a mistaken, if understandable, tendency to view Spacebomb and its artists as a kind of doughty musical equivalent of the arts and crafts movement, fixated on creating Rock the Way It Used to Be, but The Future and the Past gives the lie to that interpretation. There are certainly areas of the album that feature what you might reasonably call the Spacebomb sound – a swooning, string-section interlude called Your Fire the ballad Lost, which grows from solo piano to a subtly orchestrated climax – while another track, Far From You, offers up a loving musical homage to its subject, the late Karen Carpenter, possessed of a voice that Prass describes as “the most beautiful sound that I’ve heard”. She amps up the vibrato in her own vocals in imitation and scrambles the lyrics of Carpenters’ hits Close to You and Yesterday Once More, to depict the singer’s desperation to escape a limelight she never sought. But, elsewhere, if The Future and the Past takes anything as its starting point, it’s the oeuvre of Janet Jackson. Not the first name that gets bandied about whenever the Campaign for Real Rock meet to discuss the hallowed names of yore, but you can’t say Prass didn’t warn you. Around the time of her debut, she quietly released a cover of Jackson’s 1993 single Any Time, Any Place. A rebooted take on the jittery, staccato, then-futuristic sound that production team Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis constructed for Jackson’s breakthrough album Control fuels opener Oh My, Never Too Late and the concluding Ain’t Nobody. It doesn’t take a big leap of imagination to picture Michael’s little sister performing The Fire during the imperial phase of her career. R\u0026ampB slow jam beats underpin the ballads and the Spacebomb house band turn out to be as irresistibly adept at conjuring up slick, synthy funk as they were at imagining a mythic past in which Harry Nilsson signed to Hi Records. You can trace its musical roots, but The Future and the Past never feels self-consciously retro, never sounds like pastiche.Prass’s voice and writing are more than capable of handling the stylistic shift she’s initiated: indeed, they frequently feel liberated by it. Her usual vocal style is soft and understated enough that it’s easy to overlook what a fantastic singer she is. No danger of that on Never Too Late, where her voice soars without ever dragging out the melismatic fireworks. It’s all about control, and I’ve got lots of it, as Janet once put it. If every song here is exceptionally well-written – the songs that address the Trump presidency do so pretty deftly, with only Sisters feeling close to rote tub-thumping – the lengthy Ship Go Down and Hot for the Mountain are the most exploratory, off-beam tracks Prass has written to date, slackening the usual verse-chorus structure. The former shifts from eeriness to a gently insistent defiance – “we can take you on,” it repeats, again and again – while the latter starts out jazzy, and slowly builds into a stunning, cathartic final two minutes, as Prass’s wordless vocal wail swims through a woozy, distorted groove that audibly bears the influence of tropicalia, the Brazilian take on psychedelia that’s another of Spacebomb’s touchstones. It’s magnificent, as is the rest of The Future and the Past. Proof that you can be a member of a loose musical collective and out on your own at the same time.Whyte Horses – The Best Of It (feat La Roux)Odd as it is to hear Elly Jackson’s voice over tumbling guitar pop rather than electronics, this works perfectly."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c04b3f501596e33023603686f221471646a108a4/0_0_3500_2334/master/3500.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=8270b3a8ccce75d4cd5314415fef9b68 1400w","title":"ex ministers press theresa may for sensible brexit","story":"Amber Rudd, Justine Greening and Damian Green urge PM to ignore fringe viewsTheresa May is facing renewed pressure to listen to moderate voices within her party over Brexit after three former cabinet ministers lobbied the prime minister at No 10 to seek a “sensible” deal for leaving the EU.May met Amber Rudd, Justine Greening and Damian Green at Downing Street on Wednesday, and they told her the majority of Conservative MPs wanted a compromise deal with the EU.Rudd, who stepped down as home secretary last month, Greening, the former education secretary, and Green, previously May’s de facto deputy, urged the prime minister to ignore extreme minorities on either side of the debate.The former ministers have held informal talks with Tory MPs of various views to try to create a consensus for a “pragmatic approach” to the issue, the Times reported.Rudd told the paper: “That’s where the vast majority of the party is. We just haven’t been as shouty. We wanted to tell the prime minister what lots of MPs are telling us: sensible Brexit please.”The details of what a “sensible Brexit” might mean remain unclear, although Rudd said it would not involve the UK staying in the customs union: “Whatever customs union alternative we go for, we have to give ourselves sufficient time to deliver it. What is practical must be the guiding principle while protecting the Good Friday agreement.”One Conservative MP told the  that while he had not been personally lobbied by any of the ex-ministers, their project seemed credible. “It’s clear that they are very much in keeping with the mood of the backbench party,” he said.Downing Street confirmed May had met the former ministers on Wednesday, but said the prime minister regularly met parliamentary colleagues.The pressure on May over her Brexit direction is intensifying as she and her ministers scramble to put together a coherent plan before a meeting of the European council next month.There has been longstanding concern among a number of moderate Tories that the backbench agenda has been set too strongly by the European Research Group (ERG), the association of hardline Brexit-backing Conservative MPs led by Jacob Rees-Mogg.Rees-Mogg has joined hard Brexiters in May’s cabinet such as Boris Johnson in criticising the prime minister’s plans for a so-called customs partnership, and pushing for a more robust line.But opponents of the ERG line on the Tory backbenches are confident the hardline Brexiters do not have sufficient support to push their vision through parliament, and have been urging May to take a more moderate approach."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4af29c819fab3ba30f8c67acc68637b326f5ec1d/0_611_6369_3824/master/6369.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64959d1934bfb872c9e4636559107b84","title":"muslim council calls for inquiry into conservative party islamophobia","story":"Peer backs Muslim Council of Britain’s call for inquiry over ‘more than weekly incidents’The Conservative party has to stop denying it has an issue with Islamophobia, its former chair, Sayeeda Warsi, has warned after the Muslim Council of Britain called for an independent inquiry into the issue.In a letter to the current party chair, Brandon Lewis, the MCB said there were “more than weekly incidents” of Islamophobia within the Conservatives, mentioning nine alleged incidents over the past two months.In the open letter, the MCB criticised the party for failing to take action against the Tory MP Bob Blackman who was forced to apologise after sharing a link from an anti-Muslim US website in March.The MP for Harrow East has previously faced criticism for retweeting an anti-Muslim post by Tommy Robinson and hosting the controversial Hindu nationalist Tapan Ghosh in parliament. Blackman responded by retweeting a message that denied having invited Ghosh, but made no mention of Robinson.Lady Warsi said she backed the MCB’s call, adding that it was “a shame” it could potentially require such a public rebuke for the Conservatives to start treating the subject with proper seriousness.“What I would like to see is, first of all, people within the party stopping denying this is an issue, and then starting to acknowledge the extent of the issue, and then setting out a clear pathway of how we’re going to deal with it,” she told Sky News.Warsi, who is now a Conservative peer, said she had raised the problem with “successive chairmen”, and had written personally to Theresa May to seek action.She said: “Each time it kind of seems we’ve said, ‘Yes, we take these issues very seriously,’ and then shrugged our shoulders and moved on.”The peer added: “I hope the party will now deal with it. It’s just a shame that it’s had to be dealt with after a public demand from the Muslim Council of Britain, and an embarrassing episode of us all discussing it in a very public way.”She said the problem went beyond the actions of a few candidates, saying the party must also look at the “terrible Islamophic, anti-Muslim campaign” run in 2016 when Zac Goldsmith stood for London mayor against Labour’s Sadiq Khan.The letter from the MCB, written by the group’s secretary general, Harun Khan, reminded Lewis that when he became the chair, he launched a new code of conduct which includes the requirement to “encourage and foster respect and tolerance”, and that Lewis had since called on people to email him if they heard of bigotry within the party.Harun Khan said: “Yet no action has been taken against Bob Blackman MP who has now shown a consistent record of endorsing Islamophobia … Mr Blackman is not the only one who has fostered Islamophobia in your party.“Just last month, there were more than weekly occurrences of Islamophobia from candidates and representatives of the Conservative party.”The letter lists a number of alleged incidents that the Muslim group says took place in April and at the beginning of May.The list includes David Boston, a Conservative candidate who was suspended days before local elections for posting a photo of bacon hanging from a door handle, with the caption: “Protect your house from terrorists”.Harun Khan wrote incidents such as this were only representative of what was in the public domain and were just the tip of the iceberg.He continued: “We want all political parties to ensure that they are firm in their commitment against all forms of bigotry and discrimination. Our democracy should not be overshadowed by a isive culture within political parties that scapegoats minorities and alienates some who share similar political positions.”In response to the letter, a Conservative spokesman said: “We take all such incidents seriously, which is why we have suspended all those who have behaved inappropriately and launched immediate investigations.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/711277fc43eae1cd4cc5c4034ed67bc68f160bf0/0_187_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3e787bfea3514be71fe756d42c6c69bd","title":"scotland declines to introduce law for misogynistic harassment","story":"Campaigners criticise proposal to specify gender only as an aggravation to hate crimesCampaigners calling for an end to violence against women have expressed disappointment after an independent review of hate crime laws in Scotland stopped short of recommending a new offence of misogynistic harassment.The retired judge Lord Bracadale, who was commissioned by the Scottish government to undertake a root and branch review of hate crime legislation at the end of 2016, has proposed that gender should be introduced for the first time in any part of the UK as an aggravation to existing offences, along with age. Current hate crime laws in Scotland cover race, religion, disability, sexual orientation and transgender identity.But Rape Crisis Scotland, Scottish Women’s Aid and feminist campaigners Engender called for a bolder approach, insisting that a standalone misogynistic hate crime was the only way of disrupting “epidemic levels of misogynistic hate in schools, in the workplace, on city streets and online”.Referring to Amnesty International’s #ToxicTwitter report, which highlighted the scale of online misogyny, Bracadale said he hoped a new statutory aggravation of gender hostility, alongside the new offence of “stirring up hatred”, would create an effective system for prosecuting online hate crime and hate speech against women. But the campaigners argued Bracadale had not paid enough attention to international experience. “Other nations and states have found that simply adding gender to a laundry list of groups protected by hate crime legislation leads to underreporting, under-investigation and under-prosecution. We don’t want a law that languishes unused, giving impunity to perpetrators,” they said in a joint statement. Stating his desire for a “clear and simple scheme” that consolidated existing law, Bracadale proposed that the “stirring up hatred” offence be extended to all protected groups. He described the offence – which he noted was occurring increasingly online – as “a particularly serious and insidious crime”. Police Scotland warned recently that increasing numbers of recorded hate crime had an online element.Giving the example of the recent “Punish a Muslim” online campaign, he added that a cover-all offence would not interfere with freedom of expression. “Rabble-rousing is not the same as robust debate. The kind of conduct that amounts to stirring up hatred will usually be obvious from the nature of the conduct, the context in which it happens and the kind of language that is used.”For age-related hate crime, Brackadale said the evidence showed that much crime against the elderly was driven less by hostility and more by exploitation of the vulnerability associated with old age. He gave fraudulent telephone scams as an example.  “This is not a hate crime as such but I do consider it to be a serious problem. So I have also suggested to the Scottish ministers that they should introduce a separate aggravation where the offender exploits the victim’s vulnerability,” he said. Bracadale also concluded that no further legislation was need to tackle offensive behaviour at Scottish football matches after the government’s law to tackle such crime was repealed by opposition MSPs earlier this year.  He also suggested that any redrafting of legislation should include “intersex” as a separate category, rather than a sub-category of transgender identity.Holyrood’s minister for community safety, Annabelle Ewing, said the Scottish government agreed that the country’s hate crime laws should be consolidated into a single piece of legislation and would use the report as the basis for a wider consultation before bringing forward new legislation.

It is another chapter in a saga that began as soon as Andrew Strauss retired in 2012: The Curious Case of the Half‑Hopeless Opener.In 72 Tests since, Strauss’s old partner, Alastair Cook, has been ever-present, as captain or former captain. He has walked out to open with 12 different people. To paraphrase Graham Gooch’s famous line about New Zealand’s bowlers, it’s been the World 2nd XI at one end and Britain’s Got Talent at the other.There have been blockers (Nick Compton, Haseeb Hameed), dashers (Alex Hales) and jokers (Ben Duckett), young bucks (Joe Root, Hameed) and old salts (Compton, Michael Carberry, Stoneman), Yorkshiremen (Root, Adam Lyth), Lancastrians (Hameed), ex-Aussies (Sam Robson) and ex-South Africans (Jennings), not forgetting a doomed comeback by Jonathan Trott and a misguided promotion for Moeen Ali.Traditionally, when a batsman enters the Test arena, two destinies beckon. Either he sinks, like Gooch in 1975 (0, 0, 6, 31, instant discard), or he swims, like David Steele two weeks later (50, 45, 73, 92, overnight cult figure). The curious thing about Cook’s partners is that most of them have sunk and swum. The first man in, Compton, ground out two hundreds in New Zealand the second, Root, made a lovely 180 against Australia at Lord’s. Only Trott and Moeen flopped altogether. The rest have made several starts, managed a 50 or two, flirted with solidity, then faded away.A struggling opener can easily become a walking wicket, as Heino Kuhn of South Africa and Jeet Raval of New Zealand have recently shown against England. But that has not happened to Cook’s sidekicks. Together these 12 hungry men have an average of 27, compared to 43 in the same period from Cook, and 37 by the opposition openers. So the price in runs has not been particularly high. It is more about security: the house is built on sand.When the same thing keeps happening to different people, the prime suspect has to be the system. George Dobell of Cricinfo has just said as much in a tirade at the way the County Championship has been squeezed into the soggy bits of the season, where seamers rule and openers flounder. Nick Compton read it and tweeted: “The most sense I’ve read in years!”Yes, the schedule is insane. But there is another factor, sitting where, as Orwell said, things are hard to spot: right under our noses. If an old friend had had 12 partners in six years in real life, we would not be blaming them. The analogy, of course, is imprecise. But could it be that Cook, so admirable in many ways, is a tricky co-pilot?You wonder if his partners are intimidated by his records – most Test runs for England, most consecutive Tests for anybody as of Friday. Or by his methods – doing his own thing, batting in a bubble. You wonder if his very calmness makes a beginner more twitchy, if his resilience and concentration are somehow sealed off, unable to infect the guy standing 20 yards away. Cook, oddly for an ex-captain, seldom looks to dominate, to hit bowlers out of the attack or force them to bowl differently. The man doesn’t even sweat: how would that make you feel, in your sodden shirt, at the Gabba or the Wanderers?When he played one-day internationals, Cook fared best with an opening partner who was his polar opposite – Kevin Pietersen. The nearest equivalent now would be Jonny Bairstow or Jos Buttler: both are senior, right-handed and dynamic, and one could open while the other kept wicket. This seems the most promising way to change the script.But first we have Cook‑Jennings, the sequel. That old mate of ours is suddenly back with the girlfriend before last, and we’re trying to remember how rude we were about her. When England bat at Headingley the spotlight will be on Jennings and whether his rather wooden movements are better oiled now. The commentators will not be mentioning Cook so much, but they should be.Ed Smith, who loves a good chat and a lateral thought, would do well to take Cook aside today and say something such as this: Alastair, love your work, that 70 was tremendous, worth a hundred. But we need you to do more than open the innings – you’ve got to run the show. You’re the Chef, with Keaton as your apprentice. Get the best out of him, or get out of the kitchen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0aab76e900d1fd2b29a88f07b0d5e61aeb104dc2/0_33_4056_2434/master/4056.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5fef27a35107d4314bfbb35be58eded1","title":"ben stokes faces late fitness test ahead of second test against pakistan england cricket","story":"Ben Stokes is to have a scan on his left hamstring and is likely to face a fitness test on the morning of the second Test against Pakistan at Headingley on Friday.England’s key all-rounder suffered a tight hamstring during fielding practice on Wednesday and was limited to shuttle runs with the team physio the next morning – despite reporting a slight improvement.England called up Surrey’s uncapped teenage seamer Sam Curran on Wednesday as cover for Stokes."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fe73e514a5142094e00559be902a45a9d05978d/1518_1115_4050_2430/master/4050.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9fd7c959f417415cfd698932612596b","title":"how much screen time is too much for kids parents advice children digital media","story":"Parents have been advised to limit media consumption, but research suggests it’s the nature of it that mattersFor many parents in the digital age, battles over screen time and devices have become a depressing part of family life, and knowing how much is too much has become a moving target.Whether it’s three-year-olds throwing tantrums when the iPad is taken away, seven-year-olds watching YouTube all night, nine-year-olds demanding their own phones, 11-year-olds nagging to play 18-rated video games that “all their friends” are, or 14-year-olds who are never off Instagram, every stage of childhood and adolescence is now accompanied by its own delightful new parenting challenges.Up until a few years ago parenting advice centred around the concept of “screen time” quotas with a Goldilocks-style sweet spot of two or so hours of screens a day, beyond which media use could become harmful.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) still recommends a maximum of one hour of “high-quality programming” for children under 6, but thereafter simply encourages parents to “place consistent limits on the time spent using media” and designate screen-free time as a family.It’s unclear whether that means four hours playing a video game on a Sunday is okay, or whether it is better to have three 20-minute sessions with the iPad than one hour-long session. Is it really that bad if my 18-month-old watches a couple of episodes of the Twirlywoos before dinner?Many parents will be relieved to hear that recent research suggests that it’s not so much the length, but the nature of the screen time that matters. Whether it’s passive TV or social media monitoring, active video game playing, socialising with WhatsApp, or getting creative in iMovie.Jocelyn Brewer, a psychologist who specialises in the concept of “digital nutrition”, likens media diets to what’s on our plates: rather than counting calories (or screen time), think about what you’re eating. “It’s not just about whether you consume any potential digital junk foods, but also your relationship to technology and the role it plays in your family life,” says Brewer. “We know that using screens to soothe or pacify kids sets up some concerning patterns of relying on devices to calm or distract a child (or teen, or adult) from their experience of unpleasant or uncomfortable emotions – so we want to avoid using screens to placate tantrums, just like we want to avoid eating ‘treats’ to calm emotional storms.”For young children, the most important thing is whether parents and kids are playing, watching or browsing together.Another study from December by the University of Michigan on people aged four to 11 similarly found that “how children use the devices, not how much time they spend on them, is the strongest predictor of emotional or social problems connected with screen addiction”. But the authors said that concern over a child’s screen use is warranted when it leads to poor behaviour, loss of interest in other activities, family or social life, withdrawal, or deception.Talk about kids and technology usually tends towards the negative, but it doesn’t have to be so. The internet and video games can be fun, social and provide a new creative outlet for children. “Evidence-based benefits identified from the use of digital and social media include early learning, exposure to new ideas and knowledge, increased opportunities for social contact and support,” says the AAP. The consensus is that screen time, in and of itself, is not harmful – and reasonable restrictions vary greatly, depending on a child’s behaviour and personality. There is little point in obsessing over how many minutes a day your kids are spending with screens. Instead, parents should be doing what they can to ensure that what they’re watching, playing and reading is high-quality, age-appropriate and safe – and joining in wherever possible.“It’s important there is balance in the online and offline worlds and in leisure and learning, but what that looks like for different kids at different ages and in different families is hard to ‘prescribe’,” says Brewer. “Research shows that not having access to the digital world has a negative impact on kids – so its about finding the right amount with a holistic approach.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21a39e70de05402d8fc01bd8ea8f6934a9af9e01/0_0_5950_3571/master/5950.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=70291912b63b48000fdafce20871fba5","title":"hong kong city walking guide victoria peak to admiralty","story":"Descend from Hong Kong’s highest point into lush greenery, before exploring grand buildings, urban parks … and perhaps even a swish hotel ­or twoHong Kong’s Victoria Peak was once the home of the city’s colonial ruling classes, and these days its mansions still house Hong Kong’s richest. They chose well: topping out at 552 metres (1,800 ft) above the city, the highest point offers up views of a concrete and glass forest rising out of tropical wilderness. But there’s a better way to get a sense of Hong Kong’s mash-up of natural and manmade – a meander down the mountain.If you’re feeling energetic, then start out with the Peak Circle Walk, a clearly signposted 45-minute flat route around the Peak. The trail has views of the city’s skyscape and also of the island’s far greener south side, looking on to sandy beaches and motor cruisers anchored in sparkling bays.Time to descend into the city, along the Old Peak Road. The path begins with an unassuming flight of steps around the side of the Peak Tower shopping complex but this paved trail is a gem. As the name implies, it was the first path to run up the mountain and before the completion of the Peak Tram funicular in 1888 it was the only way up, either on foot or by sedan chair. If you’re heading downhill, it only takes about half an hour to complete the pedestrianised section. Dotted with colonial-era lampposts, the Old Peak Road descends steeply towards the sea. Gaps in the foliage reveal skyscrapers that gradually rise to meet you you’ll find yourself at eye level withluxury apartments and looking down into private swimming pools and tennis courts.Near the end of the pedestrianised trail is one of the city’s seven boundary stones: placed in 1903 to mark the limits of the one-time City of Victoria (implausibly, one of the stones went missing in 2007). The city has since expanded to sprawl across the entire territory but the boundary stones serve as a reminder of Hong Kong’s once smaller horizons.The road descends now into the urban mid-levels, where the well-to-do who can’t quite afford the mansions of the Peak live. Following the road down will bring you very neatly to the entrance of the Zoological and Botanical Gardens. Completed in 1871 on rolling plains overlooking the city’s government house, this gently landscaped tropical park hosts lemurs, cranes, meerkats and alligators. Exit the park onto Garden Road and walk down to St John’s Cathedral. The oldest Anglican church in east Asia was completed in 1849 and while it’s dwarfed by the modern skyscrapers around it, the interior feels like any British cathedral – with the exception of the lazily circling ceiling fans. Spiritually replenished, it’s time to cross the road to The Murray for some physical refreshment. This new hotel was once a government office tower, and its square, recessed windows were a careful bit of eco-conscious – and budget-conscious – civil service design. By setting the windows back and at an angle, the interiors never receive direct sunlight: thus cutting back on glare and saving the government a considerable air-conditioning bill. Gawp at the building’s three-storey pillared arches over a drink on the open-air patio. Now cross into Hong Kong Park. Built in 1991, it’s a gorgeous example of the merging of nature and modernity that Hong Kong does so well. The park is suffused with greenery and an impressive manmade waterfall – but glance up and you’re greeted with towers of glass and concrete looming overhead. Above them, higher still, you’ll see the Peak over it all and marvel you’ve made it this far. Make sure to stop by the Edward Youde Aviary for one reason alone: the multi-hued, ground-dwelling crowned pigeons that stomp across the floor.Head to Flagstaff House, still in the park. Built in 1846, just four years after Hong Kong became a British colony, it’s the oldest western-style building in Hong Kong. For many years it was the home of the commander of the British forces in Hong Kong: now it’s the city’s Museum of Tea Ware, holding a large collection of antique Chinese teapots. Next door, the LockCha tea house can teach you how to make use of all those pots you’ve been gazing it. Its restaurant serves freshly made vegetarian dim sum.Time to reacclimatise to the hectic city: a glance into the Pacific Place shopping mall flings us back into fully commercial Hong Kong. This shopping mall, redesigned by British designer Thomas Heatherwick in 2008, is one of the city’s most prestigious. But if you’re dressed well enough for it, then call an end to your downhill journey and instead ascend to Café Gray Deluxe on the 49th floor of the Upper House Hotel. This restaurant and bar has spectacular views of Hong Kong’s harbour, paired with equally fine cocktails. Order an Earl Gray Martini, and toast your descent into the city.The Peak Tram funicular (HK$37£3.40) runs from Admiralty’s Cotton Tree Drive straight up the mountain, hitting at times a 27-degree gradient. While the views are phenomenal, the queues can be punishing. The number 15 bus (HK$9.8090p) from the Central ferry piers winds its way up to the summit, or a taxi from Central will cost about HK$60£5.50."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66fb3fa02454160cd201fd83697e93e8de878ce7/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=66d3a102732907eeceeada953d36842b","title":"roseanne barr how sitcom could carry on without its star","story":"There are myriad ways the show could be revived following its cancellation over Roseanne Barr’s racist tweets – but it might be better to leave it buriedLeaving aside the grubby root of the issue, or Roseanne Barr’s rampant determination to keep making it worse, the cancellation of Roseanne has left one hell of a mess.A career is over, seemingly for ever. A television network is tens of millions of dollars out of pocket. A cast and crew are suddenly unemployed. The Roseanne writers, who started work on a new series the day the show was cancelled, are likely to be out of work and uncompensated for the season. It is, by all accounts, a terrible state of affairs.There are rumours that Roseanne may be snapped up, a la Brooklyn Nine-Nine, by a rightwing streaming startup founded by a former Trump campaign aide, but that does not seem likely. At this point, the show is so toxic that it is hard to imagine anyone but Barr wanting to taint their reputation by associating with it. Roseanne is dead – and it is going to stay dead.But this is 2018, baby. Just because something is dead does not mean that we cannot fix up the corpse a little. When Kevin Spacey’s career went down in flames, House of Cards moved on without him. When Jeffrey Tambor self-destructed, Transparent sliced him out and carried on. Admittedly, this instance is muddied by the fact that Roseanne is named after Barr – it is hard to believe that House of Cards would have carried on had it been called Kevin Spacey in Kevin Spacey’s House of Cards – but a shift of focus may be feasible.Already, Mindy Kaling has offered to write a new show for John Goodman and Laurie Metcalf, although you suspect that every writer on the planet would leap at the chance to do something similar, while Lena Dunham has proposed a Roseanne spin-off “starring Darlene’s cool kids”. I would be interested to see a show about DJ, a character who crawled out from underneath the wreckage of the Conner family in the revival and managed to become a normal, easygoing paternal figure like his father. A DJ Conner spin-off would be essentially Dan Conner: The Early Years, but without the enormous salary budget for John Goodman.Another easy win would be to refocus on Roseanne’s daughter Darlene. Sara Gilbert reportedly did a lot of the legwork to get Roseanne revived in the first place and we have been trained to watch Roseanne through her eyes, so a spin-off about her own family seems sensible. They could even throw in hints of Frasier, surrounding Darlene with people who are even more like Darlene to turn her into a lead character.What I am holding out for, though, is The Two Beckys, where Lecy Goranson and her sometime replacement Sarah Chalke are struck by lightning and end up living in the same house as two versions of the same character. Imagine the wacky hijinks. Goranson’s date ends up sleeping with Chalke by mistake. Chalke plays hooky and sends Goranson to work in her place. Goranson gets a stomach bug and Chalke ends up vomiting everywhere. These stories practically write themselves.The truth is that whatever ABC decides will not be beyond the realms of possibility. After all, Roseanne is a programme about a working-class family who struggle through life and then win the lottery, except they do not, because that entire series was written off as a dream sequence brought on by the trauma of Dan’s sudden death, which also did not happen, because he was miraculously revived for the new series. It was always such a messy show, packed with loose ends and go-nowhere ideas that burst on impact, that anyone could unpick it and find a decent new series to make.Which is not to say that they should, of course. In fact, they absolutely should not. Roseanne has caused such a noxious stink that the whole thing should be cemented up, buried and abandoned for centuries, like a broken nuclear reactor. We will all be much better off if we move on from this without another word."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6e0b11cbee994f98e49dcdaa0a3f136a2e83e414/210_419_3080_1848/master/3080.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=41c670253f83894cfc6b9a4d0eec4906","title":"for all its absurdity the babchenko stunt is no laughing matter","story":"While Kiev may have prevented a killing, the next time a Kremlin critic is murdered the first question will be: are they really dead? As dramatic plot-twists go, it was top drawer: gasps all round at a press conference about a murder investigation, as the star guest turns out to be the victim himself, smirking and very much not dead. The courageous, controversial and contrarian journalist Arkady Babchenko had not been shot in the back by an assassin, as Ukrainian government officials and gruesome leaked photographs had led everyone to believe. In fact, he had faked his own death as part of a top-secret Ukrainian security services operation to catch real would-be killers operating on Moscow’s orders. At Moscow’s House of Journalists, a memorial plaque to Babchenko was hastily taken down obituaries were taken offline or amended with a rather significant correction.The incredulity, and the delight among friends and colleagues that their sorrow and anguish had been premature, soon gave way to questions about whether fooling the world – and, allegedly, Babchenko’s own wife – for a full day was really the only possible way to play this mysterious special operation. “In half an hour I’m supposed to send the cover to the printers with a dead Babchenko and an article inside. What am I supposed to put on the cover now? Babchenko is alive?” wrote Vitaly Sych, the editor of Ukrainian weekly magazine Novoye Vremya, on Facebook. “Who does this? It’s good, of course, that he’s alive. But it’s a bit weird.”The saga was reminiscent of the ultra-noir comic novellas of Kiev novelist Andrei Kurkov, which often revolve around contract killings: one involves a depressed man who uses a circuitous route to order his own assassination.But this story, for all its absurdity, is clearly no laughing matter: Babchenko really did flee Russia in fear, and there may well have been a genuine assassination plot. The question is whether Ukrainian authorities, in preventing a killing (if that is indeed what they have done) did more harm than good, and whether there was any less provocative way to achieve the same ends. The next time a Kremlin critic is shot to death, or poisoned, or falls curiously from their balcony to die on the concrete below, the first question is always going to be: are they really dead? There’s no doubt that we can expect the “Babchenko defence” to be used as Moscow’s stock response to reports or even photographs of various Russia-linked atrocities for years to come. “Next time you show me photos from Syria by ‘White Helmets’ I will show photo of ‘dead Arkady Babchenko killed by Putin’,” wrote one pro-Russian Twitter user, in a small taste of what is surely to come in large quantities.Of course, that the Kremlin might spin something to its advantage is hardly a reason to abort a potentially life-saving mission. But even assuming there was an excellent operational reason for the subterfuge, questions about the way the stunt was handled remain. Was it really necessary to announce his death, rather than a severe injury, thus traumatising friends, relatives and Russian journalists who had already lost multiple colleagues to bullets?More pertinently, the tone of the grand reveal seemed in remarkably poor taste. Rather than solemnly note the need for such an extraordinary twist of events, Babchenko was wheeled out at the press conference in a bid to create maximum shock effect, like a seaside magician revelling in the audience’s amazement as his sawn-in-half woman becomes whole again. The Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko, hailed a “brilliant operation” while the interior ministry advisor Anton Gerashchenko could hardly control his excitement at the cloak-and-dagger plot: “Even Sherlock Holmes successfully used the method of faking his own death to effectively investigate difficult and complicated crimes, however painful that may have been for his relatives and for Dr Watson,” he wrote on Facebook.Volodymyr Groysman, Ukraine’s prime minister, said earlier on Wednesday that Babchenko had been killed by the “Russian totalitarian machine” and demanded that “the murderers must be punished”. It was unclear whether it was all part of the plot to fool the would-be assassins, or whether he was in the dark about the faked death.Now, all will hinge on what hard evidence of the Russian plot Ukraine is able to produce. If Kiev has bagged cast-iron proof that the would-be assassin’s orders came from Moscow, then the whole episode may go down as an audacious, if controversial, success.If not, many are likely to agree with the head of Reporters without Borders, Christophe Deloire: “It is pathetic and regrettable that the Ukrainian police have played with the truth, whatever their motive ... for the stunt,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecdf929cde9c577cd57f3f4a128f07d847689e47/0_266_4053_2432/master/4053.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec3f0481696729fc615d9888f2f27db0","title":"denmark passes law banning burqa and niqab","story":"Campaigners say ban violates rights to freedom of expression and religionDenmark has joined several other European countries in banning garments that cover the face, including Islamic veils such as the niqab or burqa, in a move condemned by human rights campaigners as “neither necessary nor proportionate”.In a 75-30 vote with 74 absentees on Thursday, Danish lawmakers approved the law presented by Denmark’s centre-right governing coalition. The government says it is not aimed at any religions and does not ban headscarves, turbans or the traditional Jewish skull cap.But the law is popularly known as the “burqa ban” and is mostly seen as being directed at the dress worn by some Muslim women. Few Muslim women in Denmark wear full-face veils.Those violating the law, which comes into force on 1 August, risk a fine of 1,000 kroner (£118). Austria, France and Belgium have similar laws.Following the Danish vote, Gauri van Gulik, Amnesty International’s Europe director, said: “All women should be free to dress as they please and to wear clothing that expresses their identity or beliefs. This ban will have a particularly negative impact on Muslim women who choose to wear the niqab or burqa.“Whilst some specific restrictions on the wearing of full-face veils for the purposes of public safety may be legitimate, this blanket ban is neither necessary nor proportionate and violates the rights to freedom of expression and religion.“If the intention of this law was to protect women’s rights, it fails abjectly.

The French philosopher was fiercely proud of the property, acquired in 1759 after he had fallen out of favour with the French court. He talked of transforming the village of Ferney from what he called “a miserable hamlet surrounded by marshes” to a place where key figures in Europe would flock to see him. It was here that Voltaire wrote his Treatise on Tolerance, published in 1763, whose ideas would later be paraphrased as “I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it”.Macron was advised on the heritage plan by his friend, the TV historian and royal commentator Stéphane Bern. A commission sifted through hundreds of applications to choose the sites that would benefit. Those selected include the Caribbean home of Aimé Césaire, the Martinican intellectual, poet and politician. Also to benefit is the eccentric, fantasy-filled home of the writer and adventurer Pierre Loti in Rochefort on the west coast of France, particularly to fix the roof of its second-floor decorated with artefacts from Syria and Turkey. Other places include an 18th-century fortress on a tiny Brittany island, a 12th-century Burgundy castle and a Roman aqueduct in eastern France.France already has a heritage budget of €326m a year. The culture minister said she saw the lottery – which could raise, €15m-20m as extra funding for sites in particular need.

Though immobilised, the rhino is conscious. So, once it has been moved into the right position by a team on the ground, foam earmuffs and a blindfold are placed on its head to reduce stress levels.After marking the ideal cutting point to avoid damaging the living growth plates at the base of the horns, Toft fires up a chainsaw and slices both of them off.Those magnificent horns, which have helped to protect this species for millions of years, are the reason that more than 7,000 rhinos have been killed in South Africa in the past decade. A persistent human desire for rhino horn – for everything from traditional medicine to hangover cures or status symbols – drives the slaughter of more than 1,000 of the animals each year in the country that has the largest rhino population in the world.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theWorldwide, the situation is grave. The northern white rhino became functionally extinct after the death of Sudan, the last male, in March, while the black rhino population is down to about 5,200. The situation for Asian rhinos is equally bleak: there are just 3,200 surviving Indian rhinos, about 76 Sumatran rhinos and 60 Javan rhinos. There are fewer than 30,000 rhinos globally, with Africa’s southern white rhino the most populous species at about 20,000.These alarming figures have driven wildlife managers in several South African reserves to take the drastic step of sawing off hundreds of horns every year, before criminal syndicates can get their hands on them. With the poachers’ prize removed, the risk to the hornless animals is greatly reduced.Toft has removed close to 1,800 horns from 900 rhinos in the past three years in KwaZulu-Natal, which has been heavily targeted by poachers. Both Galliers and Toft acknowledge that dehorning is not a permanent or ideal solution to the crisis. “This is not something we want to do. It’s expensive and invasive but we believe it is a necessary evil,” says Galliers, noting that it costs about £580 to safely dehorn a rhino.The cost is based on the hiring of helicopters and skilled vets. Galliers, also head of the anti-poaching initiative Project Rhino, points out that dehorning must be repeated every 18-24 months as the horns regrow naturally.Even then, there have been cases of dehorned animals being shot for their stumps. Toft has developed a method of removing as much horn as possible without causing pain to the rhino or damage to its growth plates. The horn is removed to about three finger widths from the base, then the stump is further trimmed around the edges with an angle grinder, enabling the removal of an extra 2kg of horn on a large bull.The operation is noisy and violent, but there is no blood – and Toft insists it is no more painful than trimming your fingernails if done correctly.Galliers and Toft believe dehorning could help save rhinos under threat elsewhere in Africa and Asia. But the cost means that might only be possible in small and medium-sized reserves. Dehorning only selected bulls is not an option, as those without horns would be more vulnerable in territory fights. In parks where the entire rhino population is dehorned, all bulls are placed at equal disadvantage. But dehorned rhinos can still fend off lions by using their considerable bulk as a weapon, Toft says. For trophy hunters, the aim is to acquire both the head and the horns. Many other horned animals are hunted: elephants are slaughtered for their ivory, but Toft does not think detusking is a solution. Tusks are partially hollow and contain sensitive roots and nerves. Although it would be feasible to remove the solid portion, a large volume of tusk would have to remain intact, which could still attract the attention of poachers. Tusks are also essential tools for elephants to strip tree bark or dig up succulent roots and tubers.For now, dehorning appears to be achieving success as an emergency measure, buying time while the decades-old debate continues about how to end the demand for rhino horn.This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Pompeo tweeted that he had had a “good working dinner” with Kim on Wednesday night of steak, corn and cheese.“I will remind you that the secretary of state is from the heartland and likes American food, and he’s hosting someone who’s never been to our country,” the senior state department official said. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, meanwhile met his North Korean counterpart, Ri Yong Ho, on Thursday in Pyongyang, a trip seen as an attempt by Moscow to make its voice heard in its neighbour state’s push for diplomacy.Lavrov invited Kim Jong Un to Russia and passed on best wishes from president Vladimir Putin, the Russian foreign ministry said.

This year, sanction was received for 220 temporary clerical officers to assist permanent staff in processing applications.“The increase in the volume of applications is undoubtedly in part influenced by Brexit-related demand, with around 10 per cent of all applications this year from applicants living in Great Britain,” the department said in response to queries.“However, there are also other drivers of demand, including a trend towards early renewal of passports, a growth in outbound travel, and a growing population.”As of the end of April, more than 276,000 passports had been issued since the turn of the year. In the same period, 39,000 passport applications were received from applicants residing in Northern Ireland, and more than 41,000 were received from applicants residing in Britain.The department said that in addition to taking on temporary staff, the Passport Office was working to improve services, including plans to expand the online renewal project, as part of its response to increasing application volumes. It said iniduals seeking to renew their passport should do so online, as waiting times for this service had been reduced significantly in recent years.“Adults renewing their passports are strongly encouraged to renew their passport online,” it said. “The online passport application service is fast, convenient and secure, and is processing applications in 10 working days, plus postage time.“In fact, in 50 per cent of cases, the processing time is currently down to five working days. “Applicants can apply from anywhere in the world, with no need for a paper form, witness or printed photos. Renewal applications received through Passport Express are currently processed in 16 working days.”It also said that applications from first-time applicants, as well as from those with loststolen passports, take longer to process.“For these categories of applications, robust identity verification and entitlement checks, as well as vital fraud and security procedures, are necessary to ensure that the integrity and security of the Irish passport is maintained,” it said. “These checks take additional time to complete.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3515012.1527767286!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coveney refuses to apologise for stubborn brexit talks strategy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Simon Coveney said at this stage of Brexit negotiations, Ireland needs to be protected. Photograph: Cyril ByrneTánaiste Simon Coveney said he would “make no apologies” for the Government being “overly stubborn or persistent” in pushing the British to commit to the so-called backstop option to avoid a hard Irish Border.Speaking at a Brexit conference in Dublin, Mr Coveney, the Government’s lead Brexit minister, said negotiations between the EU and UK were in “a critical phase” over stalled progress on finding a solution to avoid a hard Border on the island of Ireland. “Certainly, it would be easier not to be so persistent about this and to be reassured that everything will simply work at the time in the context of the future relationship discussions but I’m afraid we can’t do that – we can’t take that risk,” he told a conference hosted by the Association of Higher Civil and Public Servants. The Tánaiste said that at this stage of the negotiations Ireland “needs to be protected” and is “not going to be separated from the pack” of the remaining 26 EU member states.Mr Coveney said the backstop, which would keep Northern Ireland in the EU’s customs union and the single market to avoid a hard border without another option, was the “only visible solution” on the table. Protecting the peace process was why the Government was “so adamant” about legally operable backstop being agreed by the next European Council meeting of EU leaders at the end of June, he said. “Personally, I think if we don’t have progress in June we are in for a very difficult summer with negotiations. It is important to be honest about that now with our friends and colleagues in London,” he said.Mr Coveney said his “personal view” was that the transition period after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019 was that it was going to take more than two years. He told the audience of civil servants at the Morrison Hotel in Dublin city centre that it was important in Brexit negotiations that what politicians and public servants say “constantly tally and I don’t go off on some tangent for political reasons or the civil service doesn’t feel the need to correct the political system.”The Tánaiste praised British civil servants as arguably the best in the world and spoke of the importance of close relations between senior Irish and British officials in the negotiations.“The kind of conversations that they can have to anticipate and compensate for the lack of political progress at times is really important to keep this whole thing moving forward,” he said.He stressed how critical the Brexit negotiations were and how Britain’s departure from the EU would change relations between Ireland and the UK and between the EU and the UK.“This is not a case of a political storm that we must weather and at the end of it when we get out the other side, everything goes back to normal,” he said. “This is a political challenge that is going to permanently change the relationship for future generations in Ireland in the context of how we interact, how we trade and how we work with our closest neighbour.” Mr Coveney repeated his view that it was “not helpful” to be calling for border polls on the island of Ireland in the middle of Brexit negotiations.“It feeds and fuels polarisation in Northern Ireland which at a time when we are trying to provide practical, sensible solutions for Brexit,” he said.Talking about the close Anglo-Irish relations even within his own family, Mr Coveney admitted that one of his English uncles on his mother’s side voted for Brexit – “the one I don’t talk to,” he said, to laughs. Another speaker, Dave Penman, general secretary of the British civil servants’ union, the FDA, said the absence of clear political direction in the UK was “the biggest threat” to an orderly Brexit.“We have situation where the civil service are having to negotiate effectively with both hands tied behind their back it is unclear what they are being asked to deliver the government can’t agree with itself,” he said.Brendan Halligan, former secretary of the Labour Party and a one-time MEP, told the conference that there was a “very mild chance” of a cliff-edge Brexit where the UK would leave the EU without a deal leading to a “legal, economic and political blackout” the morning after Britain departs in 10 months’ time.“I think that the car crash is very much on the cards,” he said. Mr Halligan said that, “thinking the unthinkable” post-Brexit, there was a possibility of the UK breaking up “as a consequence of the driving force behind Brexit, which is English nationalism.”“It has reached the stage where economics doesn’t matter ideology has been triumphant,” he said. He found it “slightly frightening” that Northern Ireland had come back on the political agenda and said Northern nationalists were determined “they are not going to go back into a cage” post-Brexit.Emer Deane, director of the Brexit team in Ireland’s Permanent Representation to the EU in Brussels, described Brexit as “the biggest change management project we have ever had to deal with.”Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3515050.1527770808!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ringaskiddy incinerator coveney disappointed at decision","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn artist’s impression of the proposed incinerator at Ringaskkiddy in Co Cork.   Mr Coveney, a long-standing opponent of the scheme, said he told the oral hearings into the project two years ago that it was inconceivable to develop an incinerator in a harbour area where the Government had invested millions in the National Maritime College of Ireland and the clean-up of the former Irish Steel plant on Haulbowline.These arguments were all recognised by An Bord Pleanála inspector Derek Daly and provided some of the grounds for his decision to recommend refusal of planning.However, the board of An Bord Pleanála decided to ignore these recommendations and grant planning permission, Mr Coveney said.“I have spent a lot of time around the Cabinet table making the case for significant investment in Cork Harbour. We have a master plan for Spike Island and a master plan for Haulbowline Island, including investment of €70 million,” said Mr Coveney.“We are working hard to create something very special at the heart of Cork Harbour area which is of national significance. I can understand that people will be very angry and frustrated at this announcement today and I share this sense with them.”Fianna Fáil leader Micheal Martin echoed Mr Coveney, saying great work had been done to transform Cork Harbour with into a tourist amenity with the opening up of Spike Island as a visitor centre and the clean-up of the former Irish Steel plant and creation of a park on Haulbowline.Speaking on RTÉ’s News at One, Mr Martin also pointed to the establishment of the NMRCI in Rinaskiddy and various marine and renewable energy research projects nearby and locating an incinerator so close to all these projects was counter-productive, he said.“I’m very unhappy – this is the third planning application and my understanding is that the inspector recommended against giving planning permission .... people are genuinely angry and very upset because this is one step too far for that community and the wider harbour community as well.”Opponents of the scheme said they were studying the decision to see if there were grounds for a legal challenge.The company behind the proposed project has welcomed the decision by An Bord Pleanála to give the project the go-ahead while opponents have reacted with dismay.Indaver Ireland applied on January 13th, 2016 for planning permission under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 for an incinerator at Ringaskiddy which would handle 240,000 tonnes of municipal waste and 24,000 tonnes of hazardous waste annually.Indaver Ireland managing director John Ahern said the company was “pleased that An Bord Pleanála (ABP) has decided to grant planning permission for its proposed Ringaskiddy Resource Recovery Centre” following the holding of an oral hearing into the project in April and May 2016.Mr Ahern said he was conscious “this decision simply marks another step in a long process”.He said Ireland currently exports significant amounts of residual municipal waste and that incineration was part of the solution to this.Mr Ahern said a recent TransFrontier Shipments Office figures showed a 7 per cent reduction in Ireland’s waste exports since the Poolbeg incinerator in Dublin began operating last December.He said Indaver shared the view of the Confederation of European Waste-to-Energy Plants that Ireland needed more incinerator capacity.Mr Ahern said a lack of incineration capacity in Ireland will see Ireland export an estimated 300,000 tonnes of municipal waste this year. “This reliance on exporting our waste is not sustainable and exposes us to market shocks”.“We believe our plans are fully in line with national, regional and local planning regulations which was acknowledged by Cork County Council and has been reinforced by An Bord Pleanála’s decision to grant permission,” he said.Opponents of the incinerator, including Cork Harbour Alliance for a Safe Environment, (CHASE) expressed dismay and disappointment that An Bord Pleanála had ignored its own inspectors’ recommendations and granted planning for the project.CHASE chairwoman Mary O’Leary said: “We are shocked, angry and deeply disappointed that the board has granted permission. The endless delays in coming to this decision were always a cause for concern but we hoped against hope that An Bord Pleanála would make the right decision.”Ms O’Leary said all three An Bord Pleanála inspectors, who held hearings into the project in 2003, 2009 and 2016, recommended refusing permission and said An Bord Pleanála has now given the project the green light, despite the fact “no one is in favour of this”.“What is the point of going through an oral hearing and giving all that evidence, if it’s all ignored,” Ms O’Leary asked.She claimed Indaver had submitted incorrect dioxin emission figures which opponents of the project had to bring to the attention of the An Bord Pleanála inspector.“For a third inspector to recommend a refusal of permission underlines the unsuitability of this site and really questions why An Bord Pleanála saw fit to grant it, even in spite of the erroneous dioxin figures exposed on the final day of the 2016 hearing,” said Ms O’Leary.CHASE spokeswoman Linda Fitzpatrick said campaigners would now study the order closely with their legal advisor, solicitor Joe Noonan, to see if there were grounds for a legal challenge but that would also depend on whether they had the funds to mount a judicial review."},{"url":null,"title":"clare daly gives impassioned testimony on referendum result in the d%C3%A1il","story":"  May 29, 2018TD applauded by colleagues after impassioned speech during first D\u0026aacuteil sitting since referendum "},{"url":null,"title":"miriam lord it took 35 years to build this stunning result","story":"Thirty-five years after it was placed into the Constitution, the electorate voted for the Eighth Amendment to be repealed and for provision be made for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.

Photograph: Nick BradshawIt took 35 years to build a landslide.Repealing the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was neither quick nor easy, despite what the margin of difference might say.Sixty-six per cent said “Yes”. Makes it look simple.But that two-thirds majority conceals hard history and hard-fought battles behind a stunning final result.Woman by woman, story by story, year upon year, day after day. The rocks and pebbles of countless unjust ordeals and small personal tragedies piled up after each furtive trip to Liverpool and beyond.Brave campaigners for basic abortion rights did everything they could to increase the pressure, their efforts ignored and condemned by priests and politicians and that tiresome class of pious people who live in terror of the slippery slope.They thought they could hold back a landslide. On Friday, gravity kicked in. The slippery slope did for them in the end.The Eighth Amendment, which guaranteed a foetus the same right to life as the woman carrying it, is gone from the Constitution. Good riddance to it. It brought nothing but difficulty and despair to Irish women in times when they desperately needed proper care and compassion at home.It was a wonderful morning on Saturday in the RDS when the boxes were opened and the votes counted. It was a wonderful afternoon in Dublin Castle when crowds filled the courtyard to hear the official declaration. It was a wonderful day for Irish women.A day made even better in the happy knowledge that the vast majority of Irish men are looking out for them and want only the best for them. By voting in their droves to repeal, they placed the concerns of women far above the fears of ideologically-motivated crusaders who prize saving souls above having a heart.With repeal looking the likely outcome, there were calls from some quarters for a muted and dignified response. Perhaps it was the reason why there was neither screen nor public address system for the huge crowd at the castle.But no. For all the decades of all the women who suffered, and for all the women who fought and agitated for change, we had to celebrate this historic turning-point in modern Irish society.Some never thought they would live to see the day. Some, like Monica Barnes and Mary Holland and Nuala Fennell and many more, didn’t. The celebration was for them too.It was for Ailbhe Smyth, who never stopped fighting. It was for senator Ivana Bacik, Catherine Murphy, Joan Burton, Catherine McGuinness and many more who were there from the start.Political rivalries were cast aside for the day. “Oh, c’mere to me,” said socialist Bríd Smith, giving Fianna Fáil’s Timmy Dooley a hug.Obstetrician Peter Boylan, looking very cool in his shades turned up and it was like George Clooney had just rambled in, such was the clamour which greeted his entrance. The three co-directors of Together4Yes – Ailbhe Smyth, Orla O’Connor and Gráinne Griffin – arrived to rapturous welcome.Senators Lynne Ruane and Alice Mary Higgins were in floods. Ruth Coppinger was hugging for Ireland. Katherine Zappone, who demanded the referendum as her price for supporting the Government, was ecstatic.“Oh God, I told my husband I’d give up the fags if there was a repeal,” said Fine Gael’s Kate O’Connell, one of the party’s most active campaigners, as she ran out for a smoke.Brendan Howlin arrived in just after Mary Lou McDonald’s big entrance. The Labour party was fighting the cause when all the others didn’t want to know. “We never get the credit,” said Howlin, shrugging. “We carry the flag, but then in comes the fresh faced Leo to take all the glory.”Maybe not. Health Minister Simon Harris pretended to be embarrassed by the “I fancy Simon Harris” poster, but he was secretly thrilled. Wherever he went he was mobbed. No wonder Leo stuck close by him.Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin maintained a low-key presence, but his early intervention and support for repeal and the proposed legislation was a pivotal point in the campaign.It was a courageous move which now sees him on the right side of history and one half of his parliamentary party stranded on the other.As Micheál walked through the crowd, tearful young women hugged him. A man and woman approached. “We’re one of those couples who had a fatal foetal abnormality,” the women said to him. “Thank you. Just, thank you,” she sobbed.Meanwhile, back in the RDS, the Attorney General was chatting to former Supreme Court Judge Catherine McGuinness.She had had eye surgery the day before but the doctor gave her a special dispensation to attend the count. “Theoretically I should have a patch over my eye today.”At Dublin Castle, Frank Crummy (81), who set up Ireland’s first family planning clinic, was resplendent in his repeal jumper, alongside his wife Evelyn.There was a lot of discussion about why so many politicians and pundits called the campaign so wrong. The Together4Yes team remains amused by the old school, outmoded metric used by some of them to evaluate their very effective efforts. It was as if they were affronted at the idea that people outside the Kildare Street bubble might actually know more than they do about what the electorate really wants these days.Independent TD Clare Daly, a politician hugely deserving of credit for the part she played, decided to stay away from the castle bunfight. Instead, a number of Johnny Come Lately politicians with a weakness for self-publicity preened and waved from the platform.It’s always the same.A third of the electorate voted No. “I feel like I’ve lost my country,” a woman told us amid the celebrations in the RDS. She was very sad. She couldn’t be consoled.Cheers and tears and champagne greeted the announcement. The sky fell in briefly when a few drops of rain fell. Everyone danced.Because it was a monumental day.

Legislation to remove the so-called “baptism barrier” on schools admission has been passed by the Dáil.After a late night debate the House accepted the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill which prohibits the requirement for a child to be baptised before they can be admitted to Catholic schools.Religious bodies had argued that banning religion as a selection criterion in admissions would breach their constitutional rights relating to religious freedom and freedom of association.But Minister for Education Richard Bruton said the provision was robust and would mean baptism as a requirement for school entry would be removed from most schools but retained where a child of a minority needs to gain access to a school of their ethos.Three Independent Rural TDs - Michael Healy-Rae, Mattie McGrath and Michael Collins - called a number of votes but, because they did not have the minimum 10 TDs required to press votes, the votes did not take place.Mr Bruton told the Dáil after the Bill was passed: “Ireland is changing and we need to change with it. The expectation of citizens around the education system have changed and I think this Bill will go some distance to ensuring that we keep up with those changes. Fianna Fáil education spokesman Thomas Byrne welcomed the passage of the Bill which he described as “in some ways radical legislation” but said in other way it will not affect many schools in terms of how they operate.“It’s going to give clarity to schools and to children and will result in a fairer education system without being an attack on the ethos of schools, which I have to say I do value.”The legislation now goes to the Seanad.-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3515058.1527771216!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"t%C3%A1naiste pledges provision of up to 10 000 social houses annually","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTánaiste Simon Coveney said a point would be reached where an estimated 7,000 to 10,000 social houses were provided annually. Tánaiste Simon Coveney has defended the Government’s record on the provision of social housing in heated Dáil exchanges.He was replying on Thursday to Independent TD Tommy Broughan, who accused the Government of relying on profit-driven property developers and landlords in housing the homeless. Mr Broughan said there was an absence of a serious pipeline of housing, adding there was a need for an emergency programme. Mr Coveney said he would not accept Mr Broughan’s “pretence’’ that the Government did not have a pipeline of social housing. He said in 2016 there were only 657 social houses delivered. “Last year, that figure jumped to just under 2,300,” he added. “The figure this year will be significantly higher again, as well as the year after that.”Mr Coveney said a point would be reached where an estimated 7,000 to 10,000 social houses were provided annually. “We have the funding and the pipeline to deliver that in terms of projects,’’ he added.Figures released on Wednesday revealed the number of people in homeless accommodation fell slightly, from 6,035 in March to 5,963 in April.However, the figures represented a 19.9 per cent increase on the April 2017 figure of 4,972. There is also an ongoing controversy over the removal of 578 people from the March figures compared with the February figures, under a reclassification exercise by the Department of Housing. Mr Coveney said the family hubs were not the long-term solution, but the Government had been faced with a dramatic increase in homelessness in a very short space of time. The Government had to respond to people in that very difficult set of circumstances, he added. Sinn Féin housing spokesman Eoin Ó Broin said there was no sign of the housing crisis abating. Child homelessness alone had increased by a “shocking” 74 per cent under Fine Gael-led governments, he said. -the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"hawaiis erupting kilauea

organization cautiously optimistic ebola response","story":"Health workers prepare to attend to patients in the isolation ward to diagnose and treat suspected Ebola patients, at Bikoro Hospital in DRC. The World Health Organization is cautiously optimistic that the current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo can be controlled after response efforts have so far averted the explosive increase in cases officials had earlier feared, Peter Salama, WHO’s Deputy Director of Preparedness and Response said on Tuesday.Four hundred potential contacts in the city of Mbandaka - 90 per cent of those at risk - have been vaccinated under a ‘ring vaccination’ programme using an experimental vaccine developed after the last Ebola crisis in west Africa.The WHO has so far identified 900 people in DRC it is following that may be at risk of contracting the disease due to contact with someone who has been infected. The WHO acknowledged however, that identifying all potential contacts remains challenging.  Since the start of the current outbreak earlier this month, 54 cases -  including 35 confirmed instances - of the disease have been reported, mostly in the remote areas of Bikoro and Iboko in the country’s north-west Equateur province. Twenty-five people have died. No new cases have been reported in the past two days. Although only a minority of cases have been reported in Mbandaka, the vaccination effort has to date focused on the densely populated city of 1.2 million due to fears the number of Ebola cases could rise rapidly in an urban environment.Dr. Salama said that take up of the vaccine among people deemed to be at risk of the disease has been high. “The vaccine is proving to be a very acceptable intervention to the community,” said Dr. Salama.He acknowledged however, that the WHO and partner agencies were “still at an early stage in this outbreak response”. He said: “We can’t conclude that we have safeguarded the city of Mbandaka.” Dr Salama did not rule out the possibility of further cases in the city.   The WHO is now expanding the vaccination campaign into the rural areas at the centre of the outbreak. On Monday, WHO began vaccinations in Bikoro, where the outbreak was first declared.  The WHO is also expecting to receive approval in the next few days from the government of the DRC to use five new drugs on patients in Ebola treatment centres. The drugs are all unregistered and will be used as part of a clinical trial.  Dr. Salama said that it was not a simple effort to do this kind of trial in this kind of environment. The WHO hopes that the trial will pave the way for future Ebola treatment efforts. Earlier this month, WHO experts concluded that the current Ebola outbreak did not constitute a “public health emergency of international concern. The health agency is however, continuing to monitor potential locations, including 80 ports on the Congo river in DRC and neighbouring Republic of Congo for new cases of the disease.The current outbreak in the DRC is the worst outbreak of Ebola since the 2014 - 2015 outbreak which killed  11,300 people in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health SecurityLocals warn tourists to stay away from summer capital of British Raj after severe water shortagesLove Island 2018: The complete beginner\u0026#39s guide as the new series starts on ITVTwelve-year-olds shot as border police fire at truck carrying migrants into CroatiaDenmark becomes latest European country to ban full Islamic face veil in public spacesBelgian prison released Liege \u0026#39terrorist\u0026#39 gunman two days after guard warned he was radicalised Islamic State supporter changes plea to admit encouraging jihadis to attack Prince George at schoolSmall Bavarian town linked to British Royal family takes stand against new law enforcing display of crossesFamily festival cancelled amid fears over \u0026#39bad batch\u0026#39 of drugs thought to have killed two peopleChelsea murder investigation after man in his 40s stabbed to death on exclusive streetBashar al-Assad warns US troops to leave Syria as he raises prospect of clashChinese police officers go on patrol in Venice for the first time Smoking declines around the world but most countries set to miss targets, report findsPilot who died in helicopter crash believed to be Lord-Lieutenant for North YorkshireNew Jersey police release bodycam footage of violent beach arrestRussia enters North Korean diplomatic fray as Lavrov calls for phased lifting of sanctions on visitChina’s ‘dream of hegemony’ biggest threat in Asia, says US admiral appointed as ambassador to South KoreaNick Grimshaw to be replaced by Greg James on Radio One Breakfast Show\u0026#39Murdered\u0026#39 journalist Arkady Babchenko turns up alive after death staged to \u0026#39expose Russian plot\u0026#39We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/31/TELEMMGLPICT000165046010_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqaRL1kC4G7DT9ZsZm6Pe3PehAFAI_f6ud569StXyOKH0.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"denmark becomes latest european country ban full islamic face","story":"Women in niqab at Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen after the vote banning face veils was passedThe Danish parliament on Thursday passed a law banning the Islamic full-face veil in public spaces, becoming the latest European country to do so.Anyone who wears a garment that hides the face in public will be punished with a fine, says the law, which was passed by 75 votes to 30.Presented by the centre-right government, the legislation, which is to take effect on August 1, was also backed by the Social Democrats and the far-right Danish People\u0027s Party.Wearing a burqa, which covers a person\u0027s entire face, or the niqab, which only shows the eyes, in public will lead to a fine of 1,000 kroner (£118).Women in niqab are pictured after the Danish Parliament banned the wearing of face veils in public, at Christiansborg Palace in CopenhagenRepeated violations will be fined up to 10,000 kroner.It is not known how many women wear the niqab and burqa in Denmark.I don\u0027t think there are many who wear the burqa here in Denmark.

Mr Söder says the cross is “a fundamental symbol of our Bavarian identity and way of life”.But his opponents say he is exploiting a religious symbol for political ends and have denounced the move as unconstitutional.In Coburg, in the former Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, the local authorities are taking an independent stance.Norbert Tessmer, the mayor, told the local Neue Presse newspaper he had decided there was no obligation to hang a cross in the town hall as it belongs to the local municipality, and not the regional government. But he conceded crosses would have to be hung in other local public buildings such as the tax office and the law courts.A believer carries a cross, covered with a plastic bag to protect it against the rain, as he takes part in a pilgrimage in Niedertraubling, Germany, Thursday, May 17, 2018Elsewhere in Bavaria, institutions are taking a more confrontational stance. Nuremberg’s famous Neues Musuem is refusing point blank to display a cross, even though it is a public institution.“It is problematic to make such a display in an institution concerned with the freedom of the arts,” Eva Kraus, the museum director said. The Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts in Munich is also taking a stand. “We have nothing against crosses of any kind, but they should only hang where they belong: in church,” Michael Krüger, the academy president said.A spokesman for the Bavarian interior ministry admitted last week that it would not be possible for the ministry to enforce the order in every case. Public protests are planned in Munich on Friday, but a recent poll found 56 per cent of Bavarians in fact support the order, with only 38 per cent against.Support is strong among Roman Catholics, who make up 58 per cent of Bavaria’s population. The order has been endorsed by the Catholic Archbishop of Bamberg, Ludwig Schick. But some of the strongest opposition to the order has come from the church. A leading Catholic theologian accused Mr Söder of exploiting people’s fears over Muslim migrants ahead of regional elections.“You are using Christianity to exclude people of other faiths,” Burkhard Hose wrote in an open letter to Mr Söder. “The cross is not an extension of a policy of exclusion or nationalistic egoism... I urge you to stop using Christianity as a supposed bulwark against Islam.”The move has also been criticised by the head of the German evangelical church, Heinrich Bedford-Strohm., who warned: “It is very clear that no one should misuse a religious symbol like the cross for political purposes”.Please review our commenting policyLocals warn tourists to stay away from summer capital of British Raj after severe water shortagesLove Island 2018: The complete beginner\u0026#39s guide as the new series starts on ITVTwelve-year-olds shot as border police fire at truck carrying migrants into CroatiaDenmark becomes latest European country to ban full Islamic face veil in public spacesBelgian prison released Liege \u0026#39terrorist\u0026#39 gunman two days after guard warned he was radicalised Islamic State supporter changes plea to admit encouraging jihadis to attack Prince George at schoolFamily festival cancelled amid fears over \u0026#39bad batch\u0026#39 of drugs thought to have killed two peopleChelsea murder investigation after man in his 40s stabbed to death on exclusive streetBashar al-Assad warns US troops to leave Syria as he raises prospect of clashChinese police officers go on patrol in Venice for the first time Smoking declines around the world but most countries set to miss targets, report findsPilot who died in helicopter crash believed to be Lord-Lieutenant for North YorkshireNew Jersey police release bodycam footage of violent beach arrestRussia enters North Korean diplomatic fray as Lavrov calls for phased lifting of sanctions on visitChina’s ‘dream of hegemony’ biggest threat in Asia, says US admiral appointed as ambassador to South KoreaNick Grimshaw to be replaced by Greg James on Radio One Breakfast Show\u0026#39Murdered\u0026#39 journalist Arkady Babchenko turns up alive after death staged to \u0026#39expose Russian plot\u0026#39The idyllic cove from The Beach is closing due to overtourismWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/05/30/TELEMMGLPICT000164886317_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bqek9vKm18v_rkIPH9w2GMNtm3NAjPW-2_OvjCiS6COCU.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"smoking declines around world countries set miss targets report","story":"Many countries look set to miss national and global tobacco reduction targets by 2025Tobacco use has fallen significantly since 2000 but less wealthy countries are lagging behind, a new report from the World Health Organization has found.The report, released to coincide with Global No Tobacco Day, shows that worldwide the number of smokers fell by 29 million from 2000 to 2015 as more countries adopt policies to help their populations kick the habit. Today, some 1.1 billion people - 20 per cent of the population over the age of 15 - smoke.  Yet, although most countries have seen a fall in smoking rates, only a minority of countries look set to meet global and national commitments to cut tobacco use in over 15s by 30 per cent by 2025. The UK is one of a handful of countries on track to meet this goal.Which countries are on track to meet global tobacco reduction targets?The UK, where the first voluntary warnings appeared on cigarette packets in the 1970s and a smoking ban in public places has been in force since 2007, is one of a number of mostly wealthy countries that has led the way in tobacco control. Today just 16 per cent of the British population smokes, compared to 46 per cent in 1974.Across the rest of Europe smoking is also fast falling out of fashion. Last week, a new study revealed that smoking is starting to lose its allure in France as one million daily smokers kicked the habit in the last year thanks to the recent introduction of anti-smoking measures including higher taxes on cigarettes and plain packaging.Even Greece -  the European country where the biggest proportion of the population lights up - has seen a fall in smoking rates by almost two percentage points a year.Where are people stubbing out their cigarettes?The report reveals, however, that there are stark disparities between countries and regions. While 62 million smokers  in high-income countries stubbed out their cigarettes between 2000 and 2015, the number of smokers in low and middle income countries actually increased by 33 million.Less wealthy countries will see an increase in smokersThe report said that efforts to reduce tobacco use in low and middle income countries has likely been impeded by the tobacco industry whose relentless lobbying has stopped governments from introducing stronger policies.Dr Vinayak Prasad, co-lead author of the report and programme manager of  WHO\u0027s Tobacco Control, Prevention of Non Communicable Diseases team said: “It’s easier to get the political will and to explain the problem of tobacco but the tobacco industry is taking strong measures - they use all kinds of arguments such as the argument that controlling tobacco harms people\u0027s livelihoods.  The data however, disproves that controlling tobacco affects livelihoods.”The WHO’s Eastern Mediterranean region - which covers much of the Middle East and North Africa - is one region where overall smoking rates have barely fallen. The actual number of people smoking is expected to rise from 47 million in 2000 to 103 million in 2025 - a more than two-fold increase.Smoking rate are falling in most of the world- except the Middle East and AfricaDr Prasad said that multiple reasons lie behind high smoking rates in the region. “It’s culturally and socially acceptable to use the water pipe in many countries in the Eastern Mediterranean region, there’s been no strong leadership to push tobacco reduction at the highest level and countries have been hesitant to tax,” he said.Some GCC countries such as the UAE which introduced a \u0027sin tax\u0027 on cigarettes last October are starting to take measures but these have so far not been sufficient, according to Dr. Prasad.Some countries are bucking global trends as more people light upWhile the picture in many low and middle income countries is less sanguine, one group that is bucking the trend is women.Globally, women are kicking the habit faster in all regions of the world except Europe. “European women are an outlier globally,” said Dr Prasad. He said that factors including more liberal gender attitudes are contributing to a slower fall in smoking among women.Every year tobacco kills seven million people around the world – more than AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined.Tobacco use and second-hand smoke exposure are key causes of cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks and stroke. Cardiovascular diseases kill 18 million people each year - with smoking responsible for some three million of these deaths.“The single biggest killer in the world is cardiovascular disease,” said Dr Prasad. “They are responsible for almost 44 percent of non-communicable disease deaths. If you fix the heart problem, you fix a big proportion of NCDs,” he said. According to the WHO few people are aware of the link between heart disease and tobacco as there is evidence of a serious lack of knowledge of the multiple health risks associated with tobacco.“Most people know that using tobacco causes cancer and lung disease, but many people aren’t aware that tobacco also causes heart disease and stroke – the world’s leading killers,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.In recent years, more countries have adopted tobacco control policies such as plain packaging, taxation and banning smoking in public places.More people are now covered by tobacco control measuresAlthough Dr Prasad acknowledges that the tobacco industry and the continual development of novel products to continue to lure smokers remains an obstacle, he said that tobacco control policies have had a marked impact in many countries - including in low and middle income countries.“Taxation for sure is definitely an instrument - the additional revenue has been used to help the government fund universal health care in places like the Philippines,” said Dr Prasad. “Smoke free policies also cost very little as do warning labels and plain packaging,” he added.   Although the WHO’s current projection shows few countries will meet the 30 per cent target, Dr Prasad pointed to the example of France as evidence of what a country can achieve with political will. “France wasn’t doing anything until 2016 then woke up and introduced plain packaging. Things change.”Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Please review our commenting policyLocals warn tourists to stay away from summer capital of British Raj after severe water shortagesLove Island 2018: The complete beginner\u0026#39s guide as the new series starts on ITVTwelve-year-olds shot as border police fire at truck carrying migrants into CroatiaDenmark becomes latest European country to ban full Islamic face veil in public spacesBelgian prison released Liege \u0026#39terrorist\u0026#39 gunman two days after guard warned he was radicalised Islamic State supporter changes plea to admit encouraging jihadis to attack Prince George at schoolSmall Bavarian town linked to British Royal family takes stand against new law enforcing display of crossesFamily festival cancelled amid fears over \u0026#39bad batch\u0026#39 of drugs thought to have killed two peopleChelsea murder investigation after man in his 40s stabbed to death on exclusive streetBashar al-Assad warns US troops to leave Syria as he raises prospect of clashChinese police officers go on patrol in Venice for the first time Pilot who died in helicopter crash believed to be Lord-Lieutenant for North YorkshireNew Jersey police release bodycam footage of violent beach arrestRussia enters North Korean diplomatic fray as Lavrov calls for phased lifting of sanctions on visitChina’s ‘dream of hegemony’ biggest threat in Asia, says US admiral appointed as ambassador to South KoreaNick Grimshaw to be replaced by Greg James on Radio One Breakfast Show\u0026#39Murdered\u0026#39 journalist Arkady Babchenko turns up alive after death staged to \u0026#39expose Russian plot\u0026#39The idyllic cove from The Beach is closing due to overtourismWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"ocado ftse 100 ms marks and spencer share price reshuffle g4s ladbrokes coral gvc","story":"G4S\u0026nbsphas been demoted to the FTSE 250 after a brief return to the top indexOcado will enter the FTSE 100 for the first time ever next month, after its share price was boosted by 40 per cent on news that it struck a deal with US grocery giant Kroger. Also moving up to the blue chip index is Ladbrokes Coral owner GVC Holdings, according to FTSE Russell, which conducts a quarterly review of which companies belong in the various indexes. In order to rebalance the FTSE 100, security firm G4S and private hospital group Mediclinic International will drop down to the FTSE 250. G4S rejoined the FTSE 100 in June last year, having previously been demoted in December 2015 after eight years in the index, following a collapse in earnings after the company became embroiled in a scandal relating to UK public contracts in 2013. Marks and\u0026nbspSpencer has hung on to its spot in the FTSE 100, despite fears that it would fall out of the top index for the first time in its history. The retailer’s share price has been on a downward trajectory for months, not helped by its announcement earlier this month that it plans to close 100 stores. \u0026nbspLaith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said M\u0026ampS had avoided relegation “by the skin of its teeth”. “Reshuffles happen every three months though, so this is a stay of execution rather than a full pardon,” he added. “M\u0026ampS boss Steve Rowe is promising transformation, and has been candid in admitting it’s a lengthy road ahead. However, the pace of disruptive technological change means making M\u0026ampS special again is a moving target, and management are taking aim from a long way out.”Mr Khalaf said Ocado’s promotion into the FTSE 100 was a “sign of the old economy giving way to the new”. “A spate of licensing agreements has trumped up the share price in recent months, and shows that Ocado is well versed in the art of the deal,” he said.Changes to the makeup of the various FTSE indexes will take effect from 18 June.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

UK house prices rose 2.4 per cent in May compared with the same month last year, which was a slower rate of growth than expected, according to the new data.Between April and May, prices were down 0.2 per cent, with supply remaining low and surveyors reporting subdued levels of new buyer enquiries.\u0026nbspIt follows the trend seen throughout the first quarter of 2018, during which London was the weakest performing region with prices dropping 1 per cent on the year before. In the first three months of the year, the north of England recorded stronger house price performance than the south, while Northern Ireland led UK regions for property price growth. Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said the fact that annual house price growth has stayed within a “fairly narrow range” of 2-3 per cent over the past year suggested there was “little change in the balance between demand and supply in the market over that period”. “There are few signs of an imminent change,” he added. “Looking further ahead, much will depend on how broader economic conditions evolve, especially in the labour market, but also with respect to interest rates. “Subdued economic activity and ongoing pressure on household budgets is likely to continue to exert a modest drag on housing market activity and house price growth this year, though borrowing costs are likely to remain low.”Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said it was unlikely that the near-flat trend in prices will improve imminently.“Mortgage rates, which jumped in April, will continue to rise over the coming months,” he said, noting that the Bank of England had only delayed raising interest rates, meaning a hike is still on the cards this year.“Demand likely will remain at levels consistent with merely stagnant house prices,” Mr Tombs said.Jonathan Samuels, chief executive of property lender Octane Capital, said: Tight supply and subdued demand are the key contributors to the ongoing limbo gripping the UK property market. A lethargic economy populated by cautious and squeezed consumers has created a property market lacking both momentum and direction. The property market is fuelled by confidence but many consumers are running on fumes. Low stock levels and continued cheap borrowing rates will prevent a material decline in prices but equally a rise greater than very low single digits is highly unlikely. From a house price growth perspective, 2018 is looking greyer by the day.Meanwhile, Craig McKinlay, sales and marketing director at Kensington Mortgages, said the trend highlighted by the Nationwide data was “all too familiar”. “An insufficient supply of new housing is continuing to make prices creep up year-on-year. Whilst price rises of late have been more sustainable, the challenges of the housing market remain,” he said. “The situation can be resolved, but it will take time, and the government will need to redouble its efforts to meet the housing targets for future generations.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Last week, Oxford University admitted it needed to do more to improve student ersity after more than a third of its colleges admitted three or fewer black applicants over three years.Labour MP David Lammy accused the prestigious institution of being “a bastion of white middle-class southern privilege” after the figures came to light.\u0026nbspOn the latest figures from, Mr Lammy, the former Labour higher education minister, said: “It is simply not good enough for Ucas to say that they do not know why black applicants are so much more likely to be flagged up by Ucas admissions systems.\u0026nbsp“Ucas need to explain why over half of all flagged applicants are black, despite black students accounting for just one in ten applications.\u0026nbsp“Why are one in every hundred black applicants flagged compared to one in every two thousand white applicants? Ucas needs to be able to explain this huge disproportionality and satisfy students from ethnic minorities that their applications will be looked upon fairly.”\u0026nbspIlyas Nagdee, black students’ officer for the NUS, said: “While it is encouraging to see Ucas being transparent about the university application process and particularly its verification service it must take immediate steps to implement the actions it is promising.\u0026nbsp“Currently they are unsure why a disproportionate number of black applicants are being flagged and until this is properly addressed and investigated we risk prospective black students losing all confidence in what is supposed to be a fair and equitable application process.”He added: “We hope Ucas will undertake the programme of work they set out today immediately and with great attention to detail.\u0026nbspAll students must be able to have faith in the application process.“Black students are let down and failed by the higher education system in a number of other ways during their time in study.\u0026nbspUcas must ensure that they are not put off or dissuaded from applying due to unconscious bias.”Clare Marchant, chief executive of Ucas, said: “Ucas uses industry standard software to screen applications for fraud on behalf of universities and genuine applicants.\u0026nbsp“This analysis gives us confidence we are only cancelling applications where there’s clear evidence of fraud or missing information.”She added: “However, there is more work for us to do to ensure that flagging is as robust as it can be across all areas of the verification service.\u0026nbsp“We’ve already made enhancements to our fraud detection service, introduced an additional review of applications prior to cancellation, and ensured all staff involved in verification activities have had up-to-date unconscious bias training.\u0026nbsp“We have set out a programme of work to further review verification processes in collaboration with universities and colleges, and we will be inviting organisations that represent Black, Asian, and minority ethnic groups to work with us to help us take a thorough look at key areas of our business, to improve the experience for all applicants.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But as our research shows, very few are fulfilling that original purpose.”He added that it was “unacceptable” that both primary and secondary free schools accept lower proportions of disadvantaged pupils than live in their catchment areas. Sir Peter told The Independent: “It may be that disadvantaged families are less likely to apply, or that the admissions procedures of inidual schools are overly complex.“One thing is clear – free schools need to make serious efforts to recruit more students from disadvantaged backgrounds so that they reflect the communities they were set up to serve.“This should mean more and better outreach to primary schools with high levels of disadvantaged pupils.”Nick Brook, deputy general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT said: “Free schools, when open, operate as their own admissions authority, so there will be many different admissions criteria for parents to navigate. This is needlessly confusing and does not make for a joined-up system that truly has children’s best interests at heart.”He added: “The original purpose of the free school project was to offer the opportunity for different community groups to set up schools.“In the beginning we saw this happening, but many of these schools have been absorbed into larger trusts and new free schools are now overwhelmingly set up by MATs (multi-academy trusts), so it would be wrong to claim that free schools are responsible for any additional ersity in the system.”UK news in picturesUK news in picturesWest Midlands Police officers carrying out scene searches near to where a 15-year-old boy was fatally stabbed in Wolverhampton.

We very much welcome this refocusing and look forward to working with groups who are targeting new schools in these areas.”A Department for Education spokesperson said: “There are 1.9 million more children in good or outstanding schools in 2010 and the free schools programme has been a vital part of that improvement. They are driving up standards, introducing innovative practices, and giving parents more choice of a good school place, with 84 per cent of free schools inspected by Ofsted rated good or outstanding and 30 per cent rated as outstanding.“Almost 400 free schools have opened since 2010 – creating over 212,000 places – and nearly half of those schools are in the most deprived areas of the country. We are now inviting applications for more free schools and will prioritise those proposals that want to set up in areas with the lowest educational performance and greatest need for more good school places.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They work on issues that transcend borders. They have to be free to attract and retain the best global talent to innovate and compete.\u0026nbsp“British universities are still a global elite and we’re not going to witness any sudden change to that – but to retain their power status in the long term, it’s critical they’re able to stay open to the world.\u0026nbspIsolationism will chip away at any university’s reputation.”But she added that it was “too soon” to make any links between the UK’s performance this year and Brexit.The rankings are based on a survey of more than 10,000 academics in 138 countries.

One was so long ago that engraving had to do the job of photography the other was recent enough that some people alive today will have heard about it from their parents. In one, a foreign ship came to grief in British waters in the other, a British vessel went down in foreign waters, and down she stayed.First to Texel, safe haven, population 13,500: the largest of the West Frisian Islands off the coast of the Netherlands in the Wadden Sea. Today it is a magnet for Dutch cyclists, walkers, swimmers and riders (the latter an important reminder that Texel is the only known place where an entire navy was defeated by men on horseback, which is another tale altogether).In June 1743, a 700 ton vessel, VOC Hollandia, set sail on her maiden voyage bound for Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, now known as Jakarta. In any study of trade between Europe and Asia throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, the Dutch East India Company is pivotal, shipping everything from nutmegs and cinnamon to coffee and tobacco, porcelain to rubber. And that is what VOC stands for: Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie.A brief history of democracy: Is it the \u0027will of the people\u0027?Yet on this prestigious occasion, Hollandia, being of brand new and bold design, an impressive 42 metres in length, was carrying a particularly special cargo: not only many VIP passengers but also 130,000 coins. Most were “pillar-dollars”, cut to represent smaller denominations, but among the haul were also highly valuable Mexican and Guatemalan silver coins.Hollandia’s captain must have been nervous therefore, as he headed for Brittany through rough seas. Perhaps he was aware too that just 36 years before, in 1707, at least 1,550 men had perished in the same waters, haplessly drifting towards the Scillies aboard four Royal Navy warships: the Firebrand, the Romney, the Association and the Eagle. (Indeed, square mile for square mile, the treacherous Scillies are probably responsible for more of the world’s estimated 159,000 shipwrecks than anywhere else.)Remember, these were the days before the invention of reliable navigation instruments still before the erection of most lighthouses.Texel is now a popular tourist venueSure enough, like those earlier ships, the Hollandia was blown off course, scarcely six weeks after setting sail, on a blustery 13 July. And it too came to grief off the Isles of Scilly, striking the notorious Gunner Rock, going down just off Annet, an uninhabited nature reserve just 54 acres in size, 20 miles from the Cornish coast.Nobody lived to tell the tale.Miraculously, in 1971 a London attorney called Rex Cowan discovered the Hollandia’s wreck, along with its bronze cannons and some of its treasure. Unusually, he was using a proton magnetometer, allowing him to test the Earth’s field of magnetic resonance, which in the process reveals every slight variation across that field – including ferrous objects embedded in land or sea.However, it is now time to turn to the anniversary of a sinking far further away and to consider the watery grave awaiting an equally emblematic vessel. This was a calamity that was far more preventable.Many boats have come a cropper in the waters around the Scilly Isles (iStock)State of the art flagship and battleship, the HMS Victoria – named in named in honour of the Queen’s impending Golden Jubilee in 1886 – was launched at a cost of £845 from Elswick on the Tyne. When she headed for the Mediterranean in June 1893 for training exercises, she had already endured one major mishap – a grounding at Platea, off the Greek coast, with Captain Maurice Archibald Bourke having permitted members of his crew to misplace the buoys that might have saved him from some very shallow waters.On that first cataclysmic day, 29 January 1892, no full tide – indeed nothing at all – would get the extraordinarily long (100 metres), extraordinarily heavy (11,200 tons) Victoria afloat again. Jettisoning 483 tons of coal, and calling for a tow from three other Royal Navy frigates, somehow the Victoria – its bottom damaged, three of its compartments seriously damaged – resumed its voyage on 4 February, limping into the new Hamilton Dock, Malta, for repairs. Bourke, despite being severely censured, retained his command.  HMS Victoria in dock, prior to completionAt the dawn of a second catastrophic day, 22 June 1893, Bourke and his contemporaries, among them Captain Jenkins on the Collingwood and Captain Markham on the Camperdown, were lined up like tin soldiers ready for an experimental manoeuvre – a very tight one at that. It was their misfortune to be in the hands of Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon, Commander of the British Mediterranean fleet: an obstinate, overbearing man with some very peculiar traits and strategies.Tryon was deliberately taciturn and unapproachable – the better, he thought, to assert the superiority of his rank. The better too to outdo “inferior” French and Italian navies also cruising the vital Mediterranean and the better to force his officers to think on their feet.Inexplicably – and at a time when signalling remained primitive, based as it was on a mixture of flags, semaphores and lamps – Tryon wanted the two columns of his fleet to turn, uniformly, a full 180 degrees, first towards each other then (so the theory went) retracing their prior course. His 11 Captains – with Tryon himself menacingly aboard the Victoria – were to do this whilst positioned a mere 1,100 or 1,200 metres from each other, even though a gap of 1,800-2,200 metres might have been considered a safe bare minimum.Markham hesitated. Surely Tryon had confused radii for diameters? Surely he had issued the sort of order likely to be revoked any minute? Perhaps Tryon really intended the convoy to turn 60 degrees to port, then 60 degrees to starboard, before resuming its original course?Tryon however, was getting impatient. Fearing humiliation – his colleagues also hesitant to defy their esteemed commander – Markham aboard the Camperdown conceded, swinging towards the fated Victoria, despite believing he cannot avoid hitting her.  Even so, the Victoria – built before the installation of automatic bulkhead doors – has many proven stabilisers. Perhaps Bourke is a more gifted captain than he has previously demonstrated?At the last, both lead vessels went straight into reverse thrust. But it was all too late.Vice Admiral Sir George Tryon was a difficult man insofar as his junior colleagues were concernedThe toughened steel ram of the Camperdown tore 9 feet into the side of the Victoria, a full 12 feet below its waterline. After two minutes the two vessels disengage but the Victoria lists, her many gun hatches and portholes taking in floods of swirling water.Three minutes later, her bow dips – but an unrelenting Tryon demands any rescue boats return to their respective ships. Now he commands the leaking Victoria to head straight for the shores of Tripoli, five miles distant. After all, the Victoria’s engines are still running, many men below deck unharmed.Maybe Tryon trusts that the “watertight” doors are still closed, so trapping many hands not already flushed into the ocean. Rapidly though, certainly by collision plus eight minutes, the whole of the Victoria’s bow is submerged, its stern far out of true, propellers turning in open air.At last, but way too late, Tryon yells: “Abandon ship! Everyone for himself!”  Five minutes on, the top deck goes under. Loosened boilers explode. Everything remotely portable bounces into the already hazardous surrounding ocean.Two men on board refuse to jump ship: Reverend SD Morris, the chaplain on duty in the sick bay, who folds his arms across his chest, closes his eyes and says a final prayer and Tryon himself, in time honoured tradition, going down on his watch, muttering: “this is entirely my doing, entirely my fault”.HMS Victoria disappears beneath the Mediterranean’s surfaceBourke – fitter and quicker than his superior – does, with great difficulty, make his escape. A distinguished fellow-escapee is the fevered John Jellicoe, one day himself to be promoted to commander-in-chief of the British Grand Fleet and dispatched to confront a detachment of the German navy off Jutland.Staff Commander Thomas Hawkins-Smith, one of Tryon’s most vocal critics, also survives by clinging on to rigging.\u0027Made in China’ label helps archaeologists solve 800-year-old mysteryIn total, 358 of Victoria’s complement perished, coincidentally the same number as those believed to have been saved. Six bodies only were taken ashore, along with 173 men injured during the tumult. Jenkins on the Collingwood unarguably rescued more people than any other captain on duty – mainly due to his not recalling his lifeboats.The stricken Camperdown, despite taking 90 minutes to effect partial water resistance, partial stability, somehow managed to keep going, battered, but without loss of life.Back in England, reliable news was scarce. Only Markham’s telegram listing 22 surviving officers was to hand and so thousands of anxious friends and relatives milled round the Admiralty.Anger and sorrow rapidly give way to philanthropy. Within three weeks, a remarkable distress fund of £50,000 was raised for Victoria widows and orphans – the equivalent of more than £5m today.John Jellicoe survived HMS Victoria’s sinking and went on to become Commander-in-Chief of the British Grand FleetDebates raged about whether there should be a public inquiry into the disaster some argued that would hand too many secrets of British seamanship to her enemies. A court martial was opened – Bourke’s second – with reporters allowed to witness some of the proceedings. Bourke requested that any captain sistering the Victoria was exempted as a judge.In the dock, Bourke kept referring to navy ships as if they were on a highway, obeying “rules of the road”. But the very concept of obedience troubled the chief investigator, Sir Michael Culme-Seymour – “a safe pair of hands” – throughout his deliberations.It appeared to be common ground that Markham on the Camperdown should have followed his first instinct and aborted the manoeuvre. But then, had there not been a collision, Markham would have been hauled over the coals for insubordination.Tryon actually gave his orders in person ignoring them was extremely difficult, however foolish and foolhardy they were.HMS Camperdown was commissioned at Portsmouth in 1889Culme-Seymour himself had to walk a tightrope: avoiding any hint at a precedent for altering (let alone ignoring) instructions from above. Tryon’s mental health was queried. Perhaps he was suffering from a brain disease, dementia, when he sent the Victoria to its doom?In the end, Bourke came out best, his reputation undiminished. Markham, meanwhile, was censured almost as much as his flag captain, Charles Johnstone. Both could have acted differently at different stages in the unfolding catastrophe. Markham was stripped of his command, his pay halved, and relegated to minor duties. He died early, aged 65, in 1906.Crucially, Tryon’s philosophy of seamanship was abandoned, history not permitted to be kind to his memory. Of the engaged fleet formation only a repaired Camperdown was still being tossed by high seas in 1898.Like the Hollandia, the Victoria’s wreckage lay undiscovered for a long time. Not until 111 years and two months later, on 22 August 2004, was the ship found, by Austrian-Lebanese er Christian Francis, assisted by British explorer Mark Ellyatt. It was positioned almost vertically, 140 metres below their search vessel. They concluded that a full 30 metres of the Victoria’s bow had buried itself in the seabed.Our fascination with the ocean is ceaseless (PA)Three intriguing footnotes to the sinking of the Victoria continue to tantalise. First, it has long been the legend that, at the very moment of inevitable collision between the Victoria and the Camperdown, Mrs Tryon was hosting a party in her London mansion, when Commander Tryon himself, but ghostlike, descended the staircase to join festivities.Second, one of Tryon’s hobbies was collecting memorabilia connected to his hero, Horatio Nelson. In 2012, Ellyat temporarily retrieved Nelson’s sword from Tryon’s cabin but, unsure what to do with this precious artefact, he hid the discovery in a different part of the wreck where it abides till this day.Third, is the very title “Victoria” fated? After all, it was the MV Princess Victoria, a British Railways’ roll-on, roll-off ferry that sank on its passage from Larne to Stranraer, on 31 January 1953, costing 133 lives (at the start of the weekend of the great Lincolnshire floods, which left many people drowned across East Anglia and the Low Countries).How Chad’s killing fields have been turned into an elephants’ havenHow crowdfunding is enabling indie talent to create graphic novelsWhy women in South Africa are carrying the burden of HIVAnd barely six weeks after that terrible storm, a reordered SS Victoria also sank, this time striking rocks – just as the Hollandia did.Why, though, recognise the anniversary of any ship’s demise when there are no living survivors and nothing to add to any inquest? Well, the lure of the sea still captivates and enchants even the most landlocked of the general population.Despite all its dangers – because of all its dangers – the sea is where many of us are most alive.Isles of Scillyor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Also moving up to the blue chip index is Ladbrokes Coral owner GVC Holdings, according to FTSE Russell, which conducts a quarterly review of which companies belong in the various indexes. In order to rebalance the FTSE 100, security firm G4S and private hospital group Mediclinic International will drop down to the FTSE 250. G4S rejoined the FTSE 100 in June last year, having previously been demoted in December 2015 after eight years in the index, following a collapse in earnings after the company became embroiled in a scandal relating to UK public contracts in 2013. Marks and\u0026nbspSpencer has hung on to its spot in the FTSE 100, despite fears that it would fall out of the top index for the first time in its history. The retailer’s share price has been on a downward trajectory for months, not helped by its announcement earlier this month that it plans to close 100 stores. \u0026nbspLaith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said M\u0026ampS had avoided relegation “by the skin of its teeth”. “Reshuffles happen every three months though, so this is a stay of execution rather than a full pardon,” he added. “M\u0026ampS boss Steve Rowe is promising transformation, and has been candid in admitting it’s a lengthy road ahead. However, the pace of disruptive technological change means making M\u0026ampS special again is a moving target, and management are taking aim from a long way out.”Mr Khalaf said Ocado’s promotion into the FTSE 100 was a “sign of the old economy giving way to the new”. “A spate of licensing agreements has trumped up the share price in recent months, and shows that Ocado is well versed in the art of the deal,” he said.Changes to the makeup of the various FTSE indexes will take effect from 18 June.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

ABC may be able to continue without her, but, as EW points out, Barr would benefit financially, which may be bad PR for the network.ABC had previously ordered 13 new episodes of Roseanne, and in spite of the cancellation several of the show\u0027s writers will remain at ABC.Yesterday, John Goodman reacted to the cancellation news, or rather declined to.“I\u0027d rather say nothing than to cause more trouble, he told ET News.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

My family is half-French and this is a specific problem.”Less than two weeks later Alexander van Terheyden, a council candidate in Hackney, was also suspended after he called Islam a “violent political ideology” comparable to fascism and communism on social media.\u0026nbspIn response to allegations of Islamophobia, Mr Van Terheyden said: “I’ve stated Islam is a violent political ideology. Note the word ‘political’ and not religious. Note I do not refer to Muslims, I refer to the political ideology.“My views have always been public. If you mean the fact that I’m happy to voice my discontent for communism, fascism, Islam and other extreme political ideologies there is no secret to this.”Three days later a Conservative council candidate in Watford, Darren Harrison, was suspended for allegedly supporting white supremacists.Mr Harrison apparently attended events held by nationalist anti-Islam group Generation Identity.He denied being a supporter of the group and said: “I do not support their views, but support their right to have their views, as I do anyone else, as long as it does not promote violence which to my knowledge, it does not.”On 24 April Phillipa Auton\u0026nbspstepped down as the council candidate in Hounslow after she responded to a story about the 2016 Berlin attacks by tweeting: “Revoke Muslim immigration, repatriate and secure European borders, keep Europe safe”.\u0026nbspShe stood by her comments and said she “supports free speech”.\u0026nbsp“You are limited to the number of characters you use in a tweet. I am against illegal immigration and I support having closed borders,” she said.\u0026nbspThe next day the Conservative mayor of Wokingham, Peter Lucey, also stood down after a number of social media posts about Islam and the English Defence League.\u0026nbspMr Lucey said: “Some past social media posts came to light and those are not appropriate for the town\u0026nbspmayor.“I resigned for that reason, and I fully apologise to everyone involved. I would like to apologise to the people of Wokingham and to my party, and I resign from all of them.”On 27 April, Nick Sundin, a Tory council candidate in Newcastle, was suspended after he tweeted the Prophet Mohammed was a “f****** paedophile”.\u0026nbspHe did not respond directly to allegations of Islamophobia but did delete his Twitter account.\u0026nbspLess than a week later, Karen Sunderland, a council candidate in Lewisham, was suspended after old tweets emerged where she called Islam “the new Nazism”.After the story emerged Ms Sunderland’s Twitter account was deleted.On 1 May David Boston, a council candidate in Enfield, posted a picture of bacon hanging on a door handle as a way to “protect your house from terrorism” – he was suspended by the party pending an investigation.\u0026nbspThree weeks later Stephen Goldsack, a Scottish Conservative councillor in North Lanarkshire was expelled from the party after it was uncovered that he had formerly been the “Scottish security adviser” for the BNP.\u0026nbspHe allegedly rejected an application for a mosque, saying it would be okay if it was a church.\u0026nbspHarun Khan,\u0026nbspsecretary\u0026nbspgeneral of the Muslim Council of Britain, said the number of examples of alleged Islamophobia within the party was a “serious concern”. \u0026nbspHe said: “The Conservative Party prides itself in being against any form of bigotry and racism yet there are serious concerns that its best values are being disfigured by Islamophobic views.\u0026nbsp“We look forward to the party taking forward our suggestion of an inquiry into Islamophobia and we are happy to help support in any capacity we can.”When asked by\u0026nbspThe Independent if investigations into Islamophobia\u0026nbspwere still underway and what steps were being\u0026nbsptaken\u0026nbspto tackle the issue,\u0026nbspa Conservative Party spokesperson\u0026nbspsaid: “We do not comment on ongoing investigations.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

UK house prices rose 2.4 per cent in May compared with the same month last year, which was a slower rate of growth than expected, according to the new data.Between April and May, prices were down 0.2 per cent, with supply remaining low and surveyors reporting subdued levels of new buyer enquiries.\u0026nbspIt follows the trend seen throughout the first quarter of 2018, during which London was the weakest performing region with prices dropping 1 per cent on the year before. In the first three months of the year, the north of England recorded stronger house price performance than the south, while Northern Ireland led UK regions for property price growth. Robert Gardner, Nationwide’s chief economist, said the fact that annual house price growth has stayed within a “fairly narrow range” of 2-3 per cent over the past year suggested there was “little change in the balance between demand and supply in the market over that period”. “There are few signs of an imminent change,” he added. “Looking further ahead, much will depend on how broader economic conditions evolve, especially in the labour market, but also with respect to interest rates. “Subdued economic activity and ongoing pressure on household budgets is likely to continue to exert a modest drag on housing market activity and house price growth this year, though borrowing costs are likely to remain low.”Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said it was unlikely that the near-flat trend in prices will improve imminently.“Mortgage rates, which jumped in April, will continue to rise over the coming months,” he said, noting that the Bank of England had only delayed raising interest rates, meaning a hike is still on the cards this year.“Demand likely will remain at levels consistent with merely stagnant house prices,” Mr Tombs said.Jonathan Samuels, chief executive of property lender Octane Capital, said: Tight supply and subdued demand are the key contributors to the ongoing limbo gripping the UK property market. A lethargic economy populated by cautious and squeezed consumers has created a property market lacking both momentum and direction. The property market is fuelled by confidence but many consumers are running on fumes. Low stock levels and continued cheap borrowing rates will prevent a material decline in prices but equally a rise greater than very low single digits is highly unlikely. From a house price growth perspective, 2018 is looking greyer by the day.Meanwhile, Craig McKinlay, sales and marketing director at Kensington Mortgages, said the trend highlighted by the Nationwide data was “all too familiar”. “An insufficient supply of new housing is continuing to make prices creep up year-on-year. Whilst price rises of late have been more sustainable, the challenges of the housing market remain,” he said. “The situation can be resolved, but it will take time, and the government will need to redouble its efforts to meet the housing targets for future generations.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Digital minister Margot James told BBC Radio 5 Live that fans looking to buy tickets from a secondary site should not choose Viagogo, one of four major ticket reselling firms in the UK, because “they are the worst”. Meanwhile, National Trading Standards said on Wednesday that it had been in contact with the Advertising Standards Authority in relation to Viagogo. “As such we have now launched an investigation into Viagogo, which will look at all legal options to bring them into compliance with the law,” a spokesperson for Trading Standards said.Viagogo has previously been censured by the Advertising Standards Authority for “failing to make clear upfront all fees that can be calculated in advance when making price claims”, putting it in breach of the \u0026nbspUK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising and Direct \u0026amp Promotional Marketing, known as the CAP Code.The ASA said it had received complaints about how prices were presented on the Viagogo website, with quoted costs not making clear to consumers that they would be expected to pay additional fees and charges when ordering tickets. The ASA said it contacted Viagogo in March requesting that the company make changes to its website, and the firm said it would make the necessary amendments. However, the ASA added, as of Wednesday, Viagogo’s website “continues to include pricing information that is in breach of the CAP Code and the ASA’s ruling”. As a result, Viagogo has been placed in the ‘non-compliant advertisers’ section of the ASA’s website. Viagogo has been contacted for comment. The company was not the only firm implicated in the ASA’s crackdown earlier this year: StubHub, Seatwave and GetMeIn were also accused of misleading customers about fees and charges when booking tickets.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Photographer Jonathan Ernst: In his final days in office, Obama made a visit home to Chicago. As he spoke from the stage to his wife and daughter in the audience, he became emotional when he talked about what they had sacrificed during his time in office. I turned from photographing the Obama women embracing to find him onstage wiping away tears. A combination of photos shows the crowds attending the inauguration ceremonies to swear in U.S. President Donald Trump at 12:01pm (left) on January 20, 2017 and President Barack Obama sometime between 12:07pm and 12:26pm on January 20, 2009.

Photographer Joshua Roberts: I have covered the White House for 16 years and normally either the President or the pool is in position when an event starts. In this case the President was not where anyone expected him to be. In fact, he was almost blocking the door when the pool came in. We had to scramble to find a position without bumping him or the furniture as he greeted and thanked members of law enforcement for their security efforts during the inauguration. Luckily, he greeted FBI Director James Comey a few seconds after the pool had made its way into the room.US President Donald Trump, is joined by his staff, as he speaks by phone with Russia\u0027s President Vladimir Putin in the Oval Office on 28 January, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Very early in the Trump administration, weekends were as busy as weekdays. On Trump\u0027s second Saturday the official schedule said he would be making private phone calls to a number of world leaders including Russia\u0027s Vladimir Putin. I arrived early and, before sitting down at my desk walked up to Press Secretary Sean Spicer\u0027s office. He, too, was just taking his coat off. I gingerly made the suggestion that previous administrations had sometimes allowed photos of such phone calls through the Oval Office windows on the colonnade. To my mild shock, he didn\u0027t even think about it twice. We\u0027ll do it! he said. In truth, I really only expected the Putin call, but we were outside the windows multiple times throughout the day as the calls went on.Senior advisor Kellyanne Conway (L) attends as US President Donald Trump welcomes the leaders of dozens of historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) in the Oval Office on 27 February, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: We\u0027re often asked how much access we have to the Trump administration, and the answer is we have an awful lot. President Trump himself is very comfortable in the spotlight, and his aides are similarly unfazed by cameras. In this instance, senior advisor Kellyanne Conway was so comfortable in our presence she seemed not to consider the optics of kneeling on a Oval Office sofa to take pictures with her phone. Germany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel and US President Donald Trump hold a joint news conference in the East Room of the White House on 17 March, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Chancellor Merkel made one of the earliest important visits of any US allies to meet Trump in his first months in office. When world leaders give joint news conferences they don\u0027t always tend to give each other their full attention - but Merkel watched Trump intently at several key moments, and here seemed particularly rapt.President Trump reacts as he sits on a truck while he welcomes truckers and CEOs to attend a meeting regarding healthcare at the White House on 23 March, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: The White House organised a listening session with truckers and CEO\u0027s of major American companies, regarding healthcare reform. An 18-wheeler tow truck was parked on the South Lawn of the White House and as Trump welcomed the truckers someone invited the him to come and sit in the driver\u0027s seat. Trump jumped into the cab and started yelling and pretending to drive - creating one of the most memorable pictures of the year. A lesson learned, always be prepared for the unexpected.US President Donald Trump talks to journalists members of the travel pool on board the Air Force One during his trip to Palm Beach, Florida on 6 April, 2017. Carlos Barria: During the many trips to President Trump\u0027s residence in Florida it is usual to see the president coming to the back of the plane to chat with journalists. During one of the trips to the so called \u0027Winter White House\u0027, Trump had a long talk with reporters while the Air Force One entertainment system was playing one of the latest Star Wars movies. As I was listening to Trump talk I was also looking at the movie waiting for a part of the movie to frame the mood of the day. Of the many scenes, I choose the one with Darth Vader.US President Donald Trump speaks during an interview with Reuters in the Oval Office of the White House on 27 April, 2017. \u0026#13US President Donald Trump reacts as he arrives at Harrisburg international airport, before attending a rally marking his first 100 days in office in Pennsylvania on 29 April, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania to celebrate his hundred days in office with a victory rally. He was in friendly territory as he won with a big difference over his opponent Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania, during the November elections. As usual when the commander-in-chief arrives local residents gather to greet him. This time a small group of military personnel attended the arrival.

Photographer Joshua Roberts: Covering the White House does not just mean covering the President. White House staffers are an important part of the story and their relationship with the President and each other is an indicator of how things are going in the West Wing. The tendency is to focus exclusively on the President once an event starts but I always try to look around to see how people are reacting as things unfold.Secret Service agents use a presidential limousine as cover from spraying water as US President Donald Trump lands via Marine One helicopter in New York on 4 May, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: The best part of any trip to New York City with the sitting US President is the helicopter ride into Manhattan. The ride out at night can be stunning.

Trump met Russian President Vladimir Putin during a bilateral meeting at the G20 summit in Germany. The world\u0027s eyes were on these two leaders after speculation about Russian interference during the 2016 US elections. We entered the room for less than two minutes, where I took dozens of pictures. But there was this very interesting moment when Trump extended his hand to Putin for a handshake. Putin paused for a second and looked at Trump\u0027s hand. That was the picture that I was looking for, a little moment that seemed to say a lot. First lady Melania Trump chats with US President Donald Trump during their return from Germany at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland on 8 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: After President Trump\u0027s trip to Germany he arrived back at Joint Base Andrews, Maryland. First Lady Melania Trump said goodbye to Trump as she was heading off in a different direction that day. While chatting a breeze blew Melania\u0027s hair up in the air. Vice President Mike Pence laughs as President Donald Trump holds a baseball bat as they attend a Made in America product showcase event at the White House on 17 July, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: This summer the White House organized an event to showcase \u0027Made in America\u0027 products. All kinds of exhibitors brought their products as the President and Vice President toured the event. One of the companies was Marucci Sport, a manufacturer of baseball bats based in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As Trump approached a table full of baseball bats, photographers at the event, including me, rushed to get a good angle hoping that he would pick up a bat. As we predicted, he did. He took one and joked around as though he was hitting something hard. The only thing closer to him right there, was the media.Former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski says hello to reporters as he and White House advisors including Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci accompany President Trump for an event celebrating veterans at AMVETS Post 44 in Ohio, July 25, 2017. Jonathan Ernst: The most visible person in any White House is naturally the President, followed by the press secretary. But there are also the staff who support them. For those of us covering the Trump administration, there seem to be more compelling figures in the West Wing than ever before. It\u0027s crucial to know who\u0027s who and why they\u0027re important. When I raised my camera and back-pedalled ahead of the group to take this image Lewandowski gave me a hello. I liked the photo, but had no idea it would go a little bit viral, especially since Scaramucci, who was the biggest mover and shaker that week, was hidden back in the pack. But I guess the image catches a glimpse of what it\u0027s like to be a West Wing staffer on the road. US President Donald Trump arrives at a rally in West Virginia on 3 August, 2017. Photographer Carlos Barria: President Trump travelled to Huntington for one of his usual campaign rallies. While members of his family spoke to the crowd he was waiting under a black curtain to be introduced. Suddenly he walked onto the stage, one of the first frames that I took was of his hand. I set my exposure for the light on the stage hoping to create this dark background and it worked. Without his protective glasses on, US President Donald Trump looks up towards the solar eclipse while viewing with his wife Melania and son Barron at the White House on 21 August, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: On a day when everyone, and I mean everyone, was told not to look at the eclipse without protective glasses, Trump, President of the United States, couldn\u0027t help himself.US President Donald Trump poses for a photo as he and first lady Melania Trump help volunteers hand out meals during a visit with flood survivors of Hurricane Harvey at a relief centre in Houston, Texas on 2 September, 2017. Photohrapher Kevin Lamarque: Trump, eager to deliver the image of a hands-on response to Hurricane Harvey, made this visit to a relief centre and obliged this woman with a selfie as Melania continued to work. Donald Trump welcomes 11-year-old Frank Giaccio as he cuts the Rose Garden grass at the White House on 15 September. Frank, who wrote a letter to Trump offering to mow the lawn, was invited to work for a day at the White House along the National Park Service staff.  Frank was so focused on his task that he did not notice the President arrive to surprise him. He took his father jumping in to grab his attention and point Trump out. Photographer Carlos Barria said: “The image of Trump shouting at a kid who is mowing his lawn might have many interpretations in today\u0027s politically polarized United States. But for me it was just a kid who loved what he was doing, to the point he almost appeared to ignore the President.A man kneels with a folded U.S. flag as the motorcade of U.S. President Donald Trump passes him after an event at the state fairgrounds in Indianapolis, Indiana, U.S., September 27, 2017. In September, soon after Trump had made comments condemning NFL players who kneel during the national anthem, he made a day trip to a rally in Indianapolis. Jonathan Ernst managed to capture a man on one knee with a tri-folded flag and was able to use a portion of the sign on the building he was kneeling in front of to track the man down and tell his story in full. US Army veteran Marvin Boatright wanted to send a message against social injustice. President Donald Trump throws rolls of paper towels into a crowd of local residents affected by Hurricane Maria as he visits Calgary Chapel in San Juan, Puerto Rico on 3 October, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: During an afternoon visit to Puerto Rico for President Trump to survey damage from Hurricane Maria and greet some of its victims, Trump made a stop at a church where food and supplies were being distributed. Among the items were paper towels and Trump, apparently caught up in the moment, decided to distribute some of the rolls.White House Senior adviser Jared Kushner sits behind President Trump during a cabinet meeting in Washington on 1 November, 2017. Photographer Kevin Lamarque: The role of Jared Kushner has gone through a series of changes. He began front and centre as a high profile adviser, but as time has passed and issues surrounding him have surfaced, he has become more of a background figure.Donald Trump and China\u0027s President Xi Jinping shake hands after making joint statements at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on 9 November, 2017. Photographer Damir Sagolj: It\u0027s one of those how to make a better or at least different shot when two presidents shake hands several times a day, several days in row. If I\u0027m not mistaken in calculation, presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump shook their hands at least six times in events I covered during Trump\u0027s recent visit to China. I would imagine there were some more handshakes I haven\u0027t seen but other photographers did. And they all look similar - two big men, smiling and heartily greeting each other until everyone gets their shot. But then there is always something that can make it special - in this case the background made of US and Chinese flags. The first time it didn\u0027t work for me. The second time I positioned myself lower and centrally, and used the longest lens I have to capture only hands reaching for a handshake.US President Donald Trump boards Air Force One to depart for Vietnam from Beijing Airport in Beijing, China, November 10, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: There is a Reuters photographer in the tight pool covering the US president for every appearance he makes 365 days a year. This was just one of 32 images of mine that were transmitted on the Reuters wire of President Trump visiting China and Vietnam that day. You never know when a sudden interaction, a gust of wind or a unique facial expression will lead to a striking image that grabs peoples\u0027 attention.Donald Trump registers his surprise as he realises other leaders, including Russia\u0027s Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, Vietnam\u0027s Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, President of the Philippines Rodrigo Duterte and Australia\u0027s Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, are crossing their arms for the traditional ASEAN handshake as he participates in the opening ceremony of the summit in Manila on 13 November, 2017. Photographer Jonathan Ernst: Having covered a few ASEAN summits, I knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. Not everyone in the room knew to expect the ASEAN handshake. A lot was written about this unscripted moment, and what deeper meaning it might have. The simple truth is that sometimes in life there are unscripted moments.Since joining the US president’s legal team Mr Giuliani has made a series of notable television appearances.This includes making the bombshell admission Mr Trump repaid his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, for the $130,000 payment to adult actor Stormy Daniels as part of a nondisclosure agreement related to an affair Ms Daniels says she had with Mr Trump in 2006.But Mr Giuliani was later challenged over how his statement appeared to contradict Mr Trump’s earlier denial of knowledge of the payment to Ms Daniels.Mr Giuliani responded by saying the talk of a $35,000 a month retainer was just “rumour” – despite him having said days earlier it was fact.The Republican also revealed the president recently ordered a hamburger – one of his favourite dishes – with just half a bun.He told The Washington Post the duo dined together on 6 May at the president’s golf club in Virginia.While Mr Giuliani enjoyed a light Cobb salad, Mr Trump, whose weakness for fast food has been widely documented, ordered a well-done burger with half the bun, a choice which The Post claims was “in service to his health”.“I do that, too, sometimes. It’s a good way to do it,” Mr Giuliani said.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Italian governments have failed to meet the aspirations of Italians since at least the 1990s and the voters have been turning to ever more populist and extremist parties as a result. The brief premiership\u0026nbspof Matteo Renzi, which fell at the end of 2016 after\u0026nbsphe lost a constitutional referendum was probably the last gasp of conventional politics. A kind of Italian version of Tony Blair or Emmanuel Macron, Renzi\u0027s\u0026nbsppromising attempts at political and economic reform eventually stalled. His progressiveliberal Democratic Party secured a little over a fifth of the vote at the last election, pushed into third place\u0026nbspthe League (37 per cent) and\u0026nbspFive Star (32.7 per cent).\u0026nbspThe two leading groups in Italy are now the Five Star Movement, which was, literally, founded by a comedian, and is a kind of Italian Ukip and The League, formerly the Northern League, which enjoys most of its support in the wealthier north of Italy, rather than the poorer, more rural south. (Analogous to Catalan separatism in Spain).The League advocated virtual separation for the Northern provinces to form their own state. Some seek outright independence, reversing the historic Resorgimento (unification) of 1861. The League is thus a kind of cross between the politics of the SNP and Ukip.\u0026nbspThe president vetoed their choice of finance minister because he was a eurosceptic and might seek to lead Italy out of the euro – for which the Five StarLeague parties did not receive a mandate from the Italian electorate. The parties then refused to form a government, hence the stalemate. Some form of technocratic government will govern Italy until fresh elections are held. These may in effect become a referendum on staying in the euro (though not the EU).Italy’s slow-growing economy means poorer public services, bigger national and private debts, lower wages and lower living standards than expected.\u0026nbspSome blame immigration, and Italy is certainly the first destination for many making their way across the Mediterranean from Africa.Some also resent the euro, the European single currency, fully adopted in 2002, and regard it as a German racket. On this reading of things, the Germans do well out of Italy by selling the Italians their cars and then lending the Italians the money to pay for them, a cycle leading to a sort of economic bondage.\u0026nbspItalians thus believe the EU, and Germany in particular, has too much power over Italy hence the new strain of euro scepticism in what was traditionally an enthusiastic founding member (1957) of the European Union. Once the tacit admission in Italy was that they’d prefer Brussels to turn their affairs than Rome. That has now changed.So the Italian populist parties are stirring up conflicts with the EU Commission in Brussels and the European Central Bank in Frankfurt – convenient scapegoats.The Italian state and the Italian banks are going bust simultaneously, because they rely upon each other and neither is strong.The banking crisis after 2008 exposed two particular Italian problems, apart from longer term demographic and industrial trends, and these are still the immediate issues. \u0026nbspFirst and most serious is the weakness of her banks. By tradition most of the debts issued by the Italian government were purchased by Italian banks, pension funds and other financial institutions. The Italian banks are therefore stuffed full of Italian government bonds, and investors are becoming increasingly concerned that the weaknesses in Italy\u0027s public finances, namely a very large national debt, would lead to a default on the bonds, leaving them less valuable or worthless, and destroying the financial assets of the banks – which would then suffer a run and go bust.Italy and Italy’s banks would be insolvent – and beyond the capacity of Germany or the EU to rescue.\u0026nbspOnly a huge programme of buying Italian government debts, via the Italian banks, by the European Central Bank, in turn funded by the German taxpayer, has prevented this collapse from happening sooner.Since the banking crisis in 2008 the Italian has not developed as badly as the Greek one – but it is not entirely fixed either.Now that there is talk about the ECB buying less Italian government debt the old worries about Italy are coming back. These are exacerbated by the populist programme of the Five Star and League parties – which would need to borrow much more in order to fund their ambitious spending programmes.Dissolution with the post-Mussolini, post-Second World War settlement set in during the 1990s, when the old parties, the Christian Democrats and Socialists, became mired in scandal and associated with political and economic failure.Italy’s economy had began to stagnate, losing its competiveness and compounded by a low birth rate and declining working population. The post-war boom, an economic miracle which had seen Italians moving from the countryside to the towns and cities, owning scooters and cars\u0026nbspand growing prosperous was ending.In the 1950s and 1960s Italy, carried along by the increase in trade in the original EU, was growing at 7 per cent or so a year. Names such as Fiat, Lambretta and Zanussi became famous globally powerful brands, along with luxury brands such as Prada, Armani and Ferrari.But by the 1990s low growth, higher unemployment and stagnant living standards became the norm increased migration, which might help the Italian economy if properly managed, was viewed with resentment and suspicion.It was then that figures such as Silvio Berlusconi and his Forza Italia gained in popularity, themselves eventually giving way to Five Star and The League.If the economy, public finances and banks were fixed, many of Italy’s political problems would melt away. There are three options:This would mean allowing a Five StarLeague government to carry out its spending plans, allowing it to borrow and print much more money, and have the ECB buy all the resulting debt without complaint.Italy would also be allowed to print a parallel euro currency of its own, as the populist parties would like, (“mini bonds”) to help fund its spending, any inflationary problems being dealt with by the ECB, again without penalty to Italy.This would require the wealthier economies of Germany, the Netherlands and Finland, for example, to continue to subsidise Italy, in return for its continuing membership of the single currency and something resembling stability.However the ECB has already indicated it wishes to scale back its purchases of Italian government debt – which has fuelled investors’ concerns that no-one else will buy them.Exitaly: Italy leaves the euro\u0026nbspIn the long term this would enable Italy to devalue its own currency to get through structural reforms, solve any problems with international trade and to accommodate inflation, as was traditional when they used the lira. It cannot do this under the euro, and instead has to cut public spending, cut wages and undergo austerity – all deeply unpopular.However, bringing back the lira also means that interest rates would soar to persuade investors to take on the risk of a devaluing new lira currency or a default by an Italian government unable to pay back its treasury bonds.In the short run, Italy\u0027s already large national debt would need to be redenominated in the new lira currency, which, being worth less than the euro, will make the debt more expensive to service, perhaps prohibitively so.A European Risorgimento: Reform of the euro system: adding a banking union and a fiscal unionThis is the kind of solution President Macron of France has been campaigning for. It would mean that all eurozone governments in effect take on each others debts, and all are responsible for the stability of the banking system in every member state of the single currency.So this would include the likes of Greece, Spain and Italy, but not Sweden, Poland, Denmark, or the UK for that matter, who are not euro members.There might be more pressure on the Swedes and others to join the euro to “burden share” the costs of the European fiscal union. It would also require a powerful central European finance ministry and chief. \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Macron reforms would work because any monetary union, such as the euro, will never work smoothly, or at all, without a corresponding fiscal union, and preferably banking union too.However the objection is that it would require the transfer of huge sums from the richer northern economies (Germany especially) to the poorer southern ones (Italy especially), and a leap forward in political integration.Angela Merkel has made plain her reluctance to take on such obligations and, in parallel to Italy, extremist eurosceptic movements such as the AfD have been making progress in Germany at the expense of the traditional Christian Democrats and Social Democrats.Germany, as much as Italy itself, may soon have to choose whether it still wants Italy in the eurozone.Without Italy, the zone\u0027s third largest economy, though, the fundamental sustainability of the euro would come under question. Financial chaos could break out and, via “contagion” in interlinked banks and economies, spread through the wider European financial system and economy, with a global impact.One side effect of that would be to make Brexit look somewhat more palatable to the British.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The knife is not the crime. Children seldom randomly pick up knives and decide to stab people. In my experience it often starts when the child is young.This spate of killings will pass but for now it affords the attention and opportunity to reflect.Currently, the debate is cyclical and futile. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan says it’s not his fault, he needs more police. The police say we need more of them. The Government says you’ve had more police but it didn’t make a difference. Meanwhile, children are dying on the streets.The search for solutions must stretch beyond the police. Aside from outrage, there needs to be a focus on the causes, as well as the symptoms, of these crimes.This shouldn’t detract from taking knives away from those carrying them, but we can’t ignore the fact that replacing a blade is as simple as going to the kitchen drawer.Those of us who are more able to look at the world through the eyes of young people who carry knives for protection and status get closer to how they think.What we are witnessing is a sophisticated type of group mind. Some of our boys are so mentally zoned into a culture of violence. All of my youths know, directly, someone murdered, or at least seriously injured, on our streets. Some have been involved.How did we get to this place? Slowly. As the influence of parents, pastors and school principals has waned, all our young people speak of a distinct feeling of powerlessness.The tried and traditional levers and sanctions affecting the development of children are not functioning effectively. For too many, the family bond is damaged and so ruptured we overlook its devastating effects. My young people need something to fight, something to believe in. Like everyone else, they want to be someone, and sometimes that means fighting each other.It is a sad day when, for some, employment prospects are more plentiful with local dealers selling weed and crack than the only other job on offer at the local barber’s.Some of the young people I work with speak about the role of their family’s socio-economic status in their life choices. If they’re lucky, they see their parents locked into dead-end, minimum-wage jobs with no security or satisfaction. Knives, they conclude, are a type of urban qualification. As one put it: “Everyone wants to be someone, this is my way.”Digging deeper, I learned that 85 per cent of my students had never patronised a black-owned business in the past five years, aside from a barber shop. Too many of them carry the assumption that blacks are inferior. “This is how it is,” Adamu told me. “Our business is on the road, we are designed for the hustle.”I began this work with an agenda to keep black boys from being arrested in their droves.Sadly, a lot of our kids have ended up in prison, but they started the three-lap race of life two laps behind. For some, it is almost impossible to work through all the scars.For many of our children, entrance to crime and urban violence is connected to a sense of wanting to be accepted and acceptable — violence is currency.Their hope is that they survive long enough to one day grow out of it. The desire to belong is so real that any community, including gangs, will do.The more law enforcement is used, the more of a challenge it becomes. It almost acts as encouragement because it is something else to beat.Drugs are also a way of life. For some it’s about using, for others it’s selling. It’s simply a way to earn money. A visit to our social housing estates will reveal high levels of organisation. Like any business, you have distribution points, a clear marketing strategy and, most of all, plans to deal with the opposition.I also see the age of involvement getting younger and they don’t care if they live or die. In that sense they are like suicide bombers.Recently I was involved in the rehabilitation of two nine-year-old boys. One was tasked with moving weapons from location to location and the other given addresses for drug drops. He would deliver the packages during school lunch breaks in exchange for McDonald’s, KFC and clothes.Children like these do not grow up seeing themselves as having a future in business or leadership. They are crying out for genuine role models. When our young men find more employment opportunities from businessmen than “road men”, real change will begin.Until that time, we need to love these children back to sanity. They are simply not able to make the rational choices our education and social systems demand.We experience a ruling class committed to maintaining the status quo. Talk about social mobility is just air. Our children are left with the crumbs that fall from the master’s table.The Government is afraid of the mob — but in some areas there is little less than anarchy breaking out.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Government has no credible policy and the whole world knows it.“Whitehall’s real preparations are for the continuation of EU law and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice.“The State has made no preparations to leave and plans to make no preparations to leave — even after leaving.”Barring a last-minute change of tune, Mrs May is walking into an ambush which will sour relations with Brussels and condemn Britain to a generation of rancorous civil discord.A botched deal will be dressed up in Brussels newspeak as a triumph for all sides.In fact it will almost certainly betray 17.4million British people who explicitly voted OUT in the biggest democratic mandate ever seen in this country.Voters who hoped for clear and unequivocal freedom from EU laws and regulations are unlikely to stay silent for long.They expected Brexit ministers to carve out a prosperous and independent future.Instead, they have watched defeated Remainers mount a ruthless and successful counter-attack.From a position of strength as a major trading nation, Britain has surrendered on all fronts, caved in to Brussels bullies — and handed over a £39BILLION ransom for the privilege.We are likely to remain bound by a version of the EU customs union, the single market and the European Court of Justice for years to come. Meanwhile, mass immigration runs out of control.Perhaps to his own amazement, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has succeeded in his aim to make Britain worse off outside.We will not be allowed to flourish as a free-trading sovereign state.Nobody can be more vividly aware of this than Mrs May as she prepares for her looming summit.Yet she has only herself to blame, starting with the catastrophic snap election which destroyed her Commons majority.She needlessly coughed up that £39billion with nothing in return from Brussels and allowed herself to be derailed by phantom threats of IRA violence if the UK establishes any sort of border with Ireland.The sad truth is that Mrs May is not up to the job as Prime Minister at a momentous point in our history.In an age when words really count, we are lumbered with an ultra-cautious leader who cannot think on her feet or speak without notes.At a time when we should all be doing our best to make Brexit work, we have a Prime Minister who would much prefer to Remain.For the moment, Leavers such as Iain Duncan Smith and Jacob Rees-Mogg are pledging their loyalty.But a bad deal would provoke die-hard Tories into the only honourable action they feel they can take — and put her premiership on the line.They already have the votes needed to trigger a leadership contest.They will not support key Commons votes to dilute Brexit, risking Government defeat by an unholy alliance of Labour opportunists, Lib Dem and SNP wreckers and Tory Remainers.A disastrous combination of weak leadership, cack-handed communication and dismal diplomacy has plunged Britain into a needless constitutional crisis.It says something about Mrs May’s position as leader that her strongest card is the prospect of yet another general election — the third in three years.And the nightmare of political throwback Jeremy Corbyn storming the barricades and leading his Marxist extremists to power.[boxout featured-image=6392734]AS PM, Tony Blair insisted 50 per cent of school leavers must go to university.The result was grade inflation across the board and “Ology” graduates struggling to find a decent job.Now his sensible son Euan, 34, is arguing for tailor-made apprenticeships, giving kids a chance to earn while they learn.His views coincide with new Tory policy – T-levels, technical and trade qualifications which fit pupils to the work they want.They can range from plumbers and computer wizards to City bankers.Many will be driving their own car and buying a home by the time pals leave university with mountains of debt.It is the way forward in skill-hungry Britain.[/boxout] Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some is also done to shut down anything other than the argument that says “It needs more money”, while other bits are there just because TV executives have noticed it’s the NHS’s 70th birthday and think they’d better do something to look caring.Like, for instance, ITV’s A\u0026ampE Live, “from the frontline”, at Leeds General Infirmary.A self-defeating three-day experiment which, on the one hand gleefully promised us all sorts of carnage: “It’s hotting up here.” But on the other was swift to assure viewers they were operating on a time delay in case patients refused filming consent, thereby ruling out most of the drunks and any possibility of a bloke being wheeled into reception with a Hoover attachment up his fundament.I’d avoid describing LGI as the most sedate-looking A\u0026ampE unit in Britain, though, because ITV had attempted to redress the noise balance by having it hosted by human Tannoy system Davina McCall, who lost little time in telling us: “I had to get hypnotised to do this job, can you believe it?”Yeah, I can, actually.“I saw my granny sever her toes with a lawnmower,” she went on to explain, “and it made me squeamish.” If you thought for one minute, however, it sedated her, you either overestimate the powers of hypnotherapy or you haven’t been watching Davina’s career closely enough.The woman was in full Street Mates mode from the moment she clocked a young couple in the waiting room. “Are you going out?” said Davina, without so much as checking their vital signs.“We were on a date . . . our first date.”“AH-MAY-ZING! THIS IS GREAT. And it’s something to talk about when you have children . . . ”Silence. “I took it too far, didn’t I?”You did rather, Davina, though I get the squeamishness thing and actually flinched when she then told us: “A 23-year-old man, Tommy, is being brought in by ambulance after being rear-ended at high speed.”You’d hope Tommy got some of Davina’s meds as well, ’cos a weird thing happened on Wednesday and Thursday’s broadcasts.She actually calmed down a bit. To the extent I finally noticed the staff, who turned out to be naturals in front of a camera, which really shouldn’t have been a surprise given TV’s insatiable appetite for this sort of show.Among other recent TV offerings, we have: A\u0026ampE Live, A\u0026ampE, 24 Hours In A\u0026ampE, The Real A\u0026ampE, Sun Sea \u0026amp A\u0026ampE, A\u0026ampE On The Road.And that’s just the ones with A\u0026ampE in the title.There’s a whole load more with the words ambulance and emergency, which you may also have watched but entirely forgotten.Why?’Cos an actual visit to A\u0026ampE is a real, vivid, frightening, frustrating, disturbing, impressive and unforgettable experience that can leave you weeping with gratitude for the NHS.TV, by contrast, generally offers a dumb, censored, antiseptic, grovelling, uncritical, cult-like, agenda-ridden version, with this sort of dialogue.Davina (to ambulanceman Gavin): “How important is it you get there early.”“The sooner we get there the more chance the patient has of surviving.”“And that’s so important, isn’t it?”Thank you, live TV. Where would we all be without you?Good Morning Britain’s Piers Morgan: “I leave a lot of phones in my bedroom, ’cos you never know when you’re going to get THE call when your manager says, ‘Got it. Prime-time America. You’re back on’.”And it’s go go go with My 600lb Life.NOTE: In order to avoid Britain’s Got Talent Live, I’m heading south of the border, down Mexico way. Column returns in a fortnight.BBC1’s version of the Jeremy Thorpe murder plot saga, A Very English Scandal, is nuts.It’s very entertaining as well, but it is nuts, with CGI badgers running around in episode one and a couple of Yucca plants shoved in some sand dunes to try and make us think North Devon is actually “California,” on Sunday night.The main issue, however, is that A Very English Scandal can’t quite decide if it’s a comedy or not. So it’s deadly serious whenever Thorpe’s commenting on Europe, immigration or gay rights, but pure Carry On when his ex-lover Norman Scott starts having it off in a caravan with the bird out of Torchwood.It’s more than saved, though, by the incredible storyline and performances of the brilliant Alex Jennings, who totally vanishes into the part of Thorpe’s sidekick, Peter Bessell, Patricia Hodge as Ursula Thorpe, and Ben Whishaw, who’s got the most difficult role of all as the insanely irritating Scott, but does it well enough to make me wish he’d been shot on Exmoor rather than his dog.In that sort of company, of course, it was also incredibly brave to give the lead role to Hugh Grant, who never quite convinces me he’s anyone other than Hugh Grant, yet I will say this for a performance that stands out from anything he’s ever done before.He’s wearing a hat.Courtesy of ITV’s Lee Dixon on England’s World Cup goalies: “You’d be down to one goalkeeper and a nervous one.”“You’d be down to one goalkeeper and a Neville Swan.”INCIDENTALLY, who claimed the following, last week: “People always get excited about cockchafers.”EASIEST gig on the soaps?EastEnders’ Big Mo, who’s just set herself up as Walford’s resident psychic and fortune teller.A job with my name on it, frankly, as I wouldn’t need a crystal ball, money or much encouragement to tell the locals: “This old craphole will be locked in an ever more depressing cycle of baby abductions, love triangles, disrupted weddings, head transplants and escaped animals from now until kingdom come. Get the hell out, while you still can.”Walford CID might also want to put me on a profiling retainer as well, given they’re the only people who haven’t noticed that every single street crime, including – surprise, surprise – last week’s stabbings of Keanu and Shakil, has been carried out by a white, working-class male with a bad stage school Cockney accent.I guess Big Mo’s probably safe in the position for the moment, though, as she seems to have foretold the re-appearance of Shane “Alfie” Richie in The Vic, earlier this month.However, at roughly the same time, she also predicted: “Jean (Slater) will get a job with teeth.”This Morning, “Earth Angel” Sarah Rebecca Vine: “I am a spiritual life coach and healer and, I feel, a messenger to wake people up.” Zzzzz.And First Time Mum, Ferne McCann: “The hypnotherapist session definitely calmed me down and emptied my mind.” Of what?The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “On the flag of South Sudan blue represents the waters of what major river?”Bradley Walsh: “What UK Prime Minister read geography at an all- women’s Oxford college?”Jackie: “Tony Blair.”Bradley Walsh: “In a hospital, the H\u0026ampN unit refers to the head and what other part of the body?”Jackie: “Nose.”And Ben Shephard: “In Australia and New Zealand a ‘long black’ is a variety of which hot beverage?”Teri: “Beer.”The BBC’s Friday night schedule offering us two left-wing panel shows (HIGNFY and New World Order), featuring ’s Mona Chalabi, when one was far too many.The A\u0026ampE Live caption writer responsible for the spelling of “interupt”. Channel 4’s Goggleboxers and all the other people who seem to think The Handmaid’s Tale is a documentary.Car Share lacking either the brains or the balls to make a preview copy of its finale available.And Good Morning Britain without that oaf Piers Morgan, on Thursdays and Fridays.

Dave’s How The Young Ones Changed Comedy (not entirely for the better).And The Chase offering up my favourite quiz show moment of the year, so far.Bradley Walsh: “Which astrologer published a colouring book called The Art Of Astrology?” John: “Galileo.” Bradley: “Russell Grant.”Gareth Bale: “I haven’t seen the goal back yet, I’ve only watched it again now.”Steve McManaman: “It’s a surprise that Bale’s not playing, but it’s not a surprise that he’s on the bench.”And Rio Ferdinand: “Win the Champions League and it’s chance to be forever mortalised.”(Compiled by Graham Wray)THIS week’s winner is Britain’s Best Home Cook’s Mary Berry and Gary Oldman as Dracula.

In the US — officially the world’s fattest nation — that figure is 18.5 per cent.UK stores now stock plus-size clothes for under-tens, with H\u0026ampM becoming the latest chain to sell a “generous fit” range for kids as young as eight.Obesity is predicted to double in the next 25 years — while tens of millions of pounds of taxpayers’ money has already been thrown at the problem.But a simple — and cheap — solution can already be found on the playgrounds and fields of around 6,000 primary schools where more than a million children take part in the Daily Mile.The exercise regime means that at some point in every school day, pupils leave their classroom, still in their uniform, to run, jog or walk for up to 15 minutes.Youngsters can set their own pace and talk to their friends while they go round.Most of the children complete a mile or more in the quarter of an hour.Teachers all over the country have reported how pupils return to the classroom invigorated and eager to learn after doing what is being called “jography”.Last week, Prime Minister Theresa May praised the Daily Mile and called on schools to take it up — but stopped short of saying it should be compulsory.Now, for all our kids’ sakes, The Sun is calling on Education Secretary Damian Hinds to make the Daily Mile mandatory in all primary schools.The idea began six years ago and has been growing steadily. But only now have scientists been able to prove it really does have an effect.Over the course of an academic year, a team of experts from Stirling University compared nearly 400 children, aged four to 11, from two primaries, with one group doing the Daily Mile and the other not.The Daily Mile kids were put through a series of tests to calculate whether they became fitter and whether they lost fat.IF you are a teacher or parent who would like to get your school doing the Daily Mile check out thedailymile or go to @_thedailymile or on Facebook. There is lots of information showing how easy it is to incorporate the Daily Mile and to support schools who want to get involved. You can also register your interest.The findings, which have just been released, show how they lost an average of four per cent body fat.They were also fitter and more active during the day, while time spent sitting around dropped by an average 18 per cent.Another investigation, conducted at an inner city school in London, found Daily Mile youngsters did much better than expected in SATS tests.Other tests have shown how children also feel less stressed and more confident.Retired head Elaine Wyllie, 62, came up with the idea of the Daily Mile almost by accident when pupils at her St Ninians school in Stirling wanted to get fitter.After just six weeks, not one of the 57 children in her first year was overweight.But to persuade the Government to introduce the Daily Mile into all Britain’s 20,000 primary schools, scientific proof was needed.After reading the latest results from Stirling University, Elaine said: “I knew this research would be the game-changer which would prove what I had believed all along — that the Daily Mile makes children fitter, happier, more active and a healthier weight.“I am delighted and relieved that we now have objective proof.”But education chiefs appear reluctant to make the Daily Mile compulsory for fear of upsetting head teachers, who might see it as an extra burden on their staff.However, Jim Cleaver, head of Westgate Community Primary in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, says: “The beauty of the Daily Mile is its simplicity.“It takes 15 minutes out of the day and for staff it is as easy as opening a door.”At Woodlands, a school for children with special needs in Leatherhead, Surrey, lead nurse Emma Packham has seen children lose weight as a result of the Daily Mile.She says: “We had five children who were clinically obese whose weight was just going up, up, up.“Since we started 18 months ago nobody in the target group has gained weight. Some have lost weight.No other factors in their lives have changed.”It is not just the children’s weight that is changing. Teachers are reporting that behaviour in classroom is improving. And many parents say their children sleep better at night.Former MP Andy Burnham, now the Mayor of Manchester, is a fan and wants his city to become the first where every primary school does the Daily Mile.Unlike some schemes, there would be no costs with introducing it into schools. All associated expenses are currently being paid by Britain’s richest man, Jim Ratcliffe, who has also used some of his £21billion fortune to advertise it during Ant \u0026amp Dec’s Saturday Night Takeaway.Sports commentator Jake Humphrey, who runs the Daily Mile with youngsters at Trowse primary school in Norwich, says: “I honestly don’t think parents are aware of how unfit their children are. Why weren’t we doing this 20 years ago?”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That readiness is absolutely vital to securing a genuinely beneficial deal.We know that Civil Service mandarins want Brexit to fail.They’ve set up roadblock after roadblock in the hope we’ll be forced to cave in and change our minds on the whole exercise.That cannot be allowed to happen.Jacob Rees-Mogg is spot on when he says the PM needs to show some iron, and that Brussels won’t get the money they desperately need unless they play ball with Britain. It’s the only way we’ll focus minds across Europe.Without a plan, we’re only planning to fail.THE calls for abortion reform in Northern Ireland are entirely understandable.It looks increasingly odd that its laws are so out of step with both the rest of the UK and now with their southern neighbour.But Ulster’s abortion laws have always been a matter for the people of Northern Ireland.For devolution to work, Westminster needs to acknowledge the right of the Scots, the Welsh and the Northern Irish to set their own rules.It’s not a pick ’n’ mix depending whether or not MPs agree with them.And the way some Labour politicians have suddenly become dedicated activists to drive a wedge between the PM and the DUP is shameless.The Government’s priority in Northern Ireland must be to restore a functioning Assembly, which has been missing for more than 500 days. Then the province can have an abortion debate.But it is for Ulster, not Westminster, to make any decisions.KYLIE Minogue has had us Spinning Around for decades. We wish the Red Blooded Woman a very happy birthday.If only we could all be So Lucky to look that good at 50.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Some Italians told me unelected bankers and institutions in Brussels were being put first. They have a point.The EU and Italy’s President now need to tread incredibly carefully. The 5-Star Movement is already mobilising voters through street protests. The League party is calling on them to vent their frustration at the banks and financial markets.Yesterday, one EU official suggested the financial markets would teach Italian voters a lesson by withdrawing investment from the country. This will only pour gasoline on the populist fire.So, what happens next? The populists will almost certainly sweep to another victory at fresh elections, possibly triggering a new financial crisis and creating another major headache in Brussels. One of the parties might also propose a referendum on Italy’s euro membership.It seems very likely this chaos is not going anywhere anytime soon and the EU will soon be presented with yet another crisis.The events in Italy have clear implications for the Brexit debate. The EU has struggled to make sense of why Leavers opted for Brexit, just as today they are struggling to make sense of the mood in Italy.Many Leavers voted for Brexit because they felt the EU was not able to manage its own affairs, and they will see Italy as further evidence of that.But also many Leavers were anxious that the European Union allows very little room for other political views and they will see that as well in the Italy crisis.While the president was acting in the remit of his constitutional office, the problem is that many Italians and Europeans feel this is an example of Europe’s inability to accept any opposition to the euro single currency.It seems difficult to see how this crisis can be resolved without a more openly Eurosceptic Italy — and without a populist government at the head of the eurozone’s third largest economy.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Its lavishly-funded Remainer stooges aim to do the same with Brexit.How does Brussels think this all ends?If Brexit is negated there will be a collapse of faith in democracy and probable civil unrest beyond anyone’s experience.In Italy, eurosceptic parties will now have an even bigger mandate. What then?The EU meets any dissent not with wise compromise but with brute force.It is the enemy of democracy. Its contempt for voters will prove its epitaph.WE like Theresa May’s tougher tone towards the EU. But it’s action that counts.If she’s serious about withholding our £39billion divorce payment until a trade deal is signed, great. But last we heard she was relying on “good faith” from Brussels which does not exist.The PM must not issue empty threats. Nor pay a penny without a guaranteed return.LIKE it or not, Brexit day next March will be a historic moment.A new series of commemorative coins is a great idea the Treasury seems to back. Which makes it even more illogical not to print Brexit stamps too.Logic, though, doesn’t cut it at the Royal Mail. Only its Remoaner chiefs’ prejudices.THE usual Sun-hating nitwit celebs and gormless keyboard warriors piled into us over Raheem Sterling’s tattoo.Some, laughably, screamed “racism”.

As if the squad’s mental fortitude is that fragile.No one supports England teams more vocally than The Sun. But are we supposed to censor or bury a controversial picture a footballer has already posted to 3.6million Instagram followers?Or ignore a tattoo which, with gang violence rife, outrages anti-gun campaigners?

As one of the most powerful men in the world, his day was meticulously planned down to the minute. But after Donald Trump took over as President, Obama was left to figure out how to spend his time away from the White House. His first port of call was a holiday away with the family, where he indulged in a spot of kite surfing with billionaire Sir Richard Branson. But it wasn\u0027t long before he was back in the spotlight again, meeting foreign dignitaries and even finding time to turn up for jury duty. Here we keep track of what America\u0027s 44th President has been doing to fill his time since leaving office.  May 2018 May saw Barack and wife Michelle sign a multi-year deal with Netflix to make tv series and films for the online streaming service. Obama said: One of the simple joys of our time in public service was getting to meet so many fascinating people from all walks of life, and to help them share their experiences with a wider audience. That\u0027s why Michelle and I are so excited to partner with Netflix - we hope to cultivate and curate the talented, inspiring, creative voices who are able to promote greater empathy and understanding between peoples, and help them share their stories with the entire world. Obama also slammed his successor\u0027s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.  In a rare public criticism of Trump, the former President said: I believe that the decision to put the JCPOA at risk without any Iranian violation of the deal is a serious mistake. He added: The consistent flouting of agreements that our country is a party to risks eroding America\u0027s credibility, and puts us at odds with the world\u0027s major powers. April 2018  Barack and Michelle attended the funeral of former First Lady Barbara Bush, the wife of President George H W Bush, in April. The pair met Donald Trump\u0027s wife Melania at the event, but the current US president did not attend to avoid disruptions due to added security. March 2018 Obama showed his support for the March For Life, as hundreds of thousands of Americans took to the streets to call for gun law reform. He tweeted: Michelle and I are so inspired by all the young people who made today’s marches happen. Keep at it. You’re leading us forward. Nothing can stand in the way of millions of voices calling for change. The protests came after 17 children were massacred at a school shooting in Florida.   February 2018  Obama and wife Michelle unveiled their official Presidential portraits in February at the US National Portrait Gallery in Washington DC. It is traditional for presidents to commission an oil painting once their term in office has finished Obama’s portrait was painted by Kehinde Wiley, while Michelle\u0027s was by Amy Sherald.  An investigation was also launched after a \u0027white substance\u0027 was sent to Obama\u0027s Washington office. Emergency Services said the letter was mailed from Hong Kong, and was understood to have contained baby powder. The building was not evacuated. January 2018  In January, Obama took a swipe at social media during an interview with American talk-show host David Letterman . He had some harsh words for information sharing, despite admitting that much of his success in the 2008 election came from social media. He spoke about social networks becoming like a bubble where people are only subjected to the views they believe in. Obama suggested that\u0027s part of what is making American politics so polarised. His successor Donald Trump has famously sparked furious debate with his often inflammatory statements on Twitter. December 2017  In his first interview since the end of his term as the 44th president, Obama was interviewed by Prince Harry for a BBC Radio 4 special. He warned about the dangers of the internet in becoming an echo chamber where people can have entirely different realities. They can be cocooned in information that reinforces their current biases. He also said that being out of office has freed him to work on longer term projects. I am able to focus on what I think are long-term problems in a way I couldn\u0027t always do, he said.  He also took a turn playing Father Christmas to dole out gifts to delighted youngsters at the Boys and Girls Club in Washington. Obama wore a Santa hat, but opted for a leather jacket rather than the big red suit when he stunned around 50 students. Sharing his visit on Twitter, he said: There\u0027s no better time than the holiday season to reach out and give back to our communities.  Obama also managed to squeeze in a three-nation tour to China, India and France. In India, he hosted an event for his Obama Foundation, and met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi:   November 2017  In November Obama was called for jury service in Chicago, court prompting a major security operation. He was called to serve at the Richard J. Daley Centre and said he would fulfill his civic duty. His arrival prompted streets to be cleared, filled instead with Secret Service agents and a media army. Obama sat with his fellow citizens and signed a few autographs before the hearing began. Ultimately, he was not among those selected for the final jury panel.  He also hosted the first Obama Summit in Chicago - an event aiming to inspire future leaders. Hundreds of leaders from city, the US and around the world joined the former President and Prince Harry to share ideas about creating lasting change in the world.   October 2017  In October, Obama joined the other four living former-US presidents at a concert to raise money for hurricane victims across America and the Caribbean. He joined George W Bush, Bill Clinton George H W Bush and Jimmy Carter at the One America Appeal concert at the Reed Arena in College Station, Texas. Current president Trump did not attend the event, but sent a video message in which he congratulated his predecessors for spearheading the relief effort. White House did not respond to questions over whether he had been invited Obama said: As former presidents we want to help our fellow Americans begin to recover. September 2017  September saw Obama join Prince Harry for the royal\u0027s Invictus Games for injured military veterans. The pair had front-row seats for a wheelchair basketball match between America and France. An onlooker said: They looked like the best of pals. They were having a great time.  It also emerged that Obama gave Harry a grilling about his relationship with Meghan Markle . The ex-President couldn’t resist a few questions as he and the royal sat together at the event in Toronto. Student Hayley Stover, who ended up sitting on the prince’s other side, told the Sunday People: “He asked if she was enjoying the Games and Harry was really smiling as he said yes. He looked so happy. Harry and Meghan went on to announce their engagement in November. It is not yet known if Obama will be a guest at the wedding.  Earlier in the month, high school students were left stunned after Obama gatecrashed their first day back at school. He dropped in to lessons at McKinley Tech in Washington as they were still settling in to their new classes. He told them: One of the things I did throughout my presidency was I’d meet with groups of young people everywhere I went, whether it was here in the United States or when I was travelling overseas. Just to kind of hear from them, find out what they’re interested in, because I do believe that most of the problems we have are going to be solved by you.  September also saw Obama present plans for the Barack Obama Presidential Center, which is set to be built in Chicago\u0027s Jackson Park. The building will feature his presidential library and museum, containing papers and artifacts from his time as US leader. It is also set to be the HQ for the Obama Foundation.   August 2017  In August, Barack and Michelle said goodbye to their eldest daughter, Malia, as they dropped her off at her dorm at Harvard University . The 19-year-old was allowed to move into her college accommodation a day early so her arrival created as little fuss as possible. Despite being flanked by the US Secret Service in their two SUV convoy, the Obamas proved they were just like any other parents as the visibly emotional couple left their daughter in her new home.   Obama also tweeted a response to a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. At the rally, a car driven by a right-wing extremist ploughed through a crowd of anti-fascist protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer, a paralegal and activist. The message included a powerful quote by Nelson Mandela, and became the most-liked tweet in history with 3.8 million likes. Mr Obama\u0027s series of three tweets read: No one is born hating another person because of the colour of his skin or his background or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.     The first tweet amassed more than 1.5 million retweets, while Obama\u0027s follow-up second and third posts garnered more than 300,000 retweets each. Obama\u0027s tweet came shortly after Donald Trump\u0027s press conference in which the current US President failed to explicitly denounce white supremacists, instead saying: We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides.  The former POTUS took a family holiday to Indonesia in June, enjoying a spot of white-water rafting, and stayed at the luxury Four Seasons Resort on the island of Bali. CNN Indonesia reported that Central Java police deployed 700 officers to secure his visit to Borobudur, a Buddhist temple dating from the 8th and 9th centuries. Obama had lived in Jakarta, Indonesia, for four years as a child with his mother and step-father before moving back to Hawaii to live with his grandparents.  Obama also found time to swing by Canada for a chat with Canadian President Justin Trudeau. The ex-POTUS\u0027 foundation tweeted a picture of the pair sitting down for dinner and discussing plans to develop \u0027the next generation of leaders\u0027.   May 2017  May saw Obama make his first visit to Scotland to give a speech in front of politicians and business leaders at a charity dinner. But locals were left furious after a photograph emerged of him being handed a bottle of Irn Bru. Scots were livid that someone had thought to give him the sugar-free version of the country\u0027s most popular soda.     While he was in the UK, he found time to swing by Kensington Palace for a chat with Prince Harry...    In a more political turn, he also endorsed centrist candidate Emmanuel Macron in the French presidential election. The former US president said he admired Macron\u0027s campaign for standing up for liberal values. Macron went on to win the election against far-right politician Marine Le Pen. April 2017  After three months out of the spotlight, April saw Obama made his first public appearance since leaving office . He made no mention of Donald Trump\u0027s controversial first few months in office, but quipped: “What’s been going on since I’ve been gone?” He moderated an event at the University of Chicago in the city where he began his political career and which will be the site of his presidential library. March 2017  Despite taking time away from the political spotlight, in March Obama was forced to respond to claims from his successor Donald Trump that he had ordered the wiretapping of Trump during the late stages of the election campaign. Trump made the accusation in a series of tweets, without citing evidence, just weeks into his administration and amid rising scrutiny of his campaign\u0027s ties to Russia. Obama\u0027s spokesman said: Neither President Obama nor any White House official ever ordered surveillance on any U.S. citizen. Any suggestion otherwise is simply false. February 2017  After eight years in the White House, a holiday was definitely on the cards. And as he wasn\u0027t the leader of the free world any more, he could afford to take a few risks with his health. So billionaire pal Sir Richard Branson challenged him to a kite-surfing chalenge. The former POTUS spent two days learning the basics of how to fly a kite on dry land before his was finally allowed to graduate to the water. Despite numerous security guards circling around, Obama was able to relax and get into it, according to Branson.  Speaking on his blog, Sir Richard wrote: It was a huge honour to be able to invite President Barack and Michelle Obama down to the British Virgin Islands for a complete break after Barack finished his second term as President and the family left the White House. It was also revealed that Obama and wife Michelle were poised to make at least $60million (\u0026pound49million) from a book deal. The pair signed over rights for two books to publishing company Penguin Random House. Both will publish separate books, but have jointly sold the rights, the firm said. January 2017  After handing over the Presidential reins to Donald Trump, Obama and his family flew to Palm Springs for a long weekend before heading to the British Virgin Islands. Barack and wife Michelle were spotted enjoying lunch with Sir Richard Branson and his family on the island of Anegada. Billionaire Branson - who has been outspoken in his views on Trump - owns nearby islands Necker and Moskito. The Obamas reportedly arrived in the Virgin Islands on Branson\u0027s private jet, and were soon seen soaking up the sun.

But the widow of one Cold War pilot has blown that claim apart after obtaining secret documents that show he was used in a deadly experiment as he was ordered to fly through the cloud of a thermonuclear explosion. And Shirley Denson, 83, said husband Eric had such a massive dose of radiation to his head in the 1958 flight that it caused \u0026shycrippling headaches so bad that he later killed himself saying he couldn\u0027t stand the pain. Two of their four daughters were born with abnormalities as were some grandchildren and great-grandchildren. The papers show Eric, 24 at the time, had his head alone exposed to 65 years’ worth of normal \u0026shybackground \u0026shyradiation - the same as 17,500 dental X-rays - during just six minutes spent flying through the cloud at Christmas Island in the South Pacific.  Shirley said of the \u0026shydocuments – which chillingly show the Tory government of the day knew there was a risk to the men’s children: “It’s \u0026shyabsolutely wicked. It’s evil. To see it in black and white after all these years took my breath away. It seems our government used and abused its own men. “It makes me furious to think it was done on purpose, that my Eric mattered so little to them.” British Nuclear Test Veterans’ Association chairman Alan Owen said: “This is the first time in all our years of campaigning we have ever found evidence this strong. “Our members always believed they were guinea pigs and this appears to prove some of them were, at best, collateral damage in horrifying experiments. We need to know \u0026shyeverything - now.” Deputy Labour leader Tom Watson, who is backing the Mirror campaign to give a medal to the veterans of the nuclear tests, which lasted from 1952 until 1967, added: “This is a shocking document the MoD cannot wriggle out of.  “We need answers about what experiments were conducted, and how many of the 22,000 nuke vets were involved in them. “The Defence Secretary should come to the Commons and issue an unqualified apology to Mrs Denson.” Shadow Defence \u0026shySecretary Nia Griffith said: “These are deeply worrying revelations which must be \u0026shyinvestigated by the MoD.” Shadow Health Secretary \u0026shyJonathan Ashworth added: “This is an \u0026shyabsolute scandal.” Shirley, of Morden, south London, was handed the papers by the MoD during research about her husband\u0027s service. Eric flew his converted Canberra B6 bomber into the mushroom cloud of a 2.8 megaton nuclear explosion on April 28, with X-ray badges on his seat to measure radiation. They were placed behind the head, on both arm rests, and in the seat pan for each member of the aircrew.  The bomb, codenamed Operation Grapple Y, was the most deadly weapon Britain has ever fired. The papers said “care was taken to ensure as little shielding effect as possible” was given to the badges – and thus the crew. Immediately after the tests, Eric suffered vomiting and a rash, common symptoms of radiation poisoning. But within 48 hours he was ordered to fly the plane again. Veteran Joe Pasquini, who was a navigator in the same squadron, has a copy of Eric\u0027s pilot logbook which shows he returned to the air in the same plane on May 30 for a 75-minute radar calibration and formation flight. The paper - written by scientists running the tests - states those who received a dose of radiation between 10 Roentgen and 25 must not be exposed again for three years. Eric’s dose of 18.8R meant he should have been protected. His was the worst of the three-man crew.  One of the badges was placed near his groin. It recorded a dose of 8.8R, or around 30 years\u0027 worth of normal background radiation. The \u0026shydocument added: “Testicular badges: The very significantly lower levels are of interest and cheer in relation to the possibility of genetic damage.” Eric and Shirley had already had one healthy daughter before the nuclear experiments. The Mirror found birth defects or unexplained medal conditions in 37% of their descendants, including skull deformities, missing and extra teeth, and spinal problems. Eric killed himself in 1976.

Doris the dachshund has a rare condition that means she cannot keep her food down and would starve to death without help. The pooch looks the picture of health in footage of her being fed by owner Sarah Buck - but this wasn\u0027t always the case. At one point the poor pup was half her breed\u0027s normal weight and looked like a bag of skin and bones due to her condition. Sarah found the solution in the high chair and trained her to sit in it on command for liquidised meals.  Doris suffers from Megaesophagus, which means her esophagus is enlarged and makes it impossible for her to hold down food. But her Bailey Chair, a canine version of a child\u0027s high chair, forces her to eat in an upright position, and to remain upright for up to 25 minutes afterwards. Sarah, from Middlesbrough, shared a clip of Doris’ feeding time routine on Facebook with the caption: “What life is like living with a pup called Doris who has Megaesophagus.” The clip begins with Sarah rapping a spoon on Doris’ dinner bowl, and says: “Right, dinner time with Doris.”  The tiny dachshund can be seen excitedly running towards a her specialised ‘Bailey Chair’, surrounded by plenty of toys, in the corner of the room. Doris starts to get herself into the seat, by reversing, and waits expectantly for Sarah to give her dinner. Sarah can then be heard saying, “In properly, no cheating!” and the pup responds by reversing herself fully back into the seat - which has a plaque reading “Dinner with Doris” above her head. Sarah then begins to spoon feed Doris her specially liquidised food, and the pup gobbles it up. The 10-month-old pup has to keep her head up to stop her from regurgitating her food, so Sarah has to keep clicking her fingers and trying to keep her head up.  The pup listens and clearly trusts Sarah as she lifts her head back up every time she is told to. As the clip ends, Sarah has to almost wrench the spoon from Doris’ mouth as she finishes feeding her. Scores of social media users were quick to comment under the clip. Sara Freeman said: “So cute. I’m sorry she has this but I love how she goes and sits in her chair - a real help for others to see I think too!”  Jessica Auty added: “This video just melted my heart. What an angel.” Jo Howe commented: “So much love for this story, she has a wonderful temperament and obviously so much trust and a great attitude. Nothing is going to get in the way of this little ones food, nothing. Teamwork at its best.” Denise Rothery wrote: “How touching. Doris you have made me feel a little teary, as you are just so beautiful getting into your feeding chair.” While Laura May said: “Oh my gosh she is amazing and so clever.” Speaking today, Sarah said: “Doris is a clever little pup and we’ve had a long hard journey to maintain some health and weight on her finally.

The boy\u0027s mother, Amanda Johnson, has spoken of her worry and upset after her son was not allowed onto a bus in Nottingham and instead made to walk.  Miss Johnson was waiting for her son, Jovanni Bojang, at the usual bus stop but when he didn\u0027t get off the bus she began to worry, reports Nottinghamshire Live .  The support worker said she thought it was disgusting he wasn\u0027t allowed on the Nottingham City Transport number 17 bus.  She said: At 4.15pm, he went straight to the bus stop from his after school club which is over the road. I didn\u0027t know the price had gone up by 10p as he doesn\u0027t usually get the bus, it was only because I was busy. He got to the bus handed over his \u0026pound1 and the driver said you need 10 pence, when he said he didn\u0027t have the money he was told to get off. The driver wouldn\u0027t even give his \u0026pound1 back when my son asked for it. If he gets the bus I always meet him a few stops down on Mansfield Road when he gets off. But he never got off the bus and I was waiting for him until 5pm when he walked down the road.  I was so upset when he walked down towards me, he said he had never felt so embarrassed and he was made to feel really small. I can\u0027t believe he was made to walk, all for the sake of 10 pence, if it was the bus drivers child I am sure he would not have made him walk or left him at the stop. It is disgusting. Jovanni who is a pupil at Claremont Primary School has now said he does not want to travel by bus ever again on his own.

The feminist academic and author insisted some rapes are just bad sex and said society should not view it as a spectacularly violent crime. She suggested rapists should be given community service or a visible R tattoo on their hand or cheek to shame them. The controversial 79-year-old Australian also scoffed at a study that says a majority of victims have suffered post-traumatic stress. Greer has been criticised and called a rape apologist after her comments at a Hay literary festival event stunned audience members and caused an uproar online.  Safer London CEO Sherry Peck told how she was so upset that she walked out. She tweeted: Dreadful ramblings by Germaine Greer. I’m usually happy to listen to opinions different to my own but today after around 20 mins I had to walk out. Anita Singh, the Daily \u0027s arts and entertainment editor, wrote on Twitter: Had the misfortune to listen to Germaine Greer yesterday. She seemed to be making it up as she went along. Greer told the crowd that most rapes don\u0027t involve any injury whatsoever and said the notion that it is one of the most violent crimes is bulls***.  She added: “Most rape is just lazy, just careless, insensitive. Every time a man rolls over on his exhausted wife and insists on enjoying his conjugal rights he is raping her. It will never end up in a court of law. “Instead of thinking of rape as a spectacularly violent crime, and some rapes are, think about it as non consensual … that is bad sex. Sex where there is no communication, no tenderness, no mention of love.” Greer said rape is so rampant in society that the legal system cannot cope with it, and victims become bits of evidence in court due to the issue of consent. She called for a radical change to the way rape is prosecuted and punished, claiming many trials were not ending in convictions due to systemic failures.  She said a fitting punishment for rape would be 200 hours of community service, adding: I have suggested maybe a little tattoo would be a good thing, maybe an \u0027R\u0027 on your hand. I\u0027d prefer it on the cheek, really. She argued that the courts should focus on the violence and sentence offenders according to the gravity of the violence, and avoid long, humiliating trials for victims. Greer also said she doubted figures which suggest 70 per cent of rape victims have suffered post-traumatic stress disorder compared with 20 per cent of war veterans. She added: “What the hell are you saying? Something that leaves no sign, no injury, no nothing is more damaging to a woman than seeing your best friend blown up by an IED is to a veteran? The author said women haven\u0027t been destroyed by rape as society suggests, adding: We’ve been bloody annoyed is what we’ve been.” Related video: Eamon Holmes accuses Germaine Greer of being the wicked witch "},{"url":null,"title":"im not ready say goodbye","story":"News\"I\u0027m not ready to say goodbye to my children\": Mum-of-three left fighting for her life every 28 DAYSLesley Kennedy must raise £1,000 every month to be in with a chance of beating breast cancer - after being told that there is no more treatment available on the NHS\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByJilly Beattie09:09, 31 MAY 2018Updated09:10, 31 MAY 2018NewsLesley Kennedy is determined to watch her children grow up (Image: Belfast Live WS)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum-of-three battling aggressive breast cancer is fighting for her life one month at a time. Lesley Kennedy needs to raise \u0026pound1,000 every 28 days to pay for special treatment not available to her on the NHS. Doctors told that there is no more treatment they can give her because of the disease in her liver, lungs and bones. But the 35-year-old says she\u0027s not ready to say goodbye to her children - and is undergoing special treatment privately.  It\u0027s costing her \u0026pound1,000 every month to pay for her medication, Belfast Live reports.  Lesley is determined to carry on fighting for her children Ben, 14, Jake, 11 and eight-year-old Corey.  But Lesley from Eglington is not alone. Her husband Lee, and three sons, have been joined by friends and relatives, and strangers who have become friends, as everyone rallies to raise money to pay for medication. After being diagnosed aged 32 in 2015 with stage 2 breast cancer she underwent a mastectomy, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The following year she was told she had stage 4 cancer and it had spread to her liver, lungs and bones. Then 13 months ago Lesley was advised there was no more medical care to help her.  She said: If I\u0027d given up then and agreed that nothing else could help me, then we might be in a very different place. But we pushed on and I got treatment privately and the last year has been exceptional. Every day with my boys and my husband, every moment has been special. If I had listened to what I was being told in some areas I might not have had that time or those experiences - and they have been precious for all of us. Now a chance meeting in a caravan park means Lesley has even more support and the chance of more money raised for her medication. Jennifer Howell and Lesley met at a caravan park in Benone, Limavady, last year and became firm friends.    And now Jennifer is taking an extraordinary step to help Lesley access the drug Palbociclib that suppresses the hormones that are affecting the cancer she is living with.  With the help of Cloudstreet Paragliding Centre in Craigavon, Jennifer is planning jumping in a tandem paraglide from Benone Ridge in the first weekend in June. Jennifer said: I have only known Lesley for a little over a year but we just connected. It was as if our paths where suppose to cross. Lesley is a beautiful lady, filled with courage, strength and has positive outlook on life, you can probably say she has truly touched my heart. Lesley has now been given the chance to self fund a drug called Palbociclib although this drug is available to breast cancer patients on the NHS, it is not available to people who\u0027ve had previous hormone treatments - and Lesley has which means she isn\u0027t eligible for funding via the NHS. So I am helping raise money for her to have the treatment privately and I\u0027m hoping lots of people will help me along the way.  Lesley has now been on the treatment for two weeks and says she is feeling great. She explained: Of course there are good days and bad days but on the whole I feel good. I take the tablets orally and have injections once a month. I feel awkward asking for help but people have been so kind and I\u0027m very grateful. I\u0027m going to keep going as long and well as I can. I have learned that you have to trust yourself when bad news hits.

Laura Bentley said she choked on her tea when she learned the pink plastic vibrator was used to keep the bassinet gently shaking. Her partner Ben had devised the innovative method to help 10-week-old daughter Lucie sleep.  The Aussie mum-of-four, from the Gold Coast, Queensland, left the internet in hysterics with a viral image of the infant slumbering soundly next to the vibrator.   But the 33-year-old admitted she has since been flooded with messages from other sleep-deprived new mums desperate to try the trick for themselves. Laura, who has her own business with Brad, 34, alongside running Instagram blog Attempting to Mum, said: “Lucie is baby number four so we are used to it by now, but she does not do very well at day sleeps. “We’ve found to put her down, we have to literally stand behind her rocking the bassinet to replicate the movement of the car. “On Monday, I was at the gym and Brad got done with spending 20 minutes rocking the bassinet, so he decided force the process and thought ‘what can I use to make the vibrations’.  “He had to go digging for it, I had no idea where it was because we’ve just had a baby! “I came home, and he just said ‘I used the vibrator to get the baby to sleep’. “The thing is, it sent her to sleep straight away! It’s amazing and works so well. “It’s now more inconspicuously hidden in the bassinet, but we’re still using it.” Laura, who is also mum to Will, 10, four-year-old Indie and Zahli, two, said she was momentarily concerned keyboard warriors wouldn’t see the funny side of her post. But the blogger, who has 10,000 Instagram followers, said other parenting blogs also credit vibrators with helping keep their little ones slumbering soundly.

It feels like we are imprisoned in our own house. “The fence is 2ft from our front window – it’s like having the Berlin Wall in front of our home.” “We are being held hostage in a land dispute which is nothing to do with us.

One calls the other a s**t during the bizarre altercation which has been viewed more than 1.5 million times in the last 24 hours after it was published on social media. The incident took place in Shildon, County Durham on Sunday afternoon and the footage was recorded by John Canty. One woman was arrested on suspicion of assault during the incident but released without charge, police confirmed.

The brunette woman, Black Juicy, stands at the door of her house shouting at the blonde female, Lizzie.

In response to this, Black Juicy shouts at Lizzie and calls her a s**t, an utter s**t before picking up her mug of tea.

Black Juicy retaliates and throws her mug of tea at Lizzie\u0027s face, who manages to kung-fu punch the cup away from her face.  This astonishing feat is shown in slow motion again in the video.

A local paper reported several tourists had been hurt in the mass punch-up in the party resort’s raucous strip of bars and nightclubs. The violent altercation happened outside a tattoo parlour at roughly 5.30am today. Footage published by island newspaper Ultima Hora showed a bare chested youngster - also thought to be British - exchanging blows with another man after landing the first punch before he ended up on the ground.  He had to be held back by other revellers as he tried to continue the fight in confusing scenes filmed by a witness on a mobile phone and watched by scores of other youngsters including some who appeared to be encouraging the two men. Seconds later another fight thought to be linked to the first incident kicked off a few feet away. A woman - whose condition was not known this afternoon - was picked up and taken to the side of the road so she could receive first aid. A female partygoer could be overheard yelling “she’s out” - before adding “she’s knocked out stone cold” - as worried pals and onlookers gathered round her. Another man could be heard repeating over and over in English: “Two people, two people, stand back”  It was not immediately clear how the unnamed woman tourist had been hurt. She is thought to have been with one of the groups involved in the fighting. There was no obvious police presence and Ultima Hora reported local security guards had stepped in to separate the warring holidaymakers. Civil Guard officers were not available at lunchtime today to comment on the number of injured and say whether anyone had been arrested.

A majority of lawmakers voted in favour of the ban as Muslim women wearing conservative religious clothing looked on. The law was proposed by the centre-right government which argued face veils were contrary to Danish values - but it insists the ban doesn\u0027t target religious groups. First-time offenders of the so-called burqa ban - which goes into effect on August 1 - will be fined 1,000 Danish crowns (about \u0026pound115). The fine increases to 10,000 crowns (\u0026pound11,500) after a fourth violation.  Denmark is the fifth European country to pass a complete \u0027burqa ban\u0027 in public, joining Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria and France, which in 2001 became the first to do so. Denmark\u0027s law also applies to face coverings such as false beards and masks. It is estimated that only about 200 women in Denmark wear the niqab or burqa. The niqab is a veil that covers a woman\u0027s entire face except the eyes, while the one-piece burqa, which covers a woman\u0027s body and entire face, has a transparent veil.  Human rights group Amnesty International called the ban a discriminatory violation of women\u0027s rights. An earlier proposal that allowed prison sentences as punishment had been previously removed. The Danish People’s Party failed in its attempt this week to amend the legislation to include prison sentences for offenders. Other European countries or individual regions have full or partial bans.  In the Netherlands, face veils are banned in some public places, including schools, hospitals and public transport. A similar law is in effect in the German state of Bavaria. The Swiss canton of Tessin has outlawed the religious clothing entirely in public. Danish lawmakers voted 75-30 on Thursday to pass the legislation proposed by the country\u0027s three-party centre-right coalition -  The Liberal, Conservative and Danish People’s parties all voted in favour of the law, along with the opposition Social Democrats except for one lone MP, Mette Gjerskov, The Local reported. An additional 74 members of parliament abstained from the vote.

The youngsters often jumped into her bed in the middle of the night. And when they didn\u0027t, they would leap into each other\u0027s beds. So when they came into Vanessa\u0027s room, crying, and climbed into bed with her eight years ago today, she comforted them with cuddles. They all then drifted back off to sleep. But heartbreakingly, Chase and Tyler never woke up. Their mum, 37, did awake - but felt agonising pain and experienced every parent\u0027s worst nightmare as she looked across at her sons. I saw my children lying on my bed and knew something was terribly wrong, Vanessa, from Victoria, Australia, told .  Confused and barely able to move, she managed to call an ambulance and her ex-husband before paramedics attended the scene. It was only later, while in hospital, that she found out Chase and Tyler had died from accidental carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. A gas heater in another room of her rental house had leaked the colourless and odourless gas, which she and the boys had inhaled. While her sons lost their lives, Vanessa suffered acute CO poisoning and rhabdomyolysis, where damaged skeletal muscle breaks down. She also had hypoxia and a dislocated shoulder. They say that this was due to lying on the arm for so long being unconscious, she told us. Now, exactly eight years on from the tragedy on May 30, 2010, the brave mum is fighting to raise vital awareness of accidental CO poisoning. She has set up The Chase and Tyler Foundation , an independent charitable organisation that works to prevent such poisoning.  The accident still feels like yesterday to me, she said. After the accident, people would say things to me and not realise their words were insensitive, such as \u0027You can have more children\u0027, \u0027At least they went quietly\u0027, \u0027They are with God now\u0027... People don’t know what to say and they also want to see people fixed straight away and not suffering. As a bereaved parent, you are never fixed and there is no such thing as closure or moving on. Little Chase and Tyler, who adored each other, enjoyed football, riding mini motorbikes, playing on scooters and watching TV. They were pretty cheeky boys who were always together and typically like boys, always fighting between each other, said Vanessa. She added: Tyler was a little shier than Chase and he adored his older brother when Chase wasn’t tormenting him.  The day before the boys\u0027 deaths, Vanessa believes they were all watching films together - although she struggles to remember. I have memory problems from the accident, she explained. It was in the early hours of the next day that Chase and Tyler climbed into her bed, in tears, before they all fell asleep together. Chase and Tyler were always jumping into my bed. If they weren’t in my bed, they were always jumping in each other’s beds, she said. I can’t remember what I said to Chase and Tyler. I just know they climbed into my bed as they were crying - obviously due to the CO poisoning - and that we were all together and went back to sleep. They never woke up. Vanessa found out her beautiful sons had passed away while in hospital. I didn’t really know until after I woke up in hospital, she said. I don’t know if anyone told me prior to this, but due to the acute CO poisoning, I was not in a position to comprehend.  She added: I was hospitalised for a month and a half and then had a long time recovering from my injuries. I struggled to walk initially and couldn’t use my left arm or hand for quite some time... I needed help to dress me. The long-term damage is memory damage due to hypoxia and severe nerve damage to my left shoulder, arm and hand. I take a fair bit of painkillers every day. The emotional scars are the worst wounds of all, which will never heal. When she was eventually discharged from hospital, Vanessa, who works in medical administration, moved in with her mum. I had no home, my children were dead, and I couldn’t look after myself due to my injuries, so I had to move into my mother’s home, she said. I was heavily sedated due to the physical injuries, as well as suffering post traumatic shock which was a blessing in disguise. If I had to face my new reality with full comprehension - which took over a year if not more - I feel I could not have survived.  She added that there wasn\u0027t a carbon monoxide alarm fitted at her home in Mooroopna, north of Melbourne, when the leak happened. The only time I had ever heard of carbon monoxide poisoning was via movies when people died from intentional exposure within their vehicles, she said. She had no idea that people like her sons could suffer carbon monoxide poisoning from their gas or fuel burning appliances. Determined to save the lives of others, Vanessa set up The Chase and Tyler Foundation and Carbon Monoxide Awareness Week. She also began lobbying Australian parliament for mandatory gas appliance servicing and CO alarms, and publicly campaigning. I knew that if I didn’t do anything, this prevalent issue within our community would soon become old news and nothing would change, and more people would die, she said. I couldn’t let that happen.

The star continued her attack on Barack Obama’s former aide, Valerie Jarrett, despite reissuing an apology. Barr, 65, sparked a huge backlash on Monday when she called Jarrett an “ape”, in a tweet she later deleted. On Tuesday, she announced she was quitting Twitter. But on Wednesday she returned to the site, reposting her initial remarks, including an image of Jarrett’s face next to a character from Planet of the Apes. She added a fake tweet claiming Jarrett had said she wanted to make America more Islamic.  Barr’s initial post read: “Muslim brotherhood \u0026amp planet of the apes had a baby = vj.” Producers and stars of her sitcom, Roseanne, quickly condemned her remarks. US network ABC scrapped the successful relaunch of her hit 90s show, which was popular on Channel 4 here. Reruns of the original sitcom were also pulled by US broadcaster Viacom. Barr later blamed her rant on the sleeping pill Ambien. She wrote: “It was 2 in the morning and I was Ambien tweeting. I went 2 far \u0026amp do not want it defended.”  Yesterday, Ambien’s manufacturer, Sanofi, said: “Racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication.” Barr yesterday insisted: “I’m not a racist, I never was \u0026amp I never will be. One stupid joke in a lifetime of fighting 4 civil rights.” US President Donald Trump – who Barr is a vocal supporter of – waded in. He wrote on Twitter: “Bob Iger of ABC called Valerie Jarrett to let her know that ‘ABC does not tolerate comments like those’ made by Roseanne Barr.

The incredible operation took place at the Federal University of Ceara (UFC), Brazil, in April last year but has only just been revealed after it was confirmed as a success. Patient Jucilene Marinho, 23, has now spoken for the first time and talked about how the revolutionary operation using skin of the tilapia fish has changed her life and allowed her to have sex for the first time. The unorthodox treatment, which was led by gynaecologist, Dr Leonardo Bezerra, is faster, cheaper and less aggressive than the conventional method used for sufferers of Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u0026uumlster-Hauser (MRKH). The rare congenital disorder affects approximately one in 5,000 newborn girls and results in the absence of some or all of the female reproductive organs. The revolutionary treatment involves opening a space between the vagina and anus and inserting a tubular mould lined with the skin of the freshwater fish.  Once in contact with the patient’s body, tilapia skin acts like stem cells and is absorbed and transformed into cellular tissue forming the walls of the canal, similar to that of an actual vagina. Before being used, the fish skin undergoes a special cleaning and sterilisation process in the lab followed by irradiation to kill viruses. The process removes all the scales and fish smell and results in a light-coloured gel dressing that can be stored for up to two years in refrigerated sterile packaging. An ecstatic Ms Marinho spoke for the first time to FocusOn News about how the ground-breaking surgery has changed her life and made her feel like ‘a proper woman’ who now enjoys a healthy sex life. The young university student from Lavras da Mangabeira, was diagnosed in her teens with having no cervix, uterus, ovaries or womb.  However, to doctors’ surprise she developed normally throughout puberty and even experienced menstrual cramping pains in her stomach but never had a period. At the age of 15 she was given the crushing news there was nothing but connective tissue behind the skin blocking the opening of her vagina. “I cried a lot when I found out,” she recalled. “I thought my world had ended. I’d always dreamed of having a baby of my own now I had to accept that wouldn’t be possible.” She spiralled into a deep depression fearing she would never experience an intimate and loving relationship. This worsened when a teenage boyfriend mocked and broke up with her after discovering the disorder. But last year, six months after agreeing to become the first of four women to have the experimental procedure, Ms Marinho had sex for the first time in her life with her partner Marcus Santos, 24, who she has been with for over a year and who has supported her throughout. “I spent three months recuperating from the operation and then doctors gave me the all clear to have sex in October last year,” Ms Marinho revealed happily.  “At first I was very scared to do it because I thought it would hurt and I was worried it might damage the opening. But it was a wonderful moment because everything worked perfectly. There was no pain just a great deal of pleasure and satisfaction. “I didn’t feel any discomfort and there was no bleeding. Everything felt sensitive in what I’m told is the right and normal way. It was perfectly natural like the opening had always been there,” she confided. Dr Bezerra, who leads a multidisciplinary team of surgeons at the Assis Chateaubriand Maternity School (MEAC), has treated four sufferers with MRKH, also known as vaginal agenesis, with the break-through treatment. It is less invasive surgically than the traditional method which involves creating a vaginal canal using extensive grafts from the patient\u0027s groin. Some 23 patients have undergone the conventional treatment at MEAC over the past ten years. “This procedure can be time consuming and painful as the patient needs to recover from a large incision which leaves a scar that can be unsightly and stigmatising. There is also the possibility of discomfort with the reconstructed tissue,” Dr Bezerra explained. By comparison, neovaginaplasty has a faster recovery rate with no visible scars. There are minimal complications with no risk of rejection or infections the doctor said.  In addition, medical costs and materials are low – a significant benefit in a public health system strapped for cash - with operating times quicker and an abundance of the inexpensive, mild-tasting Tilapia fish readily available from Brazil’s rivers and fish farms. Research shows that tilapia skin, normally thrown away as a waste product, contains large amounts of moisture and is rich in collagen type 1, a protein that promotes healing. It is disease resistant and as strong and resilient as human skin. Since 2015, scientists at the UFC Research and Development of Medicines Nucleus coordinated by Professor Odorico Moraes, have been trialling a radical procedure that uses the moisture-filled skin of the freshwater fish to heal more than 200 victims with severe burns - with notable success. The normal regime is painful and involves regular changes of gauze bandages along with painkillers and ointments. “There was a eureka moment when we thought, if this membrane can be used for burns, why can’t it be used for the vagina,” said Dr Bezerra who began investigating the procedure in January 2016. “To make the ‘new vagina’ we insert a vagina shaped acrylic mould, lined with the skin of tilapia, into the space created between the bladder and the rectum. The device remains there for 10 days to prevent the walls from closing,” the doctor explained.

He was obviously an attacking player and I think he scored a few goals but he never played right up front.“That might have been because he was young and, when he first arrived, Aberdeen just wanted him getting games. Because we had Martin Bavidge as the main striker, he wasn’t going to get in the team right up top.“Saying that, I’m pretty sure Nicky regarded himself as a midfielder back then and I don’t think there was any thought of moving him forward.”After two seasons and eight goals, Clark moved on from the Blue Toon to Queen of the South in 2011 and, in terms of goals, has never looked back.Whether it was having former Rangers and Hearts front man Sandy as his father, or the foresight of someone at Palmerston, Bobby acknowledged the decision to make him into a striker was a masterstroke.“His dad has obviously had an influence on his career and he might have pushed for him to go up front, or maybe it was just something someone else saw in him that made them think they should give it a try. Either way, it was a great move for him and a player that gets the goals he does is probably just what United need right now.”The fact Clark is a player who knows the Championship well, having played there for Queens, Rangers and now Dunfermline, is a big plus.United now have a few members of their squad who are used to the rigours of the second tier and, for Bobby, that’s the way to go.“When I played in the lower divisions, the teams who were successful were usually ones who had players who knew the league.“United have brought in Nicky and, assuming he’s back fit for next season, they’ll have James Keatings just behind the main striker.“I thought he was a very good signing when he joined up last summer but the season was ruined by injuries. If he’s back, though, you are talking about a player who’s got goals at that level for quite a few clubs now.“These are the type you want – once you go up you worry about a team for the league above.“If you build a team for the league you’re in and get out of it, you find a few of the boys you did bring in are capable of doing well at a higher level.“Some won’t be and will have to be replaced but you are always going to want to freshen the squad each year.“With Nicky, only time will tell how he does if United get back to the Premiership, but he’s a proven scorer in the Championship and, right now, that’s the most important thing.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/03/5abe00fa671c1-848x564.jpg ","title":"confirmed

I would imagine that should the move to ‘Nou Campy’ (the club’s proposed new stadium) happen, that will also follow suit with a stadium sponsor.”Fellow fan Garry Joiner, of Dunfermline, wrote: “Football is no longer a sport, it is a business and needs to operate as one.“A name change will have no fundamental impact on Dens Park to those who have always known it as Dens Park.”Richard Gennies, who’s based in Jakarta, backed sponsorship but insisted the stadium would “always be known as Dens Park no matter what the sign says”.Another fan who also backs the move wrote: “If the name change brings in ongoing cash investment it must be a good thing for the club.“It would be good to retain Dens in the name.”One supporter suggested the name “Kilmac Dens Park” and others said they would support the move if “Dens” was incorporated.However, others hit out at the sponsorship idea.One fan wrote: “What good would changing the name do? All it would do is annoy the loyal fans who go to Dens week in, week out.”Jasen Niblo, from Birkhill, said he didn’t like the fact the move was “all about money” and urged the club to keep the name.Another fan cautioned the club against inviting any food-related sponsors, saying: “As long as it doesn’t sound as bad as the Tony Macaroni Arena (in Livingston) we might live with it.”Graham Pert, from Whitfield, added: “I’m all up for things that will be great for the club but at this stage I think it would be sad to see the name changed from Dens

the condition.Donald Grewar joined a field of about 150 athletes to take on the scenic coastal run organised by Monifieth High School.The keen runner completed his fifth marathon just weeks before experiencing the first symptoms of MND in 2013.His determination has touched the Angus secondary to such an extent that funds from the run, which normally go to support the school, will instead be given to an Edinburgh University centre leading research into the condition.Donald, from Dairsie, contacted the school to submit his entry for the run, telling them he was keen to take on the 10k in his powered wheelchair.Monifieth High head teacher MC McInally said: “We normally hold the 10k to raise funds for pupils in the school but, after receiving Donald’s request, decided that all monies will go to the Euan MacDonald Centre which he is raising money for.“When word got out about what we were doing a couple of our younger children took it upon themselves to make cakes and they raised £63, which was a marvellous effort from them.”Donald set off ahead of the main event, accompanied by supporters and some senior pupils from the school, completing the challenge around the same time as overall winner Craig Earl.Monifieth councillor Craig Fotheringham, who started the 10k run, said Donald’s participation was a heartwarming show of determination.“This is always a popular run and as a former pupil of Monifieth High I’m very supportive of it, but especially this year when it will be raising such vital funds for MND,” he said.Donald said: “I was a keen sportsman and in April 2013 ran my fifth marathon in France.“Two months later, symptoms began and I was diagnosed with MND in January 2014.”The focus of Donald’s fundraising is the Euan MacDonald Centre, based at Edinburgh University, which involves about 30 researchers from across Scotland working to improve the lives of patients living with MND.\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the

Public consultation followed with 328 nearby addresses contacted, prompting 104 formal responses.The report to the committee stressed that the brief \"does not seek to create competition between the two locations\".Stratton, it stated, \"has opportunity for larger footprint retail and community buildings whereas Ashton provides opportunity for education, park and higher density residential development\".The focus of development would be \"east Ashton\". The owners of the adjacent western part of Ashton Farm do not intend selling for development but to continue farming the land.Opportunities have been identified for improving public transport links, particularly for Inverness Campus users. Transport agency HiTrans will consider the provision of a new rail station at Seafield, the campus or Stratton.Discussions are underway with the college and Highlands and Islands Enterprise on the \"early delivery\" of sports facilities at the campus.

routes to new aberdeen academy discussed","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen City Council has been accused of “turning its back” on a community as councillors met to discuss safe walking routes to a new academy.Safety concerns have been raised by parents over pupils walking from Cove to the new Lochside Academy at Nigg, scheduled to open for the 2018-19 academic term in August.Councillors on the local authority’s operational delivery committee met at the Town House yesterday to agree a raft of safe walking routes for Cove pupils travelling to the new secondary school.The recommendations, narrowly approved by seven votes to six, included agreeing a puffin crossing be created on Earn’s Heugh Road in Cove, next to its junction with Langdykes Road.However, SNP group leader Stephen Flynn accused the ruling coalition of Conservative, Independent and suspended Labour councillors, of “turning its back” on the community after they did not vote in favour of some additional safety measures.Mr Flynn said parents in the area had expressed to him the need for a crossing on Cove Road, at its junction with Earn’s Heugh Road.He added: “We have an opportunity to make that road safer.“The parents I have spoken to have said they won’t let kids cross that road.”Mr Flynn also said parents in Cove felt an “injustice” that their children would have to pay should they want to take a bus to the new academy, unlike pupils in Kincorth and Torry, who will get free bus travel.He added: “If we’re going to ask them to walk, we need to make sure they’re doing it safely.”In their report, council officers had advised councillors not to proceed with a pedestrian crossing on Cove Road.They argued their modelling, based on the number of pedestrians crossing the road multiplied by the number of conflicting vehicles, does “not qualify” for any type of crossing facility.Fleur Tarling, chairwoman of Loirston Parent Council, said she shares the concerns of parents over the busy road.She added: “My husband leaves at 8am and he leaves in the car and struggles to get out.“Their attitude seems to be very much ‘we will see what happens when the school opens’.”However, vice-convener of the committee, Ross Grant, said councillors had to trust the advice of their own officers.He said: “When it comes to road safety and making recommendations, we are as ever reliant on the professional opinion of our valued colleagues.“The result of the surveys that have been carried out do not justify the need for additional traffic management at this stage.”He added: “In spite of Councillor Flynn’s reckless scaremongering, with the approval today of additional measures at, among others Earn’s Heugh Road, South Loirston Road and between Charleston Crescent and Drive, we have gone farther than ever in terms of road safety measures for Lochside pupils.”A proposal by opposition councillors to install guard railing along the stretch of Wellington Road between Charleston Road North and Souterhead Road roundabout was also not supported by a majority of councillors.Officers said the width of the footpath would be narrowed and it would only stop vehicles travelling at a “very low speed”.Councillors did, however, agree to ask officers to progress with proposals to upgrade the path between Charleston Drive and Charleston Crescent and to install lighting on South Loirston Road.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/05/5b0b9cf11f9e7-382x564.jpg ","title":"media firm announces partnership with denis laws sporting

up and running says man behind bid","story":"\t\t\t\t\tOne of the people behind plans for a skatepark in a north-east town today told of how he hopes it will provide a boost to the area.Members of the Marr area committee gave the green light to leasing land in Bellfield Park to Banchory Skatepark Group (BSG).Russ Crichton, the chairman of BSG, said: “We hope that parents will bring their kids to Banchory to skate, it’s already in the middle of a very popular park, and the parents can go off into the community, and visit the shops, or buy an ice cream, or whatever they want to do.“It’s not a tourist attraction, but it will do no harm to have an extra thing in the community.”Banchory and Mid-Deeside councillor Eileen Durno is also hopeful the plan will benefit the area.She said: “Hopefully people will come to Banchory to use the skatepark, and maybe visit other places in the town as well.”Plan for new north-east skatepark backed by council officersCouncillors handed the plans for the skatepark a major boost last week, as the Marr area committee offered its support to BSG to pursue a lease for the land.On the committee vote, Russ said: “We’re absolutely delighted.“This is a major step forward for us.”The land is listed as “for the common good”, meaning that it is not owned by any party.Due to this, the BSG will have to seek permission from a sheriff to gain the lease, which requires a community consultation to be undertaken, and then to seek planning permission from Aberdeenshire Council.Russ, who has lived in Banchory for 10 years and has three children who all use the existing ramp, regularly updates the skaters in Banchory about the progress of the park.He said: “They’re all really excited about the prospect of the park, but of course, they’re really impatient, almost as bad as me.”BSG estimates that the park will cost between £150,000 and £200,000, and has said that plans for the park will depend on the amount of cash raised.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"lang haul naomi aiming to add to her successes at scotstoun meet","story":"\t\t\t\t\tAberdeen AAC’s Naomi Lang aims to add another honour to her growing collection when she competes in the Scottish 3,000m Championships at Glasgow’s Scotstoun stadium tomorrow evening.The Edinburgh University sports science student won the national indoor under-20 title over this distance in January and last summer she won the Scottish senior women’s 5,000m gold.Lang is currently showing outstanding form and it would be no surprise if she won again.Last weekend she knocked almost eight seconds off her previous best 1,500m time with an outstanding victory in a British Milers Club race at Watford.Her time of 4min 20.92secs leaves her within four seconds of the qualifying mark required for a place on the Great Britain team for this summer’s world junior championships in Finland.She said: “At the start of the season I didn’t think I’d be anywhere near the qualifying standard so I haven’t really thought about the world championships.“At Watford I was aiming to get under 4:25 but I was surprised to be so far below that so I was very happy.“I’ll go to the English Championships next month and try to run well and see what happens after that.“Hopefully I can run another fast time there.”Earlier this month Lang scored a notable double at the Scottish East District championships, winning the 800m in a personal best 2:12.12 and taking the 1,500m crown in 4:32.64.The only disappointment she has suffered this summer came in the British Universities and Colleges Championships at Bedford.The former Aberdeen Grammar pupil looked to be in control of the race and heading for a fast time as the leading group went through the bell, but with 300m to go she tripped and fell.By the time she gathered herself together the leaders were out of reach but she bravely carried on to finish in 10th position.She said: “I’m not sure exactly what happened.“I tripped as another girl came alongside me.“It all happened so fast but it was really disappointing as I felt I was having a good run.”Lang has bounced back superbly from that setback and looks to be heading towards more successes in the weeks ahead.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week 2","story":"\t\tHannah O\u0027HanlonUpdated: 11/05/18, 8:40 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We

At times when the builders are working the gulls understandably leave the site but then return during the evenings and at weekends. Several birds were again sitting on apparent nests as recently as May 4, however it looks like many others may have moved elsewhere.Measures have since been taken by the builders to encourage the birds to leave the area prior to laying their eggs and to give them a chance of nesting elsewhere soon. Recently I had a meeting with SNH (Scottish Natural Heritage) and the RSPB and both were sympathetic and understanding of the situation.I also plan to meet with the Scottish Canals environmental scientist soon in the hope that perhaps provision can be made, within the scope of the hub project, to allow for a nesting area for the Common Gulls in future years at the site.This could give rise to an exciting opportunity enabling the public and visitors to the new heritage centre to view these gulls raise their chicks, for which is effectively the rarest colony of nesting birds in the Crinan Canal corridor.Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,This week Allt Dearg Wind Farm distributed over £135,000 to the Ardrishaig Community Trust, which holds the village\u0026#8217s share in this locally owned wind farm.Combined with the recent payments to the Tighnabruaich and Tarbert Trusts which hold similar shares in the neighbouring Sròndoire Wind Farm, together with the wind farms\u0026#8217 contributions to the local educational trust, this brings the total direct community benefit payments from these projects to well over £ 1 million.This is a significant milestone for the projects, and highlights the socio-economic advantages of local ownership in wind power. Despite its relatively small capacity Allt Dearg is the single largest contributor of community benefit payments in Argyll.This week the UK Government published the results of its latest tracking survey of public attitudes to energy and climate change. This shows continued growth in support for on-shore wind, and eight in ten agreed that renewable energy developments should provide direct benefits to the communities in which they are located.Some objections to wind farms remain, and our turbines remain visible in the distance. We hope that the views of Allt Dearg and Sròndoire might remind such objectors that we are economically dependent on what we can produce from the limited options available to us in remote rural areas. That our particular wind farms are able to make a significant contribution to local employment and deliver funding direct to our neighbouring communities, whilst supplying around 20 per cent of Argyll and Bute’s annual domestic electricity requirements from a clean renewable resource, is very satisfying.We would like to thank all those who have made these projects the successes they are, and in particular thank those local community councillors and trust members who have given so much of their time in recent years to make this all happen. For our part, we will continue our efforts to grow the industry and economic activity that provides secure employment and opportunity for our local community.We look forward to our community partners being able to invest the fruits of these wind farms into exciting local projects.Mary Broadfoot of Stronachullin and James F Lithgow of OrmsarySir,Loneliness is a major issue in society and affects everyone from all walks of life, regardless of age or ability.That’s why we’re pleased the Scottish Government is looking at the development of a new approach to tackling the issues of loneliness and social isolation – something we have first-hand experience of and how it affects many of the people we support in Scotland.Following a recent survey of over 150 service users of our homecare services in Stirling, Falkirk, Perth and Kinross, and Angus which focused solely on loneliness and social isolation, it was revealed that loneliest people receive far fewer visitors each week. While this is hardly surprising, we did find that those who either lived with family or had family close by were less at risk of loneliness and the negative health impacts associated. Our research also highlighted that respondents, in most cases, simply wanted a chat over a cuppa with someone their own age.Social interactions are something the vast majority of us take for granted as we all lead such busy lives, but for someone who is alone, watching time go by very slowly, it’s incredibly painful for them to sit at home day after day with no communication from the outside world.Charities such as Sue Ryder regularly arrange social events for our service users and their families.But if, as a nation, we’re serious about tackling loneliness as a public health issue then we need to be resourcing our local authorities to put in place services or to commission them from the third sector to ensure that no one feels alone and isolated in Scotland.Pamela Mackenzie, director of neurological services and Scotland, Sue Ryder, StirlingSir,This spring we hope your readers will celebrate the royal wedding with their very own Right Royal Tea Party in aid of Meningitis Now.Putting on a spread fit for a royal wedding is a piece of cake with our free fundraising pack and, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have requested charity donations rather than wedding presents, you can fulfil their wishes whilst helping families affected by this devastating disease.A royal-themed Time4Tea can be held anytime, not just on Saturday May 19, the date of the Royal Wedding. And it can take place anywhere – at home, at work, at school.Just pop the kettle on, slice up a cake or two, homemade or bought (you have to have cake at a wedding) and invite friends, relatives and colleagues to enjoy a cuppa or perhaps even a glass of champagne.The serious point is that you’ll be helping to fight meningitis and move us one step closer to our vision of a future where no one in the UK dies from meningitis \u0026#8211 and everyone affected gets the support they need to rebuild their life.Sadly, despite developments in vaccines, meningitis and septicaemia continue to affect thousands every year and kill more under-fives than any other infectious disease.

Moore took the free-kick, but his curling effort from 27 yards lacked power.Moore, however, was not to be denied his hat-trick and 60 seconds later  steered a good low finish past Scott Urquhart\u0026#8217s left hand.The early first-half jitters returned to the League defence just after the hour mark when hesitation in the box allowed Nikki MacDougall, of host club Tarbert, to nip in and force the ball past Urquhart from nine yards to add a fifth goal for Argyll.A flurry of changes from both sides with 16 minutes remaining saw Scott Soudan and Lewis MacNaughton replace MacDougall and McCallum for Argyll.The league adjusted quicker to the changes and Kyle Reid and Robbie Martin combined well for Martin to pull a goal back in the 77th minute.With five minutes remaining, Soudan\u0026#8217s tenacity in the box robbed Daniel Smith on the six yard line and left him one-on-one with Urquhart.Soudan\u0026#8217s stabbed effort was stopped by Urquhart\u0026#8217s outstretched right foot but, typical of his luck on the day, the rebound fell kindly for the Campbeltown Pupils\u0026#8217 striker who rounded the prostrate Urquhart and walked the ball into the empty net.The full-time whistle ended an entertaining encounter with the players and officials retiring to the Islay Frigate Hotel for the presentation ceremony.The Duncan MacDougall man of the match award was given to Red Star\u0026#8217s Kieran Moore.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"sun brings out the best in lochgilphead golfers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 17/05/18, 2:24 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowOn a lovely sunny Sunday the gents competed to gain a place to play in this year\u0026#8217s match and knockout competition.Jim Hunter was excited to return a nett score of 58, six strokes below par.

It was a gamble \u0026#8211 but one that paid off, with the business now turning over millions each year.He left the business \u0026#8216at least 10 years ago\u0026#8217, but was a very interested visitor at last week\u0026#8217s \u0026#8216Fyne at 40\u0026#8217 celebrations \u0026#8211 more on pages 16 and 17 \u0026#8211 to mark the company\u0026#8217s four decades in business.\u0026#8216Looking back, I feel quite astonished really,\u0026#8217 he told the Advertiser.\u0026#8216I mean, away back we had a wooden hut, but before that there was a fish box and an umbrella. We were growing shellfish, cooking prawns and smoking a bit of fish.\u0026#8216The restaurant as we see it today was an old farm steading \u0026#8211 well, it was a midden, really. But we slowly evolved within it.\u0026#8216It was open to the slates and the wind used to go straight up the length of the oyster bar. We had a hessian sack to keep down the draught, and it used to stand out at about 45 degrees a lot of the time. It was very primitive for many years, because we were skint.\u0026#8216People sat in their overcoats, but they liked the style. All of a sudden they could get local shellfish, and it just developed from there.\u0026#8217He continued: \u0026#8216Since my time the whole place has had a re-make and it is really, really nice.\u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s been driven by the volume of people wanting to dine here. I mean, you couldn\u0026#8217t keep up that slightly rustic look. It\u0026#8217s a cracking place now. Just superb.\u0026#8217Johnny Noble sadly died in 2002, aged just 66.\u0026#8216He was an inspiring, lovely man, said Mr Lane. \u0026#8216No matter what disaster befell us no matter what cock-up happened, he was ever-optimistic and just kept us going.\u0026#8216We would have our business meetings in the billiard room at [Johnny\u0026#8217s home] Ardkinglas House, and there would be a bottle of something. That just keeps the morale going.\u0026#8216He was a great man, and wonderful entertainment.\u0026#8217The stories of Johnny Noble are legion, and most are true.Andy Lane recalled: \u0026#8216In the days of the Oyster Bar in our old draughty building, everyone had to muck in. Johnny would go round being the wine waiter for a while. Until, that is, someone would choose an inappropriate wine. At that point he\u0026#8217d start a sort of genial argument with them. In the end he\u0026#8217d sit down with them and you\u0026#8217d never see him again for the rest of the evening.\u0026#8216I don\u0026#8217t think we realised just how important he was for the business until he was gone.\u0026#8217Now living a quieter life in Cornwall with his Dexters, Mr Lane concluded: \u0026#8216My wife and I changed tack in life, really, and it keeps us busy.

Therefore, we support separating pedestrians, cyclists and motorists through an expansion of the network of walking and cycling paths across Scotland.We would like to stress, however, that measures like these will not single-handedly lead to safer roads. The road mentality in Scotland still favours the motorist over more vulnerable road users, which presents a huge barrier to more people taking up active lifestyles.More needs to be done to change our road culture for people in Scotland to feel safer regardless of their means of transportation, ultimately empowering them to lead healthier and more active lifestyles.Perhaps it is time we started to beat the ‘presumed liability’ drum once again?Brenda Mitchell, Road Traffic Accident Law (Scotland) LLP, Edinburgh.Sir,Some people have difficulty getting up and down the steps on the Glasgow bus.

A platform comes out on to the pavement, with a holding bar, and is then raised up to floor level. This is designed as a wheelchair lift, where two seats at the front have to be arranged to be taken out, to give plenty of room.It was agreed, however, that if someone felt nervous about climbing up or down the stairs, they could also use the access platform. Once they have paid their ticket, they can walk to a seat.West Coast Motors asks anyone wanting this service to please remember two things.Firstly, book your single or return tickets by phone or on the Citylink website.Then, 48 hours before your journey, phone Citylink and tell them the times and details of the booking you have made and let them know you will be using the access ramp. The telephone number is 08712 663333.Kirsty McCuaig and Patricia Crawford, Mid Argyll Buddies.Sir,The ongoing effects of weather, bureaucracy and concern for the future continue to put our countryside under pressure, with few avenues to turn to for support.This can have dramatic consequences for the rural economy and the people who live and work there.The Prince’s Countryside Fund is committed to supporting community-led projects that will re-invigorate and sustain farming networks and the countryside by providing services and amenities through its grant programme.Open for applications until June 14, grants are available for up to £50,000. If you are involved in a community-run or farming support project and think your organisation may benefit – or if you know someone who might –  visit  www.princescountrysidefund. org.uk/grants.The fund has supported a diverse range of projects, including a community transport app in Argyll and projects on Barra, Orkney and Shetland. We are proud to have distributed more than £9 million since 2010 to more than 250 projects led by these grassroots organisations.It is crucial we help rural areas during these times of change to retain a thriving countryside and encourage a sustainable farming sector in the UK and would encourage people to apply for our funding.Claire Saunders, director, The Prince’s Countryside Fund.Sir,At first sight, it seems odd that the controversy over the reported disturbance to common gulls, oystercatchers and black guillemots at the old oil depot in Ardrishaig is focused on a breeding colony of common gulls.I’m no bird expert and hadn’t realised common gulls are less common than the bigger varieties or that they’re a declining species.But among the reasons given for this are predation by mink and the loss of open rubbish dumps and both might be contributing factors in Mid Argyll.It’s surely hardly surprising that the only breeding colony along the canal is at the Ardrishaig end, where the urbanisation around the tidal flats of Loch Gilp and the Lingerton dump offer prime scavenging opportunities.I don’t know whether they lose out to the bigger gull species when it comes to local island nesting sites, or whether the old Gleaner site might offer other advantages, for example, maybe less vulnerable to mink predation – but could it be the gulls are there primarily because of man-made feeding opportunities and that they’ll find an alternative site that’s similarly convenient?Likewise, the smaller populations of oystercatchers and black guillemots, however, although they’re also both amber listed they don’t scavenge and seem to be more dependent on the sea and shore for their livelihoods.Their decline might be of more concern but they’re hopefully less swayed towards easy pickings around Loch Gilp and more evenly distributed to Loch Crinan.Perhaps Jim Dickson and Andrew Tongue can enlighten us further on just how endangered the populations of these three species are in Mid Argyll.Robert Wakeham, Lochgilphead.Sir,Please would the parents of the young girl who may have witnessed a recent incident with a man and dog in Inveraray Main Street contact my husband and I through this newspaper?We saw a man who, we believe, mistreated a dog in the street at 8.30pm on Sunday April 29.We are both keen to know this young person is alright as she appeared to be frightened, running off at speed with her two dogs.Knowing she was fine would put our minds at rest. We can still see her face full of horror and hear her cry.Otherwise we had a lovely holiday. You have a most beautiful part of the country to live in.Name and address supplied.Sir,It has been announced recently a Scottish Conservative government would invest £100 million into fixing potholes over the course of the next parliament.We all rely on our roads but they are now plagued with potholes which are damaging cars. Beyond our concerns for public safety, this systematic under-investment is slowing our economy and costing local councils a fortune in compensation for car owners.We recognise the importance of well-maintained roads and we are willing to invest in it.The SNP has consistently neglected Scotland’s roads and the results are obvious for everyone to see.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.On Monday May 14, I spotted six swallows over the rear of Meadows Place, hopefully heralding a decent summer.First seen this year.Mike Power, Lochgilphead.Sir,During this week\u0026#8217s Holyrood vote on the UK Government’s Withdrawal Bill, Labour, the Greens and LibDems joined the SNP in an overwhelming rejection of the UK Government’s currently-drafted Brexit plans, voting 93 to 30 against the bill.While the Scottish Government agrees in the need for UK-wide frameworks, it has described the retention of the overall control of agriculture, fisheries, food labelling and public procurement as a power grab.The Scottish Parliament has spoken loudly and clearly, and if the UK Government wants us to believe they value Scotland and devolution, they must respect the vote and remove the proposed power grab.Any constraints placed on the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament without consent would be a democratic outrage.During Prime Minister\u0026#8217s Questions, Theresa May failed to reassure us she will respect the decision of the Scottish Parliament. If she does choose to ignore the vote and force through this legislation, she will be breaking the conventions of the 20-year-old devolution settlement and imposing a power grab upon Scotland against our will.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"science matters natures patterns","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 20/05/18, 11:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe natural world abounds in beautiful patterns, each evolved to enhance survival of a species \u0026#8211 the extravagant, iridescent peacock’s tail, which serves to attract a mate, while intricate orchid flowers entice pollinators and tigers’ stripes provide camouflage.But not all nature’s patterns are quite as showy it is the mathematical symmetries that I find most intriguing.Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci lived in 12th century Algeria when Indian numerals were introduced to the West via the Middle East.  In his book, Liber Abaci (published in 1202), he describes a numerical sequence, now called the Fibonacci sequence, in which each number is the sum of the previous two digits: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 ad infinitum. He formulated this recurrence in relation to rabbit breeding, but it turns out to be exceedingly wide-spread in nature, from tree branching to mollusc shell growth to bee reproduction.Plant leaves are like solar panels, absorbing sunlight to power energy-providing photosynthesis.  Thus, leaves appear in a spiral around the stem, each positioned to optimise sunlight capture.  The ratio of leaves to turns is always a ration of Fibonacci numbers 3 leaves to 1 turn for hazel, 8/3 for pear and 13/5 for almond trees.  The angle between consecutive leaves is always close to 137.5o, called ‘the golden angle’ – perfect for maximising energy production.The number of petals in most flowers also follows the Fibonacci sequence: lilies have 3, buttercups 5, delphinium 8, common marigolds 13, asters 21.  But even more striking are the complex spirals of seed-heads of sunflowers, fir cones and pineapples.  In each case new seeds forming in the centre of the flower push older seeds out into mesmerising patterns of interlocking, clockwise and anticlockwise spirals.The numbers of spirals in both directions are consecutive Fibonacci numbers with 5 and 8 or 8 and 13 in pineapples, 8 and 13 in fir cones, and numbers as high as 144 and 233 recorded in sunflower heads.Why? Because these configurations pack in the most seeds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 21/05/18, 3:33 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Some would argue it has been an eyesore that should have been knocked down long before now and replaced with a more modern building.But it\u0026#8217s sad to see the old Inveraray Community Hall crumble and rot with neglect.What makes the building\u0026#8217s current predicament all the more galling is that there was the chance, according to Inspire Inveraray, to make the building safe six years ago.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

Whitletts has landed an unenviable spot in the country’s top 10 road tests to avoid. The list, published by recovery firm 24/7 Vehicle Rescue, claims the “nerve-jangling lottery” has put Ayr on the map for all the wrong reasons. It follows a \u0026pound3.5m scheme to increase lanes and install traffic lights on the roundabout in 2006, which has sparked trouble for many trying to negotiate its contours ever since. Transport Scotland held a safety review in 2015 after stats showed Whitletts was more dangerous than the giant M8 roundabout at Hermiston Gait near Edinburgh.  Ranjen Gohri, spokesman for 24/7 Vehicle Rescue, said: “Britain is famed for its roundabouts, and being able to safely negotiate them is a major part of driving in this country. “Unfortunately, many motorists are terrified of them. “This is not helped by some of the cases we’ve gathered that have a fearsome reputation and seem to almost unnerve drivers before they even get to them. “With the volume of traffic and unavoidable problems such as breakdowns, driving in the UK is difficult enough without having to attempt some of these roundabouts from hell.” Also making the top ten is Sheriffhall, which sits on Edinburgh’s city bypass, and Haudagain in Aberdeen, which is due for a \u0026pound30m redesign later this year.

The prolific striker turned down Premiership riches and clubs in England to agree a one-year contract at Somerset Park on Tuesday. Shankland, 22, told the Ayrshire Post: “It’s a great club to be a part of. The main thing for this decision is that I am enjoying my football. The gaffer has been great with me and that’s why I came here. He gave me a chance to get back into football. I am happy and I don’t think there’s any amount of money that beats happiness. The fans have taken to me and that gives you confidence going into every game you play. Shankland smashed 29 goals en route to being named League One\u0027s player of the year as Ayr won the title.  Boss Ian McCall said: Lawrence could have doubled his money elsewhere and had offers from the Premiership up here and League One down in England. But the affection he has had from our supporters has played a huge part in his decision. It’s a huge piece of business for this club. Be in no doubt that Lawrence could easily have gone, but he has made a footballing decision. It is a big, big signing which shows our intent and now we need the fans to respond with an upsurge in season ticket sales.

Erin McKenzie, a 25-year-old law graduate married 27-year-old offshore worker Stuart Murray. The pair are both from Kilmarnock. “We met in the Brass \u0026amp Granite in 2010 at a pub quiz,” said Erin. “I worked part time in Tesco while studying and Stuart would come in and chat to me on a Sunday when he wasn’t offshore. “It wasn’t until 2015 when my gran met Stuart at a wedding and told him that I was single that he finally plucked up the courage to ask me on a date! “Stuart invited me to his house where he cooked me a lovely meal and the romance started. We moved in together early 2016 and then Stuart proposed whilst we were on holiday in Dubai in September 2016. “He bought me a pair of Valentino shoes and got down on one knee to put them on for me before pulling out my beautiful engagement ring that he’d designed himself and had made by a jeweller in Dubai.  The couple tied the knot on Saturday, February 24 this year, with the ceremony held at Glasgow University Memorial Chapel and the reception at Boclair House in Bearsden. Erin said: “It was a nice contrast of traditional and modern glam. “We were so lucky getting a beautiful crisp sunny day - right before the Beast from the East came later that week. “Stuart and I wrote our own ceremony and personalised vows. “We ended the night with [I want to spend my] Life with You by The Proclaimers. “It really was a perfect day and more than we could of dreamed of! The bride wore Everlasting by Caroline Castigliano, from The Bridal Garden in Glasgow, with her bridesmaids wearing customised blush Haley Paige dresses from Anne Priscilla, Glasgow.  Groom Stuart wore an Arran Mist kilt and plaid with matching navy jacket and gold tie. And the groomsmen wore Arran Mist tartan kilts with charcoal jackets and gold ties - exclusive to MacGregor \u0026amp MacDuff in Prestwick. The bridal party consisted of chief bridesmaid Eilidh McKenzie and bridesmaids Lynsey Ross, Raina Purba and Kirsteen Havlin. Making up the rest of the wedding party were best man Craig Marshall, ushers Les Lawrie, Dean Wear and Torin McKenzie, mother of the bride Una McKenzie and parents of the groom Yvonne and Fraser Murray. The couple celebrated being newlyweds with a trip to the sunshine. Erin said: “We squeezed in 10 nights in at the Centara Ras Fushi resort in the Maldives before Stuart went offshore again. “It was paradise! Our villa was right on the beach so it was perfect for watching the sunset.  Thistle \u0026amp Blink Photography from Kilmarnock captured the couple’s big day, leaving them with fond memories to relive. Emma Lawson of Betty Bluebell, based in East Kilbride, pieced together the bouquets with Ashley Nimmo, Ellis Dewhurst and Jett Paterson of Allure in Kilmarnock creating the hair and beauty looks for the day. As for their cake, the couple opted for four-tiers with all their favourite flavours, including red velvet. A local lady called Gianna made the cake, completed with a handmade topper by friend Rachel Currie. Erin added: “We would like to say a huge thank you to our families, bridesmaids and groomsmen for their help in the planning and execution of our dream wedding- it couldn’t have gone better! “Thank you to everyone who shared in our special day, your generosity and well wishes have been overwhelming.

Neighbours have slammed fast motorists in the Heathfield area and also in Whitletts Road. One resident claims an existing speed camera on Whitletts Road currently isn’t in operation and insist vehicles are zooming past her home at speeds of up to 50mph. She is calling for a speed camera further along the road to curb fast drivers. The concerned woman has called for the camera between Whitletts Road and Mainholm Road. Speaking at this month’s North Ayr Community Council, she said: “I am convinced the speed camera in Whitletts Road is not switched on. “I can hear cars at 6am or 7am travelling at more than 30mph coming into the town and the same going out.  “We need a speed camera.” Councillor Ian David said: “I am waiting for a response from the Partnership Panel as speeding in Whitletts Road was mentioned and it will be taken up with the police.” Speeding was also a hot topic discussed at last month’s Newton and Heathfield Community Council held in Newton Pavilion. Community councillors highlighted problems with speeding cars in Alderston Avenue and Northfield Avenue, and the problem of these streets being used by drivers as rat run to avoid the traffic lights in Prestwick Road. One woman said: “(There is) speeding in Alderston Avenue and there are a few children who stay in that street at the corner and the cars are turning right on to Northfield Avenue.” Police attending the meeting said they would do their best to monitor the situation. A council spokesman said Police Scotland/Safety Cameras Scotland administer speed cameras: “Safety cameras in Scotland are operated under the rules and guidelines of the Scottish Safety Camera Programme.”  A Police Scotland spokesman said: “The speed detection cameras are rotated around camera housing sites and have the ability to be used at any time. “You can find more information on the Scottish Safety Camera Programme and the location of camera sites by visiting www.safetycameras.gov.scot” In March, the Post reported that more than 13,000 speed offences have been captured on Ayrshire’s roads over the past three years Fast drivers were caught 13,103 times racing through the streets at breakneck speeds across the county from 2015 to 2017. And the highest clocked by a speed camera during that period was in 2016 at 140mph. Over last three years, a total of 715 speeding offences were detected in Ayr, 227 in Troon, 116 Prestwick, 32 in Maybole, 105 in Girvan and 88 in Cumnock.

Calls are mounting for civic head, Helen Moonie, to hold a bash at County Buildings, following Ayr’s first league title in 21 years. But the request could be snubbed in favour of a joint sporting celebration, the Post understands. A request for the engagement, lodged in the aftermath of Ayr’s success, is being considered by officials. Former cop Alasdair Malcolm, now a volunteer at Somerset Park, has called for the recognition. He said: “Every effort should be made to mark this fantastic achievement. “Ayr United are an integral part of the local community and, particularly through their Academy programme, have close working relationships throughout local schools and community groups. “The club, which has been a feature of the town since 1910, have had an outstanding season.” Ayr became the first club in the UK to score 100 goals in domestic competition en route to their title.  And their championship was the first to be clinched on home soil for 90 years. Mr Malcolm, secretary of the Ayrshire Golf Association, said: “It would be fitting if the local authority, by way of a civic reception or similar event, would mark the achievement of the management, players, officials and staff.” South Ayrshire Tory leader, Martin Dowey, added: “It is a wonderful achievement and one that is worthy of a civic reception. “A prosperous Ayr United is good for the town and we will be calling on all councillors to recognise the title win.” However, it’s believed there may be other invites on the guest list of any civic celebration. Carrick Rugby Club, three-time winners of the BT National Shield, and Commonwealth gold medallist Paul Foster, are among those in their thoughts. A council spokesman said: “A request has been received and will be considered in line with our civic hospitality guidelines.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"win a summer shopping spree","story":"NewsWin a summer shopping spreeTo help you get fashion and beauty- ready for summer, Debenhams at Ayr Central are hosting a fabulous VIP shopping event on Thursday June 7.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post10:35, 30 MAY 2018Updated10:36, 30 MAY 2018NewsGet ready for summer and be in with a chance of winning a shopping spree\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWIN A SUMMER SHOPPING SPREE!

Wren Kitchens will move into a 10,000sq ft unit at Heathfield this September, the Post can reveal. The firm, based in Lincolnshire, will make its first foray into Ayrshire when the store opens its doors. Its nearest outlet is currently more than 40 miles away at Abbotsinch, near Paisley. The addition comes as a welcome boost for park bosses, who are set to lose three retailers this year. Homebase will bow out on June 24, joining Carpetright and Maplin on the casualty list. The departures will see 50,000sq ft of trading space lost. However, Alastair Dickie, director at Heathfield’s developers Ediston Properties, said: “This is a positive piece of business. “Wren are an expanding company and this represents their first store in Ayrshire.  “They clearly view Ayr as a place to be and we are happy to have them on board. “It will mean jobs, not only in store but indirectly for fitters.” Wren will move into the unit vacated by the former PC World. The firm, which was founded in 2009, employs more than 4000 staff. It comes as park bosses prepare to seal a deal with another new name on site. Mr Dickie added: “Since acquiring the park we’ve let out ten units and don’t anticipate stopping there.” Ediston bought Heathfield in 2011 in a deal worth \u0026pound31.8 million. Retail giants such as M\u0026ampS, DFS and Costa have all moved in as part of the park’s overhaul in the intervening years.

hit global financial markets this week and raised questions about the country\u0026rsquos future as a member of Europe\u0026rsquos shared currency, the euro.\nSome in Italy and other countries in the 19-member currency union have complained about the euro, saying it has made life tougher economically.\nHere is a quick look at the euro and why it is in the spotlight again.\nWhy is the euro an issue in Italy\u0026rsquos political crisis?\n[READ] In this commentary, Daniel Gros argues that \"the root causes of the current crisis in \n#Italy\nare domestic little to do with fiscal rules or lack of risk sharing. This means it needs to be resolved domestically\" \nhttps://t.co/M5q4uxUK1I\n\u0026hellip \npic.twitter/bBbsIDC2ZV\n\u0026mdash CEPS ThinkTank (@CEPS_thinktank) \nMay 31, 2018\nItaly\u0026rsquos economy has grown very little since it adopted the euro as a founding member in 1999. Some blame the euro rules that limit government spending and deficits, which can stimulate growth.\nMany economists, however \u0026ndash a number of them Italian \u0026ndash say the country has failed to make its economy more competitive. It is held back by corruption, excessive bureaucracy and high labour costs.\nThat makes Italy an expensive place to locate a business and makes its exports less competitive.\nDaniel Gros, head of the Centre for European Policy Studies, says Italy\u0026rsquos troubles are homemade but psychologically hard for some to accept.\nHe said that the \u0026ldquoimpact of corruption and pervasive conflicts of interest on growth, and economic performance in general, is diffuse and difficult to pinpoint.\n\u0026ldquoIt is thus understandable that the euro has become a scapegoat, he said.\nAll that has been true for years. What has made the euro an issue this week?\nPresident Sergio Mattarella rejected the proposal for an economy minister whose writings have entertained the idea of leaving the euro (Fabio Frustaci/ANSA via AP)\nItaly\u0026rsquos anti-establishment Five Star Movement and anti-immigration League party have each flirted with the idea of leaving the euro and regaining complete control over fiscal and monetary policy.\nThe two parties won enough votes on March 4 to form a government. But that stalled after President Sergio Mattarella rejected their proposal for an economy minister whose writings have entertained the idea of leaving the euro.\nMr Mattarella said that such a drastic idea needed to be debated openly during a campaign, not brought in through the back door.\nHis move helped put the euro front and centre, with the prospect that any new elections would be explicitly fought as a referendum on the euro.\nCould Italy leave the euro?\nItaly is not struggling because of the euro, but because of lack of structural reforms. Italy should do what France has started to do. Reforms, reforms, reforms, and Italy will be saved! \n#EPlenary\n\u0026#127470\u0026#127481\u0026#127466\u0026#127482    \n\u0026mdash Guy Verhofstadt (@guyverhofstadt) \nMay 30, 2018\nYes, but it is considered unlikely.\nFor one, despite it all, many Italians do not want to. A poll from October 2017 showed 45% of Italians thought the euro was good for their country and 40% thought it was bad.\nAnd the possible consequences of leaving are sobering. Investors, fearing their holdings of stocks or real estate might be switched into a new Italian currency that would be worth less, would sell, causing markets to plunge.\nItalian companies could get into legal disputes with foreign suppliers about what currency to pay in. Bankruptcies and lawsuits would spread. Italian\u0026rsquos euro savings would be worth less. Growth would suffer.\nIf it is so unlikely, why did markets take fright this week?\nThe Italian Constitution clearly says \u0026ldquothe sovereignty belongs to the people, not to financial markets. Today \n#Mattarella\nis denying the result of free elections and is declaring that Italy is a colony of Germany.It\u0026rsquos a financial coup! Help us. Stand up for italian democracy!    \n\u0026mdash Ignazio Corrao (@ignaziocorrao) \nMay 27, 2018\nThe fear is that a government that runs bigger budget deficits and flouts EU rules, as the two populist parties suggested they would do, might scare off investors from lending the government money.\nThat would raise the cost Italy pays to borrow money from international investors. The main market reaction this week was a jump in Italian borrowing rates.\nExtremely high borrowing costs could force Italy to default on its debt.\nAnother reason for concern is Italy\u0026rsquos size. It\u0026rsquos the third biggest eurozone economy, too big to fail and too big to bail, as the saying goes. The likelihood is small but the consequences would be large.\nHow would Italy leaving the euro affect people outside Italy?\nSome experts say the eurozone would hold together but would suffer a huge blow in confidence.\nA crisis in the 19-member eurozone \u0026ndash collectively the world\u0026rsquos second-largest economy after the United States \u0026ndash could lead to investors around the globe becoming more cautious, sending stocks and growth lower for an unknown period.\nIs it just Italy that has questions about the euro?\nBefore the introduction of the euro, Italy was a formidable competitor for the German industry. Its world market share was at 6%. Today Italy\u0026rsquos market share has shrunk to half of that. The country is over-indebted. The youth unemployment rate is a scandal. \n#FutureofEurope\n\u0026mdash Hans-Olaf Henkel MEP (@HansOlafHenkel) \nMay 30, 2018\nNo. Even strong supporters of the euro say the currency\u0026rsquos set-up is faulty.\nIt lacks the usual ways for countries to adjust to financial difficulty, in that it has no central fiscal pot to even out recessions in individual countries.\nSince countries no longer have a national currency, they also cannot let it devalue \u0026ndash a common safety valve in times of trouble. A weaker currency makes a country cheaper to invest in for foreigners.\nInstead, Greece and other member countries that ran into trouble got bailout loans from other member countries, on condition they impose crushing budget austerity-slashing pensions and government salaries and raising taxes. That fuelled resentment against the euro and the EU.\nEfforts to fix the euro include tougher banking rules to keep expensive bank bailouts from overwhelming a country financially.\nThere is now also a bailout fund to help members that run into trouble. But progress has stalled on other measures, such as a common budget.\n(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\u0027GoogleAnalyticsObject\u0027]=ri[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new Date()a=s.createElement(o),m=s.getElementsByTagName(o)[0]a.async=1a.src=gm.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)})(window,document,\u0027script\u0027,\u0027//www.google-analytics/analytics.js\u0027,\u0027ga\u0027)ga(\u0027create\u0027, \u0027UA-72310761-1\u0027, \u0027auto\u0027, {\u0027name\u0027: \u0027pacontentapi\u0027})ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027referrer\u0027, location.origin)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension1\u0027, \u0027By David McHugh, Associated Press\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension2\u0027, \u0027660322b1-b582-4e2b-801b-a4ad1fd7441a\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension3\u0027, \u0027paservice:news,paservice:news:world\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension6\u0027, \u0027story\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension7\u0027, \u0027composite\u0027)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension8\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.set\u0027, \u0027dimension9\u0027, null)ga(\u0027pacontentapi.send\u0027, \u0027pageview\u0027, { \u0027location\u0027: location.href, \u0027page\u0027: (location.pathname + location.search + location.hash), \u0027title\u0027: \u0027Everything you need to know about Italy and the euro\u0027})\n"}]
