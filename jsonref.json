later, Mr Bower claimed in another book that Tony Blair presided over a silent conspiracy to change the face of Britain for ever with mass immigration. His explosive book Broken Vows revealed that he ordered his Labour government never to discuss in public the supposed ‘advantages’ of the unprecedented influx.But behind the scenes ministers were instructed to wave tens of thousands of asylum seekers into the UK under cover of their being ‘economic migrants’.Astonishingly, the minister Mr Blair put in charge of borders ruled against deporting failed claimants because it would be too ‘emotional’. In March this year, Mr Bower released his unauthorised biography on Prince Charles called Rebel Prince: The Power, Passion and Defiance of Prince Charles.He claimed it would include testimony from more than 120 people employed or \u0027welcomed into the inner sanctum of Clarence House\u0027.                                                     A Queensland Police spokeswoman told

duchess, wearing a pale pink loose-fitted dress and a scarf adorned with two koala brooches, gamely picked up a bat to test her skills against Australian boxers Anja Stridsman and Caitlin Parker.She was joined by Lucy Turnbull, the wife of Australia\u0027s prime minister Malcolm Turnbull, but, with a laugh and a smile, the Duchess concluded: I think I\u0027ll leave it to the professionals.But Ms Parker, 21, declared: \u0027She smashed it!\u0027Ms Stridsman, 30, added: \u0027It was a pretty special moment. I feel ready for my match now I\u0027ve played royalty.\u0027As the tour of the village\u0027s games room continued, Camilla did not stop there.Picking up a pool cue, she looked bemused - but Australian shot put para-athlete Marty Jackson was on hand to help her out and show her how to use it.Meanwhile, her husband spent a few moments testing out his own table tennis skills against a Bangladeshi athlete.

Sexist producers or feeble women who lack the confidence and guts to compete? Nowhere is this more striking than on topical panel shows like Have I got News For You - just starting its 55th series.From the very beginning, the teams have been hosted by writer and satirist Ian Hislop and comedian Paul Merton. Hislop is cheery, consistently snappy and savage with his put-downs, Merton lugubrious and surreal.There have been regular complaints from the start that the show is a boy’s club, where women don’t feel at ease and some women were highly offended this week when Hislop remarked that female MP’s were reluctant to host the show- there has only been one, Anne Widdecombe.Ten male MP’s have occupied the hot seat, including Boris Johnson, Ed Balls and Nick Clegg. I was unlucky to be a panellist on the show with Ed - he made the fatal mistake of thinking he was a comedian, instead of accepting the task was to read out a script and not mess it up.Possibly his success on Strictly had over-inflated his ego, but the result was painful in the extreme.Would I have done a better job? Most definitely - but I’m not interested in maintaining order and having to appear neutral, I prefer to be an irritant and spar with the others.          There have been regular complaints from the start that the show is a boy’s club, where women don’t feel at ease           Jo Brand (who demolished the cocky blokes with some withering putdowns)Hislop is not a chauvinist but a surprising well-balanced fellow, who had the guts to say ‘women are slightly more reticent…maybe modesty makes them think ‘I can’t do that…maybe more men in public life think ‘Yes I can do that’.Politically incorrect it might be, but Hislop articulates what the scientists now tell us - men have no problem thinking they can be achievers, when they often possess minimal skills for the job.What a feeble bunch most female MP’s turn out to be - Nadine Dorries (not a shrinking violet) says she will never appear on HIGNFY again because it’s ‘too vicious, too abrasive’ adding ‘women don’t banter in that way, or very rarely…most don’t have that degree of aggression’.Compared with the Bill Clinton and Monica scandal the seedy...Share this articleTalk about condemning your own sex to mediocrity in the space of a couple of sentences, and a bit rich coming from someone who regularly takes part in the antiquated bear pit that’s the House of Commons debating chamber, where grown men shout, make silly gestures and animal noises and interrupt each other, in the name of democracy.Margaret Beckett, now in the House of Lords whimpered ‘they eat people alive who think they can compete’. These women are a disgrace to their sex - Beckett did herself no favours when she appeared on Question Time around the start of the MP’s expenses scandal, and tried to justify all her various houses and living expenses. She was mocked by a rowdy audience and failed to fight back, spineless outside her comfort zone.

As for allegations of sexism, the producers of HIGNFY will be under enormous pressure to book more women - after the BBC launched a target of 5050 gender representation.Comedy shows are about entertainment, and if a guest (male or female) can’t deliver they won’t be asked back.I am frequently asked to appear on popular television shows by casting directors, and I know why. It’s hardly flattering, because they are ticking boxes. They will be tasked with booking the following - a young soap star, an actor who’s had ‘problems’ (either booze or drugs) and is turning their life around, an airhead reality star, a sportsperson of yesteryear and a couple of old farts who will complain and argue. Each component is chosen to appeal to a certain demographic in the audience, from brain-dead youth to frisky pensioner.Every single reality show, from The Island to Strictly, to I’m a Celebrity and Real Marigold Hotel follows these highly structured guidelines - so you get me or Anne Widdecombe or John Sargeant or Miriam Margolyes in the ill-tempered crumblie slot. Thankfully, Have I got News is one show where these rules don’t apply. You need to be smart, alert, self-deprecating and careful not to annoy your team leader. What’s not to like?One feminist writer whinged that women don’t want to appear because ‘they see how they are dealt with’. Sure, there have been some gormless silent bimbos on the show, but there have also been useless tongue-tied men.Is it beyond the wit of smart women to mount a take-over of prime time telly?

He claimed: \u0027High Commissioners are required to watch the visit from a minstrels\u0027 gallery. They complain about being \u0027ushered around like cattle\u0027.\u0027          According to Mr Venuprasad, he warned Baroness Scotland about organising a £500,000 garden party which he claims \u0027marked him out\u0027Mr Venuprasad claims three days before the baroness officially arrived in her job, he was told \u0027Team Scotland\u0027 required office space for at least six people, potentially dislodging existing staff. On her first day \u0027she tells staff \u0027I am the Secretariat\u0027 and all staff are \u0027mini -mes\u0027,\u0027 he said.Mr Venuprasad says he warned about Baroness Scotland organising a £50,000 garden party, expressing concerns about \u0027the cost, invitation list, timing and absence of Secretariat staff\u0027.He told the tribunal: \u0027As a result of making the disclosures I was immediately marked out … by the secretary general as being the source of a leak when adverse reports about her were published in the UK Press.\u0027I was then subjected to a campaign of intimidation and hostility clearly designed not only to punish me, but to damage me reputationally and psychologically.\u0027I deny in the most strenuous terms that I leaked sensitive and confidential information to the Press.\u0027Mr Venuprasad claims he was treated as the sole suspect for the leaks but it could not be proved so he was suspended, given a final written warning, and effectively pushed out for a bogus offence of forwarding work emails to his private email address.He claims he would otherwise have worked as a \u0027high performer\u0027 for six more years. He wants compensation that could approach £500,000.Mr Venuprasad said: \u0027A Secretariat spokesperson described me to the media, on the record, as \u0027a profoundly disaffected inidual\u0027. This description had therefore been sanctioned, probably at the highest levels.\u0027Queen snubs\u0027 Baroness Shameless: Monarch said to be staying...Pressure mounts on Baroness Brazen as her PR advisor is...Share this article\u0027I had been told that the SG was threatening to report me to police regarding my previous employment. My career was in tatters.\u0027 He said he was falsely accused of corruption.The Secretariat\u0027s lawyer, Alice Lacourt, said the baroness denied smearing Mr Venuprasad behind his back.Tribunal chairman David Goddard QC said: \u0027Why can\u0027t the secretary general say that? … It is unusual not to have evidence from the people who made the decisions.\u0027Mrs Lacourt said it was not felt necessary to call the baroness to give evidence to deny she had smeared Mr Venuprasad because there was no direct evidence that she had.An official Secretariat spokesman later said it was the \u0027busiest\u0027 time of year for the secretary general who had been in Australia all week for the Commonwealth Games, meetings and conferences.The tribunal findings will be announced at a later date. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/06/01/4ADDE3FE00000578-5584017-image-a-1_1522974745350.jpg","title":"Beast East hits high street sales","story":"A dusting of snow covers Guildford High Street.Year-on-year sales dropped by 10.1 per cent for March, according to BDO\u0027s High Street Sales Tracker (HSST)          The news is likely to be little better looking ahead to April, with the tracker reporting flat growth for the week leading up to Easter Sunday amid a weekend of wet weather.

He describes himself as a \u0027media and cultural theorist who specialises in research on playful media, from videogames and social media to activist and art projects\u0027.Then there is Ruth Catlow who is not even connected to an academic institution but is listed as a director of Furtherfield, an \u0027artist led online community\u0027. With a degree in sculpture, Ms Catlow describes herself as an \u0027artist, theorist, curator,\u0027 and a \u0027recovering web-utopian\u0027, whatever that is.Meanwhile, Zeta Kolokythopoulu, who is listed by the Guardian as being at London South Bank University, is not known there as a member of its staff. A separate website suggests she may be a PhD student.There will have been little surprise at the pro-Corbyn views advanced by another inidual who put his name to the letter: Jeremy Gilbert, the professor of cultural and political theory at East London University.In his biography, Gilbert boasts he writes regularly for the Guardian as well as the Left-leaning New Statesman, and that he has appeared on national TV \u0027as a spokesperson for Jeremy Corbyn\u0027s leadership of the Labour Party\u0027.In its news coverage of the letter, the Guardian skated over that admission as well as the fact he is a \u0027member of the founding national committee of Momentum\u0027, the group set up in 2015 to shore-up Corbyn\u0027s leadership of Labour.The shadow chancellor John McDonnell, a self-confessed Marxist, will have been delighted by the inclusion of Theodore Koulouris on the list. A \u0027senior lecturer in media theory\u0027 at Brighton University, his work is described thus: \u0027His research interests lie in the interstices of media and literary theory with a focus on the intersections of Marxism with deconstruction, on the political significances of mourning, on media ethics, and on literary and socio-political articulations of feminism, gender performativity, and feminist activism in the digital era.\u0027          Protesters hold placards as they demonstrate in Parliament Square against anti-SemitismAnother of the letter\u0027s authors, Michael Chanan, professor of film at Roehampton University, is proud to state he is the \u0027New Statesman magazine\u0027s first video blogger\u0027.Hacked Off, the lobbyist group seeking to muzzle the Press, is inevitably involved. Julian Petley, Professor of Journalism at Brunel University, a supporter of the group, signed the letter.A member of the editorial board of the British Journalism Review which over the years has been hijacked by the Left, he has been a full-time academic for 26 years.None of these academics is from Oxford or Cambridge. In fact only one of them, Bart Cammaerts of the London School of Economics, comes from one of our top ten universities. And he is an associate professor in the Department of Media and Communications who is currently on sabbatical.There are several signatories from Goldsmiths, University of London, and the less well-known universities of Aston and Lincoln.The fact is that even a cursory glance at the list reveals these people – 18 of whom are from media journalism and communciations departments – are anything but the senior academics they were claimed to be (and God help our universities if they are!)So why has the Labour-supporting Guardian exaggerated their status? Could it be down to the influence of Corbyn\u0027s all-powerful communications chief Seumas Milne? He is a former columnist on the newspaper. He also happens to be an old colleague of Becky Gardiner, who signed the letter in her capacity as senior lecturer in media and communications at Goldsmiths University.What the letter did not make clear is that she worked for 14 years on the newspaper and was comment editor when Milne was a columnist between 2010 and 2014. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/1/2018/04/04/21/wire-2640414-1522872749-887_87x84.jpg","title":"Israel Hamas gear Gaza border showdown","story":""},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/06/07/4ADF122700000578-5584769-image-a-49_1522995302691.jpg","title":"Gold Coast Candyman looking new attractive girlfriend apply now","story":"    Travers \u0027Candyman\u0027 Beynon (centre) is looking for an \u0027extremely attractive\u0027 woman to call his luxurious waterfront mansion home along with his wife and girlfriends (pictured)          The 46-year-old (second left), who is a father-of-four, has opened his doors for five girlfriends to cook his breakfast and pose in half-naked photos - as in any \u0027genuine relationship\u0027          Australia\u0027s Hugh Hefner wants his five new girlfriends to \u0027explore and experiment beyond their wildest fantasies\u0027 (pictured)\u0027With a custom bed built for a King, five more girlfriends can fit ... the search is on,\u0027 Beynon told The Sun.\u0027I want my girlfriends to develop, explore and experiment beyond their wildest fantasies.\u0027 The tobacco tycoon, who helped his parents create Free Choice, wants a \u0027fun, bubbly, outgoing, spontaneous, adventurous and respectful\u0027 lover to start a \u0027genuine relationship\u0027 with.What\u0027s wrong with this picture?

He’s got a very busy schedule I imagine.Asked why Harry seems so at ease with the competitors, he replied: I think it’s because he’s around military people. It’s hard to explain if you haven’t served. I think that’s why he’s so comfortable, he’s around like-minded people.After meeting Meghan for the first time he said: “She was lovely, like you see on the TV. Very polite and humble, so just great. She asked me what I was doing, how I was. She was cool, really cool, just like I imagined.Mr Ormrod, who lost both legs and an arm to an IED in Helmand Province in 2007, said he would be watching their big day on TV.He said: “We will be at home glued to the box watching it and wishing them all the best not just on the day but for their future together.

That makes him a lot different.“I couldn’t imagine living the life he has and having that of normality and being able to do that, he must be really grateful for that. We all just look in on that and are happy for him.Speaking about the surge in applications to compete at this year\u0027s Games, he said: I love it, the buzz is even bigger this year. It’s crazy. They’ve included the families now in the trial process as well, which is really important.‘The buzz is just great. It feels like five minutes ago that we were doing this for last year and I’m back here again and I’m just grateful to be here.What’s really cool is the first couple (of games) the focus was on all us Afghan vets and now the older guys are coming out and it’s growing the veteran family.
