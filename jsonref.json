Industry analysts looking at five major supermarkets typically see around 2,700 increases in early January, but this year it is closer to 4,400.Across all food retailers, almost 10,000 products have shot up in price over the new year. Research by price tracking and retail analysts Assosia looking at a basket of common products found an average increase of 6 per cent in the past year.For someone spending £430 a month on groceries, around the UK average, that adds up to an extra £25 a month. Some of the increases on big-selling household name products are particularly startling.The survey picked up an 18 per cent hike on a tin of Heinz baked beans and 12 per cent on beef mince, frozen peas and Jordans cereals. The increase was 11 per cent on supermarket-brand chocolate digestive biscuits, 9 per cent on milk, 8 per cent on eggs and 7 per cent on wholemeal bread.The biggest hikes the survey found were 32 per cent on Stork baking spread and 22 per cent on Lurpak lighter blended butter and rapeseed."},{"url":null,"title":"Ferry boss predicts 20 mile motorway queues unless Covid checks lifted Easter","story":"Share this article Since Friday, fully vaccinated travellers and under-18s arriving in the UK no longer need to have taken a pre-departure lateral flow test.And if demand for travel eventually returns to pre-pandemic levels, the ferry boss has predicted there will be behavioural changes among holidaymakers.He said: \u0027I do think that maybe there will be a shift a little bit away from long haul back towards more local holidaying, and I guess that also underlying there\u0027s that element of sustainable travel, green travel.\u0027Mr Parker argued that travel by ferry is better for the environment than by plane and that the Dover-Calais route transports important food and medical supplies to the UK.He added: \u0027Those vessels are going backwards and forwards anyway, so if you are travelling as a passenger your footprint is offset by the fact you\u0027re using something which is happening anyway.\u0027DFDS recently invested in a fleet of electric trucks and aims to be carbon-neutral by 2050."},{"url":null,"title":"Nicola Sturgeon told provide light end tunnel Covid beleaguered Scots","story":"Share this article   Miss Sturgeon told the broadcaster: \u0027We are in a position where we all want to get to as much normality as possible.

And you get that heart in your mouth, heart-wrenching, \u0027oh my god, where are they\u0027 sensation? \u0027It\u0027s that sensation just prolonged for hours, days, weeks, months and years, where you\u0027re just absolutely panicking about making sure you\u0027re kid\u0027s safe. \u0027The not knowing, the waking up every day for ever and ever wondering about his existence, even... It\u0027s an extended torture.\u0027\u0027No traces were ever found of him communicating with anybody,\u0027 Kevin said. \u0027We never have found one shred of evidence that he had an event or destination in mind that he was communicating with anybody. It genuinely seems that whatever was going on in his head was only in his head.\u0027 Kevin also struggles to accept that his son would put his family through the heartache of running away. Just a few weeks before his own disappearance, Andrew and Kevin spoke about Madeleine McCann, who had gone missing in May 2007. \u0027I remember sitting on the sofa in our front room seeing the news of Madeleine McCanns disappearance unfolding and going \u0027it must be every parent\u0027s worst nightmare\u0027,\u0027 Kevin recalled. \u0027And Andrew goes, \u0027yeah, that\u0027s awful\u0027.

That’s what I risk. This is one of those defining moments, it really is,” Biden said.  “People are going to be judged -- where were they before and where were they after the vote. History is going to judge us. It’s that consequential. And so the risk is making sure people understand just how important this is.” As of now, it appears that Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer does not have the votes necessary to amend the filibuster and allow voting rights bills to advance. Schumer has set a deadline of 17 January, Martin Luther King Day, to vote on the matter. In his Atlanta speech, Biden is expected to say, “The next few days, when these bills come to a vote, will mark a turning point in this nation. Will we choose democracy over autocracy, light over shadow, justice over injustice? I know where I stand. I will not yield. I will not flinch.”“Congratulations @GeorgiaFootball on your national championship! Your skill, grit, and determination show us what is possible – and how to win your school’s first title in 41 years. I’m proud of you, Bulldogs,” the president said on Twitter. The Bulldogs scored three touchdowns in the fourth quarter to defeat the Alabama Crimson Tide 33 to 18.“We need some good rule changes to make the place work better, but getting rid of the filibuster doesn’t make it work better,” Manchin told reporters on Capitol Hill moments ago. Because the Senate is evenly ided between the two parties, majority leader Chuck Schumer needs the support of all 50 Democratic senators to get rule changes approved. Many Democrats have called for amending the filibuster with a simple majority, but Manchin once again made clear that he wants the vote to occur under regular order, which would require a two-thirds supermajority for passage. “We need some good rules changes, and we can do that together,” Manchin said. “But you change the rules with two-thirds of the people that are present, so it’s Democrats and Republicans changing the rules to make the place work better. Getting rid of the filibuster does not make it work better.” Manchin’s comments come hours before Joe Biden is set to address the need for filibuster reform to pass voting rights bills in a speech in Atlanta, Georgia.“There is nothing more urgent than securing the foundations of our democracy,” NAACP president Derrick Johnson said in a statement ahead of Biden’s trip to Atlanta. “This administration and this Congress must use all the tools at their disposal to get voting rights across the finish line. We need to see outcomes.”  Of course, it remains unclear whether Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer can convince all 50 members of his caucus to support changing the filibuster, which would allow voting rights bills to advance. Senate Republicans have repeatedly used the filibuster to block the passage of the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act.“This is what you would expect from Russia,” Trump told Fox News on Monday. “This is what you would expect from Venezuela. This is third-rate stuff.” The investigation run by Letitia James is looking into questions including whether the Trump Organization altered property valuations for tax purposes. A separate, criminal investigation in Manhattan is covering similar ground. Such alleged behavior has been widely reported. In 2016, as Donald Trump ran for the White House, the  reported on a golf club outside New York City. The headline: How Trump’s $50m golf club became $1.4m when it came time to pay tax. Trump denies wrongdoing. Eric Trump initially refused to comply with the James investigation but was taken to court then questioned in 2020. James has issued subpoenas to Donald Trump Jr and Ivanka Trump. They have refused to comply. The family has sued, alleging the investigation is politically motivated – a delaying tactic the New York Times said “Mr Trump has deployed in the past when faced with scrutiny by law enforcement and others”. As the Times put it, “there is no constitutional protection against a prosecutor harboring a political bias”. Experts believe the Trump suit will not succeed. Eric Trump’s remark about Russia raised eyebrows. He is reported to have told a golf writer, in 2014, that the Trump Organization did not “rely on American banks” because it had “all the funding we need out of Russia”. He denies the remark.“We are grateful for the opportunity to meet with the President to express our deep concerns for the state of our democracy, and convey that his visit cannot be a mere formality. We see his speech as a critical first step in a series of actions to move voting rights legislation forward,” King said in a statement. “We also support the Georgia groups who have decided not to attend the President’s speech today — they’re frustrated after a year of inaction and we are too. We’re in communication with them and stand in solidarity to ensure voting rights get done.” While in Atlanta, Biden will lay a wreath at the crypt of Dr King and visit the church where he was once a pastor.  King noted in his statement, “We are hopeful that after tomorrow’s trip to our home state, the President will honor my father’s legacy by traveling back to Washington and using every political chip he has to ensure the filibuster doesn’t obstruct the right to vote for Black and Brown Americans.”The group had warned the president and vice-president that they needed to announce a specific plan to get national voting rights legislation passed or risk their high-profile trip to Atlanta being dismissed as “a waste of time”. On Monday evening, the coalition of activist groups – Black Voters Matter, Galeo Impact Fund, New Georgia Project Action Fund, Asian American Advocacy Fund, Atlanta-North Georgia Labor Council – along with James Woodall, the Georgia NAACP president, announced that “we will not be attending” when Biden and Harris speak. “Instead of giving a speech tomorrow, the US Senate should be voting tomorrow. What we need now, rather than a visit from the president, vice-president and legislators is for the White House and Senate to remain in DC and act immediately to pass federal legislation to protect our freedom to vote,” the groups said in joint statement. Joe Biden will travel to Atlanta, Georgia, today to call on Congress to immediately pass national voting rights legislation, which has stalled in the Senate due to Republican filibustering. “The next few days, when these bills come to a vote, will mark a turning point in this nation. Will we choose democracy over autocracy, light over shadow, justice over injustice?” Biden is expected to say.  “I know where I stand. I will not yield. I will not flinch. I will defend your right to vote and our democracy against all enemies foreign and domestic. And so the question is where will the institution of United States Senate stand?”  Of course, the key question is whether Democrats will be able to amend the filibuster to lower the 60-vote threshold needed to pass voting rights bills.  As of now, it remains unclear whether centrists Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema would support changes to the filibuster, and majority leader Chuck Schumer needs all 50 Democratic senators on board in order to move forward. Regarding what Biden will say on the filibuster, a White House official said, “After the GOP’s support for state attempts to undermine the rule of law based on simple majority votes around the country, he supports – as an institutionalist – changing the Senate rules to ensure it can work again and be restored and this basic right is defended.” The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c68594c85da8d094a61a3e0c74b0e522c4a5c70/151_235_5321_3193/master/5321.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=c610bceb1be17949ccc60be347d41be7","title":"covid news live pfizer says omicron specific vaccine could be available by march mexico president tests positive again","story":"The previous record of 332,252 daily new cases was set on 5 January and since then France has had two more days of more than 300,000 new cases over 24 hours as the highly contagious Omicron has become the dominant variant. The seven-day moving average of new cases rose to nearly 270,000 on Monday. By mid-January, the French government hopes to introduce a vaccine pass that will make vaccination mandatory for anyone wanting to go to restaurants or attend indoor events. Until now, proof of vaccination or a recent negative test were sufficient.Speaking at a televised meeting of the government’s coronavirus task force, Anna Popova, a top consumer health official, said Russia had so far recorded 305 cases of Omicron across 13 of its regions. “The risk of a very intense rise in (cases) of the disease is real,” she said. Omicron has pushed case figures to record highs in parts of western Europe and the United States, while cases in Russia have generally been declining from a peak of 41,335 registered in early November. Officials said they now feared the trend could rapidly reverse and Popova warned that daily infections could hit “six figures” if proper sanitary measures were not observed. Moscow’s Mayor Sergei Sobyanin told Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin at the televised meeting that the capital, which has a population of 12.7 million, was already seeing a significant increase in Omicron cases. He said special measures would be taken to tackle the rise in cases, without elaborating. “It’s necessary to mobilise more hospital beds, to mobilise the health system,” Sobyanin said. The Kremlin has frequently expressed frustration at the slow uptake of the domestically-made Sputnik V vaccine against COVID-19, with many citing distrust of the authorities and fear of new medical products.In its half-yearly forecasts, the Washington DC-based Bank said it expected a “pronounced slowdown” in growth in the next two years, with the less well-off parts of the world especially hard hit. David Malpass, the World Bank’s president, called for action to reduce the debts of poor countries and said he was “very worried” about the permanent scarring of development caused by the pandemic.

Measures vary and observers point out that many home tests are not officially logged. But NBC News reported at least 1,343,167 new infections.

She said she feared returning to school was not safe and called for local authorities to implement strict quarantines at schools, in which one pupil’s Covid infection would result in quarantine for the entire exposed class. But Taina Isosomppi, Helsinki’s chief epidemiologist, told Reuters the capital region’s municipalities were not going to follow the minister’s advice. Isosomppi said: Last week, Isosomppi and nine other leading Finnish infection specialists published an open letter against a plan proposed by Kiuru’s ministry to reintroduce school closures and going back to remote learning.The previous record of 332,252 daily new cases was set on 5 January and since then France has had two more days of more than 300,000 new cases over 24 hours as the highly contagious Omicron has become the dominant variant.

The sites are in Claremont, Manchester, Nashua and Newington. The findings re-emphasise the importance of short-range Covid transmission, with physical distancing and mask-wearing likely to be the most effective means of preventing infection. Ventilation, though still worthwhile, is likely to have a lesser impact. “People have been focused on poorly ventilated spaces and thinking about airborne transmission over metres or across a room. I’m not saying that doesn’t happen, but I think still, the greatest risk of exposure is when you’re close to someone,” said Prof Jonathan Reid, director of the University of Bristol’s Aerosol Research Centre and the study’s lead author.

The prime minister, Magdalena Andersson, said: “The situation has deteriorated, without doubt. The level of infections in Sweden is at a historically high level.” The rise in cases means Sweden’s new cases have doubled in five days.

Social media posts have appeared to make clear that Djokovic attended events in Belgrade and Marbella during the period in question. Djokovic has reportedly claimed that Tennis Australia filled in the form on his behalf. Djokovic took part in a Davis cup tournament in Madrid in early December.

But those in home isolation can take free online yoga classes, with Delhi’s chief minister, Arvind Kejriwal, saying that it would help patients “boost their immunity and attain mental and spiritual peace”. India’s capital registered 17 deaths each on Saturday and Sunday, the biggest single-day toll in more than 200 days. Every fourth person tested is coming back positive. Nationally, India recorded almost 170,000 new cases on Monday, almost half the daily number recorded during the surge of last April and May. Deaths remain a fraction of what they were but are rising. Meanwhile, the Indian Council of Medical Research, the government’s apex scientific body, on Monday tweaked its mandatory testing guidelines to ease the strain on the testing infrastructure. Healthy, asymptomatic contacts of confirmed coronavirus patients no longer require mandatory testing. Experts say that India is better prepared to deal with the latest coronavirus wave, driven by the Omicron variant, than last year. The country has now administered more than 1.5bn vaccine shots and recently opened the programme to teenagers. It has also begun giving boosters to vulnerable groups.The additional doses of sotrovimab would be supplied to the US in the first quarter of 2022, the companies said, taking the tally of doses secured by nations worldwide to roughly 1.7m. In November, the US government signed contracts worth about $1bn for an unknown number of doses of the treatment, after saying it would control the distribution of sotrovimab. Sotrovimab, given via an infusion, belongs to a class of medicines called monoclonal antibodies, which are lab-generated compounds that mimic the body’s natural defences. Tests have indicated that it works against the fast-spreading Omicron variant. Scientists and governments are scrambling to bolster defences against Omicron with testing, shots and therapies, as the variant threatens to become dominant globally by evading protection offered by current vaccines and drugs.

We are calling on the Minister of Education to take students’ voices into account and revise the decision about State exams for 2022.”Jack McGinn, ISSU education officer, acknowledged concerns that some students in this Leaving Cert cohort have not completed a Junior Cert, as junior-cycle data has been used for standardisation of predicted grades over the past two years.“However,” he said, “in light of the circumstances, we must put students first as it is their future that will be impacted.”The union is surveying students on the matter, with provisional results showing a clear favour towards a hybrid model, which is a choice between predicted grades or sitting the exams.The statement is a significant development on a building issue, with Labour and Sinn Féin having already called for the reintroduction of the hybrid model.Paul Crone, director of the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, said there needs to be something additional to this year’s exams to account for the Covid disruption.“We don’t know exactly what that should look like, or what’s possible, but what we’re saying is we should put students first,” he said.‘Intensely unfair’Deputy president of NUI Galway Prof Pól Ó Dochartaigh has said, however, that the hybrid Leaving Cert system created inequalities and he was in favour of students sitting traditional exams this year.While he understood the pressures facing Leaving Cert students and sympathised with them, he said accredited grades had resulted in inflation, which pushed up points for courses.Speaking on RTÉ radio’s Morning Ireland, Prof Ó Dochartaigh said that six times as many students had achieved 600 points last year than in the previous two years, which had led to a lottery for the final places in university.It was “intensely unfair” if some students received the results by putting themselves through the challenge of sitting the exam, but lost out because someone else’s teacher said they were very good, he added.“I think what is deeply problematic is the idea that one student gets the same number of points as another student on the basis of two very different methodologies.”An attempt should be made now to return to some sort of pre-2020 normality and the years 2020 and 2021 should be regarded as exceptional years because the alternative to that was to tell those who did the Leaving Cert prior to the pandemic that they would be permanently disadvantaged, Prof Ó Dochartaigh said.He added that he was not opposed to reform of the Leaving Cert system, but that reform should be on the basis that the experience was the same for everyone.\u0026nbsp‘No justification’The Teachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) and the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland (ASTI) have both said they will only support the traditional, externally-assessed exams.On Monday, TUI said there was “no justification” to offer students additional options as schools have remained open throughout this academic year.The ASTI, meanwhile, said speculation on the use of previous one-off grading processes during the pandemic is “unhelpful”.The Department of Education said it is “ aware of the disruption” experienced by students who are due to take their Leaving Certificate examinations in 2022.“These are challenging times for all of society and it is acknowledged that the impact of the Omicron virus means that some students and teachers cannot currently attend school,” a spokesman added.However, the Department said the adjustments to the assessment arrangements for the 2022 Leaving Cert – including increased choice – were designed to take account of the disruption to learning last year, “as well as providing for some possible further disruption in 202122”.“The Department will continue to engage with all partners in education on all matters relating to Leaving Certificate 2022,” it added."},{"url":null,"title":"what alternative options are there for the leaving cert","story":"Students, school leaders  and Opposition parties are now united in their opposition to pressing ahead with the exams as planned. Photograph: Dara Mac Donaill In April 2020 Leo Varadkar insisted the Leaving Cert would go ahead “by hook or by crook”. It didn’t, of course.In early 2021, Minister for Education Norma Foley said it was her “firm intention” to press ahead with traditional exams. She, too, reversed her position.In both cases there was a crucial moment which convinced the Government to change tack: the intervention of students.So, the announcement by the Irish Second Level Students Unions (ISSU) on Tuesday that the State exams “cannot go ahead as planned” in 2022 is highly significant.In the past, talk of “student voice” was mostly tokenism and student representatives didn’t carry much weight.This has changed dramatically thanks to a highly organised ISSU and the considerable power of social media.Students, the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals and Opposition parties are now united in pressing ahead with the exams as planned.A poll of an estimated 30,000 students – to be published next week by the ISSU – will likely add to pressure for change.Teachers’ unions, Department of Education officials and some Government ministers, meanwhile, want exams to go ahead as planned and argue that the adjustments made will ensure there is fairness for students.Voicing opposition to the exams, however, is the easy bit: a more difficult question is what are the alternatives?The option of re-running last year’s system of giving students a choice between written exams and teacher-assessed grades looks to be highly difficult, if not impossible.This is because thousands of this year’s Leaving Cert students who skipped transition year did not sit Junior Cycle exams.These results were crucial to the standardisation process which helped ensure fairness and consistency in results in recent years.Any attempt to estimate these students’ results by an algorithm, based on a school’s historical performance, would likely lead to accusations of “school profiling” and end up mired in controversy.This, realistically, leaves policy-makers with just two broad options:Option one: Additional choice in exam papersUnder current plans, students sitting the 2022 State exams will have more choice on their exam papers to account for the impact of the pandemic on education over the past two years.Existing plans also provide for two sets of Leaving Cert exams to be held during the summer to cater for those who are sick with Covid-19 or are in isolation.The planned adjustments to the exams are fairly modest in some papers, so further changes could be factored in to account for added disruption.Marking schemes could also be adjusted in some cases, such as giving greater weight to project work, etc.Significantly, students and principals and have not specifically called for a return to last year’s “hybrid option” of a choice between accredited grades and exams. In theory, then, such a move could be enough to get them on board.It would also avoid teachers having to assess their own students, which unions are fiercely opposed to.The fact that the summer written exams are being drawn up around now and likely to be printed soon means the clock is ticking fast. For now, it seems the most likely option.Option two: Teacher-assessed grades – with no standardisationWhile it would be difficult, if not impossible, to standardise teacher-assessed grades due to the absence of Junior Cycle results, there is another option: drop standardisation altogether.This is what happened in the UK last year following uproar over the extent to which students were downgraded using an algorithm.Teachers in the UK determined grades using mock exams, course work, essays and in-class tests without any resorting to any standardisation.Exam boards provided teachers with optional assessment questions for students to answer to help schools decide which grades to award.The downside is it that it would almost certainly send grades soaring to levels even higher than last year.Last year, for example, some students with maximum points, incredibly, did not gain access to their first choice and were rejected on random selection.The absence of standardised assessments would also lead to unfairness in the allocation of inflated grades across inidual schools, with some being more generous than others.Such a move would also attract opposition from teachers’ unions, who argue that they should not have to assess students for the purpose of State exams -- though they have agreed to do over the past two years. All these downsides mean, for now, this is less likely as an option."},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: The small tortoiseshell can become confused by central heatingStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"up to 500 000 likely infected with covid 19 last week says dr tony holohan","story":"The 14-day incidence last week hit its highest level in the pandemic, at 4,450 cases per 100,000 people, but Tony Holohan’s estimate is even higher at it takes account of testing constraints and undetected infections. Photograph: T NarayanBloombergUp to 500,000 Irish people were likely to have been infected with Covid-19 last week, according to Dr Tony HolohanThe likely prevalence of active infection was 5.7-9.6 per cent, equivalent to between one in 10 and one in 20 of the population, the chief medical officer has told Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly.The 14-day incidence last week hit its highest level in the pandemic, at 4,450 cases per 100,000 people, but Dr Holohan’s estimate is even higher at it takes account of testing constraints and undetected infections.Covid-19 cases in hospital are growing at about 7 per cent per day, Dr Holohan says in a letter sent to Mr Donnelly on January 6th.Incidence is high across all age groups and is higher than at any time in the pandemic in all but the oldest age groups, he says. Test positivity has also increased in those aged 65 years and older in recent weeks.“Medical grade and respirator masks, if properly worn, offer greater protection than cloth masks anyone who wishes to wear a medical grade or respirator mask instead of a cloth mask should do so, so long as whichever mask they choose is well-fitting and worn properly.”People who are over 60 or are medically vulnerable, who are currently advised to wear a medical mask in confined spaces, “may prefer to wear a respirator mask,” Nphet now advises.Officials also say “ideally” a respirator or medical-grade mask, and not a cloth mask, should be worn by anyone: with a confirmed diagnosis during their infectious period with symptoms who is a household contact of a confirmed case or who is visiting a healthcare setting or visiting those who are vulnerable to Covid-19.Dr Holohan says Nphet will prepare a report before its next meeting (next week) that will allow for a better understanding of the severity of Omicron, the impact of vaccination and boosters and other “important measures” of the impact of Covid-19 on the health system.“While the current situation is dynamic and there are still a number of important uncertainties, we have the benefit of a year’s data on Covid-19 vaccines, and it is timely to reassess our strategic priorities for Covid-19 immunisation in the near and medium term.”Test and trace capacityAccording to the letter, the test and trace system is now operating at surge capacity and under “severe pressure”. However, the number of deaths and ICU admissions linked to Covid-19 remains stable.Dr Holohan says the recent increase in incidence and hospitalisation has not “as yet” translated into increased critical care admissions or deaths. Potential contributory factors including the age profile of recent cases, the protection conferred by immunity from vaccines and infection and the “lower intrinsic virulence” of Omicron compared with previous variants.The number of hospital-acquired infections continues to be of concern, according to Dr Holohan, with 36 recorded in the week to December 26th last.There has been a significant increase in confirmed cases among hospital staff 704 in the week to December 26th.Some 80.5 per cent of reported antigen test results are confirmed through PCR testing.In early January 96 per cent of new cases were due to the Omicron variant, according to the letter, and 718 cases of Omicron have been confirmed through whole genome sequencing.So far this winter, 37 flu cases have been notified, while notifications of RSV dropped by 75 per cent at the end of 2021.Dr Holohan says 49 per cent of those in hospital are fully vaccinated, as are 40 per cent of those in ICU.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"westmeath had highest rate of covid 19 over christmas period","story":"Covid-19 incidence rate highest in Westmeath, Clare and Kilkenny during Christmas.

The order was later lifted on December 21st.In its inspector’s report, the FSAI identified a significant amount of rodent droppings throughout the waste and food storage room, as well as the carcass of an unknown, animal.The inspector said the presence of rodents was a danger to public health, because they can transmit many harmful pathogens to foods and packaging through droppings and urine.CockroachesSeparately, a closure order was also issued to DFC Take Away on Dorset street, in Dublin city with the inspector finding cockroaches and shortcomings in terms of hygiene and cleanliness.In a letter to the business, the inspector said there were live cockroaches found in a cockroach bait trap in the premises, which has been a “persistent issue and concern” and pest control procedures were “not robust”. The closure order was issued on December 10th, and lifted four days later.In total, the authority issued 59 enforcement orders on food businesses for breaches of food safety legislation last year, an increase of 40 per cent compared to the previous year largely due to temporary lockdown closures of many businesses in 2020.

Photograph: Andrew DownesPA Wire What did we learn from Day One of the Great Golfgate Trial?We found out that lawyers – if the legal heavyweights who turned up in force for a district court case in Galway are anything to go by – have a rather sniffy attitude to golf. Not quite their cup of tee.And that the Oireachtas Golf Society was a hitherto unrecognised major force in Irish political history until it hit the headlines last year due to the “Golfgate” furore.We learned that the size of a gap in a partition is a moveable feast. It certainly was moveable at the particular feast under the spotlight in Judge Mary Fahy’s courtroom on Thursday.We discovered that the annual President’s Prize dinner was not a “frivolous” event in 2020 and that the traditional presentation at the 19th hole after a convivial day on the links was anything but “a frolic”.That this event was, in fact, “poignant”. This is because it was held in honour of a politician who was behind the much-underestimated Golfing Revival Era in Irish politics 50 years ago. The late Mark Killilea was a driving force in the resurrection of the Oireachtas Golf Society, which had fizzled out after it was founded by a TD called Major Somethingorother in 1929.We heard that the then captain of the guard in Leinster House, an enthusiastic member of the society, had two breakfasts and one evening meal in the hotel which is now at the centre of this court case. And that a member of the Seanad and his wife left the dinner before the formalities commenced because “we’re not dessert people”.And that guidelines issued with the “imprimatur of the State” and bearing the harp of Rialtas na hÉireann on printed communications may, or may not be, worthless.We also learned on the opening day of the trial of politicians Noel Grealish and Donie Cassidy and hotel bosses John and James Sweeney for allegedly contravening the Covid emergency health act by holding a dinner indoors for over 50 people, that all of the witnesses called by the prosecution had nothing but praise for how the defendants managed the event.Bending the rulesThe story of the Oireachtas Golf Society’s now-infamous dinner hit the headlines late in 2020. In the early days of the pandemic, claims that politicians had been bending the strict rules painfully and dutifully observed by wider society caused uproar. But the lawyers acting for Grealish and Cassidy set out from the start to show how their clients acted with the utmost propriety at all times and their actions have been gravely misunderstood by the public.Which brings us back to something else learned on Thursday: when push comes to shove, it’s all the media’s fault. In this case, according to Donie Cassidy’s lawyer Colm Smyth SC, for getting involved and then “public hysteria was whipped up and hysteria was whipped up”.This, he said, led to “a lot of very good people” having “to resign from their positions”.Near the end of the first day, Martin Brett, a Fine Gael councillor from Kilkenny who was at the golf outing and dinner in Connemara, said he didn’t even know how many people were at the function until he read it in the paper.“Don’t believe what you read in the newspapers and the journal,” said Eoghan Cole BL, for the State.Barrister Cole was up against it. A lone ranger on the DPP’s side against the heavy guns hired by the defendants. The place was coming down with junior and senior counsel and instructing solicitors.Smyth, for Donie Cassidy, made the most running on day one, with bracing interventions from Senator Michael McDowell SC (for former PD colleague and now independent TD Noel Grealish) and the country’s leading libation lawyers Constance Cassidy and Eddie Walsh (for James and John Sweeney, respectively).Bewildering meanderThere isn’t much you can tell those two about the licensing laws. When Constance, in the midst of a bewildering meander through statutory instruments and hospitality regulations, talked about “the consumption of intoxicating liquor”, you knew it wasn’t the first time she said those words.Among the ranks of the BLs was junior counsel Willie Penrose, the former Labour TD. He is part of the Cassidy squad.As for the journalists sent to cover this trial of the half-century (50 years a-fourballing, and all that), there was no room in the court building for them. Two were allowed inside to hear the proceedings, the rest given a video link to download and hope for the best.Enter the hero of the hour: Fergal McGrath, brother of former TD Finian, who runs the Town Hall Theatre opposite the courthouse. Fergal made a room available to the hacks (which is more than the Courts Service could manage, despite this being a case of national interest which was flagged months ago).Business for Fergal has been hugely impacted by Covid, but he has a tasty line-up of events coming in the new year. The panto, sadly, had to be cancelled so all the kiddies in Galway missed out on the fairy godmother saying: “You shall go to the (golf) ball!”After a morning spent mostly in legal discussion, Colm Smyth got round to telling us of Donie Cassidy. A man who has never been before the courts in his life, has had a distinguished political career and is the owner of four hotels in Dublin, and that’s just for starters. “A lawmaker, not a lawbreaker.”Donie, in Colm’s words, sounded like Santa. Before the event, “he checked the regulations. He checked the guidelines. He consulted with people.” Probably to make sure nobody would be naughty and everyone would be nice.Former TD and senator Cassidy was president of the society. His co-defendant, TD Noel Grealish, was captain on the night.No hand, act or putterMichael McDowell said this was very important because his client’s position is that president Cassidy organised the do as it was his dinner. Noel Grealish, as captain, had some involvement in organising the first day of golf but “I just want to be 100 per cent clear” he had no hand, act or putter in organising the shindig on the second night.Eddie and Constance, meanwhile, said that the “company” as opposed to the two Mr Sweeneys should have been charged.Then Colm Smyth started talking about “potentially an unsavoury aspect” to the prosecution, without explaining entirely what he meant.“Substantiate the unsavouryness,” challenged Eoghan Cole, for the State.The witnesses so far are all people who attended the golf dinner.They were blown away by the Covid prevention measures taken by management.The mainly retired minor politicians who attended this dinner were “exceptionally impressed”. But then, they don’t get out as much as they used to. There would be no “intermingling” at this hooley in Connemara.One of the guests recalled the rigid attention to the pandemic prevention rules on the night.“A waiter said to me: table service only. You don’t move unless you go to the toilet.”One of the lawyers pointed approvingly to “the liberality of sanitisers and so on”.There was some discussion as to whether they were separated by a “partition” or “a solid wall” but there was a definite ision until the gap appeared at prize-giving.It was seven to eight feet on either side of a pillar, according to one witness, and “probably the width of a person”, according to another.But did two separate rooms of people attending the dinner constitute a single event or multiple events? It’s a bit like St Patrick and the shamrock – three leaves on the one stem. St Donie and the dinner – two rooms on the one feed.Judge Fahy will have to decide.She admitted she isn’t much into golf, with the course in Ballyconneely more “the Dublin fours”. Michael McDowell and Eddie Cassidy were similarly unmoved by the joys of the game.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"scotland to lift covid restriction on large outdoor events from monday","story":"Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon said she hoped to lift other Covid related restrictions in the coming weeks.

It is even more unusual to see a two-year period with mortality so far above the preceding five-year average. We have to go back eighty years to 1940-41 to find such an extreme period on this measure.”Although The Great Depression saw a rise in mortality of about 10 per cent in 1929, rates had dropped back by 1930, with the average of the two years only being two per cent above the prior five-year average.The figures are estimates and the final data will be crunched when the Office for National Statistics (ONS) releases final figures on Tuesday.Overall, deaths in 2021 were just one per cent higher than the 10-year average, but experts said that a drop in mortality would be expected over time, so even a small rise was worrying.Figures show that before 2020, no year has had higher mortality rates than the 10-year average since 1963.In 2021, more deaths were registered in England and Wales than in any year since the Eighties, apart from 2020.There are likely to be between 585,000 and 590,000 deaths registered in England and Wales in 2021. In contrast, 2020 was the first year since 1918 to see more than 600,000 deaths.More from NewsIt\u0026#39s time to bust the myth that Nicola Sturgeon has had a \u0026#34good pandemic\u0026#34Illegitimate Belgian princess \u0026#39cried over King Albert II sneers\u0026#39 when she asked for recognitionCovid latest news: Nicola Sturgeon to extend Scotland\u0026#39s vaccine passport rulesBoris Johnson will not resign, says minister as pressure grows over Downing Street party emailOn Covid deaths, Britain is no outlierMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"giant deep surfaces midlands one britains greatest ever prehistoric","story":"Scientists are celebrating one of the “greatest finds” in British palaeontological history after the skeleton of a 180 million-year-old sea dragon was discovered in Rutland.Measuring 10 metres in length with a skull weighing approximately one tonne, the ichthyosaur is the largest and most complete fossil of any marine reptile found in Britain.The discovery was made by Joe Davis, an employee of the Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust, during a routine draining of a lagoon island at Rutland Water in February 2021.Ichthyosaurs were marine reptiles that lived in Britain 250 million years ago. They went extinct 90 million years ago.The animal was characterised by its large teeth and eyes, and ranged in size from one to more than 25 metres. It was first identified in the 19th century by the palaeontologist Mary Anning.Dr Dean Lomax, a palaeontologist who has studied the species, said: “Despite the many ichthyosaur fossils found in Britain, it is remarkable to think that the Rutland ichthyosaur is the largest skeleton ever found in the UK. It is a truly unprecedented discovery and one of the greatest finds in British palaeontological history.“Not only is it the largest ichthyosaur skeleton ever found in Britain, but it is also the most complete skeleton of a large prehistoric reptile ever discovered in the UK. And yes, that includes dinosaurs.”When they first spotted the remains poking out of some clay, team members at Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust were unsure about their origins and suggested that they could simply be pipes. After speaking to Rutland council, experts from the University of Leicester were called and the ichthyosaur skeleton was identified.The remains were dug out by a team of expert palaeontologists from around the UK in August and September. They worked in partnership with Anglian Water, Rutland County Council and the Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust. The skeleton was also surrounded by the remains of ammonites and belemnites, which may have been feasting on the animal\u0027s remains. Scientists said that the discovery could give them a better understanding of their ecosystems.Although two incomplete and much smaller ichthyosaurs were found during the initial construction of Rutland Water in the 1970s, experts said that it was unusual to find a specimen of this kind in the Midlands. Remains are usually found across the Jurassic and Yorkshire coast.“To put this find into context for the public in the world of British palaeontology, the discovery is like finding a complete Tyrannosaurus rex out in the Badlands of America, only this Jurassic giant was found in a nature reserve in Rutland, of all places. It is a truly unprecedented discovery and one of the greatest finds in British palaeontological history,” Dr Lomax said.Scientists are now securing funding to clean and repair the skeleton before it is put on display.Dr Mark Evans of the British Antarctic Survey said: “I’ve been studying the Jurassic fossil reptiles of Rutland and Leicestershire for over 20 years. When I first saw the initial exposure of the specimen with Joe Davis I could tell that it was the largest ichthyosaur known from either county. However, it was only after our exploratory dig that we realised that it was practically complete to the tip of the tail.”He added: “It’s a highly significant discovery both nationally and internationally but also of huge importance to the people of Rutland and the surrounding area.”Nigel Larkin, a specialist palaeontological conservator, said: “It’s not often you are responsible for safely lifting a very important but very fragile fossil weighing that much.“It is a responsibility, but I love a challenge. It was a very complex operation to uncover, record, and collect this important specimen safely.”The excavation of the remains will feature on BBC Two’s Digging For Britain on Tuesday at 8pm.More from NewsCovid latest news: Nicola Sturgeon to extend Scotland\u0026#39s vaccine passport rulesFrench mayors could scupper Emmanuel Macron rival Eric Zemmour\u0026#39s presidential bidIt\u0026#39s time to bust the myth that Nicola Sturgeon has had a \u0026#39good pandemic\u0026#39Illegitimate Belgian princess \u0026#39cried over King Albert II sneers\u0026#39 when she asked for recognitionBoris Johnson will not resign, says minister as pressure grows over Downing Street party emailMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"jurassic spark new generation dinosaur hunters uncovering britains","story":"It has been described as one of the greatest finds in British palaeontological history: the skeleton of a 180-million-year-old ichthyosaur, discovered in Rutland Water during the routine draining of a lagoon island last February, and dug out by a team of palaeontologists in August and September.Tomorrow night (Tuesday, Jan 11), the excavation of the remains of this 10-metre “sea dragon” will feature on BBC Two’s Digging for Britain, reminding the public of what lies beneath our small island: buried treasures, the unearthing of which can yield so many secrets about our prehistory. For although the surface area of Britain is modest, our geology is erse. The opportunities to find fossils from a range of different time periods are great.Good places to look are around the rocks of Surrey, Sussex and the Isle of Wight, which date from the early Cretaceous period and were deposited 120 to 140 million years ago by rivers and on flood plains. If it weren’t for the fact these areas are covered in houses and trees – and if our climate were somewhat warmer and drier – we’d no doubt be finding as many dinosaurs here as they do in the arid American state of Utah.Yet despite our damp climate and developed land, we live in a golden age of palaeontological discovery – and also of interest in prehistory, which, of course, is linked. The UK has a long historical association with fossil-hunting and palaeontology. The first dinosaur fossils that were recognised as such were found in this country: a collection of big teeth spotted in rocks by the side of a road in Sussex in 1822 by Mary Ann Mantell and her husband, Gideon. It was Richard Owen, a British scientist, who later coined the term “dinosauria”, meaning “terrible lizards”. The teeth were the first evidence of a dinosaur known as Iguanodon.There followed a 19th-century fossil-hunting craze in Britain among Victorian gentlemen naturalists. Its legacy is found in the Natural History Museum, where we have today a large dinosaur collection from countries including Canada and from southern Africa.Until the start of the Second World War, dinosaurs fascinated the British. Our interest seems to have waned after that, until the mid-1990s, when our interest in these primal and often terrifying beasts was reignited. I was 13 when Steven Spielberg’s blockbuster Jurassic Park was released in 1993. Although I knew I wanted to work with dinosaurs, my interest in the subject would have been regarded as niche for a girl in her early teens. The film made it more socially acceptable and mainstream. It made me less weird among my secondary school peers.Now that the Jurassic Park generation has come of age, we are seeing the results of those childhood passions in our universities. During the 15 years that I have worked in the field, there has been an explosion in academic study of vertebrate palaeontology. Several universities now offer undergraduate degrees in the subject, including the universities of Portsmouth, Bristol and Birmingham. While geology courses more often used to cater to students interested in entering, say, the oil or mining industries, today’s geology undergraduates are more interested in bioersity.Yet as in the case of the Rutland sea dragon, whose remains were found by Joe Davis, an employee of the Leicestershire and Rutland Wildlife Trust, many palaeontological finds are opportunistic – that is, not made by professionals. The UK today has a large community of amateur fossil-hunters, who are out there looking for fossils, sometimes on a daily basis. They visit the brick pits around Peterborough, or the cliffs of the Isle of Wight, particularly in winter when the storms roll in and the rocks become unstable and can collapse.There are no special techniques to fossil-finding. We just have to use an ancient tool: our eyes. But we have to know where to look.So what has this golden age of palaeontological discovery actually yielded? Quite a lot, really. Last year saw not only the unearthing of the Rutland sea dragon, but also a huge Jurassic seabed in a Cotswolds quarry, where colleagues have discovered a beautifully preserved haul of fossil sea urchins, starfish, sea lilies and feather stars.The remains of two dinosaurs that lived about 125 million years ago and were found on the Isle of Wight were identified in September and named Ceratosuchops inferodios – or “horned crocodile-faced hell heron” – and Riparovenator milnerae, a predator with a skull more than 3ft in length.Then in October, we identified Britain’s earliest known carnivorous dinosaur. Named Pendraig milnerae and roughly the size of a chicken, this creature had been found in Carmarthenshire in Wales in the 1950s and entered our collection in the 1960s. But it wasn’t until last year that, after comparison with better known specimens from around the world, we discovered it was new and deserved to be recognised as a type of dinosaur in its own right.In November, other fossils found on the Isle of Wight were identified as another new species, called Brighstoneus simmondsi. The defining characteristic of this eight-metre long herbivore was its bulbous nose.Behind the Isle of Wight finds was a retired GP called Jeremy Lockwood, who has spent much of the pandemic hunting for fossils on the beach and is studying part-time for a PhD at the University of Portsmouth and the Natural History Museum. He may not be the only one who has spent these past two years in fruitful palaeontological employ. With a boom in “staycations” – including on the Jurassic coast of southern England – it’s possible there has been something of a pandemic boom in dinosaur hunting. And, from our point of view, the more eyes on the ground the better. The more discoveries by amateurs this heightened interest turns up, the more detailed a picture we can build of our prehistory.So far we have barely scratched the surface. From the start of the Jurassic period to the end of the Cretaceous is a time of 140 million years. During this, everything that lived on land and was larger than a metre in size was a dinosaur. So that is 140 million years of animals evolving, dying and going extinct. Most of their remains will not have become fossils. Many of those that did are yet to be discovered, as vast portions of the world remain very little studied. In Africa, South America and parts of central Asia, prehistory is underexplored and there remain huge geographic areas where we don’t really know what was living there. Our existing knowledge only covers a fraction of a per cent of what once roamed our planet, and of what is still on it, sitting beneath the surface waiting to be found. With every new discovery, we feel a thrill of excitement – and, each time it happens, we learn a little more.Dr Susannah Maidment is a principal researcher in Earth Sciences at the Natural History Museum.

It also helps protect those who face serious financial difficulties to clear up problems for which they were not responsible. The cladding scandal that arose out of the Grenfell Tower fire disaster in 2017 is a case in point. Thousands of leaseholders living in high and medium-rise buildings were left in fear for their safety and in despair for their financial wellbeing. Until the cladding is removed, many of their homes are at risk and unsellable.These leaseholders face huge bills through no fault of their own. Under an earlier attempt to address this unfairness, no one living in a high-rise block would have to pay for the removal and replacement of cladding, while leaseholders in lower-rise buildings were to be offered low-interest loans capped at £50 a month. Michael Gove, who assumed the housing brief last year, has taken a different approach. He says the costs should fall much more heavily on the construction industry — a policy shift that saw £1 billion wiped off property company shares yesterday.He has given builders just a few weeks to come up with a scheme to contribute £4 billion to a fund that will repair unsafe buildings between 11 and 18 metres high (the Government has already committed £5  billion of public money to remove cladding from taller buildings, backed by an industry levy). Mr Gove threatened them with a new tax if they failed to comply.It should not be necessary to use such a heavy-handed approach. The construction industry has done well in recent years, benefiting from taxpayer-subsidised help to buy schemes, and should be prepared to reach an accommodation to help the cladding group. Mr Gove is principally after those who mis-sold cladding but since many have gone out of business, this might be impossible to do other than through a further levy on the entire industry.There are obvious holes in the plan, including what happens to people living in buildings under 11 metres and who pays for other non-cladding measures now being demanded by lenders, such as fire breaks and insulation. Mr Gove was right to say using the tax system was “a blunt instrument”. But if the builders won’t recognise their responsibilities, he may have no option.More from NewsCatholic church condemns far-Right funeral with coffin draped in Nazi flagCovid latest news: Nicola Sturgeon to extend Scotland\u0026#39s vaccine passport rulesFrench mayors set to scupper Emmanuel Macron rival Eric Zemmour\u0026#39s presidential bidIt\u0026#39s time to bust the myth that Nicola Sturgeon has had a \u0026#39good pandemic\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"living virus means living unvaccinated","story":"No one much likes Novak Djokovic. Even when he wins, he loses, with crowds loudly willing his opponent on. His astonishing resilience on court is dismissed as robotic, his superhuman fitness a form of sneering at more frail, fallible mortals.That public antipathy may initially have blinded the world to the grotesque treatment he endured in Australia. One thing is certain, it would never have happened to Roger Federer. But there is something deeply chilling about the sight of a man deemed a political threat, on his own, being spirited away by the heavies at an airport. It is the kind of thing that happens to Alexei Navalny flying into Moscow, not the world No 1 tennis player arriving to defend his title in a liberal democracy.Yet his youth and fitness are a reminder of why some vaccine strategies have gone off the rails, not just in Australia, but in Europe too. For the evidence suggests that whether it is a young tennis player, or young drinkers out trying to enjoy themselves, the wrong people are being targeted by harsh vaccine restrictions around the world.Djokovic challenges a draconian Covid strategy down under that has governed life for countless months. It is, as Dominic Wilkinson, professor of medical ethics at the University of Oxford, points out, a strategy founded in the nation’s isolation, which has allowed it to pretend it can cut itself off from the pandemic. But as Wilkinson, himself half-English and half-Australian, also notes: “The difficulty was always going to be in sustaining that.”Like every other government, the Australian authorities are weighing up how to get back to normal life. Given we cannot eliminate the disease, the path to attaining this, says Wilkinson, is obvious: ensure enough people have enough immunity to prevent Covid posing a serious threat. “The question is how do you get from here to there?” The answer is building populations’ resistance through either vaccination or “natural immunity” – catching Covid and fighting it off. Or both. Djokovic argues that, having recently recovered from Covid, he benefits from natural immunity. But in a country where Covid has until recently been rare, and which has still recorded less than a million cases, compared to 14.5 million in the UK, natural immunity is dismissed. Vaccination is king.Even in the UK, where so many of us have caught the disease, this “natural immunity” defence is still officially considered suspect. Hence the Health Secretary Sajid Javid’s shock on being told last week by Steve James, an ICU consultant at Kings College Hospital, that James had not yet been vaccinated and did not want to be, because “the science is not strong enough”.It is easy to protest, as Dr Peter English, a former consultant in communicable disease control, did yesterday, that healthcare workers refusing vaccines are “irresponsible” because they risk both transmitting the disease to vulnerable patients and, potentially, falling ill and taking up an NHS bed themselves.Yet, on the risk of infection, as Dr Julian Tang, clinical virologist, respiratory sciences, at the University of Leicester, has pointed out, “natural infection with viruses generally provides longer lasting and broader immune protection, compared to vaccination”.And, on transmission, Javid’s own Department of Health has just released a study showing that while vaccines cut transmission for the original Covid strain, new strains see both vaccinated and unvaccinated people transmitting the virus at similar rates.This is, as Wilkinson is at pains to point out, not to suggest that immunity acquired from catching Covid is somehow preferable to getting a jab. The dangers of contracting Covid are far greater than any potential vaccine side effects. “I think there are strong reasons to have a vaccine for health professionals,” he says. “The question is whether it’s ethically justified to force people to have a vaccine if they have had a confirmed infection… because there is reasonable evidence that those who have had the vaccine and those who have had an infection have similar protection from infection and risk of passing on the virus.”Across the Atlantic, there are similar doubts. “If you listen to the language of our public health officials, they talk about the vaccinated and the unvaccinated,” Marty Makary, professor of health policy and management at Johns Hopkins University told the British Medical Journal last autumn, in an article reviewing a host of studies that described similar protection from vaccine and infection-led immunity. “If we want to be scientific, we should talk about the immune and the non-immune.”It is a distinction certain to become ever more stark, ever more fraught, because of the increasing use of vaccine mandates around the world by governments, schools and employers – Italy is even banning the unvaccinated from ski lifts. Ignoring infection history also throws broader government vaccination policy, beyond vaccine mandates, into doubt, in the UK as much as in Australia.Here, young people have been targeted with measures requiring them to show proof of vaccination to enter nightclubs. As many in the industry predicted, it appears to be having little effect. Latest ONS figures show the highest rates of infection among young adults. Indeed, a year into the vaccination campaign, it is beginning to become clear who is most in need of jabs and boosters. And the answer is the same as at the start of the pandemic. Then policy was framed as if the virus did not discriminate. It soon became clear this was not true. The elderly and those with co-morbidities were very much more at risk. The same people, it seems clear, should be the focus of vaccination campaigns.Indeed, demonising the unvaccinated, notably the young and fit, is almost certainly counter-productive. In the first six months of last year, 67 per cent of the population received at least their first jab. Since then, however, only another 10 per cent have come forward, leaving almost a quarter entirely unjabbed. Discounting children under 12, not yet eligible for a vaccine, that leaves up to six million Britons unjabbed. Many are teenagers and young adults, up to a third of whom are not fully vaccinated.But in some areas, particularly in London, over a quarter of over-60s are not double jabbed. Ethnic minorities suffer disproportionately. In the latest ONS figures, the lowest third-dose and booster vaccination coverage was among Pakistani (42.2 per cent), black Caribbean (44.4 per cent) and black African (45.4 per cent) ethnic groups. Almost all white people aged 80 and above are fully jabbed, while only four out of five black people over 80 are, which a government report last month blamed for higher death rates among minorities.These are the groups that would most benefit from the protection of vaccines. Yet coercion is unlikely to change their minds. Indeed, it is a blunt tool. In the latest ONS survey, fewer than two in 10 of those hesitant to have a vaccine said needing one to work or go on holiday might make them change their mind. The most persuasive reason, for the slim minority willing to countenance it, was altruism – to protect others.These millions are not anti-vaxxers – militant, headline-hogging campaigners calling doctors and nurses administering jabs murderers. But they are damned by association, making many even more reluctant to come forward now. Some GPs, like Dr Azhar Farooqi, in Leicester, have realised a less confrontational approach is required. Having noticed that many of his highest-risk patients, particularly from poorer or ethnic minority backgrounds, were turning down the jab, he telephoned them personally for a reassuring chat. On the spot, 70 per cent changed their minds.It is the very opposite of the French president Emmanuel Macron’s decision to “p––– off” the unvaccinated, making it increasingly hard for them to live without it. Indeed, insisting people take vaccines to protect themselves is not just of questionable effectiveness, it is also morally wrong, says Wilkinson. “It’s a bad ethical reason, it’s a paternalistic reason, it says government knows better than you what to do with your own health.”More from NewsCovid latest news: Nicola Sturgeon to extend Scotland\u0026#39s vaccine passport rulesFrench mayors set to scupper Emmanuel Macron rival Eric Zemmour\u0026#39s presidential bidIt\u0026#39s time to bust the myth that Nicola Sturgeon has had a \u0026#39good pandemic\u0026#39King Albert II of Belgium \u0026#39reduced illegitimate daughter to tears with his sneering behaviour\u0026#39Boris Johnson will not resign, says minister as pressure grows over Downing Street party emailMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"roman dual carriageway market town unearthed hs2 dig","story":"A Roman “dual carriageway” has been unearthed by archaeologists along with the remains of an ancient British boom town.Excavation work for HS2 has uncovered the remains of a 26-acre settlement near Chipping Warden in Northamptonshire, which reveals signs of entrepreneurial town planning in Britain more than 1,700 years ago.Archaeologists have discovered a “dual carriageway” twice the side of an ordinary Roman road running through the site, likely laid to ease congestion for merchants and their carts cramming into what was a thriving trading town.Its oversized infrastructure shows the commercial importance of the site, which enjoyed a boom in the third century AD, experts have said, and finery from across the Roman Empire poured into the town before it went bust with the end of Roman rule.“We think the reason for that is to allow two streams of traffic to pass through this area. This would have been a very busy area at that time, and you can imagine people loading and unloading goods when they arrived here.”Jim McKeon, the Museum of London Archaeology project manager at the site, said building the road showed “clever town planning” by locals who exploited the settlement’s position near the River Cherwell and the Fosse Way Roman road.The well-connected town likely shipped livestock and agricultural goods towards London, and its newfound wealth from the third century is revealed by the luxuries coming the other way, including glass vessels, jewellery, and high-status pottery from Gaul.Hundreds of Roman coins have also been found by the 70 archaeologists working at the site, along with chemical compounds used to make ancient make-up, and ornate scale weights for weighing merchants’ wares.Shackles have also been found at the site, which may indicate slaves were traded in the area.The town plan, which helped the local economy, also segregated the settlement and archaeologists have found what they have termed a Roman “B-road”, leading traffic away from the residential area to the equivalent of an “industrial estate”.Mr McKeon said: “It has been well thought out. Just like today, you don’t want the smelly, heavy industry near where you live.”Excavations have found evidence of large fires, indicating the area may have been used to bake large quantities of bread, or as a foundry or pottery kiln. Experts have also unearthed evidence of a holding area for livestock.Both working areas are set apart from larger residences in the settlement, which may have been several stories, and indicate the newfound wealth of locals.Whilst the town appears to have enjoyed a boom period under Roman rule, estimated to have lasted from about 250AD to 350AD, the settlement appears to have suffered an economic bust following the end of Roman rule in the early fifth century.Mr McKeon said: “Once the Empire begins to recede, those trade links with Europe begin to disappear. There just aren’t the same opportunities.”Archaeological evidence suggests that the site went quickly out of use following this economic collapse, as the local population returned to the subsistence agriculture that predominated in the area before Roman rule.Mr McKeon believes that the site’s 10 metre-wide road may have been quickly covered and lost during this period, saying: “Just like today, if today you left a motorway unused, it wouldn’t take long before it would become covered by soil and vegetation.”The hidden road, made up of several layers of stone arranged in different sizes, would also have made the area impossible to plough for later farmers, and as a result the site has remained well-preservedThe Museum of London Archaeology team working along the HS2 rail line has found evidence of 30 Iron Age roundhouses and a road from the period before Romanisation and the village becoming a prominent trading hub. So far, only uncovered above five acres of the settlement, which geophysical surveys suggest could be 26 acres in size.More from NewsCovid latest news: Nicola Sturgeon to extend Scotland\u0026#39s vaccine passport rulesFrench mayors set to scupper Emmanuel Macron rival Eric Zemmour\u0026#39s presidential bidIt\u0026#39s time to bust the myth that Nicola Sturgeon has had a \u0026#39good pandemic\u0026#39Illegitimate Belgian princess \u0026#39cried over King Albert II sneers\u0026#39 when she asked for recognitionBoris Johnson will not resign, says minister as pressure grows over Downing Street party emailMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"three weeks tumultuous life covid","story":"It is a difficult thing for a journalist to do, but let me try to think back three weeks. Then, it was almost universally reported, Boris Johnson was tottering on his papier-mâché throne.His party had lost the North Shropshire by-election. He was mired in supposedly very shocking allegations about whether a party or a gathering had taken place in 10 Downing Street a year earlier, and there was some more stuff about his wallpaper. A hundred Conservative MPs had rebelled against his reimposition of some restrictions because of the omicron variant. Was his time running out, asked the BBC in its most hopeful tone of voice.Now it is reported that omicron is not killing people in any significant numbers. Even NHS chiefs, usually Eeyores, admit that it is not being overwhelmed. Ministers suggest that further restrictions are unlikely to be needed. Fresh revelations about No10 parties might revive the Boris on the brink headlines, but with rather less conviction. The explanation for these comical changes of political fortune is Covid-19 itself. Whenever people feel a setback in recovery, they turn against the Prime Minister. Whenever they feel renewed hope, they feel all right about him. It is pretty much as simple as that.Few seem to learn the lesson, which is that the disease is a classic example of Kipling’s famous test of “If you can meet with triumph and disaster And treat those two impostors just the same”. Anyone who has proclaimed social collapse and bubonic plague-like mortality has been proved wrong. So has anyone who has announced we have “licked the virus”.The most one can tentatively say about Boris’s handling of it all is that it went fairly badly at first and then went better after the vaccine. Britain has been neither disgraced nor exalted in the eyes of the world as a result. The Prime Minister deserves neither a speeded-up Knighthood of the Garter nor a P45.Only when the illness does more or less go quiet will people form a settled judgment. Then they will weigh the costs, of all kinds. Perhaps the test example will be energy prices. Will their enormous rises be excused on the grounds that the explosion in demand – and therefore price – is essentially a temporary Covid by-product? Or will voters question the underlying, much longer-term upward trend caused by the delusion that we face a “climate emergency” so severe that no cost incurred trying to prevent it is too great?On which last point, it might clarify minds if the Government could state baldly its policy on gas: it is that we must, at almost any cost, import it rather than produce it.Faced with the awkward fact that the intermittency of renewables absolutely requires fossil fuel back-up for the accurately foreseeable future, the Government tacitly recognises the need. Like the Pharisees in the Gospel, however, it worries more about taint to its own purity than doing what is actually good. So it cannot bear to give permission for fracking or assist more North Sea gas production, but does not mind being dependent on expensive supplies from foreign powers, some of which will exploit their power over us for hostile political ends.Their gas production, of course, will add more carbon dioxide to the planet, but “off the books” as far as Britain is concerned. Britain’s “consumption-based” emissions are much higher than our “production-based” ones and the gap between the two has been growing. This may be good for President Putin, but does nothing for the planet and nothing but harm to the British consumer’s pocket.Going through an old photograph album, I found a picture I had taken on my first visit to India, 40 years ago. It was of a plaque erected by the Indian government beside the British memorial in Delhi to those British and Indians (roughly 1,250) killed by the rebels in the Indian Mutiny of 1857. It reads: “The ‘enemy’ of the inscriptions on this monument were those who rose against colonial rule and fought bravely for national liberation.” The “heroism of these immortal martyrs” was thus commemorated on the 25th anniversary of Indian independence in 1972, it adds.In the light of recent events, I was interested by this early example of “retain and explain”. The words are quite fierce, but they are pinned on an adjoining wall rather than obscuring the original monument. Nothing is toppled or defaced. How much more dignified than that little mob in Bristol.Last week’s item about Desmond Tutu’s time as a curate in England has produced several charming responses from readers.One is a letter from “D M Tutu”, which appeared in Cranleigh parish magazine after he and his family had spent a month in a borrowed house in Horsham Road in that Surrey village in 1963: “We take back with us only the happiest of memories – of strangers stopping to give us a cheery ‘Hello’: of an old lady crossing the road to shake us by the hand to welcome us to her village: of transport generously put at our disposal: of friendly and helpful shopkeepers, who were not trying all the time to palm off dubious goods on unsuspecting visitors – I could go on, multiplying examples of your warm friendliness.”Another is a further example of Tutu’s amusement about skin colour differences: he loved it when someone unthinkingly described him as “tickled pink”.More from NewsCatholic church condemns far-Right funeral with coffin draped in Nazi flagCovid latest news: Nicola Sturgeon to extend Scotland\u0026#39s vaccine passport rulesFrench mayors set to scupper Emmanuel Macron rival Eric Zemmour\u0026#39s presidential bidIt\u0026#39s time to bust the myth that Nicola Sturgeon has had a \u0026#39good pandemic\u0026#39More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"downing street party email full","story":"Downing Street party email in full as Boris Johnson dodges questions about attendanceA leaked email has revealed that top Downing Street adviser Martin Reynolds proposed \"socially distanced drinks\" at No . in May .

Stories of alleged parties during lockdown and Boris Johnsonaposs attendance are currently being investigated by top civil servant Sue Gray, and now there are new questions for the PM to answer. The fresh allegation is based on a leaked email sent during lockdown by Boris Johnsonaposs Principal Private Secretary Martin Reynolds, which involves the proposal for socially distanced drinks and was sent to around to  No  staff. Former advisor Dominic Cummings claimed he and another special advisor protested that the event seemed to be against the rules and should not happen. In a post on his Substack newsletter, he wrote: We were ignored. I was ill and went home to bed early that afternoon but am told this event definitely happened. So far, the PM has refused to deny his attendance. So what did the email say and why is the PM in trouble  The leaked email  Witnesses have since estimated that between  to  people attended a gathering on May ,  and sources claimed the PM went along with his we Carrie, where there were tables with drinks, crisps, sausage rolls and picnic food. The gathering was advertised in an email, seen by ITV, which carried the subject line Socially Distanced Drinks! [OFFICIAL-SENSITIVE-No  ONLY].  Around  staff are believed to have been invited, including the PMaposs advisors, door staff and speechwriters. It read: Hi all, after what has been an incredibly busy period we thought it would be nice to make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No  garden this evening. Please join us from pm and bring your own booze! Why is Boris Johnson in trouble   An official inquiry is currently looking into claims of parties in lockdown in Downing Street and Whitehall. According to sources, the contents of the email mean Sue Gray will have to interview the PM himself in her investigation into parties. On the same day as the email, the Met Police released a video on strict guidance for those who wanted to leave the house. People were not allowed to mix with those outside their households.  Since the new allegations came to light, the Met released a statement stating they are in contact with Downing Street over alleged breaches. Previously, they have deemed reported instances in Whitehall as unworthy of investigation.A Met spokesperson said: The politan Police Service is aware of widespread reporting relating to alleged breaches of the Health Protection Regulations at Downing Street on  May  and is in contact with the Cabinet Office.Boris Johnson has also come under fire for hosting a Christmas quiz in No.  last year.Sue Grayaposs investigation  Several instances of alleged gatherings have been reported. In December, government adviser Allegra Stratton resigned after she was caught on camera joking with other advisers about a Christmas gathering that had involved cheese and wine. In the wake of this, the PM said to the House of Commons: I can understand how infuriating it must be to think that the people who have been setting the rules, have not been following the rules, because I was also furious.  Ms Gray is understood to be investigating four events in  which the PM is thought to have attended:May : Garden party at No .in which Boris and Carrie Johnson were pictured in the garden with wine, cheese and more than a dozen other people. No said this was an outdoor work meeting.May : Second garden party at No . with more than  staff told to aposBYOBapos by top civil servant Martin Reynolds.November : Leaving do Sources told the Mirror  to  people crammed into a room in No  to see off top aide Cleo Watson.December : Christmas quiz The Prime Minister was pictured on screen, sitting beneath a portrait of Margaret Thatcher, as he read out questions. He was flanked by two colleagues, one wearing a Santa hat, while the other was draped in tinsel. Who is Martin Reynolds   The invitation email was sent by Downing Street civil servant Martin Reynolds. Reynolds was appointed as Principal Private Secretary to the Prime Minister in  and has previously been an ambassador to Libya. Key details of the email, including the phrase socially distanced drinks, have caused speculation over Reynoldsapos future in the role. His role means he works extremely closely with the PM, who has so far refused to deny any attendance at the alleged party.  The PM said: All that, as you know, is the subject of a proper investigation by Sue Gray. Downing Street also refused to comment three times on whether the PM attended. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: As Iaposve made clear before there’s an independent process going on to look into this led by Sue Gray and I canapost comment further while thataposs taking place.

There have been dficulties keeping track of case numbers in recent weeks due to shortages of lateral flow testsand polymerase chain reactiontests. Despite this, case numbers have remained high and have reached record levels since the Omicron iant took a hold on the country. The UKaposs official Covid death toll passed , on Saturday January . Prime Minister Boris Johnsonaposs government is currently drawing up plan for a living with Covid strategy, which aims to avoid any long-term restrictions in England from March this year.The proposed rule changes may seem like a contradiction to some, so what are they and who do they affect  What is the PCR test rule change   Currently, people who test positive for Covid with no symptoms on a lateral flow test are required to take a PCR to confirm their status. This will change from January .They will still have to isolate for at least seven days, but only from the date of their positive lateral flow test.Head of Imperial College Londonaposs Department of Primary Care  Public Health, Professor Azeem Majeed told the i that the move is a positive step. He said: If you’re positive on lateral flow teststhat’s almost certainly diagnostic of a Covid- infection in the current situation we’re in, as infection rates are so high.By not then having to take a PCR test, it takes pressure off the PCR testing system. What should I doI have a positive LFT   Anyone who tests positive for the virus through an LFT should report their status immediately. The UK Health Security Agencyhas given guidance of how to do this and what will occur afterwards.They said: Under this new approach, anyone who receives a positive LFD test result should report their result on Gov.UK and must self-isolate immediately but will not need to take a follow-up PCR test. At the moment, isolation rules mean that a fully vaccinated person can stop isolating after seven days, proving they take a lateral flow test every day and are negative on days six and seven and have no symptoms. A move to a five-day isolation period is now under consideration. The PM told reporters today: Yes of course, we are looking at that and we will act accordingly to the science as we always have. Is the change to testing permanent   The change brought in has been described as a temporary measure while cases remain high. The UKHSA said: This is a temporary measure while Covid- rates remain high across the UK. Whilst levels of Covid- are high, the vast majority of people with positive [LFT] results can be confident that they have Covid-. The idea is that while cases are in such high numbers, symptoms and a positive test are more likely than normal to indicate the virus. Meanwhile, while case numbers are infrequent and low, a PCR test might be needed to show a positive infection.  The new approach reflects similar changes made this time last year in January , when there was also a high prevalence of infection meaning it was highly likely that a positive [LFT] Covid- result was a true positive. This meant confirmatory PCRs were temporarily paused and reintroduced in March  following a reduction in prevalence.

Oliver Dowden issued the warning moments before the “bring your own booze” bash - which multiple sources claim Boris Johnson attended with his we Carrie. And just five days later, the Prime Minister himself said police should intervene to stop people having outdoor parties. Mr Johnson has been plunged into a fresh scandal over the bash on May , .A bombshell e-mail obtained by ITV News showed more than  No staff were invited by the PM’s top civil servant and told to ‘bring your own booze’.Outdoor gatherings were banned in England at the time under Covid rules. Now footage has emerged of then-Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden speaking at a No press conference, just  minutes before the pm bash out the back door.  He urged hard-pressed citizens to “limit contact with other people”, and said: “You can meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor, public place - provided that you stay two metres apart. The Cabinet minister warned “staying alert for the vast majority of people still means staying at home as much as possible.”Mr Dowden added: “If everyone stays alert and follows the rules, we can control coronavirus.“This is how we can continue to save lives and livelihoods as we begin as a nation to recover from coronavirus.”  Just five days after the outdoor gathering, Boris Johnson said police should intervene to stop outdoor gatherings. He was asked by a member of the public: “There are large groups gathering in local parks, ignoring social distancing rules. When many of us are being so vigilant and staying alert, what can be done to discourage this disregard for the rules ” The PM replied: “Feel free to speak to people yourselfyou feel that they are not obeying the rules. “But the police will step innecessary and encourage people to obey the law. Boris Johnson ’s Principal Private Secretary Martin Reynolds faces a fight for his job after the May  e-mail was revealed by ITV News. And sources now expect Whitehallaposs parties investigator Sue Gray will have to interview the Prime Minister himself - as he was said to have been present at four of the events she is looking into.In a screenshot of the email obtained by ITV News, Mr Reynolds wrote: Hi all, after what has been an incredibly busy period it would be nice to make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No garden this evening.Please join us from pm and bring your own booze!According to the BBC, staff raised questions privately at the time with one saying: “Um.

Kate Grfiths said I am no longer silenced by the family courts” and I can speak out” after a y saga involving her ex Andrew Grfiths. Mr Grfiths used to be the MP for Burton and the minister for small business, and once worked as former prime minister Theresa Mayaposs chief of staff.He resigned in  after the Sunday Mirror revealed he sent depraved messages to two constituents.  The Grfiths, both , became embroiled in private family court proceedings, centred on a child, after separating.During those proceedings, a family court judge concluded that, on the balance of probability, Mr Grfiths had raped and physically abused Ms Grfiths.  Ms Grfiths was speaking on a Tortoise Media podcast after Court of Appeal judges ruled the rape finding could be made public. Ms Grfiths said the pair met in  before Mr Grfiths became an MP, and began a relationship  months later. He was great, he was funny, he was a charmer, said Ms Grfiths. I thought he was an all-round good guy. He was very attentive. Ms Grfiths said people would say they were an ideal couple. But she added: By the end of the relationship, I had just become a shadow of my former self. Three appeal judges last month ruled the family court judgeaposs findings could be made public after a -month legal fight by two media organisations - Tortoise and PA Media. Ms Grfiths had waived her right to anonymity and supported the fight by journalists. She said publication would allow her to help constituents. Itaposs like a feeling of freedom, she said. Mr Grfiths had strongly denied allegations made against him, and argued that the family court judgeaposs findings should not be made public. He said the judgeaposs findings should stay private in order to protect the child at the centre of the case. Judges ruled that neither the gender nor the name of the child at the centre of proceedings could be revealed in media reports.

She says: “Hunger is something that should not be going on in England. “Many years that I have gone without - you could see the bones jutting out of my chest because I had three children and it’s me they’re relying on. “I remember things being really bad, to the point where at times I ate dog food.” Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletter She recalls how she discovered that getting a job would mean being stripped of other benefits. “Things that you were once entitled to, now you’re no longer entitled to those things, then you realise you’re working and still in poverty,” Tfanie tells the film. “In my opinion the system is broken, it doesn’t seem to reflect the needs of the modern family.”Another contributor to the YouTube film, ‘No Child Too Hungry to Learn’, tells how household bills swallow up money.“For the people that earn just enough not to get any help, I think that section of people struggle a lot,” says community nurse Claire. “All their income goes on bills and rent, and then there’s nothing left over.  “It’s hard with the children. I have had sleepless nights thinking about whether I’m going to have enough for the shopping. “That’s a terrible thing to worry about - how you’re going to feed your baby.” The video was made “to raise awareness of the realities faced by families experiencing hunger across the UK”, according to Magic Breakfast. A study published alongside the film shows eight out of  schools believe hunger among their pupils climbed in the past year. Nine out of  schools also think poverty leapt, according to the Magic Breakfast Measuring and Monitoring Survey  . Charity chief Lindsey Macdonald said: “The scale of poverty and hunger in the UK is at a critical level.  “It has a devastating impact on the children who start each day without any food to wake up to. “Our research highlights the increase in poverty and child hunger in our school communities in the past year, and the ripple effect this can have on children and their ability to learn.” Director Ally Green, working with AllMedia’s Bullion Productions, said: “I hope the audience will connect to the families and children at the heart of this film, and are left with a deeper understanding of the social, economic and iable factors that all play into child poverty, with an unrivalled feeling of being compelled to create change.” AllMedia’s chief operating officer Sara Geater said: “It is a sobering yet hopeful film and highlights the urgent need for proper nutrition for all children.” The Department for Work and Pensions was contacted for comment.

Today the Daily Mirror takes a detailed look at le in areas the Conservatives claim they now care about. The picture is bleak, with little or no progress since Boris Johnson won an -seat majority at the  General Election. Over-promising and under-delivering is a hallmark of this Prime Minister. The rundown school we highlight today, where heroic teachers and other staff struggle to keep going in crumbling buildings, is unfortunately not an exception. Working people deserve better and the pupils deserve an education in fit-for-purpose facilities. But in this country Government policies are levelling us down instead of up. Staff our NHS  With an understaffed NHS on its knees, axing key staff because they are unvaccinated would be self-destructive. The boss of one of London’s busiest hospitals warning as many as % of his workforce could need moving shows what happens when the tricky real world collides with Whitehall diktat. Of course, those in the health service should be jabbed, to protect patients, colleagues and the public as well as themselves. Yet the no jab, no job order could prove ruinous to the provision of healthcare. Daily pre-work tests are expensive and burdensome but it would surely be better to use them than to lose the skills and expertise of people who, for whatever reason, have failed to get inoculated, or chosen not to.

Lord Evans said the stories on lockdown breaching parties, first revealed by the Mirror, had cut through with the public, as the affairs have now caused public concern. Giving evidence to the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee , Lord Evans said the public expects MPs to live up to the standards they profess to live up to. Tory rebel William Wragg, chairman of the PACAC, said Lord Evans was quite correct. It comes as the Police have made contact with the Cabinet Office over claims the PMaposs principal private secretary organised a bring your own booze party during Englandaposs first lockdown. Martin Reynolds sent an email to more than  Downing Street employees inviting them to make the most of the lovely weatherin the garden. The leaked email, obtained by ITV news, said: “Hi all, after what has been an incredibly busy period we thought it would be nice to make the most of the lovely weather and have some socially distanced drinks in the No garden this evening.“Please join us from pm and bring your own booze!” Paymaster General Michael Ellis will be summoned to the Commons to answer an urgent question from Labouraposs Deputy leader Angela Rayner on the scandal at .pm today.  The peeraposs appearance in front of the PACAC committee follows the Greensill lobbying row involving former PM David Cameron.Mr Cameron was taken on as a paid adviser after he left Number , and used his contacts to send texts and e-mails to Chancellor Rishi Sunak and other ministers and senior civil servants urging them to allow Greensill to participate in a Government Covid loan scheme for businesses. Mr Cameron acknowledged there are “important lessons to be learned”. Lord Evans told MPs on the committee: “I think we have seen a whole series of issues over the last few months: the Owen Paterson affair, the attempt to change the rules over standards investigations in the middle of the investigation into Mr Paterson’s actions. “The questions around the redecoration of Downing Street, in particular the very bad processes that were clearly in place for keeping Lord Geidt properly informed. “The Greensill affair and now partygate. “All of those, I think, have demonstrated that there is – at least – a carelessness amongst people in Government over standards issues, and possibly no more than that.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonConservative PartyMIPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

When heaposs crying into his beer, Johnson will still be blaming everybody . Infamy! Infamy! Theyaposve all got it in for me! Lies have a habit of catching up with liars.

Turn up heat Labour is drawing a thick red line between itself and the Conservatives today by challenging Tory MPs to support cuts in rising energy bills.

Health Minister Ed Argar was sent out to defend the Government after a bombshell email emerged showing the PMaposs aide inviting more than  No  employees to an evening gathering on May  .Martin Reynolds, the Prime Ministeraposs principal private secretary, said staff should make the most of the lovely weatherand urged them to bring your own booze, according to ITV News.Witnesses claimed about  staff attended the event, including Mr Johnson and his we Carrie - and there were long tables laden with drink, crisps, sausage rolls and other picnic food. Outdoor gatherings were banned at the time under Englandaposs Covid restrictions. Less than an hour before the gathering was due to begin, the-then Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden urged Brits to “limit contact with other people”. He told a No press conference: “You can meet one person outside of your household in an outdoor, public place - provided that you stay two metres apart. What were you doing on May   email webnews@mirror Top civil servant Sue Gray is understood to be looking into at least six Westminster gatherings that took place in  as part of an official inquiry in potential rule-breaking.Sources suggested that Ms Gray was likely to interview Mr Johnson, who was believed to be present at four of the gatherings under investigation. The Met Police has confirmed it is in contact with the Cabinet Office over the claims. Mr Argar told the Today programme he could understand people might feel anger and hurt at the allegations - but he said people need to wait for Ms Grayaposs inquiry to conclude. Asked explicitlythe PM was at the event, he said: I donapost know, I donapost know. I donapost work in No  Downing Street. Pressed again, he said: I donapost know. He said he hopes Ms Gray would provide a swt report, adding: I hope it will clary all the facts around this and some of the other allegations weaposve seen about whether regulations were broken. Thataposs what she is working on, I know she is keen to get to the bottom of it...rules are found to have been broken, appropriate disciplinary action - as the PM said - should be taken. Mr Argar refused to speculate about whether the PM was there but said itaposs important rules are followed. He said he had not been invited to attend any drinks and was glued to Zoom at the time. Confronted by angry messages from listeners, he said: I can understand the anger, I can also understand the hurt and the upset from people whoaposve lost loved ones, people who werenapost able to grieve for loved ones or who werenapost able to see their loved ones, who passed away whether from Covid or something .  He said he had lost a close relative during the pandemic who he wasnapost able to see. Mr Argar added: I understand exactly how people feel about these allegations and about the impact on their children and their mental health. Tory MPs have gone to ground since the email emerged on Monday night. But former Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson tweeted: This line wonapost survive  hrs. Nobody needs an official to tell themthey were at a boozy shindig in their own garden. People arefurious. They sacriced so much - visiting sick or grieving relatives, funerals. What tf were any of these people thinking Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner said:Boris Johnson ’s deflections and distractions are no longer tenable.“Sue Gray is a highly respected civil servant who will be carrying out an investigation to the highest standard. “But the truth is out now. Not only did Boris Johnson know about the parties, he attended them and he lied. “It’s time for the Prime Minister to stop hiding behind Whitehall inquiries and finally come clean.

Forget record high NHS waiting lists and crumbling schools when Tory Cabinet Ministers lie in front of giant Union Jacks to illustrate their intense patriotism. And ignore sleaze, corruption, back-handers, unfairness, inequality and fatal mistakes for, with the blessing of Culture Wars Secretary Nadine Dorries, Tory no-mark Andrew Rosindell wants the BBC to play God Save the Queen every day. Statues, flags and anthems are battlegrounds the PM’s smokescreen to ert public attention away from his tax hikes, soaring fuel bills, cost of living rises, stagnant wages and declining public services.  It is a classic, cynical Right-wing strategy to ide and rule. It played well in the past and it might work again. Magicians use misdirection as a form of deception to draw the audience’s attention from the real action. Johnson would rather voters were angry about a jury clearing four protesters over the toppling of slaver Edward Colston’s statue in Bristol than holding the PM to account for increased National Insurance or discussing Labour’s proposed windfall tax on North Sea oil and gas producers to compensate households who are facing huge increases in energy bills.  Suella Braverman is an Attorney-General whose ideological conviction results in much of the legal profession judging her guilty of stupidity. Even considering an appeal against the jury verdict in the Colston case is a sign the governing party will roll in the gutter. Labour leader Keir Starmer is wise to take no lectures on patriotism from a Conservative regime which inflicted the terrible national self-harm that is Brexit. But in a fight, the Labour leader is similarly wise to combat smears which saw predecessor Jeremy Corbyn unfairly tainted as hating his country. Labour wins by keeping the national conversation on big issues that really count, the Tories by changing it to emblems and frippery. Living standards or statues  The election’s choice and verdict will decide whether Britain is a progressive country moving brightly forward or stuck in the past.

Alexandra Sinyavskaya, , met Antonio Scuzzarella, , back in  when she was working part time at a coffee shop in Turin while studying. While Alexandra worked shts, Antonio would stop in for coffee as his office was just around the corner. After showering her with compliments, Antonio eventually won her heart and the pair began to date. However, two months later, they amicably separated when Alexandra decided she wasnapost mature enough to be in a serious relationship. She finished her studies to qualy as an accountant and moved back to her hometown of Moscow, Russia - but the pair remained friends over the years. For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here But in February , shortly before the pandemic started, they found themselves in touch more often and reconnected online. Before long, theyaposd booked a trip to Barcelona together. Alexandra said: In February , we made plans to go to Spain together as friends as he knew the country very well and I have always wanted to go. We bought tickets and made plans for a holiday in Barcelona when Covid hit and Italy closed its borders. He insisted that I should go without him, but I said no and we stayed at home, him in Turin, Italy and me in Prague, Czech Republic. During lockdown, the pair spoke every single day and kept each other up to date with what they were doing. By September , Alexandra had moved to Turin to live with her beau. While living with Antonio, Alexandra fell pregnant - but tragically she lost the baby at five weeks.  It made us realise that we want to be together, get married and start a family, she said. In February , she found out she was pregnant again - but tragedy struck once more when Alexandra miscarried at seven weeks. After a tough few months in which Antonio proposed but Alexandra did not accept, the pair finally got engaged when she was ready in June  and the pair tied the knot in December. Although the couple are smitten with each other, Alexandra says they do get some unusual looks and comments from people who judge their -year age gap. People assume that I am with him for his money and sayhe was a simple clerk or a street sweeper I would not be with him, the accountant said.  She added it took time for Antonioaposs friends to understand sheaposs with him for love, and not because she wanted his money or a to live in Italy. Some of my friends still donapost understand why Iaposm not with a better-looking guy my age, she said. Sometimes when we are out in the streets people ask whether he is my dad and we have to clary that we are a couple. It is funny, but it also gets very annoying after a while. Alexandra is no stranger to age gap relationships, having dated a -year-old man when she was just , and being with a man  years older than her when she met Antonio. I discovered very early on in my dating le that I donapost like the system, she said. I want you to show me something that I donapost know. I prefer a man who knows how to live, I want a man who is experienced, who is well-travelled and knows who he is. She said most people judge age gap relationships because theyaposre not educated about them. Anything out of the norm is unacceptable, she said. People make comments about you, your partner, your relationship but you donapost have to explain anything to anyone just be happy. Although sheaposs madly in love with an older man, sheaposs warned other women considering an age gap relationship to remember their partner will most likely die long before they do. At some point your partner will be very old, she said. You have to understand that it will come and you have to be prepared for that as well.

However scientists have stressed vaccination is the best protectionThe new study examined how the presence of these T cells at the time of exposure influences whether someone becomes infectedImage: Getty ImagesByElla PickoverDanya BazaraaSenior News Reporter:,  Jan | comments Some of the bodyaposs defences generated after an infection of the common cold could help to ward off the virus that causes Covid-, researchers have said. A small study found that people with high levels of T cells - generated after infection with other coronaviruses such as the common cold - were less likely to catch Covid-.Bu the authors of the study have insisted people should not rely on this and stressed that vaccination was the best way a person could protect themselves against Covid-.These findings came after a new study, conducted by experts at Imperial College London, set out to investigate why some people donapost catch Covid-, despite being in contact with the virus.The question has confused many people - as some repeatedly get Covid while others manage to avoid it even though they have been exposed to the virus.Dr Rhia Kundu, first author of the study, from Imperialaposs National Heart  Lung Institute, said: Being exposed to the Sars-CoV- virus doesnapost always result in infection, and weaposve been keen to understand why.  We found that high levels of pre-existing T cells, created by the body when infected with other human coronaviruses like the common cold, can protect against Covid- infection.While this is an important discovery, it is only one form of protection, and I would stress that no one should rely on this alone.Instead, the best way to protect yourself against Covid- is to be fully vaccinated, including getting your booster dose.Previous work had suggested that T cells induced by other coronaviruses could recognise Sars-CoV- - the virus that causes Covid-.  The new study, published in the journal Nature Communications, examined how the presence of these T cells at the time of exposure influences whether someone becomes infected. Experts studied a group of people in September  when fewer people in the UK had been infected and the vaccination campaign had not yet started. Researchers studied  people who lived with someone with a confirmed case of Covid-. The participants did PCR tests at the onset of the study, and four and seven days later, to seethey developed an infection themselves.Blood samples were taken in the first six days of exposure to enable the researchers to analyse the levels of pre-existing T cells induced by previous common cold coronavirus infections. The researchers found that there were signicantly higher levels of these cross-reactive T cells in the  people who did not become infected, compared with the  people who did become infected. The authors of the study said that these T cells targeted internal proteins within the Sars-CoV- virus, rather than the spike protein on the surface of the virus, to protect against infection. Current Covid- vaccines target the spike protein of the virus, not these internal proteins. This finding could lead to the development of new vaccines that target the internal proteins of the virus - which could potentially provide longer-lasting protection, as T cell responses can persist longer than antibody responses. Professor Ajit Lalvani, senior author of the study and director of the NIHR Respiratory Infections Health Protection Research Unit at Imperial, said: Our study provides the clearest evidence to date that T cells induced by common cold coronaviruses play a protective role against Sars-CoV- infection. These T cells provide protection by attacking proteins within the virus, rather than the spike protein on its surface. The spike protein is under intense immune pressure from vaccine-induced antibody, which drives evolution of vaccine-escape mutants. In contrast, the internal proteins targeted by the protective T cells we identied mutate much less.Consequently, they are highly conserved between the ious Sars-CoV- iants, including Omicron.New vaccines that include these conserved, internal proteins would therefore induce broadly protective T cell responses that should protect against current and future Sars-CoV- iants.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Imperial CollegeSarsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Alcohol consumption in the UK in  was at an all-time high, and according to experts more people are took part in Dry January than ever before. GP Dr Ross Perry, Medical Director of cosmedics, told how after just one week off the booze youaposll notice a change in your food choices and appetite, and feel more energetic. After a month off, sleep will be fully regulated, skin will be clearer and the fat around the liver could have reduced by as much as  per cent.Meanwhile, wellbeing expert andBBCRadio  DJ Janey Lee Grace revealed what itaposs really like during the first month without alcohol, after she quit drinking all together.Dr Perry told Mail Online: Binge drinking can have serious health problems. In the long term it can boost the risk for liver disease, high blood pressure, stroke, certain cancers, and heart disease but equally it can cause accidents alongside memory problems, alcohol poisoning and a build-up of alcohol in the blood stream which can affect our vital organs.Having the odd alcoholic drink every now and then isnapost going to cause much of a problem but when moderation is every day, and at least several glasses, this is when long term it can cause a problem.apos He added: After your last drink the liver starts working overtime and the pancreas starts producing extra insulin. Itaposs important to drink lots of water over the coming days to keep your skin and body hydrated.  What happens to your body when you stop drinking  Week oneThe first few days following no alcohol your body goes into detox mode. Headaches and grogginess will have subsided and you start to feel more refreshed in general, but it actually takes up to  hours before you mentally and physically feel back to normal.Your sleep pattern becomes more regulated after - days meaning youaposll wake up with more energy and skin looks clearer. This is because drinking alcohol may send us to sleep very quickly but in actual fact we miss out on the all important Rapid Eye movement which should be around - cycles. But the effects of alcohol mean this is limited to one or two.  In the first week youaposll notice a change in your food choices and appetite. When weaposve been drinking alcohol the hormone that makes you feel hungry go up which often leads to bingeing on the wrong foods. Eating a better diet will make us feel better overall, not forgetting all those calories weaposre likely to save, approximately  calories over daysyou were drinking a glass of wine each night. Waking up with a flatter tummy in the first week instead of feeling bloated and lethargic will also be visible in the first week. Week two After two weeks you will notice a huge improvement in overall sleep pattern as your body becomes more regulated. Better brainfollowing a good nightaposs sleep and replacing water instead of alcohol will also have a huge benefit to our skin which will appear clearer, less dry looking and fine lines reduced. After two weeks you will also likely see a drop in body weight, eye bags reduced and far less overall bloating around the stomach area. Week three After three weeks blood pressure will reduce. Drinking every day and binge drinking can cause our blood pressure to rise and can be really dangerous. Reducing blood pressure can help with any long-term health problems. After three weeks you will also notice a signicant improvement in overall cognitive ability and increased energy levels. Week four After four weeks of not drinking alcohol skin and eyes will look brighter and clearer. Skin which is irritated and normally dry will feel better due to the added hydration to the body. After four weeks, liver fat reduces up to  per cent, increasing its ability to flush out toxins. Mild liver disease, like fatty liver can be reversed completelya person stops drinking alcohol altogether. When there is no alcohol in your blood for several months, the liver cells canto normal. Overall after four weeks of not drinking alcohol, sleep will be regulated and you will most certainly feel well rested.

Tips on reducing your alcohol intake when you start drinking again GP Dr Ross Perry shares his top tips on reducing your overall booze intake - Keep a diary - The key to reducing your alcohol intake is first to keep a diary of how much alcohol youaposre actually consuming. Many of us may not realise the levels of booze weaposre actually consuming, especially being in lockdown.Plan ahead - Look to have alcohol free days,you drink every day start by drinking every other, and slowly reduce this down, first to every few days, then perhaps just a weekends.Itaposs important though not to binge on the days you do allow yourself to drink which will do more harm than good. Try to have a glass of water before you have alcohol and alternate alcoholic drinks with water or other non-alcoholic drinks. Form a habit - Replace the time you drink alcohol with doing some exercise, taking a long bath or make yourself a mocktail. Your head and body will thank you for it the next day.Save money - Be mindful about how you shop for alcohol and what youaposre actually purchasing. Put the money aside youaposd normally spend on alcohol and create a apostreat boxapos for something you really want to buy.Ease yourself into it - If you havenapost drunk alcohol for a while start by having a glass of water. Keep measures small so opt for a small glass of wine, or a bottle of beer rather than a pint and alternative with water and soft drinks to keep hydrated.Donapost fall back into the habit of drinking every day but keep it in moderation as it will be more enjoyable when you do enjoy a glass of wine with dinner. Keep a diary of your alcohol intake so you can stay on track. The author, who penned Happy Healthy Sober - Ditch the booze and take control of your le, now works to help others ditch booze through Emotional Freedom Techniquestherapy. She explained that for a someone who drinks heavily and often, but is not clinically dependent on alcohol, cravings are mental rather than physical. She said: When you first stop drinking its a shock to the system for sure. In truth,you are a aposingapos drinker , then the alcohol will have left the body within a few days, so any cravings are not physical but mental, but they can be VERY strong. The big problem is the brain chemistry is out of whack, so we want a hit of dopamine, or serotonin and can literally feel like climbing the walls to get some relief from the voice in our head telling us... go on, just have one! Sharing lessons she has learned from her own sobriety, she advised making sure to stock up on healthy serotonin boosting foods and substituting booze with an alcohol-free alternative, so you donapost lose the sense of aposglamourapos drinking brings. She said: What does help, I now know, is to do your preparation, stock up on really good healthy food and snacks, you need good proteins and fats to balance those brain chemicals.Will you be giving Dry January a go  Join the debate in our comments below Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BBCBlood pressureHeart diseaseMental healthSave moneyAlcoholTherapyBinge drinkingFitness\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our money-saving tips and top offers direct to your inbox with the Mirror Money newsletterInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The chalkboard sign, placed outside W.M Christie Butchers in Edinburgh, Scotland, called on locals to end violence against plants by eating meat. Vegans took offence to the message after a photo of the message circulated on social media. It read: “Every day thousands of innocent plants are killed by vegetarians. Help end the violence and eat meat.”Some branded it nonsense while others went as far as calling the owners psychopaths, reports Edinburgh Live. Jakub Dragon, who shared the image on Facebook, told the publication: “I just think it’s nonsense, I don’t understand.How can they justy killing an animal like that  It only brings anger and fights and I don’t find that funny.Surely eating plants is less damaging to the environment and plants, unlike animals, are not sentient. Many were outraged by the tongue-in-cheek sign mocking vegan diets. Kevin Thomson commented: Jeez, the ignorance is astonishing. Plants are not sentient and exist in synergy with humans and animals as a food source. You just canapost say I murdered a carrot. People will cling to all sorts of nonsense to justy murdering animals. Animals that have exactly the same fundamental wishes as us - to be happy, safe and free from suffering. Adam Rennie said: SoI interpreted that right, we need to eat the humans because it was humans that killed the plants too ” Lisa Roy added: And what does their meat eat  Others interpreted the sign as a joke and said there was no need to get upset. Gilly Billy said: Surely we can take this in good humour. These people are running a business that has been in their family for generations. It doesn’t mean we all have to eat meat. It can’t be okay for vegans to fly the vegan flag, and not okay for meat-eaters to do the same. Regardless of our reasons behind being vegan.

We are surrounded by people telling us to go vegan and vegetarian, yet my business is a butcheraposs. We sell meat and I’m promoting my business. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and I respect that, I’m just expressing mine. And it seems to have worked, given the attention my butchers has now received.

Marie Irene Carol Scottaposs oldest son, Stuart, and her husband, James, had asked consultants, police officers, and ambulance technicians to detain the -year-old under the Mental Health Act, coroner Adrian Farrow heard at the opening day of the week long inquest. They made the pleas after she had attempted to take her own le three times, South Manchester coroneraposs court heard.The mum from Hale disappeared on December , , the Manchester Evening News reports. Her leg was later found in the River Irwell in Salford some  months later, with her remains tragically discovered in the Mersey Marsh, near Frodsham, in December .  James says Marie first attempted to take her le on December , , after being found at home, but had been discharged just  hours later, with doctors allegedly saying she was aposjust being sillyapos. I could not believe she was being discharged, James said in court. She tried to take her own le yesterday. The psychiatrist said he thought she was just being silly. Marieaposs mental health began to deteriorate at the end of October  following the passing of her mum, Irene, who would visit her daughter aposfour or five timesapos a week. It did not initially affect her, said James, who was married to his childhood sweetheart for  years. But it had [an impact] in her own mind. The first signs that Marie was not well came a few days after the loss of Irene, after her husband discovered her when it aposwas apparent she had been drinkingapos on a Saturday morning - which was very out of character, he added. Then, on November , the self-employed ironing businesswoman rang eldest son Stuart to ask for apossleeping tabletsapos and aposanti-anxiety medicationapos. That led her to seeing her GP, Dr Patel, who prescribed her anti-depressants and sleeping tablets. However, her out-of-character behaviour continued.  On December , instead of seeing her brother and sister-in-law for coffee as she did most weekends, Marie did not arrive at their home - and instead ed back to her house after aposdrinkingapos. When dad James came back after looking in the shops for her, she was aposfast asleepapos on the settee - but he became alarmed when she had not stirred for apossix hoursapos. That prompted the family to call for an ambulance, who took her to Wythenshawe Hospital. She was very drowsy and non-responsive, Stuart explained. During the visit, paramedics were aposspeaking to her but she was not talking back, she was completely out of itapos, James added. Despite her admittance and overnight stay at Wythenshawe Hospital, the family felt more could have been done to care for Marie. I went on December  thinking I was going to visit, James continued during his testimony in the court. They said she had been declared medically fit and she was in with a psychiatrist. I could not believe she was being discharged. She tried to take her own le yesterday. The psychiatrist said he thought she was just being silly. When asked why the family thought doctors felt she was fit to leave their care, they said it was because Marie was a good aposactressapos.  The next time Marieaposs actions raised the alarm was on December . After James had been working away for the morning, he ed to find Marie had vanished from home. That sparked a search effort from the family across Hale and other places they knew the mother was likely to know. Eventually, Marie was found by a dog walker in a pond in Sunbank Wood, in Hale, with cuts to her wrists and legs. Again, she was taken to Wythenshawe Hospital, where she stayed until December . During her stay, the family again asked the doctors to section his mum. I would always ask the nursethey were going to let her out, Stuart said. They said aposnot a chanceapos. They had a security guard at the end of the bed. James added: I expressed how serious this was. I said the family want her sectioned and that she needs to be on long-term medication. The doctor said she does not need that. He said she would be better served by the home team. I said this has all happened within five days from being released to a far more serious attempt. Stuart, giving evidence alongside his dad, said the news of his mumaposs discharge took a heavy toll on him. It destroyed me, he said. She stabbed herself and nearly drowned. What more warning signs do you need  Although home visits were arranged for Marie, only two appointments took place before her final out-of-character incident. After Stuartaposs partner Roxanne had stayed with her at the family home on December , Marie dashed out the door - with Roxanne following her. After she could not find her on foot, Roxanne turned to see Marie driving a car. Eventually, Roxanne managed to get Marie out of the car and call the police. When Stuart arrived at the scene, he asked the attending police officer: Please section my mum. We were banging our heads against a brick wall. We asked three of four times. We were really scared. For a third time, Marie was not sectioned, and instead saw another psychiatrist the following day. After both Marie and James arrived back from the appointment, at around .am, he went out to run some errands, and left Marie to start work. Tragically, that would be the final time he saw his we alive. The inquest then heard that Marie left home in the early afternoon, boarding a bus to Altrincham station, where she took a tram to Deansgate. She then proceeded to walk around the Bridgewater Canal area of the city for some time, before buying some items, including alcohol, from a Sainsburyaposs store. After this, she boarded another tram to Victoria Station, and then asked a taxi driver to take to Heaton Park and then The Rock shopping centre in Bury. Police Senior Investigating Officer DI Simon Aker then said Marie was last spotted on CCTV walking towards Openshaw Park, at around :pm - roughly the same time the family alerted the police to her disappearance. That was the last confirmed sighting or Marie, with pathologists believing that the most likely cause of death was a sudden movement of the head towards the chest, breaking her neck. The inquest continues, with a verdict expected on Friday.* Samaritansoperates a -hour service available every day of the year.

But when Poppy Lee-Burrowes decided she wanted to cut her hair for the cause when she was just five years old, she was told she wasnapost able to - as the charity couldnapost make wigs from afro hair. The determined youngster didnapost give up though and kept growing her hair out for six more years just in case the policy changed - and in April , it did. Poppy, now , still plans to donate her hair to the Little Princess Trust and will be chopping off about eight inches on January .  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Despite knowing she will miss her big hair, donapost care look, she knows that other people will be able to love my hair too. The school student from Rhondda Cynon Taf, Wales, said: I want to do it because of the people that wonapost have hair. I want to be generous and help. Poppy also has a fundraising page that was set up to raise money for the wig-making charity, and the page states the big cut will be a big deal to her. She added: Itaposs taken me since I was about five, I have only ever had small trims in my le, never a big cut, so this is a big deal to me. It costs £ to make just one wig for a child.  And Poppyaposs mum Jessica explained her daughter first wanted to cut her hair six years ago after hearing about her friends who had done the same. She told the BBC: It was last year a friend sent me an article to say they were now able to accept afro hair. We showed it to Poppy and she was ecstatic, over the moon. She was more than happy to have it cut and share her hair. We are so proud of her. Jessica was initially disappointed to learn the Little Princess Trust couldnapost accept afro hair but said she understood because of the extensive work they put into making these wigs and how important they are. It can take  to  hours to make a hand-tied inidual wig, according to Little Princess Trustaposs chief executive Phil Brace. Previously, the trust offered afro-style wigs using straight hair which was later curled into the requested style as it was unable to find a wig manufacturer able to use hair donations from black and mixed-race people in wigs. Afro hair can easily break in the wig-making process, but after teaming up with London company Raoul to develop a wefting method, the Little Princess Trust is now able to accept donations of afro hair. Poppyaposs other mum, Beki, said: I think itaposs really important that theyaposre now accepting afro hair because obviously to help all children and I think it will help children to keep their identity as well. I think thataposs really important and itaposs a really big step. For more information on Poppyaposs haircut, and to donate to the cause, visit Poppyaposs Afro Chop page on Just Giving.

River had decided she would have him buriedthere were not any ashes - instead, she claims Co-op promised there would be ashes.The cremation then went ahead a month after Tommyaposs death, on June , . But, when -year-old River went to collect the ashes, she was told there were none, after all, thanks to a heartbreaking mix-up.The devastated mum-of-two, from Morley, Leeds, filed a formal complaint last year but said she is still brought to tears by the blunder. River said: I knew from the start that I only wanted Tommy to be crematedthere would be ashes. I was told there definitely would be - until I turned up to collect the ashes from the hospital and there were none. I was heartbroken - I wanted to bring some of him home so he could be here with us. Even now, thinking about it brings me to tears. A scan had shown Tommy no longer had a heartbeat in June . The young mum had to give birth to her stillborn son at St James Hospital, Leeds, on June . Devastated River was given the option to hold a funeral for tiny Tommy the following month, which was to be organised by Co-op Funeralcare. She said in a consultation about the funeral, which took place on July , she was asked whether she wished to have her tiny son cremated or buried. River said: I wanted to be able to take him home, so I said I only wanted to have him crematedthere would be ashes. I was worried there might not be as he was only tiny - so I told them I didnapost want to end up with nothing left of him. I said I would rather have him buriedthere wouldnapost be ashes, but the funeral team said there definitely would be.  Following the funeral, Tommyaposs minuscule remains were cremated at Cottingley Hall Crematorium. But when the grieving mother went to collect Tommyaposs ashes, she was horried to learn there were no ashes for her to collect. Sadly, the scatter tube Co-op sent the hospital - which was supposed to have contained the ashes - was empty. River said: I was heartbroken - I rang my sister and broke down on the phone. Despite her devastation, River spent the next three years trying to come to terms with the loss of her first child. She went on to have Tommyaposs younger siblings Bobbylee, three, and Elisha, two, but has never forgotten her first son. After a conversation with family in the summer of , River was convinced to submit a formal complaint to the Co-op. And, after an internal investigation took place, the company acknowledged its errors and apologised. A letter to River sent in September  said: At the time of Tommyaposs sad death, staff from Co-op Funeralcare should have made the Bereavement Services team aware that due to Tommyaposs young age, there may not be any ashes to collect following cremation.  It explained that due to a breakdown in communication, the young mum was then given an empty scatter tube. It later read: We are so very sorry for the upset these failures in communication have caused. As compensation, Co-op agreed to foot the bill for a memorial area in Riveraposs garden, dedicated to Tommy, which she said was installed four months ago costing £,. The memorial features a headstone, bench, a series of ornaments and a gate where the mum-of-two says she now sits every evening to think about him. She said she brings Bobbylee and Elisha with her to the memorial, to talk about their older brother who they tragically never got to meet. River said: While the memorial is lovely, itaposs not quite the same. Nothing will bring him back and I know because I couldnapost bring his ashes home, that heaposs not here with me.

Tommy, from Hampshire, made the comments as it was announced that he is the latest Ambassador for Mencap - a UK learning disability charity. The -year-old, who played Terry Boyle in the hit BBC crime drama, spoke exclusively to The Mirror ahead of the announcement today.On Zoom, he said he had aposalwaysapos wanted to be an actor after starting out with local theatre company Blue Apple Theatre, which was founded by his mother Jane. I always wanted to be an actor because I do enjoy making people feel their emotions, making them laugh, cry, shout and swear all for the love of it on a screen, he exclusively tells the Mirror.  The TV star is keen to use his position to push for more ersity and hails his time appearing in nailbiting drama Line of Duty as aposincredible.apos Describing the scene where his character is nearly drowned in a lake, he found himself freezing cold in mid-November at midnight standing by the water. Comparing it to a James Bond scheme, the actor says he had a ball filming the gripping drama, especially the interrogation scenes. Rather sweetly, his mum Jane was included in the final episode - playing the social worker taking Terry to a safe house after the dramatic ongoings.Heaposs keeping details about a rumoured next season quiet but adds that he hopes he appears in itit does . Although he admits: If Iaposm not in it, I will enjoy putting my feet up and watching it. He has made his TV debut in Holby City and went on to be the first professional actor with Downaposs syndrome to play Hamlet, in a performance that Sir Mark Rylance hailed as aposphenomenalapos. And he thinks that representation is aposimprovingapos, but thereaposs much more to do. Asked what advice he would give actors with Down Syndrome who are hoping to follow in his footsteps, he says: Live your le to the full. Be professional, be punctual and have an early night so that you really are on top form. The best part is having fun.  Tommy is also the winner of ious Best Actor awards for his short films and also the first professional actor with Down’s syndrome to become a full voting member of BAFTA. Asked about representing Mencap, he said: I really do feel honoured and proud to represent Mencap because I really would like to be a voice for the . million people in the UK living with a learning disability. It is a bit daunting and overwhelming because we are all dferent but it is quite a brilliant chance to make a dference. I do hope to stop people saying that people with learning disabilities cannot do certain things.  I want other people to say aposyes you canapos, because we will help you.apos We are not all the same. We donapost all have the same chances in le, but I do want people to understand we can do things. We should be able to lead healthy and happy lives and do interesting things like go to work, get married and choose who we live with, just the same as other people. The main message is: just give us a chance. In July , Jessop received an honorary Doctorate of Arts from the University of Winchester for his services to the entertainment industry. Recent research from Mencap for its  th anniversary revealed that two-thirds of Brits don’t know what a learning disability is and two in five Britshave not seen someone with a learning disability in the media in the past year – one of the reasons for the lack of understanding in this country.The research also revealed that a thirdof people in the UK say they would feel more comfortable talking to someone with a learning disabilitythey saw them featured more often in the media. Speaking of his new role as Mencap Ambassador, Tommy says: I am proud and honoured to be a Mencap Ambassador. I hope through this role I can help Mencap keep doing what they do best to carry on their really hard work in the future.” Edel Harris, Chief Executive of the learning disability charity Mencap, said: “ We are delighted to welcome Tommy Jessop as our Ambassador. Like the rest of the nation, I was gripped by the last season of Line of Duty and was delighted to see someone who has Down’s syndrome on such a popular and prime time TV show.It’s incredibly important because representation really does matter and I’m thrilled he’s joined the Mencap family.“Having Tommy on board as an Ambassador is a great way to de-stigmatise and challenge misconceptions about people who have Down’s syndrome and or who have a learning disability. He will also help us increase the visibility of people with a learning disability across the media and society to help transform attitudes. Our vision is for the UK to be the best place in the world to live a happy and healthy leyou have a learning disability and I look forward to working alongside Tommy to make this vision a reality.Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Terry BoyleMencapCasualtyHolby CitySoap operasLine of Duty\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

An inquest into the deaths of Garry Bolton and his daughter Paige, , was concluded on Monday with assistant coroner Ian Sprakes delivering a narrative verdict, Hull Live reports. He said: “On January , , Garry Bolton and Paige Bolton died at  Wensley Avenue in Hull between approximately .am and am due to the effects of inhalation of products of combustion and carbon monoxide poisoning due to the effects of a smouldering fire probably deliberately started that morning.” Garry and Paige died in the fire in the early hours of January , , at the house in north Hull, where they lived. But Paige’s mum Cherie Rangeley says the conclusion has left her with few answers and she believes a more definitive short form conclusion should have been delivered. She said she feels numb and like she has no closure. “For Paige it wasn’t suicide, Garry murdered my little girl,” she said. “There is no closure really. He didn’t have to take my little girl. If you want to kill yourself then fine but he didn’t have to take Paige. “I feel numb and didn’t really get the answers I was hoping for. I’m not any nearer where I feel I’m supposed to be. “I would have preferred a conclusion of suicide for Garry and unlawful killing for Paige rather than a narrative verdict. “But with Garry’s family there too I guess he has to see it from both sides.”  Cherie, who was with Garry for  years, also feels there was little said about Paige at the inquest. She said: “There was nothing really about Paige and how she felt. At the end of the day Garry took his own le and that of Paige which he had no right or need to do. “Paige was cheeky but also shy. But once she got to know you there was no shutting her up. “I loved her so much and loved buying her things.”  Cherie says Paige was quite a complex character but knew how much her family loved her. “Paige loved to play and we would go to a nearby basketball court and she would roller skate,” she said. “She loved being silly around me and we had a lot of fun. “But she was also delicate and could get very scared. I’m sure she knew what was going on that night and I dread to think what she went through. “But she knew how much she was loved. She rarely said she loved me but she would show it in other ways. “I just miss Paige being Paige and being able to hold her. I also miss her beautul smile.”  Cherie says it is still very hard and she struggles still every day. “Christmas was hard,” she said. “I started thinking I need to buy Paige a present and then realised she was gone. The inquest previously heard how Garry and Cherie had twins Paige and Ethan in  through IVF treatment. Sadly, Ethan died of a heart defect aged just six months, which devastated Garry and Cherie. Paige’s ashes have now been laid beside Ethan which makes Cherie’s visits to the graveside even more dficult. “I find it very hard visiting the grave as Paige really looked after Ethan’s headstone,” Cherie said “She would clean it every time we went there and would leave toys for Ethan. “Now she is not there to do it but, instead, lies next to Ethan. Paige was killed by her dad Garry in a murder-suicide in which he set fire to their home and locked them both inside, the coroner concluded on Monday. Mr Sprakes said he believed Garry Bolton had probably deliberately started the fire, with no logical explanation for the fire having been started accidentally.  Fire crews had to break into the property using a saw and then discovered the two victims lying together in the bathtub. Garry had locked the front door and made access inside dficult, the inquest heard, and no attempt had been made to contact the emergency services. Returning a narrative conclusion to the inquest, which started back in August, Mr Sprakes also referenced chilling texts sent by Paige to her grandmother before she died saying: Daddy is scaring me. Mr Bolton had also written a note expressing self-harm, the inquest heard. During proceedings in August, Mr Sprakes mentioned text messages Garry had sent to former partner Cherie, which he decided not to read out, which he said “amounted to a suicide note”. The inquest had heard how Garry’s mental health seemed to have deteriorated, having already suffered from anxiety, low self-esteem and paranoia.  Independent fire investigator Dr Will Hutchinson carried out an investigation into the blaze and he had also given evidence to the inquest. He had said it was a smouldering fire which meant it took a number of hours to develop. He also indicated such a fire would produce lethal levels of carbon monoxide almost immediately, which could take effect in a matter of minutes. The smoke alarm was also not working, but he could not say for sure whether the fire had been caused accidentally or deliberately. However, Humberside Fire and Rescue Service station manager Richard Gibson believed the cause was deliberate. He said: “I believe the ignition was due to an unspecied naked flame. “As the seat of the fire was in the centre of the bed, it leads me to believe it was deliberate.” Mr Sprakes delivered a narrative verdict. He said: “On January , , Garry Bolton and Paige Bolton died at  Wensley Avenue in Hull between approximately .am and am due to the effects of inhalation of products of combustion and carbon monoxide poisoning due to the effects of a smouldering fire probably deliberately started that morning.” Mr Sprakes went on to offer his condolences to Paige’s mum and the sister and mother of Garry who were all in court. He said: “I express my sincere condolences to the families of Garry and Paige Bolton. “This is a very sad and, indeed, tragic event. There are very few words I can say to relieve the pain and anguish for a truly tragic event.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON MurderMental healthInquests\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Fiona Leary, , ordered a box of Graze Protein Oat Boost bars online last Wednesday for her gym-loving family. But when she and her husband Justin opened the parcel, she claims one of the snacks had already been eaten. The business owner then said she made the stomach-churning discovery of an open wrapper poking out covered in tiny teeth marks and mouse droppings. When Justin, , complained to Amazon, Fiona said they were simply offered a replacement for the £. order without promising to investigate how it happened. The mum-of-three is now calling on Amazon to investigate a potential warehouse issue she believes caused the aposrevoltingapos delivery. Amazon said they are now investigating the issue and working with the customer to make things right. Fiona, from Chorley, Lancashire, said: It was disgusting. You can see the packet and itaposs got chewed teeth marks around it. There are black drops that look like mouse droppings and bits of the oat biscuit scattered around. Itaposs definitely an animal thataposs eaten it. Itaposs got tiny teeth marks and there are mouse droppings on it. You can see on the box and the wrapper. You can see droppings and pieces of oat.  Fiona told how one box was not touched but the other two had been and that there were black marks all around where some kind of vermin has been on top. She added: My husband ordered and spoke to Amazon online. They said aposalright, weaposll just replace the boxapos.They didnapost want photographs of it and it felt on their side they werenapost going to take any further action. Thataposs why I wanted to name and shame them on Facebook.Iaposd expect them to open a case and investigate the matter. Thereaposs clearly an issue at the warehouse. The cake-making business owner, who bakes from her home, plans to report the incident to the Food Standards Agency.  She said: I bake cakes for a living and have to go through hygiene standards for my job. This is revolting for me. Iaposve done my food hygiene standards certicate and I keep my kitchen clean. Making sure no pests get in is a priority. We wonapost be eating two of the boxes now, theyaposll be going straight in the bin. Iaposm going to report them to the Food Standards Agency today. It needs some investigation, especiallyAmazon is going to start selling more food products. An Amazon spokesperson said: We are working directly with the customer to make things right. A Graze spokesperson said: Weaposd like to offer our sincere apologies to Fiona for this experience and any concern caused. Ensuring that our products can always be enjoyed in the highest quality and condition is our priority and weaposre working closely with Amazon to urgently understand how this order has been delivered in this condition.

One officer claimed one lad was fine and a fire fighter wordlessly tossed a blanket over the other dead boyaposs head in front of his devastated parent. Angela Pearson and Sarah Turner had rushed to the scene upon hearing of a really bad accident involving their boys. Mrs Pearson was initially told her son Mason was fine, while Mrs Turner said she only learned George, , had died when she saw a firefighter throw a blanket over his head. Both lads were in one of two cars racing on the A, near Thirsk, when tragedy struck in March . Mrs Pearson was met by police stopping vehicles, and the Pc she spoke to radioed up and said that Mason was fine - he was alive. Once she was told her son had died, there didnapost seem to be a lot of compassion or empathy, she said.  We were sent on our merry way with no information about what to do, she added. Nobody came to see us and we didnapost receive a phone call - it was the longest night of our lives. Georgeaposs mum watched in horror as firefighters cut the victims free from the wreckage. After a while, the fire service turned the machinery and a big halogen lamp off and started to walk away, she said.  One of them came back and from about seven foot away he just threw a blanket over Georgeaposs head and that was the moment I knew heaposd gone, that image will live with me forever. Nobody said, aposcome and sit down, I need to explain somethingapos, she added, The boys were were passengers in a VW Bora being driven by Luke Ridley.  He was jailed for  years after admitting two counts of causing death by dangerous driving and five counts of causing serious injury. William Corser was in another car and racing Ridley when the crash happened between Busby Stoop and Carlton Miniott. He was jailed for  months after admitting dangerous driving. North Yorkshire Police said: We recognise that the way that we initially responded to and supported the two families of those who had died, in the aftermath of the collision, was below the standard we should have achieved and added to their distress.  We are very sorry that the level of service we provided fell short, and for any additional distress that was caused, and we would like to thank them for raising this with us so that we can ensure it does not happen again. North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said: This was a tragic, complex and extremely emotive incident involving multiple casualties, including a family member of a local responding firefighter.  Our aim is to treat all those involved with dignity and respect and we strive to learn where we can make improvements in our response to incidents. At the time of the incident it was revealed that a teenage boy left with severe injuries was the son of a firefighter. Heartbroken friends described Mason and George as top lads after they died at the scene of the three-vehicle crash.

Samantha Stevens. , has relapse remitting MS, an incurable neurological condition which involves the immune system attacking nerves in the brain and spinal cord. She was first diagnosed with the lelong disease in  when her daughter was just a year old, Liverpool Echo reports. The ailment - which causes tiredness, vision problems and issues with balance or walking - manested in Samanthaaposs case with blindness whenever her core temperature rose too high.She would lose her eyesight completely in one eye whenever she took a hot shower and during hot summer days.Have your say on Samanthaaposs story in the comment section Speaking to the Liverpool Echo, she said: My daughter was a year old and I just lost sight in one of my eyes, I think MS can quite often present with visual disturbances. My auntie struggled with MS for a long time and she got to the point where she lost mobility in her arms and legs and I saw that growing up, so my first thought was aposoh no am I going to end up bed riddenapos as many with the condition do. I had an MRI scan and a lumbar puncture to confirm my diagnosis, thereaposs a lot of invisible symptomsI have a hot shower, I lose my eyesight, in the summeritaposs too warm, I lose my eyesight. I am fortunate that when my core temperature goes back to normal I do regain my sight. The Multiple Sclerosis society estimates that there are over , people with MS in the UK, and that nearly  people are newly diagnosed each year. Samantha, from Newton-le-Willows, now cares for her two daughters on her own, despite her condition progressing further requiring her to use a walking stick. She said: A lot of the time, with the relapses, you will have a problem and your immune system will sort of repair itself, but now that Iaposm in the progressive stage of my disease, there isnapost any repair now. I have extra aids at home, extra rails and equipment in the bathroom to help me with my showers and that sort of thing. The mum-of-two believes her devastating condition has strengthened her relationship with her two daughters aged  and . She said: There are small things like struggling to fill in a form when my kids bring them home from school because I struggle to hold a pen. My kids actually help quite a lot with cooking, and lting pans from the cooker to the sink and so on. Theyaposve almost taken on sort of a careraposs role which is rubbish because you hope your children will have as much as a childhood as they can. My older daughter understands the disease and its effect and she definitely worries, but Iaposd say it affects our relationship positively because I think they have a lot of admiration for me and what I have to do without the help of her their dad. He left when things got bad to have a better le without the burden of me I suppose, so it is just me and the girls.  Samantha is on a waiting list for NHS treatment but believes her best hope is to travel abroad and receive experimental stem cell treatment, that she claims to have up to a % success rate in treating her condition.She said: It is a risky and potentially dangerous procedure but I really don’t have many options. If there’s even a small chance that my disease progression can be stopped I’m willing to take the risk.Samantha is raising money to help fund her trip for treatment, you can donate via her GoFundMe page.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSImmune systemMultiple sclerosisDisabilityParenting\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Longstaffe is the writers middle nameMiners strike in  Image: Daily RecordopinionByPaul Routledge:,  Jan | commentsIt was something of a mystery why I was attracted to the cause of the miners. True, the National Union of Mineworkers was never out of the headlines in the Seventies and Eighties when I was Labour Editor of The Times. But that didn’t quite explain why I felt at home with them. Now I learn that it’s been in my blood for nigh on  years. The  Census shows my forebear Joseph Routledge, born in Durham in , was a miner, living in Shinclfe and married to Alice, nee Longstaff. Longstaffe is my middle name. I don’t know where the “e” came from.  Joseph and his family became Mormons and for a time he emigrated to Salt Lake City in the USA before ing, disillusioned, to his native county. Joseph went back into mining, studied hard and gained a manager’s certicate and was in charge of Ryhope colliery, Sunderland, for at least  years. Joseph was also the co-inventor of a safety lamp for use underground, and must have been quite well thought-of despite being the boss, credited with trying to keep the miners happy. He died in , and his widow, Alice,  years later. They are both commemorated in a stained-glass window in St Paul’s Church, Ryhope. Remarkable. I was dimly aware of these facts before, in relation to a novel by the Sunderland writer Glenda Craig. But I am indebted to the Routledge Clan Society, of which I am now a member, and its newsletter, The Blackmail, for the full story. No, I don’t know why they call it that – something  to find out. Maybe it’s what we paid the reivers who stole our cattle when we lived on the Scottish borders.

A spokesperson from the branch said: “Alaska and her friends were underweight and poorly fed, never walked, rarely saw the outside world, and had limited contact with people. “Despite everything they’d been through, all three dogs were friendly and affectionate with everyone they met.”  Alaska had lumps on her body that were all removed, one of which was found to be cancerous. Her tumour was successfully removed and vets confirmed that there is no sign the cancer had spread. After treatment, Alaska went up for rehoming in July, and while her friends were both rehomed, she’s still waiting, and simply can’t understand why. So, in the hopes of finding a forever home, she’s dressed up as a Dalmatian with a special winter coat in a bid to win over adopters who may be put off by her breed. We know our dogs have quirky personalities, but have you ever thought it might be down to the stars  Just like us, our pups also have their own star signs, and their traits and personalities may very well be affected by them.Feeling intrigued  Discover your dog’s star sign and what it means on our sister site TeamDogsapos Astrology Chart. The rescue added: “Of course, they shouldn’t be put off by Alaska’s breed. Staffies can make absolutely wonderful pets and companions, and Alaska will make the best addition to the right home. She is a happy girl who always greets us with a waggy tail. She has the most beautul eyes and so much love to give she just wants someone to love her in . “She is a friendly, sweet, sociable girl who absolutely loves spending time with people. She’s incredibly smart and picks up new things quickly. “She loves to snf for treats and learn new tricks. She walks nicely on the lead but can be reactive with other dogs so would like a new home where she can enjoy walks in quiet areas.” Alaska is looking for a foster home or a forever home in a quiet, calm, adult-only household without other pets. She’d like a secure, enclosed garden where she can play, with calm, patient owners who can slowly teach her how to settle into a new routine.  Alaska would benefit from additional training as she can be boisterous and get over-excited at times. The branch behaviourist will be on hand to help new adopters with this. “Unfortunately Alaska suffers from chronic gut disease which has caused some bouts of illness and meant she’s struggled to put on weight,” the spokesperson added. “She has a specialist diet and medication which has helped and we’re confident this will improve once she’s out of the kennel environment, which she finds incredibly stressful.” Ideally Alaska’s adopters would live within  miles of the branch so the team can continue to support her in her new home.Find out more about Alaskaonlineor contact the team on   or dogrehoming@rspca-crewenantwich.org.uk for more information.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TeamDogsDogsAnimals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The shocking video, which also includes frequent bad language, was shown to year  pupils as part of the religious studies syllabus at Excel Academy, in Sneyd Green, Stoke-on-Trent. It was included as part of a lesson on religious symbols last week and showed two cartoon figures discussing the Taoist aposyin and yangapos symbol and what the best and worst things in the world they could imagine were. One character thinks of a cheese toastie as the best thing in the world and a sex toy covered in razor blades as a depiction of something evil. The school says the Youtube video was shown by a substitute teacher, who had used the wrong video link. It says the video was identied as being inappropriate when played and wonapost be used again. But pupil River Maddocks told Stoke-on-Trent Live the teacher had told the class the video contained offensive language before it was shown.The first swear word appears on-screen at  seconds and an image of Jesus Christ reading Playboy magazine appears at  seconds. At  seconds, the F-word is spoken. The sex toy imagery is not until more than two-and-a-half minutes into the four-minute-long video. River, , who is a Christian, said he was shocked by the content and scribbled down the name of the film so he could tell his mum and dad.  His parents, Leah and Eden Maddocks, of Smallthorne, were horried when they watched the video for themselves. Leah, aged , said: When River first told us about it we thought he must be exaggerating, but when we watched it, it was even worse than we thought. Whoever decided to show that in a lesson must not have watched it properly beforehand. Itaposs not just the bad language or the fact it is offensive to every faith going - there is a part with a cartoon depiction of something which they shouldnapost even know about at their age. When we watched it we were mortied. I donapost think it is suitable to be shown to any age group in a school. Posted to YouTube by the Sam OaposNella Academy, the expletive-ridden film is called Where Religious Symbols Come From ­- That Happened Thursday and features stickmen characters giving an explanation of where the symbols adopted by ious world religions originate. River said he was astonished to be shown the video during a lesson. He said: We were revising for an RE test and doing religious symbols. The teacher, who isnapost our normal teacher, said he had a video to show uswe needed help with it. I was shocked when I saw it. All the other kids were laughing. Itaposs really not appropriate for a school.  Riveraposs dad Eden, , added: As soon as he mentioned it I was fuming, but when we sat and watched it, it was even worse than I thought. The world is going bananasthat can be shown in a school. An Alpha Academies Trust spokesperson said: A supply teacher used an incorrect video link which was identied as being inappropriate when played and will not be used again. More stringent checks will be made moving forward to ensure this does not happen again.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Jesus of NazarethYouTubeEducationSchoolsToysSex toys\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

And while there, he decided to sport a hilarious disguise of a fake moustache,  nose, joke glasses and a red hat. But it seemed the disguise brought him even more attention, as photos from the holiday over  years ago show.However, the prince seemed to take the situation in good humour, and according to the Daily Mail told photographers that the prince would not be coming out today. Taking on a dferent persona is something that Charles appears to have passed on to his sons Prince William and Prince Harry. While at university in St Andrews, Scotland, William decided to go by a dferent name as he was keen to go under the radar.

And his dad Prince William revealed that activity was carrying out litter picking sessions, which left his son frustrated about the state of the planet. Speaking to a BBC podcast last year, William ulged: So George at school recently has been doing litter picking and I didnapost realise but talking to him the other day he was already showing that he was getting a bit confused and a bit sort of annoyed by the fact they went out litter picking one day and then the very next day they did the same route, same time and pretty much all the same litter they picked up back again.And I think that for him he was trying to understand how and where it all came from. He couldnapost understand, heaposs like, aposwell, we cleaned this. Why has it not gone away ’  Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm. Click here to sign up. William has been very vocal in the past  months about turning the tide on climate change and environmental problems.And heaposs previously said that he was concerned that George and his generation might still be talking about climate change in decades to come.  He added: But it shouldnapost be that thereaposs a third-generation now coming along having to ramp it up even more. And you know, for me, it would be an absolute disasterGeorge is sat here talking to you or your successor, you know in like  years time, whatever, still saying the same thing, because by then we will be too late.  It is thought that George and Charlotteaposs younger brother Prince Louis will join them at the same school in September after he turns four in April.As part of William and Kateaposs wishes to give them as normal an upbringing as possible, as soon as they walk through the school gates their kids are treated like any other child.And this means they must do what teachers tell them and follow the schoolaposs most important rule - just like everyone . Its website states: As you would expect of any Thomasaposs school, the most important school rule is aposBe Kindapos.

Ex-royal cook Darren McGrady says HM prefers to flavour the game meat with cranberries rather than relish or secret sauce but never has it sandwiched between a bread bun. Instead, she eats it naked on the plate.Do you enjoy reading about the royal family for all the best royal news from the Mirror here  Speaking to Insider last year, Mr McGrady said: “It always tickled me at Balmoral, we would make our own burgers. They would shoot deer, and we would do venison burgers.“There’d be gorgeous cranberry…stuffed into them, but we never set buns out. He went on to say: Her Majestyaposs Victorian upbringing dictates that the only thing you would pick up and eat with your fingers is afternoon tea. They would have burgers, but not the buns. So they would eat it with their kne and fork. The Queen holidays at the Balmoral estate in Scotland almost every August or September - last year for the first time in decades without Prince Philip, following his death in April.Mr McGrady worked as head chef at Buckingham Palace from  until , making food for Prince William and Harry, as well as Princess Diana. He also said the monarch hates pizza and during his time in her service, not a single pizza was ever served.  When he wasnapost prepping venison patties, the top chef was usually cooking up traditional French foods, he added.

The -year-old became Manchester’s first and only female bus driver in . Sheaposs continually driven Brits around in the decades since, but recentlylost her jobbecause she lacks the “capability” to drive the new model of bus used on her route.Bosses at Go North West said that, at .mtall, Tracey is too small for the vehicles due to the change in position of the wing mirrors and pillar on the assault screen. The changes mean she would have to lean back to use the mirror, so her feet would be off the pedals. However, trade union Unite say Tracey has been “designed” out of her job. Speaking to the , Tracey said she has been struggling emotionally since. She told how she has been forced to “put everything on hold financially” and is now unable to plan for her future. Over the festive period, she did not buy any Christmas presents and today sees the deadline to lodge her final appeal amid a cost of living crisis. During her decades of work, she faced countless comments and sexual remarks and dealt with it all in a male dominated industry - with % of bus drivers being male in . Tracey was initially suspended due to her height but then later dismissed with  weeks notice. She has since worked with her union, Unite, to try and resolve the situation. Go North West offered her a new contract, but with less hours, and therefore less pay, than her previous work. She would lose out on £ a month. The widowed mum-of-three has said she has a mortgage and cannot afford to take a pay cut. Celebrities have come out in support of her including actors Maxine Peake, Julie Hesmondhalgh and James Quinn. And now a petition demanding her restatement has over , signatures. Tracy is smaller than the average height for women in the UKbut the less than cm dference has jeopardised her job.  Unite general secretary Sharon Graham said: Tracey Scholes was the first woman bus driver at the Manchester depot. “Her appointment broke the mould for women in the bus industry. She has given  years of unblemished service. “It seems inconceivable, that due to the blind intransigence of its local management in Manchester, Go Ahead is now ready to watch unlimited damage to its international reputation as a result of the tawdry treatment of Tracey.  “But that is exactly what is happening. From Poland to Turkey, from Norway to Indonesia, media reports have pilloried the bull-headed stance of local Go Ahead management. A Go North West spokesperson said Scholes was a valued member of their team and that they had made a number of proposals to ensure Tracey could still work, but that these were rejected. They said: “The design of the mirrors on our buses was agreed after consultation with Unite some time ago. All our other drivers of similar height to Tracey are able to view them safely. Dedicated, experienced, hardworking bus drivers are dficult to find and so we would never act lightly in a situation like this. We are sorry that we were left with no choice but to bring this driver’s employment to an end.” The company also said it is working to improve female representation at all levels, with a particular focus on attracting female bus drivers. The Go-Ahead Group have a target of raising the number of female bus drivers from % to % by .

Millions of Brits have made taking the tests part of their everyday lives to help prevent the spread of Covid infections. Dr Nathan, a doctor in London, says some people are testing themselves incorrectly and may be inadvertently going out while positive for the virus. He says the three most common mistakes are failing to spot positives, not reading the instructions and mixing up the best way to conduct the test, Manchester Evening News reports. Dr Nathan said: “Any positive line within  minutes, evenit is so faint that it is barely visible, equals a positive result, he said. “However,a faint line appears after  minutes, this can be ignored.” He added: “Don’t forget to avoid eating or drinking for at least  minutes before, to blow your nose and to wash your hands!”  “You should always follow the enclosed instructions, he continued. “If the test advises doing a throat and nose swab, do this. If it advises a nose swab only, do this. “That being said, there are some anecdotal reports of people getting a positive throat swab and a negative nose swab, and later developing symptoms and a positive PCR.”Dr Nathan who shares advice about Covid on his Instagram, @expedition_doctor. It comes as a new rule change is set to come into effect tomorrow, as the government works on keeping on top of coronavirus case numbers.There have been dficulties keeping track of case numbers in recent weeks due to shortages of lateral flow testsand polymerase chain reactiontests.Despite this, case numbers have remained high and have reached record levels since the Omicron iant took a hold on the country.  The UKaposs official Covid death toll passed , on Saturday January . Currently, people who test positive for Covid with no symptoms on a lateral flow test are required to take a PCR to confirm their status. This will change from January . They will still have to isolate for at least seven days, but only from the date of their positive lateral flow test.

Here’s everything you need to know about the rule change and when you will still be expected to do a PCR testA major rule change means fewer people need to take a PCR test to confirmthey are Covid positive Image: Getty ImagesByMalvika Padin:,  Jan | comments A new Covid testing rule has come into effect in England as of today, January , under which fewer people will be required to get a PCR to test for infection. Under this rule, someone who tests positive on a lateral flow test will no longer need to get a follow-up PCRthey have no symptoms of the virus. If you have a positive lateral flow test, you will need to self-isolate immediately. Since you no longer need to double check with a PCR, this means your -day self-isolation period starts earlier. If you get a negative lateral flow on day six and seven, then you can even end your self-isolation early.Despite the new rule, there are still over a dozen reasons when you still have to get a PCR test.  The government has outlined certain exceptions to the rule change. For instance, you should always get a PCR testyou have symptoms of Covid, regardless of the result of lateral flow.This includes not just the three classic signs of high temperature, new or persistent cough and loss of smell or taste, but the more unusual symptoms that are being increasingly reported.You should also get a PCR doneyouaposve been in contact with someone who’s tested positive, evenyou are fully vaccinated.  There are many other reasons to get a PCR test in England under government guidance. Hereaposs the full list:Youaposve been asked to get a test by a local council or someone from NHS Test and Trace A GP or other health professional has asked you to get a test Youaposre taking part in a government pilot project Youaposve been asked to get a test to confirm a positive result Youaposve received an unclear result and were told to get a second test Youaposre in the National Tactical Response Group You are due to have an operation in hospital People who are eligible for the £ Test and Trace Support Paymentwill be asked to take a PCR so they can access financial support People participating in research or surveillance programmes may still be asked to take a follow-up PCR test The one million people in England who are at particular risk of becoming seriously ill from Covid and are involved in new research of treatmentsThe rules and exceptions y between nations. For instance, in Scotland you should book a PCR testyou have had two or more void lateral flow test results.

The little boy was found in a dirty, wet towel and covered in dried blood with his umbilical cord still attached, according to police in Hobbs, New Mexico.They confirmed a young woman, Alexis Avila, , confessed after being charged with child abuse and the attempted murder of her infant child relating to the Friday night incident, local site KOB reports.In CCTV footage, a white car is seen pulling up to the car park rubbish bins before a person in the back seat hangs out of the window to chuck a black bag inside. Around six hours after the suspect sped off, a group of dumpster ers arrived and heard a faint wail from the bag.  Acting Hobbs Police Chief August Fons said the little one was wrapped in a dirty, wet towel and covered in dried blood when he was found. The youngsteraposs umbilical cord was also still attached to his belly button, he added. The chief praised the group who found the baby for their collective quick response which saved his le.

The same camera that filmed the crime also filmed the moment the group, who have been called angels by local media, found the abandoned babe.Local site KOB said the CCTV captures the moment the witnesses start digging through the same dumpster and pull out a black bag before looking through it.Just seconds later a woman lays eyes on the child and opens the bag, retrieving the newborn and tending to it. Police tracked the number plate on the white car and arrested Avila.  According to reports, she said she did not know she was pregnant until last week when she looked for treatment for abdominal pain. She said the babyaposs father is a juvenile and she ended her relationship with him back in August. The officers also said she told them that she gave birth in her parentsapos bathroom and panicked. Avila allegedly stuffed the baby inside two plastic bags, one with other trash, and left it in the dumpster. The baby was taken to a nearby hospital after the rescue and later travelled by helicopter to another hospital in Lubbock, Texas, where he remains in stable condition. The police declined to release any additional information on the child.If you have been affected by this story, advice and support can be found at Sands .

Some people want as much medical help and support available, while others want as little intervention as possible. Thereaposs no right or wrong way to have a baby.One mum, however, has left people equally surprised and impressed with just how independently she gave birth to her son, Fern, without any help at all.Alice Llani @aliceandfernhas gained an impressive following on TikTok, thanks to sharing details of her vegan and holistic lestyle and approach to motherhood.In her most recent clip, the mum revealed how she, not only gave birth alone on her toilet, but she even had to pull her own placenta out afterwards.

When people argue with me but don’t realise I freebirthed my son myself on my toilet, resuscitated him myself, reached my entire hand inside to pull out my placenta, then bfhim for  months, she wrote alongside the clip. In another clip, Alice went into more detail where she explained that she actually spent  hours in labour in her bathtub, before eventually giving birth on the toilet. When pressed as to why she hadnapost opted for a hospital birth like the majority of first time mums, she said: If you manage to push a baby out laying down without breaking your tailbone tearing good for you but I’m not going to risk it. She continued: Things moved really fast when I was pushing baby Fern out. The labour dragged on for  hours but the pushing was fast. I’d been watching free births non-stop so when he came out my focus wasn’t, aposAh, I have a babyapos, it was checking up on him, because I was the aposdoctor.apos So I was looking for his colour and his colour was so good, but he didn’t breathe immediately. After Fern was born, Alice was really sleepy and was frightened she was going to fall asleep with her placenta still inside, so after trying all the natural methods to bring it out, she ended up reaching up inside and pull it out herself.

But one man has found himself experiencing both ends of the spectrum after the Covid- pandemic took him from embracing his unique name to being the butt of endless jokes. Kovid Kapoor, from Bangalore, Karnataka, India, always thought his name was special - until early  when he realised he now shares his name with a virus that has caused a global health crisis. The -year-old trip agency owner said: It is crazy how I am getting all this attention for my name.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Before the pandemic, Iaposve always thought it was a unique name. I have met just one another Kovid in college and we instantly connected because I never found anyone with the same name. Kovidaposs name was chosen by his mum after she saw it in a religious hymn and the word - which is spelt with a soft aposdapos - means scholar in Hindi. And although the pandemic has made him second guess his love for his name, Kovid says heaposs embracing the hilarity of the situation as best he can.  He added: I was amused when the WHO first announced Covid in . Friends and relatives started sharing the reports with me. It was surprising at first. For three months straight, my name was on TV every day although with a slight spelling dference. It felt great. My mother was equally amused. But as the pandemic spread, Kovid found that more people began to think he was lying about his name - or that heaposd changed it for a joke. In one hilarious instance, Kovidaposs friends ordered a personalised cake for his th birthday last year, but after thinking the message was a joke, the baker changed his name to aposCovidapos. The man has also had baristas in coffee shops stare at him bemused when he gives them his name and has been laughed at by security officials. He said: People really find it amusing, they think I am joking or have changed the name. I have changed my Twitter bio to aposmy name is Kovid and I am not a virus.apos Kovid is making the best out of the awkward situation though and hopes the increased interest in his name will help bring more traffic to the trip agency that he owns.

Sometimes items arrive looking exactly as described but others... itaposs a little disappointing.Sadly, one Amazon knows this all too well after ordering a cute little black dress from TikTok, only for it to arrive and barely protect her modesty. The TikTok user, who goes by the name Girlfriend online, bought a fullblack dress with a plunging neckline and extremely high slits up the front, which leave very little to the imagination. Posting from her handle @girlfriendxoxoxo, she explained: So I bought a new dress off Amazon. It looked really really cute online, but on me... I’m just dying. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. This is the dress. I’m laughing because I just can’t decide what to do. There’s not enough fabric here and there’s definitely not enough fabric here, continued, while laughing her head off. I’m giggling, sorry, because it’s funny to me - I have a very cute body but I’ve been duped by Amazon, dammit! Despite her giggles, many of her followers were quick to comment saying just how good she looks in the dress. That is absolutely gorgeous on you, one wrote, while another added: I love the way it looks! A third wrote: Itaposs such a cute dress though, is there any chance youaposd be able to tailor it ! Fortunately, the creative woman was able to find a work around to make the dress work, and ended up styling it with a gorgeous black corset on top and it looks amazing.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

Prince Giacomo Bonanno di Linguaglossa, , is believed to have met -year-old Tanya Yashenko, from Belarus, at a dinner party in . It is said the couple enjoyed a whirlwind romance, holidaying in destinations such as Monte Carlo, Dubai and the Males. The Times reported he also gave her a Mercedes worth €,, a €, share in a Rome bed and breakfast, expensive jewellery and €, to help her to rent a flat in the centre of Rome. According to Italian media, Yashenko filed a legal complaint against the prince last year, alleging that he was stalking her and hired a psychiatrist to assist with her case.However, newspaper Il Messaggero reports that the expert has now switched sides and accuses Yashenko of taking advantage of the psychological fragility of Linguaglossa.The Italian press also reportedly obtained text messages exchanged between the pair, where she criticised the prince for not being generous enough.

It is claimed the prince was left traumatised after the break-up of his earlier marriage. Yashenko has denied any wrongdoing and has insisted that the prince withdraw his accusations. At the weekend, the Italian prince took to his Facebook page, where he said he wanted to “publicly apologise to my partner Tanya Yashenko for my  statements. He added: I would like to explain that jealousy is a big reason for my actions. But the gts I gave I don’t want back.” It also emerged that the pair spent Christmas and New Year together.But the princeaposs lawyer Armando Fergola told the: She continues to try to manipulate him. He has certainly not withdrawn his accusations and will not do so.“He is still very fragile and the love affair has clouded his judgment. The primary aim of this case is to protect him from her, both psychologically and economically. Getting her to pay back the money is a secondary objective.” Read MoreRead MoreFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Love\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Doctors said she was healthy and avoided frostbite despite the intense cold. The baby was in a cardboard box designed to store eggs and had been left to freeze to death, say police. Law enforcement are now seeking the baby’s parents and announced an investigation into the attempted murder of the child. “We were just out for a walk in the evening, when we saw a box,” said Renat. “We walked closer and heard a squeaking sound. We thought there were puppies inside the box. “But when we turned our phone torches on to see what was inside, there was a tiny baby - a girl. “She was lying there like a little doll, so tiny. “We were so stunned we didn’t even know for some seconds what to do, and where to run. “She had no clothes on her, she was wrapped in a piece of fabric, with a bottle next to her.” The lads tried to flag down a car - but no one stopped.  So Renat called his father saying: “Dad, we found a baby girl in the box.” “I rushed to them with my we, and took the baby to the hospital,” said Dmitry, . We were all shocked. The doctors had a careful look and said she was fine, not even frostbitten.  “My son and his friends must have picked her up just in time.” Medics say the baby - two or three days old - was probably born at home, then abandoned by the mother. Rinat’s mother Anna said: “We are parents to three sons, so having a daughter was our long-term dream. We are hoping we’ll be given a chance to adopt her.”  The Novosibirsk region children’s ombudswoman is backing the move. “We will be supporting the family’s desire to adopt the baby,” said Nadezhda Boltenko. Investigative committee operative Yekaterina Petrushina said: “A criminal case was initiated into the attempted murder of a minor.” Russian parliament speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said: “This story in Novosibirsk region didnapost end in tragedy only thanks to the care of the young men. “A newborn baby was rescued. She was abandoned by those who were supposed to care for her. “Instead she was left to die in the cold by the side of the road. “Were these lad not to walk on this quiet road, she would have perished from hypothermia. “There is no excuse for the fiends who abandoned the baby - this is a monstrous act.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BabiesHospitalsSnowNewborn babyTeenagersPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Brahamdev Mandal, , had all the vaccines in just  months and even managed to book two less than  minutes apart on the same day. The serial-vaxxer was only able to sign up for extra jabs by lying to health officials and using the ID of other people who also needed the lesaving serum. He said he wanted to feel stronger during the pandemic and rid himself of the joint pain he has suffered for eight years. The former postman has been accused of a string of offences by police in the village of Orai, in Bihar, India where he lives.  Puraini police station cop Deepak Chandra Das said Mandal was booked under sections ,  and  of the Indian Penal Code respectively. However, under section , the accused may get leniency due to his age. Among his jabs, Mandal got two vaccines inside  minutes on the same day at Puraini health facility on April  last year. The OAP bragged: I have taken vaccines and I recommend everyone to take them. Itaposs quite beneficial.  The Government has taken an incredible step as it helps back pains too. You should take it. My oxygen level has improved and I havenapost caught a cold since getting a jab. Mandal claimed he got nine of the jabs using his own ID card. Station house officer Das said: Mandal has taken  vaccines at dferent dates using dferent identity cards lying to the health officials. This act is a violation of the Covid- vaccination rule. He has taken vaccines between February , , to January , .One medic urged for officials to plug such loopholes. This is a massive loophole when it comes to the surveillance system. We need to plug in such loopholes, they said.

There were many contributing factors according to the sherf, some of which would have been avoided with the crystal clear benefit of hindsight.As the sherf noted, the owners took pride in their vessel, kept it well maintained and considered it to be a safe boat.

I don’t think I would have been able to get through it without that support, so to those who ran alongside me, part of the way, or cycled, or just popped up to cheer me on, a huge thank you.”Among those who ran with Chris in the final challenge was Scottish Rugby’s welfare manager Stuart Dow, who completed his first marathon.Referee Hollie Davidson and Scotland women’s stand-off Helen Nelson joined the runners on the last section from Edinburgh’s Meadows to Meggetland.Chris added: “There’s a hot tub with my name on it that I’m desperate to get to now. Would I do any more marathons  No, not at this stage. Marathons are definitely off the script.“But what I do take from this is that when you have such a purpose, a higher purpose, to do something, then you can pretty much do anything with the right support network.”.removeLast word to dad Roy, who could not resist in joining in at stages along the route.He said: “I’m proud of him.

It#s estimated that  million plant pots and seed trays are sold every year and the majority are sent to landfill or are incinerated.But there are non-plastic alternatives such as biodegradable pots made using materials like coir, wood chips, bamboo and rice husks.A growing number of garden centres and nurseries use biodegradable pots, but it#s worth checking out their sustainability policies.You can also make your own pots using newspaper or toilet roll tubes.And now is a good time to make your own supplies of biodegradable pots so you have stock for the planting season in a couple of months.If you#ve got a supply of old newspapers to hand, simply roll a cm-wide strip of newspaper tightly around a glass tumbler, leaving cm beyond the bottom of the glass.Fold the excess paper across the bottom, then press the glass down to flatten the pot#s base.There is no need to fix your paper pot with tape, just slide it off the glass.When ready to plant, just fill with compost.Taking good care of existing plastic is a good way to ensure you don#t have to keep buying it – so reuse any plant pots you have again and again for new seedlings, cuttings and plants.If you look after your propagator trays and lids, repairing themthey crack, they will last for several seasons.You can also reuse compost bags to store compost or turn leaves into leaf mould.The added bonus of recycling or reusing items in the garden is that it also reduces cost – as does growing from seed rather than buying established plants.Even in winter, you can grow something from seed, you just need a seed tray and a window ledge, or small cold frame or greenhouse – whatever space and budgets allow.For anyone growing their own vegetables, January is great for sowing onions.If you sow onions then, it saves the expense of buying onion sets – small bulbs – later, and you can have a much larger crop of onions in the summer.Onions seeds do not have a long shelf-le, so it#s best to buy new seeds each year.Seeds will germinate between C and C, one or two weeks after sowing.When large enough to handle, transplant to inidual small pots and keep in a bright, frost-free place until April when they can be planted outside.Varieties to try include: Setton – high yield, yellow skinned and good storage potential Red Baron – a late maturing red onion with globe shaped bulbs and strong taste and Hybound – an early iety with bronze-brown skins which is excellent for long-term storage.January is often the coldest month in the garden but there are still some things you can be doing to keep busy.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, January might be the middle of winter but, as the days en, the garden starts to grow.It is a great time to plan for the coming gardening year and to order seeds and plants.Enjoy the fresh air on dry sunny days, and check your winter protection, stakes, ties and supports are still working after any severe weather.Also, put out food for birds and leave some garden areas uncut, a little longer, to provide shelter for wildle in your garden.Top three jobs this month: clean pots and greenhouses ready for spring, dig over empty or unused plots, and prune apple and pear trees."},{"url":null,"title":"district news january 7 2022","story":"Tiny Glenbarr Primary School, which has just six pupils, has just missed out on being named Scotland#s most scenic school.More than , votes were cast in a Twitter contest organised by Henry Hepburn, news editor at education resource magazine and website Tes Scotland, to highlight the stunning locations of Scotland#s schools.The competition attracted  schools and celebrities even got involved, re-Tweeting posts to boost votes during the few days of competition in December.Despite having so few students, Glenbarr reached the nail-biting semi-final, just short of the final.With views overlooking Ben Nevis, Lochaber High School won in the end, narrowly beating Morgan Academy in Dundee.MID ARGYLLVolunteers are needed to help provide and expand PCR testing in several locations across the NHS Highland region, including Tarbert and Lochgilphead.Volunteers will be co-ordinated by the British Red Cross.

This equipment has the advantage of raising driver awareness of the technology available, without the need to proceed with enforcement.#Councillors agreed that officials should investigate the ious forms of remote speed detection equipment, in consultation with Strathclyde Police and the Scottish Office, as trunk roads authority, and report back.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe New Year in Campbeltown was celebrated quietly at the weekend.Apart from a few breathalyser tests, police said the town was remarkably quiet. There were no incidents of breach of the peace, assaults and so on.All was peaceful on Islay too.No public houses or hotel bars were open to the public on New Year#s Day, which undoubtedly helped to keep everything quiet.There was one New Year#s Day incident. A van belonging to the Redfusion television company struck a wall on Low Askomill. Nobody was hurt.The breathalyser appears to have retained its purpose.All the burgh#s taxis were kept going non-stop over the Christmas and New Year period and operators reported heavy bookings.The West Coast coaches were also well used by people who sensibly left the car at home.Shops were kept busy during the few festive days and licensed grocers sold big amounts of the #cratur# and other alcoholic drinks.Christmas and New Year Day babies expected at Craigard Maternity Hospital failed to arrive and the staff had a quiet time of it.A large crowd of people of all denominations and from all over the country converged on Carradale House, home of the authoress Mrs Naomi Mitchison, to take part in the New Year celebrations.This was the rd time that Mrs Mitchison had played host to a large number of guests at Carradale.Politicians, government workers, farmers and fishermen all mingled together, danced, sung and sampled an excellent buffet.Many Carradale villagers were also present.Addressing the guests, Mrs Mitchison talked about the effects of the Common Market and fishermen.

This original fragment is now in the National Museum of Scotland but its discovery suggested something very signicant about Aberlady’s early history.The design on the fragment was similar to the artwork of the Lindisfarne Gospels, an illuminated manuscript made on Holy Island and completed around AD. This Gospel book is a priceless national treasure, probably created by Eadfrith, the Bishop of Lindisfarne.Ian has a passion for history, especially early Medieval history in the time before Scotland, and so the cross fragment had always fascinated him. The dimensions of the cross fragment suggested that, before it was broken, it would have stood about five metres tall.“A large cross with this level of ornate carving would only be commissioned and erected at a place of some importance,” he told me.“The Celtic Church was widening and deepening its influence and its leaders now had the ear of kings. Royal endowments of land and wealth to the Church and rewards to loyal and battle-hardened thanes co-existed. This was very much a time of devout holy men and warlords. It was such an exciting piece of evidence of Aberlady’s early history.”Ian explained that a cross of similar date and style at Abercorn in West Lothian was very probably carved by the same person, or team of masons, and gave an idea of what the rest of the cross at Aberlady might have looked like. Intriguingly, there were three fragments of that cross.When he told me this, my thoughts wandered for a moment. Here we were, having a wee drink in a pub, talking about a craftsman, or group of craftsmen, whose skill and creativity has been preserved for well over a thousand years, and yet we know nothing about them, not even their names. I raised a glass to them and the countless thousands of skilled stonemasons, joiners, builders and artists of all kinds who really did build our historic monuments, but whom history almost never credits.But, I thought, at least we know who made the beautul recreation: Barry Grove, who also carved the reconstruction of the Pictish cross-slab at Hilton of Cadboll – and he used the same simple tools and techniques that would have been used by those earlier stone masons. The cross was unveiled in Aberlady’s Memorial Garden on December , .Ian then told me of the lost ecclesiastical settlement of Pefferham. He explained that there was a medieval document called Historia Regum, meaning History of the Kings. It was written in the th century and is usually credited to Symeon of Durham. This document listed all the main churches of existence in the Northumbrian diocese of St Cuthbert during the ninth and th centuries AD. Aberlady would have been part of this diocese.“Each of the important churches of the diocese, including Melrose, Abercorn, Edinburgh, Auldhame and Tyninghame, are identied in a clockwise direction in the Historia Regum,” Ian explained. “But there is one church mentioned in that document that is lost in time and seems to have vanished from both maps and memories. It was known as Pefferham, seemingly east of Edinburgh and west of Auldhame.”The western branch of the Peffer Burn flows into Aberlady, of course, and place-name evidence places the village on a route taken by monks travelling between the two great seats of learning of the Celtic Church at this time: Iona and Lindisfarne on Holy Island.This route became a holy highway connecting the two major religious sites, and one very likely taken by St Aidan, who left Iona to establish the church on Lindisfarne. In this context, a high cross here at Aberlady, or Pefferhamyou prefer, becomes quite plausible.More evidence emerged from metal finds in the Glebe Field immediately north of the present church. The tip of an ornately carved bishop’s crosier and a carved representation of Madonna and child had been found by metal detectorists lots of coins too. Moreover, geophysical research located two seemingly overlapping oblong structures, which could have been Anglo-Saxon but perhaps over large when compared with others. The evidence was cumulating and convinced Ian of the need for archaeological research. Historic Environment Scotland agreed and Historical Monument Consent was given, and a case for funding was submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund.The project envisaged involving six local schools, as well as many local and not-so-local volunteers, and the funding was approved. The archaeological investigation in the Glebe Field, just north of the church, took place in .The results of the dig were astounding, revealing a signicant settlement of stone structures overlaying earlier timber structures dating to the seventh to th centuries. The largest collection of scattered metal objects dating from the Anglo-Saxon period ever discovered in Scotland came from the Glebe here, pointing firmly to a major settlement during that time.Ian happily told me that “prominent academic research experts have agreed that there is now sufficient artefactual, place-name and textual evidence to say that we can begin to tell the story of the ‘lost’ Anglo-Saxon settlement of Pefferham”. “In fact,” he added, “it seems that base hole for the original carved cross may have been discovered.”It was so fascinating to hear and there is not enough space here to go into all the details of the story, but fascinating leaflets have been produced by the conservation and history society which bring these exciting discoveries to le. But nothing compares to a visit to the village to view the locations and feel the presence of all this history, with brilliantly illustrated information and interpretative  by the society to guide your imagination.What has been achieved by Aberlady Conservation and History Society was summed up by Ruth Parsons, chief executive of Historic Environment Scotland, who has said: “The incredible work done by Aberlady Conservation and History Society has brought previously unknown history to light. It has added to our understanding of a period in history little understood, even by those who know most about it… this fabulous cross reconstruction is, quite simply, unique. Hopefully, it will stand for centuries.”I hope so too."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-new-housing-development-tranent-revealed","story":"Members of the public can learn about Persimmon Homes East Scotland’s plans for land between Lammermoor Terrace and the industrial units off Elphinstone Road on Wednesday.The developer is yet to reveal how many new homes or what size the properties would be on the site, which is currently farmland.A spokesperson for Persimmon Homes East Scotland said: “Persimmon Homes will host an online interactive consultation event on Thursday, January , between pm and pm.“Members of the public are invited to post questions on the proposals and a member of our team will be online to answer.”A formal application would need to be submitted to East Lothian Council following the public consultation.Members of the public would be given another chance to look at the plans and make any comment before they are potentially scrutinised by the council’s planning committee.Mike Falconer, chairman of Tranent and Elphinstone Community Council, encouraged any interested parties to attend the virtual consultation and find out more about the proposals.

Mercedes-Benz EQSIt wasnt just BMWs flagship EV that did well in recent safety tests. Mercedes-Benzs range-topping EQS also scored a full five stars under examination recently. The luxury saloon ed an adult occupant safety rating of %, while child occupant safety was also excellent with a score of %.A full suite of assistance systems helped it gain an % score for safety assist, while its protection against vulnerable road users was rated at %..

How, then, did it go for Raworth Before we could find out, politics show watchers began the day, as is traditional, with Sky News’ Trevor Phillips on Sunday. Having started his run last May as a maternity cover for Sophy Ridge, Phillips was the future once . Now he is the longest serving presenter in post.His first interview of  was with Nadhim Zahawi, former Vaccines Minister now Education Secretary for England and, for this day only, Minister for the Sunday shows.Mr Zahawi had already set the direction of the day with a Sunday Times interview in which he said it would be “helpful”the quarantine period could be cut from seven days to five.He also, according to the report, said free lateral flow tests were on the way out. In front of the cameras, though, he said that was not the case. Scotland’s First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, had already called the move to scrap free tests “utterly wrongheaded”.: Warning on free testsPhillips’s running order also included João Vale de Almeida, the EU’s ambassador to the UK, on Northern Ireland and trade the First Minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, on dferences in Covid restrictions around the UK and Marvin Rees, mayor of Bristol, on the Colston statue verdict. It was a newsy mix that made for a lively hour.Sunday Morning had Mr Zahawi and Rachel Reeves, Shadow Chancellor, as well as an interview with a hospital chief executive. In keeping with Marr show tradition there was an arts segment, this one featuring Elizabeth McGovern, aka Cora Crawley of Downton Abbey fame, and her new play about fellow actor, Ava Gardner. The show’s other regular, the newspaper review, had also survived intact, as had the set.Sunday Morning was similar to Marr while at the same time very dferent. Where Marr’s show was fleet of foot and proactive, Sunday Morning had the air of a programme that was put together last Tuesday and not changed since. Where Marr set out to make headlines, Sunday Morning came across asit wanted to have no impact at all.In short, Sunday Morning, like its title, felt safe, bland, BBC.Fair enough, butthe Raworth shows prove popular with audiences, and BBC management, it could influence the selection of the new host.Comparing Marr and Sunday Morning has little to do with the presenters personally. Both are experienced, highly respected journalists. But broadly speaking they represent dferent styles and approaches to the jobRaworth, for example, is BBC through and through, cool, calm, hard to read. In recent years it has seemed as though she was getting ready to take on a Dimbleby role with a place at great state occasions.: Covid, the latest figuresMarr, in contrast, with a hinterland in newspapers before joining the BBC, is more of a scrapper whose interview style could best be described as robust. He left the BBC precisely because he wanted to express a view and shake things up.Which style do viewers prefer  It is a question being asked not just at the BBC but throughout the industry as a whole. GB News thought it had the answer by hiring “big personalities”, only to find viewers cared just as much,not more, about basic standards. The signing of Piers Morgan to talkTV shows which way Rupert Murdoch sees the wind blowing.Alternatively, having had a taste of news and views mixing to a greater extent than before, UK audiences could be ready toto the more traditional fare offered by the main channels.Despite the dull title, Sunday Morning might prove to be a lively arrival after all."},{"url":null,"title":"letters-scotland-without-covid-funding-london","story":"“Our public health response is curtailed by lack of finance” she said last month, after the UK government added another £m of new money for Covid response. It doesn’t matter how much Westminster gives Holyrood – it will never be enough.What the Covid crisis shows is how much better Scotland is as part of the Union rather than separated from the world’s fth largest economy, with no central bank, no currency, no national grid, and with a government that wants to shut down North Sea gas and oil.From the rapid and unique development of the Astra Zeneca vaccine, free from the constraints of the European Medical Agency, through the support of the British Army, the roll-out of millions of free lateral flow tests , to the sharing and pooling of medical science across the four nations, the case for the Union speaks for itself.William Loneskie, Lauder.TIME IS RUNNING OUT FOR THE SNPNICOLA Sturgeon’s stance on lateral flow test kits being freely available betrays the core problem with SNP policies: great on the surface, huge problems underneath. Health minister Humza Yousaf is in the same boat .Lateral flow kits are expensive and, like all “free items” on the NHS, prone to abuse. Add in John Swinney’s exhortation to basically use one every time you go out, and not only does the bill rise alarmingly, so does the mountain of plastic waste.Mr Yousaf is not taking into account the damage to commerce nor staff availability nor even the mental health of many Scots.Ms Sturgeon effectively cancelled the holiday period for many and did huge collateral damage to the economy. The SNP is one-dimensional, focussing only on theof time until indyref, but there are three “normal” dimensions plus time and space.The government isn’t coping with the breadth or height of the problems it is facing, and time is running out for the SNP as is space for the endless excuses as to why little is working properly in Scotland today.Dr Gerald Edwards, Glasgow.WHAT HAPPENS TO ALL THOSE TEST KITS WHILE fully supporting the ongoing current pandemic injection campaign and the regime for frequent use of lateral flow tests, I cannot help but feel a gnawing and growing unease about the veritable mountain of many millions of single-use pieces of plastic we are creating, destined for landfill, this being anathema to the Greens among us.I also wonderany attempt is being made to reclaim and recycle the tonnes of, presumably high-grade stainless steel, from the teeming multitude of used syringe needles David J O’Hara, Scotstoun, Glasgow.THE UK MEDIA’S HARMFUL VIEW OF THE EUDAVID Leask’s article on “Scotland’s skin-deep relationship with the EU”highlights some crucial issues, not least the Scots’ affection but lack of detailed knowledge about the signicance of EU membership.That “we are not remotely interested in its detail” is in part true. That Scots “…do not keep up with what is happening in the EU or in its member states…and neither do our politicians” has been deeply concerning, but no surprise.Why might this be  During our tenure as members of the EU, the UK media largely ignored the wide-ranging signicance of our membership, unless an ‘EU bad’ headline was lazily accessible.I was always struck through my involvement with other member states how their national and, more importantly, regional press regularly featured balanced pieces on a new piece of legislation, new consultation, speeches or visits by Commissioners or delegations.By contrast, it was evident that large sections of the UK press indulged in clear campaigns of misinformation which at times verged on the ludicrous. The EU would fairly regularly send measured rebuttals to editors across the UK, but I cannot recall ever seeing these being published.Sometimes the detail doesn’t matter and sometimes it does. Our collective poor record in informing the public did however play a large part in the dreadful and internationally embarrassing decision to withdraw from the EU, the consequences of which we have not even started to realise, as David Leask observes. Our attachment to Europe is perhaps more at an emotional level and sometimes that is more than enough.Tony Fitzpatrick, Dumfries.A RISK INHERENT IN THE ASSISTED DYING BILLEILEEN McCartinmakes an excellent point about the dangers of the ‘slippery slope’ associated with legalising assisted suicide or euthanasia, as evidenced from the experiences of other countries where laws have been extended to include disabled people, children and those with mental illnesses.She states that many Liberal Democrats oppose Liam McArthur’s proposals but she is incorrect in claiming that “the current Assisted Dying Bill … in no way reflects Lib Dem policy”. Sadly, the Scottish Liberal Democrats did adopt just such a policy in , which was reaffirmed in  by the UK Liberal Democrats in a motion which made specic reference to Mr McArthur’s proposed Bill.Of course, like all previous attempts to legalise assisted suicide, Mr McArthur has failed to address the concerns that exist about how to safeguard those who are vulnerable to pressure being exerted by others with questionable motives, such as access to a potential inheritance or the desire to free up beds in hospitals or care homes.For example, most of those gaining assistance from doctors to commit suicide in Oregon now regularly cite the “fear of being a burden on family, friends or caregivers” as their reason for seeking death.The bill would provide a cheap solution for policy-makers or NHS managers, enabling them to sidestep their obligations to address the unmet need for palliative care. It would make the situation worse.The experience of those countries which have gone down the assisted suicide or euthanasia route shows that the development of palliative care is impeded when such legislation is in place.Faced with shortages of NHS resources, an overstretched workforce due to the pandemic and the prospect of huge savings to be made by enabling patients to end their lives prematurely, can we really trust politicians to come up with a law containing adequate safeguards which will prevent abuses from occurring Dr Gordon Macdonald, CEO, Care Not Killing, Glasgow.THE ABORTION CONUNDRUMI HAVE never understood why abortion has not been brought in to the discussion about assisted dying.It is perfectly legal to end a le that has not been lived , whereas people who have lived what they describe as a happy and full le and now wish to end it, either because of, or ahead of, intolerable, unmanageable pain, are unable to make this decision for themselves.Why is it permissible to end one unlived le but not another fully lived le Kathleen Gorrie, Helensburgh.NOT ALL SUFFERING CAN BE RELIEVEDI AM a retired doctor, and a Catholic opposed to assisted dying legislation.Like Lilian McDade , I have watched my -year-old son die. I have witnessed the suffering of patients, of their family and friends, and also within my own family. I don’t believe we can relieve all suffering, either physical or mental.However, I dfer from your previous correspondents. As a doctor, I felt my role was to relieve suffering where I could and to acknowledge and respect the patient and her family when I was unable to provide relief. As a doctor and a person, it was not my role to end her le, only to be present.Some of us have charmed lives and happy deaths, but some have dficult lives and dficult deaths.I believe a caring society acknowledges this and acts to help. Offering death, however, is not acceptable to doctors, nurses or human beings.We ought to oppose assisted dying legislation.Miriam Deeny McKernan, Rutherglen. "},{"url":null,"title":"green-scotland-cop26-climate-investigation-full","story":"Our subscribers will get exclusive access as we look to answer the pressing questions in Scotlands climate crisis fight.As the COP conference looms on the horizon, we will leave no stone unturned in a bid to stimulate discussion and debate on this crucial topic.Find out more about our exclusive £ for two months offer here. From the hundreds of sites and big-name companies that broke environmental rules, to the most polluted streets in Scotland, readers can expect ground-breaking exclusives, in-depth analysis, and interactive content – as well as regular live videos, giving you the chance to speak directly with the award-winning reporters behind the stories.Here, you can find every article published in the week-long investigation so far - with this piece being updated daily with new exclusive stories.To make sure you do not miss out on the high-quality insight, join us today by taking out a subscription for just £ for two months here.More than  industrial sites across Scotland have been officially damned as “unsatisfactory” on pollution, according to data from the Scottish Environment Protection Agencyseen by The Ferret.Sepa assessed the environmental performance of two big oil companies, ExxonMobil and Ineos, as “very poor” in .

The rest of the six were Starling, HSBC and the The Co-Operative Bank.The research found that TSB, Bank of Scotland owners Lloyds, , Nationwide, Santander and The Co-operative Bank also all still use SMS texts to very a log in, leaving messages \"at risk of being hijacked by cybercriminals\". Santander and The Co-operative Bank said they are looking to move away from SMS.They also found that TSB, Virgin Money and Nationwide were failing to use software that ensures spoof messages sent by potential scammers are blocked or quarantined by your email provider. TSB has said it has since introduced this protection, Virgin Money said it was in the works and Nationwide said it operates ‘a range of email security controls’ to protect members.HSBC came out on top for securitiy, with a score of  per cent. It was the only bank to score five stars for both website encryption and account management. It was rated A+ for cipher strength because it supports the latest encryption standards.In a test of each provider’s banking app Virgin Money and TSB again were were amongst the lowest ranked.Lloyds, Nationwide, Santander, and TSB dropped points because online and mobile banking require the same login credentials - with the consumer organisation saying it would prefer banks to ask for app-specic passcodes.Which said: \"While online banking is a largely safe way to manage money, scammers are upping their game and the industry needs to keep pace.\"That is why we are calling for banks to work much harder to upgrade online security so they are providing high levels of protection for customers.\"If a fraudster does breach a bank’s defences and you lost money as a result, you have a legal right to a refund from your bank – unless it can demonstrate that you were ‘grossly negligent’ – in other words, unusually careless with your security details.\"Last year TSB was reported to the finance regulator for failing to comply with the rules over online banking security .Concerns were raised with the Financial Conduct Authorityabout Edinburgh-based TSBs online banking login process as it joined Edinburgh-based Tesco Bank as the worst in the UK in a probe into flaws in online banking security that could help criminals to scam customers.Jenny Ross, Which money editor said: “Banks must lead the battle against fraud, yet our security tests have revealed worrying flaws when it comes to keeping people safe from the threat of having their account compromised.“Our research reinforces the need for banks to up their game on tackling fraud by using the latest protections for their websites and not allowing customers to set insecure passwords. We also want banks to stop sending sensitive data to customers via SMS texts as this could leave the door open to fraudsters.”A TSB spokesman said: “We continue to invest in strengthening online and mobile protection for customers and have introduced a number of features recently which aren’t captured in these results. Additionally, TSB tracks well across the industry on fraud with lower than average fraud losses. In contrast to the wider industry, we are the only bank that offers a guarantee to refund our customers should they ever fall victim to bank fraud.”A Virgin Money spokesperson said: “The safety and security of our banking services is our top priority and we are continually monitoring, assessing and improving our security controls.”A Lloyds Banking Group spokesman said: “Keeping our customers’ money and data safe is our priority and we have robust, multi-layered security across online and mobile banking services to protect against cyber security threats. We employ world-class experts in the cyber-security field, who work to deliver the right balance of online security measures, customer experience and accessibility. We continuously evolve and invest in our safeguards and have fully decommissioned the legacy Lloyds Bank sub-domain referenced.”A NatWest Group spokesman added: “Security continues to be a high priority for NatWest Group to keep our customers and the bank safe. We continue to invest in our digital security capabilities, leveraging market leading technologies – for example, multi-factor authentication and our work on biometrics – to deliver simple and secure banking services for our customers.”"},{"url":null,"title":"next-celtic-connections","story":"Roaming Roots, Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, January Dean Owen at CCA, January Geraint Watkins Band and Emma Jane, Drygate Brewery, January Shetland , The Mackintosh Church, January Ceilidh With The Peter Wood Band, National Piping Centre, January The Lonesome Ace Stringband  The Magpies, Mitchell Theatre, January Elephant Sessions th Anniversary Special, Glasgow Barrowland, January  The Conundrum: International Piping Night, Glasgow Royal Concert Hall , January Neal Francis and Unoma Okudo, Drygate Brewery, January An Tobar:  Years, Drygate Brewery, January Megan Henderson with Ainsley Hamill: Not Just Ship Land, Mitchell Theatre, January Frankie Gavin and Màirtìn Ò Connor and Stundom, Glasgow Royal Concert Hall , January Le Vent Du Nord, Old Fruitmarket, January Ian Fraser with Josie Duncan, Mitchell Theatre, January Spiers  Boden, Òran Mór, January Astrid and Ewan Macfarlane, Drygate Brewery, January Lera Lynn and Donovan Woods, CCA, January Allison Russell and Ala de Liona and Emily Scott Robinson, Saint Luke’s, January Breabach with Beòlach, Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, January Jason Wilson’s Ashara, CCA, January Leventime: A Tribute To Jackie Leven, Òran Mór, January Stina Marie Claire, CCA, January Andrew Wasylyk and Twelfth Day, Mitchell Theatre, January Hamish Henderson Night: Ballad Of The Banffies, Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, January Jill Jackson and Lady Nade, Old Fruitmarket, January Annabelle Chvostek and Elaine Lennon, Glasgow Royal Concert Hall , January Kate Rusby, Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, February Rachel Baiman and Cahalen Morrison, Glasgow Royal Concert Hall , February Catriona Price, Mitchell Theatre, February Amadou  Mariam, Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, February Darlingside, Saint Luke’s, February Dervish, Glasgow Royal Concert Hall, February Tom Oakes, National Piping Centre, February The Mastersons and Julia Taylor, CCA, February Ryan Young and Chris Amer with Janice Burns and Jon Doran, National Piping Centre, February Roddy Hart And The Lonesome Fire, Saint Luke’s, February "},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"January ,  at : pmRestrictions on indoor hospitality which were introduced on Boxing Day are to remain in place until at least January , Scotland#s First Minister has confirmed.

It comes, however, only after millions in public funds have been spent on an ill-conceived vanity project opposed across parties and the communities most directly affected.#No-one disputes the need to modernise air traffic services, which support operations on our leline air routes. Sadly, months and millions have been wasted by SNP Ministers and HIAL on a centralisation that was never going to get off the ground.”Meanwhile, Alistair Carmichael MP said that the “costly and unnecessary” plans have ended “not with a bang but a whimper”, and called for reform of the board of HIAL to ensure the communities that the airport operator serves are heard.“Above all we need to reflect on how this sorry state of affairs came to be in the first place,” said Mr Carmichael.“Retreat on the centralisation plan is only a temporary fix of the underlying problem. HIAL is supposed to be accountable and responsive to the needs of the entire Highlands and Islands and it is clearly not living up to that aspiration.“If we are to avoid another similar fiasco in the future then we need to look at further reform to ensure that our communities are heard on the board of HIAL.”Richard Hardy, Prospect National Secretary, welcomed the announcement and said that the union and HIAL remain in “sensitive negotiations” in relation to the future delivery of air traffic services.A HIAL spokesperson said: “We have been clear that ATMS is the best option to maintain the long-term sustainability of air services for the Highlands and Islands. Nevertheless, we are committed to working with Prospect and our air traffic control colleagues to try and develop a new solution involving compromise by both sides.“We would encourage those with an interest in ensuring the delivery of a safe, resilient, and sustainable air traffic operation for island communities to recognise the delicate nature of these negotiations and engage in constructive dialogue to reach that end.” copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Djokovic has reportedly claimed that Tennis Australia filled in the form on his behalf.In addition, there remain separate questions over Djokovic’s confirmed positive test on December  and his subsequent meeting with children at a public event in Belgrade the next day, which would have broken Serbia’s own -day quarantine rules following a positive test.Amid the continued confusion, Djokovic’s former coach Boris Becker has warned he risks the wrath of the Australian Open crowdhis quest for a record st grand slam title is ultimately allowed to continue.While Serbian fans celebrated outside the court-house on Monday, many Australians, who have endured months of hard lockdowns, remain angry at the current decision to allow the unvaccinated Djokovic to enter the country. vw,vw,px, px\"Novak Djokovic’s court win sparked wild scenes in Melbourne Becker, who coached Djokovic for three seasons from  to , told the BBC: “I’m sure there will be a couple of boos and whistles, but he’s used to that.“He was always a street-fighter who had to fight the odds and win over the crowd, and it was fascinating in last year’s US Open final when they finally embraced him.“The crowd will be dficult with him but with each match he starts, he will win the crowd and they will embrace him again. But he is going to have a dficult first week.”Whilst expressing his full support for Djokovic’s stance, Becker admitted he was concerned at the prospect of similar problems in the future, and reiterated his belief that the world number one should accept a vaccine.“I’m sure the French Open and Wimbledon will be watching the Melbourne saga, and I’m sure they will have strict rules on who can play and who cannot play,” Becker added.“It’s everybody’s choice but le is more dficultyou don’t want to be vaccinated. Personally I’d advise him to be vaccinated eventually because le would be easier for him, but ultimately it’s his choice and we have to respect that.” vw,vw,px, px\"Boris Becker coached Novak Djokovic for three season from  to  A number of fellow players have expressed concerns over Djokovic’s potential exemption, although Rafael Nadal offered belated support for the decision on Monday, having previously intimated it was wrong for his great rival to seek to enter Australia.Wimbledon quarter-finalist Marton Fucsovics provided a glimpse of the mood in the locker room by saying he does not think the Serbian had the right to play in the tournament.Speaking to the Hungarian outlet MSport, Fucsovics said: “People’s health is paramount, and there are rules that were outlined months ago, namely that everyone should vaccinate themselves – and Djokovic didn’t.I’m pleased and grateful that the Judge overturned my visa cancellation. Despite all that has happened,I want to stay and try to compete @AustralianOpen I remain focused on that.

Watches are made up of people with mixed abilities, mostly first-timers like Mavis, but also those living with a disability.Mavis said: “I went on a voyage on Tenacious and it changed my whole outlook on le. It was the adventure of a letime. I was made to fee part of the team, sailing this magnicent ship, straight away, the permanent crew at our sides – and we couldn’t have done it without them. They guided us in all aspects of the running of the ship with care and kindness.“Watching everyone working together as a team really moved me. I wanted to let everyone know, whether disabled or non-disabled,you’ve lost confidence in le or fearful of being with people, this is where you need to be. Part of the team on Tenacious. She was built especially for this purpose to give new le and to find out just how able you really are.“I#ll never forget my voyage and the wonderful friends I made and so overwhelmed at how challenges were overcome. Thank you Tenacious and thank you to the magnicent permanent crew who led and guided us all the way.”Patrick Fleming, JST’s chief executive, said: “Tenacious is the only tall ship designed to be sailed by a mixed ability crew – allowing fellow voyage crew members to join in with the day-to-day activities on board.“It’s great to hear stories from people like Mavis who’s lives have been truly touched by the experiences offered onboard.”The JST charity offers people of all abilities the opportunity to climb aboard their tall ship Tenacious for an immersive sailing experience and relies on funding from the public.

So much of what we learn in terms of socialisation and relationships does not happen in a classroom but across all the other day to day activities and interactions that take place.“It is a huge issue. Our young people have lost a lot in terms of their formal education but for me, they have also lost a massive amount in terms of the other areas of development that their education brings.”Portree High School pupil Luke Eveling, who has published a book about facing mental health challenges as a teenager on Skye, believes the pandemic had taken a toll on his age-group.He said: #Lockdown and the pandemic more widely definitely had an effect on young people in school. A lot of my friends are finding it hard to cope with exams and more broadly the pandemic simultaneously. This has influenced how well they are doing at school.#I have a few friends who have turned to serious drug abuse as a way of coping with the combined pressure, and others have stopped going to school completely.”In April , Luke bravely shared his own challenges through his book ‘A Series of Essays About Mental Health’.Within the book, Luke, who lives in Broadford, wrote frankly about a wide range of issues including heartbreak, peer pressure, drug abuse, and suicide. at the time, Luke talked about being diagnosed with Asperger’s and coping with isolation during the pandemic.While last year Luke spoke warmly about the “overwhelming support” he had received from family, friends and the wider community after opening up about his own circumstances, he believed more support services should be made available to help other young people.He added: #There are some, but there just isn’t enough for everyone. Things like having a school counsellor sound good but just don’t seem to reach everyone who needs help.#Councillor Finlayson added: “We know the importance of mental health # people are nervous about the pandemic and have not been able to socialise as before. We already have and will continue to have a situation where some young people will really struggle to get back to being with their peers and to sustaining positive relationships.“Parents are rightly concerned. Their children are in a totally unique situation given the global scope of the pandemic and the impact it has had and will continue to have on how education is delivered.“Supporting all aspects of education in its widest form needs to be a priority for all levels of government from the UK Government to Scottish Government to local government.“We all need to realise that the young people who have been in schools for the last two years have been disadvantaged in many dferent ways.“We need to take account of this going forward in terms of additional resources and possibly a catch-up curriculum and perhaps even more importantly, support for all aspects of young people’s health and wellbeing including mental health.”Assessing the lay of the land in schools across the region, Councillor Finlayson said: “Within Highland we will be continuing to follow the rules and mitigation measures that were in place previously and have come from the Scottish Government # all these things masks in classrooms, social distancing, ventilation in classrooms, limiting contact with other year groups and classes as much as possible will continue. What the rest of the country will be expected to do.“Better ventilation is being encouraged in schools # but we must consider the time of year and the fact that some of the schools within the Highland Council are pretty antiquated and not in the greatest condition.“I am keen that schools should make decisions that suit their own circumstances # because each school is dferent.#"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1641481177735.jpg--covid_19___thu_6th_january_figures.jpg?1641481178000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220106newscovid 19 thu 6th january figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows four further coronavirus related deaths and , new positive test results.

What we are seeing now is patients presenting with a sore or scratchy feeling throat, mild headache, sneezing and a runny nose.“We are not seeing as many people – either adults or children – experiencing high temperatures or fever. For the most case, these symptoms can be managed at home with a mix of paracetamol or ibuprofen, basically over-the-counter medicine you can get from a pharmacist.”Read MoreWhat does a faint line on lateral flow test mean The transmissibility of Omicron has prompted the government to change testing and isolation guidelines.As of January , people in Northern Ireland who get a positive lateral flow test no longer need a PCR test to confirm that result.In the event of a positive lateral flow test, the public has been advised to assume they have Covid and that you are infectious and report it on the gov.uk website.The earliest a period of self-isolation can end is on day seven - providing lateral flow tests on day six and seven are both negative and the inidual does not have a high temperature.Day six and day seven lateral flow tests should be at least  hours apart.

What we’re aiming for is to get net zero by .”He said that the overall plan is among the most ambitious in the world.“I’m certainly very comfortable that what we’ve arrived at is the optimum,” he told politicians.During a committee appearance in which the method and modelling contained in the carbon budgets was both probed and praised, the academics stressed that while they not prescribing specic policies there were certain inescapable facts facing Irelandit was to reach the climate targets.I think that the focus needs to move away from meeting certain technology targets towards a relentless, immediate focus on reducing fossil fuel consumptionDr Hannah DalyDr Hannah Daly, also from University College Cork, said that included reducing the country’s dependency on fossil fuels.She spoke about how the growth of electric car sales was less than the growth in SUV sales last year.“I think that the focus needs to move away from meeting certain technology targets towards a relentless, immediate focus on reducing fossil fuel consumption.”“And because it permeates all sorts of aspects of society, there’s no single solution,” she said.Throughout the meeting, politicians were urged to begin preparations for the necessary changes to the economy and the jobs market.The extent of the challenge was stressed.Dr David Styles, from the University of Limerick, said that the target for carbon emissions in the land use sector may end up being “impossible” to reach.Discussing the committee’s modelling, he said: “When we think of activity change, for example planting areas with forests, it’s not just the  targets but  and beyond.”Prof O Gallachoir told the committee “rapid and sustained economic, social and technological transformation across all sectors of the economy” will be needed to meet Irish climate change targets.He encouraged politicians present to “recommend that these carbon budgets be adopted, and further to ensure that the necessary urgency is directed at developing and implementing the policy supports and regulations to enable Ireland to remain within these carbon budgets”.Most ReadCrime pays for loyalist killer Robert ‘Brooksy’ Clarke as he puts Co Antrim mansion on market for almost £mStephen Nolan victim of Twitter ‘pile on’ after being ly accused of hitting out at Novak DjokovicRepublican ex-inmates body run by former IRA man applied for NI centenary cashDick Strawbridge: buying dream home in France left us penniless‘He was my brother, I loved him so much’: Funeral takes place of ‘beautul soul’ Aidan Mann stabbed in DownpatrickTop VideosPlayJim Shannon breaks down in Commons as he talks about his mother-in-law dying alonePlayKate ‘danced waltz with pinch of rock ‘n’ roll’ during th birthday photoshootPlayAngela Rayner says PM#s #absence speaks volumes# at Commons party questioningLatest Republic of IrelandTime to relax the rules around close contacts, Leo Varadkar saysNo arbitrary time frames for Northern Ireland Protocol solutions, says LewisEx-Defence Forces soldier makes bid to have terror charges droppedLate GAA player’s trust backs quest for sudden adult death syndrome cure‘Solution on Northern Ireland Protocol needed before Assembly elections’LatestDrivers stop to photograph ft statue of nude man dubbed the Suffolk Colossus‘Care home residents were  times more likely to die than those at home’Declan Bogue: Collective responsibility in terms of vaccination needed to help fend off postponementsSurgeon who branded livers of unconscious patients struck off medical registerDeclan Bogue: Giant-killings just not likely in modern GAA,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Produced by the British Youth Music Theatre , “Breadboy – The Musical” is the sequel to Tony Macaulay’s acclaimed memoir, “Paperboy” which had two sell-out runs at Belfasts Lyric Theatre in  and . The Lyric will again be hosting Macaulay’s new production and a star from Derry could well steal the show. Derry has a rich history of acting talent with the likes of Amanda Burton, Bronagh Gallagher, Saoirse-Monica Jackson and Jamie-Lee ODonnell all having starred on stage and screen. Auditions will take place at St Cecilias College on February  – although it may be moved online in order to comply with Government Covid guidelines. BYMT Executive Producer, Jon Bromwich, said: “At BYMT we develop talent and grow creativity to the highest level, for our  summer season we are looking for fierce actors, singers and musicians. BYMT offers young performers the rare opportunity to gain experience in a professional environment before entering the industry as an adult.” The storyline of “Breadboy” picks up from where “Paperboy” left. It follows the le of -year-old Belfast teen Tony in  who is the bread delivery boy for the last Ormo Mini-Shop in the world. As well as dealing with a iety of customers on the Upper Shankill, he also stumbles across punk music, via Derrys own “The Undertones” and their famous hit, “Teenage Kicks” which in turn reflects his own feelings on his school-crush, Judy Carlton, who sits opposite him in chemistry class. Tony Macaulay, writer of Breadboy, said: “Everyone involved in the musical adaptation for Paperboy were overwhelmed by the reception it received over the past two years. It was such a privilege to be part of this amazing project. The entire creative team especially the young cast were phenomenal. “I am delighted that BYMT has decided to bring Breadboy to stage for their new season. I wish all those taking part in the auditions the very best of luck and look forward to meeting and working with the young cast in .” Singer-songwriter Duke Special added: “I am delighted to be involved in the next adventures of Tony Macaulay as Paperboy transforms into Breadboy. Tony’s mind, as a  year old growing up in s Belfast, is a glorious mix of reality, imagination and downright fantasy! His muses may be the same as his slightly younger, paperboy self but this time he’s older, wiser and wearing Brut.

Produced by the British Youth Music Theatre , “Breadboy – The Musical” is the sequel to Tony Macaulay’s acclaimed memoir, “Paperboy” which had two sell-out runs at Belfasts Lyric Theatre in  and . The Lyric will again be hosting Macaulay’s new production and a star from Derry could well steal the show. Derry has a rich history of acting talent with the likes of Amanda Burton, Bronagh Gallagher, Saoirse-Monica Jackson and Jamie-Lee ODonnell all having starred on stage and screen. Auditions will take place at St Cecilias College on February  – although it may be moved online in order to comply with Government Covid guidelines. BYMT Executive Producer, Jon Bromwich, said: “At BYMT we develop talent and grow creativity to the highest level, for our  summer season we are looking for fierce actors, singers and musicians. BYMT offers young performers the rare opportunity to gain experience in a professional environment before entering the industry as an adult.” The storyline of “Breadboy” picks up from where “Paperboy” left. It follows the le of -year-old Belfast teen Tony in  who is the bread delivery boy for the last Ormo Mini-Shop in the world. As well as dealing with a iety of customers on the Upper Shankill, he also stumbles across punk music, via Derrys own “The Undertones” and their famous hit, “Teenage Kicks” which in turn reflects his own feelings on his school-crush, Judy Carlton, who sits opposite him in chemistry class. Tony Macaulay, writer of Breadboy, said: “Everyone involved in the musical adaptation for Paperboy were overwhelmed by the reception it received over the past two years. It was such a privilege to be part of this amazing project. The entire creative team especially the young cast were phenomenal. “I am delighted that BYMT has decided to bring Breadboy to stage for their new season. I wish all those taking part in the auditions the very best of luck and look forward to meeting and working with the young cast in .” Singer-songwriter Duke Special added: “I am delighted to be involved in the next adventures of Tony Macaulay as Paperboy transforms into Breadboy. Tony’s mind, as a  year old growing up in s Belfast, is a glorious mix of reality, imagination and downright fantasy! His muses may be the same as his slightly younger, paperboy self but this time he’s older, wiser and wearing Brut.

But some struggle to adapt, and find they need to hold their book at arm’sto read the page or direct a light on it to see the words more clearly. For most people, the answer is a simple eye test which will identythey need reading glasses, multi-focal glasses or contact lenses to make words clearer – and le easier. Maeve Walsh, director at Specsavers Crescent Link in the Waterside and Ferryquay Street in the city centre, says: “It can sometimes be dficult for people to assess themselves whether they have presbyopia, which is why we always encourage regular eye tests, usually every two years. “As we age, it’s completely natural for our eyesight to worsen and it shouldn’t be something we worry about, providing our eyes are in good health. “My advice to those with presbyopia would be to carry your specs with you at all times and get into the habit of having them close by. This will help with activities like reading, and will also ensure you’re not straining your eyes, which can sometimes cause other problems.” To find out more about presbyopia, or to book an eye test visit:https:www.specsavers eye-health presbyopiaandwww.specsavers stores derryorwww.specsavers stores crescentlink Top five signs you have Presbyopia .

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Covid cases across the country have continued to rise with , cases reported from December  to January . Of this, over  were in Derry as Derry remains the county with the highest Covid infection rate in Northern Ireland. Schools across the city resumed face to face teaching in the classroom earlier this week after the Christmas break, with no change to Covid guidance. Susan Parlour, President of National Education UnionNI, said: The message seems to be, keep the schools open and hope for the best, its farcical. There is no PPE in schools and there are no risk assessments. I understand this takes time but it is essential in the current circumstances. Face coverings are required in schools which staff need to provide themselves or they need to accept the substandard masks offered which are really not fit for purpose. Also, many children do not wear their masks and this is rarely challenged. We receive daily figures on Covid cases in schools but with no track and trace in place and lateral flow testing, which has proved time and time again to not be the most reliable, the number of cases and close contacts will be higher than what is recorded. Chief Medical Officer, Dr McBride, stated that Covid was not spreading in schools and that outside socialising was the cause, we saw the rise in cases over Christmas and the schools were shut. Mark Browne, Permanent Secretary, sent a letter to principals on December  that stated that the departments advice onmeasures to reduce transmission has not changed. He stated that EA has provided CO monitors to schools along with detailed instructions on their use. This is not the case. CO monitors are not on the ground and there is little to no guidance on how to use them. NEU NI released a statement providing guidance for CO monitors and their use stating that carbon dioxide monitors are not a solution to the problem of poor ventilation. The Department for Education in Englandis rolling out a very limited number of CO units and most schools will not be able to benefit from this scheme. Susan continued: Schools, students and principals feel let down and there are no mitigations in place to keep them safe. There seems to be a  perception that teachers want to teach from home, it is not the case. Teachers want to be in the classroom but they want it to be safe for both them and their students. There are no measures in place to keep the school community safe, no close contacts, no track and trace, no support and no meaningful guidance. NEU NI are currently advising teachers and schools not to teachover  per cent of their staff are absent. If this number of absent staff members is reached, the school should close. The Education Minister stated that options are available such as consolidating classes or teachers teaching remotely as well as live teaching but Susan explained, this is even more work and pressure on teachers, in an already stressful teaching environment. At St Cecelias College in Derry, % of the staff are currently off sick six teachers and  classroom assistants. There are  pupils who are off sick in one class alone. Tanya Wakeley, teacher and union rep at St CeceliasCollege in Derry, said: We are teaching in a Covid stew, it is a nightmare and it is not good enough. Those are the numbers only two days into the school year and we havent even reached the peak of this Omicron wave. The government has to do something and we need to speak up. We dont want to work from home, its not an efficient way to teach and its double the workload. We want to be in the classroom to teach our pupils, but we want to be doing it safely, where both staff and pupils feel safe. We know for a fact that schools arent safe at the minute and we can see that after only two days back teaching. The students feel let down too, especially the senior years. They dont even knowtheyll be sitting their exams in the summer. Nobody knows what is going on and there is no clear direction. I have students that have never sat an official exam and that will no doubt never get their work experience. We feel very in the dark with everything and we are not being told enough. With teacher absences, many teachers are forced to form compositeclasses or teach larger numbers of pupils than they are used to or is usually advised. Tanya continued: A class can have anything between  to  pupils and what we have to do at the minute, because we dont have enough teachers in school, is put more than one class in the multi-purpose hall. The pupils are all socially distanced, but Covid is airborne, and there are no windows in that hall. If we are in the classroom, the classrooms are freezing because we have to ventilate the rooms, its the middle of January, with the cold air we are going to get sick either way, whether its Covid or not. We are not provided with sufficient PPE, the masks are not fit for purposeand at this stage, it is a complete trust situation that pupils do not come inthey have tested positive or have Covid symptoms. The parents are worried as well and we dont even have the governments guidance to reassure them. We are being told one thing by the government and another thing by experts. You dont know what to believe and God knows what is coming next. This is not going away and its definitely not going away in schools. It is going to get worse before it gets better and we need plans in place. We are collateral damage and we have been forgotten about. Education Minister, Michelle McIlveen, has said her priority remains keeping schools open amid the surge of casesin Northern Ireland. She said there have been no changes to the guidance issued toschools regarding Covid because health officials havent changed their position. Schools experiencing staffing shortages will have the option to move to remote learning and introduce partial timetables, she added. A spokesperson for the Department of Educationsaid that “a range of mitigations” have been recommended to risk the transmission of Covid within schools across the North. They said: “Throughout the pandemic the Department has worked closely with key stakeholders as well as the Department of Health and Public Health Agency as we manage our response and continue to do so. “We continue to follow advice in relation to all public health issues including contact tracing however no changes have been recommended in respect of the approach to contact tracing or changes to the DE Covid guidance. “Rates of Covid infection in the community in Northern Ireland are currently extremely high. Schools are part of our community so it is inevitable that there will be cases among staff and students in our schools. “While we cannot eradicate Covid altogether, a range of mitigations are recommended to reduce the risk of transmission as much as possible in the school environment. “These measures include regular LFD testing, good hand respiratory hygiene, maximising ventilation, face coverings for post-primary pupils and staff and consistent groups wherever possible. “All staff and those aged  and over have also had access to the vaccination programme. We have a shared objective to support our schools so they are able to provide for our children as we all know that the best place for our children and young people is in school. “No one mitigation on its own will prevent the spread of the virus, but used together each mitigation provides works to reduce transmission. “Our schools, like those across the rest of the UK and Ireland, are facing staffing shortages due to the pandemic. There is a limited supply of qualied teachers. “We have made a formal call for retired teachers to provide support and we have also looked to provide more flexibility for schools in how they deploy substitute teachers. If further financial resources are needed by schools we will make bids to meet these costs. “The EA secured more than , C monitors and approximately  per cent of schools in NI have now been provided with monitors, with a further  monitors expected imminently. The additional monitors will be delivered to the remaining schools as a priority and also to those schools that have requested additional monitors. “Good ventilation, along with other measures can help mitigate the risk of transmission. Natural ventilation, such as opening windows can be effective at reducing the risk from virus in the air. “School leaders who are concerned about ventilation in a room should contact the EA maintenance helpline for advice and support on the best approach for their inidual circumstances. “In some cases where an area of poor ventilation has been identied, it may be appropriate to consider the use of an air cleaning unit as an additional mitigation whilst further remedial work is undertaken to improve ventilation. “The pandemic requires a collective response to support the safe operation of our schools – staff, parents, and pupils all have a key role to play carrying out regular testing and making sure making sure that anyone with symptoms follows Covid- advice and information which is available atNIDirect.gov.uk.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Hundreds of people turned out for the first day of vaccinations at the Centre, which played an important role in the initial drive to deliver First and Second vaccinations. The Foyle Arena is now open to walk-ins and bookings from am to pm, Monday to Saturday, and am to pm on Sundays. Mayor Warke joined them to receive his booster jab, and said he was impressed by the swt organisation of the effort and the professionalism of staff on site. He said: “This is a rapidly changing situation and I am extremely impressed at how these measures have been so quickly put in place to meet demand. I want to acknowledge the work of the Western Trust staff who are doing such an amazing job in very challenging circumstances. “I also want to thank all the staff at the Foyle Arena, and previously at Templemore, who are playing a vital role in this effort. “The Trust are aiming to vaccinate  people a day at the Foyle and I would appeal to everyone attending to please follow the advice of the professionals and lets do all we can to get as many people as possible protected in the weeks ahead.” The campaign is expected to continue until January and to safely accommodate the numbers of visitors to the centre Members of Foyle Arena, there will be some minor impacts to services over the coming weeks, though most will continue as normal. This includes changes to studio class timetables, and alternative temporary arrangements are now in place for Members, with a wide range of leisure services also available across other Council owned leisure Centres. Director of Health and Community with Council, Karen McFarland added: “There has been a speedy response to the recent developments in the Covid pandemic, and we were happy to be able to step up once again to provide much needed facilities to help progress the Trusts Vaccination Campaign. “Measures have been put in place to mitigate any impacts and while most of our leisure services will continue as normal, there may be some disruption to some activities which we will communicate directly to our members. “This is a short term campaign, and I really appreciate everyones patience as we assist in getting vaccinations to those who need them. “With high volumes of people expected to attend I would appeal to people to please follow the guidance at the centre and the directions of staff – they are there to help keep things running smoothly. “The safety of our staff and the public is our first priority and I would ask for everyones cooperation over the coming weeks.” With the volume of people accessing the Foyle Arena, additional parking is available for members at Clooney Park West playing fields. To find out more about leisure services available across all Council sites, and any changes to timetables please go to: derrystrabaneleisure The Western Trust this week issued an appeal to staff to help in the escalated operation as vaccinators. People are being encouraged to use the booking system as the number of walk-ins that can be accommodated will be limited. Vaccinations are also available from GP surgeries and local pharmacists. Over s who have yet to get their first dose of the vaccination can also receive it at the vaccination centres.

These proposals are being brought forward by a new partnership between Derry-based property developer South Bank Square and housing provider Choice. The new plans include a mix of social and affordable homes ranging from one to four bedrooms, comprising a mix of terrace, detached and semi-detached houses as well as a number of bungalows and apartments aimed at those aged  and over. Proposals also include signicant areas of open space, a woodland walk, allotments, childrens play area, and a tenant hub. The project represents poundmillion of investment to the City Region, and will see the creation of approximately  new jobs over a period of eight to  years. Martin Mallon, Managing Director of South Bank Square said: “We are delighted to unveil these updated proposals for the Ballyoan site. “This new partnership with Choice Housing Association represents a signicant multi-million pound investment in the North West and will see the development of hundreds of new family homes over the next ten years. “The comprehensive planned development of this site will be key to delivering some of the thousands of new family homes that we know are very much needed in the city now and over the forthcoming years. “The new proposals will include expansive areas of open space, children’s play areas, a woodland walk, as well as proposed improvements to the local roads infrastructure. “It is fantastic to be able to announce this level of investment in our home city and we expect that this scale of investment will bring with it many job opportunities for local people and local suppliers in the North West. “Enabling works have already started on site following our planning approvals granted earlier this year and we hope to commence house building on site early in .” Michael McDonnell, CEO at Choice added: “We are thrilled to move forward with these proposals in partnership with South Bank Square. This project will unlock huge potential to create much needed, high quality social and affordable homes for a range of people in the city. “As well as relieving housing stress in the city, this project will allow young families to get on the property ladder by bringing forward a number of affordable homes, as well as offering professionally managed, exceptional private rental opportunities too. “Extensive planning has been carried out to ensure the needs of young families, disabled people, and the elderly are catered for, with plenty of green space, allotments, a play park and a tenant hub included in our ambitious plans. “We hope to be able to secure planning permission for these homes so that we can begin to deliver them as soon as possible.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Invest NI and the Department for the Economy , believe that Northern Ireland’s ranking in the ONS survey is not truly reflective of the level of innovation activity that is actually being delivered across the region. This could be down to the fact that many businesses simply don’t recognise what they do as innovation.  In response to the ONS, DfE launched Innovate NI in October  this is an initiative that supports local businesses to progress through a four-step innovation framework for successful innovation to create value. The initiative also provides official recognition for innovation activity, helping businesses to understand where they are in their innovation journey and recognise their innovation achievement.  As a business further develops their innovative project, they can have their activities assessed by Innovate NI. If deemed to be innovative, they receive recognition so they can clearly see the level of progress that theyre making.  Mary agrees with the need to encourage businesses to identy as innovative.  “One thing is for sure we don’t shout about our innovation achievements enough. I firmly believe the NI economy is much more innovative than the ONS survey portrays during the pandemic, we found that NI actually had a lot of innovative businesses with erse offerings and locally we showed a high level of resilience in dealing with a very signicant economic shock. “But I do think micro-businesses in particular, sometimes struggle to see themselves as being innovative and struggle to understand all the supports that are available to them. That’s why Innovate NI’s recognition scheme is so important and it is one of the reasons we decided to support the work of Innovate NI with the Economic Recovery Innovation Grant.” Economic Recovery Innovation Grant The Economic Recovery Innovation Grantis funded by the Department for the Economy’s Economic Recovery Action Plan. The grant was launched on th November and it provides small-to-medium-sized businesses, including micro- businesseswith the opportunity to apply for a grant of up to pound,.  This grant was created to help businesses progress their innovative idea - this idea must be new to the business, or the market, for example, a new product or service, or a new process within the business. The grant will help a business that is currently working on an innovative project to test and develop it, with the end goal of commercialising the product or service, or implementing the process fully in the business. The pound, can be used to fund development costs and the actual implementation of that innovative idea into the business. Businesses hoping to apply must complete Invest NI’s eligibility checker and satisfy the scheme’s eligibility criteria including being registered with HMRC and being a Northern Ireland-based SME or social enterprise.  They must also have a valid Silver Level Innovator recognition from Innovate NI. Silver Level Innovator recognition means businesses have already started to test and develop an innovative idea for their business.  Businesses can checkthey satisfy the eligibility criteria on Investni andthey do, they can submit an innovation assessment to find out their innovation level. Once issued, Invest NI will invite the eligible, Silver Level Innovator to apply for ERIG. Mary says the reason why businesses must have the Silver Level Innovator recognition to qualy for the grant, is to ensure that the grant is put to good use.  “We want local businesses to further develop innovative projects, services or processes that will enable them to grow. A business that is recognised as Silver Level has already completed the ideation and selection steps of the Innovation Framework, so we know the grant will be used to progress an idea Innovate NI has assessed as potentially innovative. “Using the grant to achieve commercialisation or implementation would then, hopefully, allow a business to progress to Gold Level Innovator status.” Innovate NI also provides help, support and signposting to ensure businesses progress through these innovation levels. This helps to avoid repeating the same step over and over again. This signposting will also help businesses know where to go for the right help. “Innovation can be something big or something minor, but it can make a major change for an SME or micro business. Just go checkyou are eligible and where you are on the Innovation Framework - it could completely change the way you do business.” The closing date to apply for the Economic Recovery Innovation Grant is pm on Monday, st January . Grants will be allocated on a first-come, first-served basis.

Neighbouring Fermanagh  Omagh had the second-highest rate of . while the lowest figure was to be found at Ards  North Down with .. The overall rate for the North stands at . cases per . people. While there are suggestions that another full-scale lockdown may be imposed by the Executive, given that the new Omicron iant of Covid has long-since embedded itself within the island of Ireland, no matter what restrictions are put in place, Dr Black – who is the Chair of the British Medical Associations Northern Ireland Council – said that rates will continue to rise over the next few weeks. He said: “It doesnt matter what restrictions we put in now because the effects of the fth wave, which is Omicron, are already baked into the system. What is going to happen over the next few weeks cannot be altered now. “ the horse has bolted. That ship has sailed. We are in a position where we are just going to have to work our way through the next four to six weeks. “This will include another two weeks of a huge infection rate, two or three weeks after that will be hospitalisations – hopefully not in large numbers and not too much pressure on Intensive Care Units. The pattern so far is that hospitalisations are not as bad as they were last January with the Delta iant.” Although the Omicron iant is generally regarded as being weaker than the Delta one that struck  months ago. Dr Black says that while young people who have been fully vaccinated maybe able to cope with it, the elderly may be more vulnerable to this iant. He added: “In September , Derry and District had the highest rate in Western Europe and we are more than four times higher than that rate now. The rates that weve seen in the past are so modest compared to what were seeing at the moment.   Figures from the Department of Health of positive Covid- cases in the North of Ireland.  “The rates at this moment are just phenomenal. You always worry about older, vulnerable people getting infected – certainly in Derry in the last week, weve seen more than five hundred patients in Derry and Strabane over sixty years old becoming infected. Across Northern Ireland that figure is more than three thousand. “Your worry from that is do those elderly and vulnerable patients end up in hospital  So far, our numbers for hospitalisations have only increased to around ten per cent in the last week or so. But we will be watching it very closely because although the Omicron iant is clearly a milder disease for younger people, we dont know yet how it will affect the elderly. “With Omicron, the factor here is how infectious is it. I think thats the major reason weve seen such a big increase. As throughout the pandemic, every time we think were successful, we become complacent and loosen up and complacency always leads to failure. “There was something about us being too complacent before Christmas in terms of bringing in enough restrictions early enough. That to some extent is the problem with a democracy. Politicians want to react to public sentiment rather than anticipate public sentiment. “You see in China, they closed down a million-person cityafter they get three positive results. WhereasBoris Johnson seems to be quite content to tolerate hundreds of thousands of infections per day because he thinks thats what the public seems to be wanting to tolerate. “Its a strange dichotomy in terms of how democracies respond to these pandemics.” The Health Service has been under considerable strain ever since the pandemic began almost two years ago. And Dr Black warns that the strain both the virus and the extra workloads it has brought upon the medical sector may well affect important services being delivered by the Health Serivice. He continued: “We worry about how the virus will affect iniduals in terms of their own health but also the effect that is happening on the Health Service with respect to the ability of staff to attend work. “The BMA mapping before Christmas suggested ten per cent of staff to be off with illness and a further ten to fteen per cent off due to isolation. Unfortunately, we seem to have been proven to have been correct. “Were seeing signicant numbers of staff missing – not just in general practice but in hospitals with nurses, doctors, paramedics and particularly in the ambulance service as well with response times from ambulances longer than we would want. “I see some of the ambulance services in the north of England were saying thatyou had a heart-attack, dont wait for an ambulance – go directly and get a lt to hospital. “Thats an extraordinary situation that were in that the virus is limiting the services for patients in other areas such as heart-attacks and strokes.” Meanwhile, the Western Trust has said it will continue with the temporary suspension of visitors to patients in hospitals, such as Altnagelvin in Derry. A short statement on the Western Trusts website read: “We would like to thank the public for their cooperation in relation to the recent changes to our visiting arrangements. Your support helps us to provide safer care for your relatives and friends who are currently in hospital. “Due to the continued pressures on our hospitals and the high level of COVID- transmission in the community, visiting remains suspended across our hospital sites and facilities. This does not apply to birthing partners, for maternity arrangements.” The Foyle Arena is serving as a mass vaccination centre. It is open between am to pm except on Friday, January  where it is open until pm. The centre is closed on Saturday, January  and Tuesday, January .

She argues that the new accommodation for the incoming undergraduates would be of immense benefit to the retail and hospitality sectors of Derrystudents were resident close to the citys heart. The student pound could help to kickstart the local economy – more so given the effects the pandemic has had on Derrys businesses. In the letter, Ms McLaughlin writes: “Our city will benefit substantially from the intake of new students. That benefit will increase even furtherthe new accommodation needed for them is located in or close to the city centre. “More specically,students live between campus and city centre this will have signicant positive impact on the commercial heart of the city, through its retail and hospitality sectors. I need hardly remind you of the hard times they have suffered over the last two years. “It is essential that core institutions such as the university work together with the public and private sectors, in order to maximise the combined impact. “I suggest this would in this instance be best achieve by providing student accommodation where it will have the most economic impact, which would be close of Derrys city centre. “Moreover, this would provide the best student experience by giving students easier access to the benefits of urban le, with close proximity to retail facilities and evening activities.” Explaining why she has taken it upon herself to write to Ulster University, Ms McLaughlin added: “I am urging the Ulster University Vice Chancellor, its Council and Senate to consider the potential benefits of their actions to the wider city. Our retail and hospitality sectors have suffered terribly through the pandemic, and locating new student accommodation close to the city centre would provide a real and much needed boost to our commercial sectors. “This, in turn, would help to safeguard existing jobs, as well as creating new jobs. I hope Ulster University will accept the logic of my argument. “While my party and I have campaigned for years for the expansion of Magee on the basis of the skills that will be created that will benefit the city and so will create well paid jobs, it is also very important that the expansion provides wider economic benefits through higher spending in the city and on local businesses. That, too, will create more jobs.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

However, Mr Eastwood stated Ms Truss threat was another in a series of hollow statements from British Government Ministers who the DUP had taken at their word only to be let down on matters Brexit. The Foyle MP said that meetings with senior Tories and threats to trigger Article  are like groundhog day for people in Northern Ireland who want political leaders focused on our crumbling health service, the crisis in our schools and the spiraling cost of living. He said: “It really is incredible that with our health service under immense strain, our schools facing a Covid crisis and households across the North facing spiraling energy costs that the DUP has refused to abandon it’s disastrous campaign of threatening the institutions of government over the Northern Ireland Protocol. “Instead of addressing the real priorities that people are concerned about – getting the surgery they need, protecting jobs in their communities, providing a warm home for their family – the DUP is once again chasing influence with Tories at Westminster who will use them when it’s convenient and then dump them just as quickly. “They haven’t learned a thing from their last ugly break up with that party. “It is like groundhog day for people in Northern Ireland who want political leaders focused on the urgent priorities facing us. “The only outcome to Jeffrey Donaldson’s foolish crusade is more uncertainty and chaos at a time when we just can’t afford it. “Parties that are serious about government should be seeking to work together to improve the lives of people in our communities. “Instead we have establishment parties in a toxic race to see who can bring the government down first to meet their own selfish needs. People are sick of it.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

And a great way to make sure you’re on an even footing when it comes to motoring in  is by making some simple and easy checks around your car to confirm everything is as it should be. googletag.cmd.push But what should you be focusing on  Here, we’re going to take a look at some of the areas you might want to focus on. Interior   vw,vw,px, px\"  Don’t forget to vacuum areas in the middle of the cabin, too    Alright, so a clean interior isn’t critical to the roadworthiness of your car, but it’s a great place to start things off when it comes to checks. Plus, a tidy cabin will be far less distracting, while a lack of loose objects will ensure that nothing interferes with the major controls. So remove any items such as bottles or packets and wipe down areas such as the buttons and heating controls to ensure they’re bright and clean. A quick vacuum in the footwells can really help too. Tyres   vw,vw,px, px\"      Tyres are absolutely crucial. After all, they’re the only point of contact between your vehicle and the road so it’s paramount that they’re in good condition. First off, give the walls of the tyres an inspection are there any cracks or cuts  If so, they might need replacing. When it comes to tread, the legal minimum in Ireland is .mm. To check this, you could use an accurate tyre gauge – available to purchase from most motor factors and retailers – or a € coin. This latter method requires you torun a € coin along the centre of the wheel. If the gold part of the coin is not visible, then the tyre tread is ok. However,it is visible your tyre could be approaching the minimum legal depth so you should get them checked. You also need to check the pressure of the tyres. You’ll find the correct pressures for your vehicle either on the door sills or behind the fuel filler cap. Find this and simply inflate your tyres to the right pressure using a compressor, which are found at most petrol stations. Lights   vw,vw,px, px\"  Check that all of your lights are operating correctly   Lights are critical at this time of year. Not only are they needed to light up the road ahead, but they’re also required to make sure you’re visible to other road users. It’s why it’s a good idea to give them a check over. You can test your headlights – both dipped and full-beam – by operating them when parked close to a shiny surface, such as a garage door. When it comes to your rear lights, you could ask a friend to watch as you test them – or you can, again, reverse near to a reflective surface and operate them while looking in the rear-view mirror. Make sure you test your indicators, too – a blink that moves too quickly might mean that a bulb has blown and needs replacing. Washer fluid   vw,vw,px, px\"      You might have noticed that there’s a lot of dirt and grime on the roads at the moment and a great deal of this tends to end up on your windscreen. Because of this, it’s best to make sure that you’ve got plenty of washer fluid in your car so you can quickly and effectively clear your windscreen. On most cars, you’ll find the washer bottle under the bonnet, signied by a blue cap. Top it up to the correct level and make sure you’re using washer fluid – water on its own can freeze and cause damage to your car’s washer system. While you’re here, make sure your wipers are working effectively too –they’re making a rubbing noise or are smearing the windscreen, they’ll need replacing. Oil   vw,vw,px, px\"  Locating your car’s dipstick is a simple task. It’s usually marked out under the bonnet by a yellow cap.   While we’re under the bonnet, it’s a good idea to check your oil levels. This is easy to do, too. Simply remove the dipstickand clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Then, re-insert it back into its holder remove it again just after. Now, you’ll be able to read your car’s oil levels using the guide on the dipstick. If it’s too low, top it up via the oil filler using the correct oil for your car – you can find this in your vehicle’s handbook. Remember, only fill up in small increments and check your dipstick after each time. This helps to avoid overfilling. Windscreen   vw,vw,px, px\"  A windscreen might be requireda crack appears    Your car’s windscreen takes a real beating at this time of year, which is why there’s a greater chance of cracks or chips appearing. Take this opportunity to give your car’s windscreen an inspection to make sure that there’s nothing out of the ordinary. If you notice a small chip, then it’s a good idea to get it professionally repaired rather than leaving it to develop into a crack. This preventative repair is far cheaper than the cost of replacing an entire windscreen, after all. Remember, driving with a cracked windscreen can be deemed a motoring offenceit’s obscuring your view. If you’re stopped by police with a heavily cracked windscreen, it could lead to penalty points and a fine.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

WHO advises against blanket travel bansDoes the virus read your passport  - WHO advises against blanket travel bansReporter: Mary McFadden Dec Email: mary.mcfadden@iconicnews.ie  addthis, The World Health Organisationis advising against blanket travel bans to prevent the spread of the newest Covid- iant, Omicron. googletag.cmd.push The Executive Director of WHOs Health Emergences Programme, Dr Mike Ryan, said there are many ways to manage the risk of importation or exportation of disease without banning travel. At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

We’re encouraged to make these ongoing health measures as much a part of the holiday as mulled wine and mince pies. Such steps can help protect our nearest and dearest while we’re together. The gt of protecting one another from COVID- – including the Omicron iant – is the one that truly keeps on giving. The weather outside may be “frightful” but, gathering indoors, we can still open windows to allow fresh air to disperse the virus. Embrace face coverings, there are seasonal styles aplenty to add festive flair to commuting and high street shopping trips. Every adult in the country needs to get a COVID- booster vaccine, because two doses does not give you enough protection against catching Omicron. Get your booster now at nhs.uk covidvaccination. Get Boosted Now is the national mission to build a wall of defence against the new Omicron iant. This mission is more urgent and more important than ever before because Omicron COVID- is spreading fast. Vaccines are the best way we can protect ourselves. You can get a COVID- booster  weeks after your second dose. Boosters give you the best possible protection against the virus and should signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation. And, swter than shaving or applying makeup, taking rapid lateral flow tests are a quick and easy part of your getting ready routine before venturing out. If you have been in contact with someone with COVID- and are double vaccinated, you should take a daily rapid lateral flow test for seven daysyou have no symptoms. This will help slow the spread of the virus and allow you and your loved ones to continue your plans that dayyou test negative. If you are unvaccinated, you must continue to self-isolate for  daysyou are a contact of someone with COVID-. Don’t forget the NHS COVID- app is still the fastest way to knowyou’ve been exposed to someone who tested positive for COVID-, so keep it on. A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year, celebrate safely and let’s make it a good one. ‘It’s vital to ventilate’  Leeds University Professor of Environmental Engineering Catherine Noakes, pictured, said: “As Christmas is coming people will naturally be spending more time indoors – welcoming friends and family into their home and attending social events together – as the weather gets colder.While we are all looking forward to spending time with friends and family this Christmas, it’s important to remember that coronavirus is still spreading and can easily transmit in the home even when people are vaccinated.“In an enclosed space, the infectious particles hang around in the air like smoke and can build up over time, increasing the risk of other people in the room breathing in the virus, especiallythere is no ventilation or fresh air helping to refresh the air.“That’s why it’s so important to ventilate indoor spaces by opening windows, evenjust regularly for a short time. This way fresh air can disperse and blow COVID- particles away to decrease the risk of others being infected.”  Wish List  Vaccinations  All adults now need to get a booster vaccine, as two doses do not offer enough protection against the fast spreading Omicron iant. Boosters are available  weeks after second jabs. Get Boosted Now at nhs.uk covidvaccination to signicantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation.  Taking tests  Make taking rapid lateral flow tests part of your festive preparations.

Pic by Mary K Burke. googletag.cmd.push Neil Forester  “Is this real ” yelled a delirious Neil Forester at the end of his sides championship final win over Greenlough. Youd forgive him for asking. The Brian Oacutegs captain has seen years of heartache and near misses, and when the crunch arrived in November, he produced a huge performance to finally clamber over the line. Starting the game on Enda Lynn, he pushed forward in the latter stages and marshalled attack and defence, almost omnipresent as Steelstown ended their hurt. It typied the leadership he showed all season, and he was central also as Brian Oacutegs shook off what was historically their bogey team in Castledawson at the quarter final stage. The public feedback reflected the good will towards a man very few would begrudge a county championship medal. “He puts his head where you wouldnt put a sock,” said one respondent, while another simply said he was a brilliant leader. A further respondent said he was a real GAA man. “He does it all for his club, other clubs and schools all around Derry and still puts in big performances when it matters. Heart of a lion and wise beyond his years,” they said. A hugely important player for Hugh McGraths men, Forester will continue the search for silverware this weekend as Steelstown take on Moortown in the Ulster IFC final in Glen.  Young stars join up with Derrys provisional football squad  A number of the All-Ireand winning minor team are training with the seniors.   Young Intermediate Footballer of the Year  The young midfielders aerial prowess was key to the Brian Oacutegs effort. Pic by Mary K Burke. Donncha Gilmore  Its been quite a year for Donncha Gilmore. He picked up Ulster and All-Ireland titles with the Derry minors and ended the year with an intermediate championship medal. The midfielder belied his years with a series of confident, mature performances in a championship where seasoned giants are in plentul supply at centre field. With the county final in the melting pot, he rose to field the ball among a scattering of players, raising a roar from the crowd and lting his team mates. The Steelstown man was a popular choice throughout the public feedback, with his exploits in the Oakleaf jersey no doubt contributing. “He has been brilliant for Derry and Steelstown, an All-Ireland winner and a Derry championship winner, with more to come,” said one respondent. Another said he covered every blade of grass throughout the championship, while another – who was liberal with the blue and yellow heart emojis – said he was pure class. In a nod to the midfielders modesty and work ethic, another response said the young man has no idea just how good he is. Gilmore can look forward to Sundays Ulster IFC final as well, and will feature in manager Rory Gallaghers provisional squad for the upcoming season.

Pic by Philip Fitzpatrick Sportsfile. googletag.cmd.push Ciaran McFaul  If great players have everything in their locker, Ciaran McFaul probably needed a second one last season. The Glen talisman was imperious in the number  role into which Malachy ORourke moulded him in . In the biggest game of the year, the county final against Slaughtneil, he hammered over three points and dictated the game in the same manner he had done all season. That Donegal champions St Eunans set out to shut him down in their Ulster SFC clash in Letterkenny is a mark of just how influential McFaul has been. His name also dominated the responses to our online poll, with one respondent in particular waxing lyrical, saying McFall was arguably the greatest talent ever produced in Derry football. “What an absolute work horse he is on the field, any position that man turns the bolts in any match. He can read a game super and his dummies are without a doubt the best in Ulster,” said another. A further respondent said he redefined the number  role, while another quite simply said the centre back was pure class. Able to dictate play from deep, he has arrived on the end of attacks with perfect timing, while also performing his defensive duties with commitment.  Derry manager looking for continuity after stop-start tenure to date  Rory Gallagher said he was delighted to see theof the McKenna Cup.   Young Senior Footballer of the Year  Doherty in action against Kilcoo in the Ulster semi final. Pic by David Fitzgerald Sportsfile. Ethan Doherty  Ethan Doherty was still at school when the Covid pandemic started. Less than two years later, he helped Glen lt the John McLaughlin Cup for the first time. Stepping straight into the first team at both club and county level, the rise of the former St Patricks College captain has been meteoric. Every inch the modern wing back, his power, pace and ability to break the line have been a key part of Malachy ORourkes Glen machine. The GAA community in Derry have also been quick to recognise his precocious talent, and he was a hugely popular choice in our public feedback. Amid numerous goat emojis, one respondent suggested he could play anywhere, while another said his selection as Young Player of the Year was merely common sense. “The engine of Glens back line with constant running. He never gave up and always looked to drive the ball forward to create scoring opportunities,” said a further response. One particular respondent kept it simple, nominating him for the award because he roasts everyone. Doherty is a player with a big future, and, already performing at the highest level for both club and county, the possibilities seem almost endless.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Peter Devlin hit each of Moortowns scores in that period, while Cahir McMonagle responded with Steelstowns first score on  minutes. But it was a frustrating first half for the Derry side who hit four wides as they struggled to replicate their usual free-scoring game. It required a dferent type of skill in the second half and when McMonagle struck again just nine minutes in, Brian Ogs had hope. Time continued to tick away but  minutes into the second period, McMonagle struck his third point, a real beauty to tie up the game at -, and the travelling Steelstown crowd sensed the title was there for the taking. With just minutes remaining, Emmet Deane first Steelstown into the lead for the first time, and when McMonagle hit his fourth point of the game soon after, the job was almost done. Con Heron fisted the ball over the bar for Moortowns first core of the second half to make it a one-point game again, but in the dying seconds McMonagle struck again, with the final whistle following shortly afterwards to confirm Steelstown Brian Ogs as the Ulster champions for the first time in the clubs history.    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Pic by Mary K Burke. Reporter: Orlagh Mullan Jan Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Sunday th January  is a day that Steelstown will never forget. The day that they became champions of Ulster for the first time in their history. googletag.cmd.push Just two and a half months after winning their first Derry championship, the men of Brian Oacuteg’s came through their toughest challenge yet to overcome a dogged Moortown by - to - at a packed Owenbeg. Having dispatched of Cloughaneely, Donaghmoyne and Butlersbridge in some style on their way to the provincial showpiece, this was a totally dferent game in which Steelstown where often frustrated and only led for the first time in the th minute but, by the final whistle, they didn’t care one bit.  As manager Hugh McGrath took in the scenes of blue and gold on the field afterwards, he said it was a special and unforgettable day for the people of Steelstown, and also paid tribute to the late Brian Oacuteg McKeever after whom the club is named. “We thought Derry champions sounded good, but Ulster champions certainly has a ring to it! When you put the hard work in that these lads have and you’ve had so many close calls and disappointments, to get over the line in something so close and so tight and so nervy – it just means even more. Steelstown as Ulster champions is one that will live in the memory for a long time,” he said. “All week leading up to it there was an excitement in the group about being in the final but the big thing we were saying was that we were so proud that Brian Oacuteg’s name was being mentioned on a provincial level and in some places on a national level. For us that’s huge. McGrath continued: “We all know in the city what he was about and why we’re named after him, but when you see the way we dug that out today – that’s Brian Oacuteg McKeever. That spirit is exactly what it was. “We’re really proud. Lots of teams say that they’re proud, but we are immensely proud of getting that name on the map and hopefully we can get it on the national stage and make even more people aware of that. Evenit’s just to get them interested and to find out why we’re called Brian Oacuteg’s – great – because that story needs to be told all over.” DREAM COME TRUE As Steelstown captain Neil Forester made his way up the steps of Owenbeg to collect the cup, the only words he could utter were ‘this is the stuff of dreams.’ “It hasn’t sunk in,” admitted Forester afterwards. “There was maybe huge relief and satisfaction after the county final, but this is a dferent level. “Getting out of Derry was such a big thing for us because we just hadn’t done it. I kept saying just get past Cloughaneely in the first round and then you get the ball rolling then you don’t know what can happen with the momentum. We were brilliant that day, but the crossbar still had to save us and maybe that was that little bit of luck we needed. “This team has just grown and grown. To win an Ulster title against a fantastic and dogged Moortown team in conditions that probably suited them and their defensive style is special. The fact that all those habits and the hard work that we put in has paid off. “It’s literally unbelievable. We were talking about getting our monkey off the back in Derry but once we did that we have just kicked on so much. I honestly don’t know what  to say.”   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

a special teacher and a special friendSpecial tribute to lelong friendTributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKanesince his death on Friday. Reporter: Gary Ferry Jan Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Over the course of  years, I don’t think I’ve argued with anyone as much as I did with Sean O’Kane. googletag.cmd.push I mean, how can anyone seriously say to me that Jackie McNamara was a better footballer than Ryan Giggs  It was  and we were in the canteen of St. Columb’s College on the Buncrana Road, and he was adamant. One thing about Sean was that he was always passionate and he always stuck to his guns, eventhe truth was staring him right in the face. ‘I’m telling you Gary, he’s a far better player. Giggs is over-rated. And I’ll tell you another thing – any team that signs John Collins will win the Premier League.’ He actually said these words to me! Even now, when I’m trying to swallow the lump in my throat writing about my friend, I have to laugh and shake my head at that statement. John Collins went on to join Everton and he never, ever came near the Premier League title. We were both in our mid-teens, and the only thing that really mattered at that stage was football. This was the time of Oasis and Blur, where the internet didn’t exist, and your mood depended on how your team did at the weekend. Sean was Celtic through and through, just as I was Manchester United, and we rarely,ever, agreed on things on the pitch. I think it was the fact that we agreed on so many things off the pitch which ensured that we became friends. We were massive WWE fans, andwe weren’t lost in conversations about what Stone Cold Steve Austin did to Vince McMahon one week, we were laughing about what The Rock said the next week. We were proper wrestling geeks, a trait that connected us for  years after we left St. Columb’s, andever I needed to vent about anything wrestling-wise, Sean was the one to talk to. We also spent days, weeks and months playing football after school or during the summer holidays when his family moved to Fernabbey he, his brother Fergal, and sometimes his sisters Ciara and Eireann , would meet us all at the Youth Club in Lenamore and we would wile away the hours. At the weekend, it became more serious and we would go to the gravel pitches at the Sports Complex, before walking home together, barging and complaining and laughing the whole time. Sean was always an older head on younger shoulders. He consoled and talked me through my undying love for a teacher at St. Columb’s in those early years. Needless to say I am mortied looking back, but when I do look through my fingers at that cringeworthy period of my le, I remember Sean there, telling me she was a married woman and for me to wise up, in his own unique way of course. Oh and his coat! For some reason, his parents bought him this big warm winter coat, emblazoned with the Celtic crest. There’s nothing wrong with that, but for some utterly bizarre reason, on this coat designed for Baltic weather, the arms were detachable with a zip. I mean, why  That became the bane of Sean’s existence as we used to take off the arms and hide them and he would have to walk around school looking for them. But he loved that coat! Sean and I were also among the few in the school who, when we turned  – on the exact same day – refused to drink alcohol. I was never that interested and he was the same, but that lasted about as long as a Celtic title challenge these days as our other class mates – Colm McCloskey, Neal Sharkey, Paul McColgan, Gerard Grey and Piaras O’ Donaghalie got their hands on him. Before you knew it, Sean was living the le and living the hangovers, and that innocent -year-old teetotaller was lost to history. Le took us in dferent direction for a few years after that but it was Derry City FC which brought us back into the same circles. I was a junior reporter at the Derry News, and Stephen Kenny was taking the team places after years of struggle. Like any true Derry bandwagoner, Sean decided to come along and see what the fuss was about, bringing his good friend Damien Tracey along with him. The fact that his sister Ciara was playing for Derry City Ladies and dating Gareth McGlynn may have had something to do with it also. For a number of years, we would always meet at the games, and revel in a rich period for the Candystripes. It got to the stage that we went in on a bet together – Derry City to win - every game. I remember one such game, City were - up and won a penalty. Mark Farren stepped up to hit it and he missed! Sean was not amused, but luckily Liam Kearney headed one in late on and we were delighted, taking back everything we called Farrenso! I clicked so well with Sean, but I could never be as outspoken as him. He wasn’t shy in holding back his opinion and I always marvelled at that, simply because I couldn’t do it. I’m sure his colleagues and students at St. Joseph’s know what I’m talking about he was just so interesting, and he never failed to make me laugh with his witty observations and devastating putdowns. The fact that both Damien and Sean are gone now weighs heavily on me. I was driving on Saturday evening and it struck me how I wouldn’t hear Sean’s voice again, or read his texts when he would be calling Scott Brown a fraud or Neil Lennon a joke, or venting about whoever had annoyed him that particular week. Sean was able to accompany me to the Brandywell twice last year, for games against Shamrock Rovers and Drogheda United, and I’m so glad that happened. I know he enjoyed those games, and I enjoyed his company, and we laughed about the stupid things as we always did. I can’t claim to be Sean’s best friend, and I don’t knowhe would describe me as a friend or an acquaintance, but the fact that I could always text him about stupid stuff was something I always appreciated. I was on the periphery of his le in the sense that I didn’t go out with him or wasn’t party to his struggles as he fought, fought and fought his battles, but I have always considered him a friend, and I am so damn sad that he has gone. I’m in this job nearly  years and still I would be asking him to correct my headlines andthis or that sentence was grammatically correct. He was a self-proclaimed ‘Grammar grump’, as am I, which brings up another memory. We were in Wexford for the  League Cup final, and in the bar for the celebrations afterwards, another friend of mines looked on agog, as Sean and I complained about people’s grammar. It was ridiculous, but that’s what we were like together. Football, WWE and grammar. I know Sean was so well thought of at St. Joseph’s, at Tristar, and far beyond both in local circles. We were born on the exact same day – March ,  – and maybe that’s the reason I always felt so strongly linked to him. But we were linked by much more than our date of birth, and for that I am appreciative and for that I’ll remember him forever. Others can tell better stories and others will have been much closer to Sean than I was, and I can only imagine what they’re feeling today. Those students who have paid tribute to him on Facebook had a wonderful teacher – not just someone who knew the dference between a comma and an apostrophe, but who was willing to talk to them, to tell them stories, to give them advice, to connect with them on a human level. That kind of teacher is not so easy to find, believe me. Those students are the lucky ones. His best friends, who spent so many hours with him in good times and bad, are the lucky ones, His family, who were with him every step of the way, who made him laugh, who made him strong, who cared and consoled and supported him in those hard, hard days – they are the lucky ones. To have known him at all, makes me a lucky one. It is so hard to say goodbye to you Sean, so I won’t. Instead I’ll say thank you, so much, for arguing with me all those years and for making me laugh so often. And for the record – it took him  years, but he did eventually admit that he was wrong about Jackie McNamara. Better late than never. The page is blurry now as I write these final lines with tears in my eyes, but I’m pretty sure Sean is reading over this shaking his head at any spelling or grammar mistakes I must surely have made. I would expect nothing less from one of the best people I ever knew. Thank you for everything Sean. Until we meet again.

a special teacher and a special friendSpecial tribute to lelong friendTributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKanesince his death on Friday. Reporter: Gary Ferry Jan Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Over the course of  years, I don’t think I’ve argued with anyone as much as I did with Sean O’Kane. googletag.cmd.push I mean, how can anyone seriously say to me that Jackie McNamara was a better footballer than Ryan Giggs  It was  and we were in the canteen of St. Columb’s College on the Buncrana Road, and he was adamant. One thing about Sean was that he was always passionate and he always stuck to his guns, eventhe truth was staring him right in the face. ‘I’m telling you Gary, he’s a far better player. Giggs is over-rated. And I’ll tell you another thing – any team that signs John Collins will win the Premier League.’ He actually said these words to me! Even now, when I’m trying to swallow the lump in my throat writing about my friend, I have to laugh and shake my head at that statement. John Collins went on to join Everton and he never, ever came near the Premier League title. We were both in our mid-teens, and the only thing that really mattered at that stage was football. This was the time of Oasis and Blur, where the internet didn’t exist, and your mood depended on how your team did at the weekend. Sean was Celtic through and through, just as I was Manchester United, and we rarely,ever, agreed on things on the pitch. I think it was the fact that we agreed on so many things off the pitch which ensured that we became friends. We were massive WWE fans, andwe weren’t lost in conversations about what Stone Cold Steve Austin did to Vince McMahon one week, we were laughing about what The Rock said the next week. We were proper wrestling geeks, a trait that connected us for  years after we left St. Columb’s, andever I needed to vent about anything wrestling-wise, Sean was the one to talk to. We also spent days, weeks and months playing football after school or during the summer holidays when his family moved to Fernabbey he, his brother Fergal, and sometimes his sisters Ciara and Eireann , would meet us all at the Youth Club in Lenamore and we would wile away the hours. At the weekend, it became more serious and we would go to the gravel pitches at the Sports Complex, before walking home together, barging and complaining and laughing the whole time. Sean was always an older head on younger shoulders. He consoled and talked me through my undying love for a teacher at St. Columb’s in those early years. Needless to say I am mortied looking back, but when I do look through my fingers at that cringeworthy period of my le, I remember Sean there, telling me she was a married woman and for me to wise up, in his own unique way of course. Oh and his coat! For some reason, his parents bought him this big warm winter coat, emblazoned with the Celtic crest. There’s nothing wrong with that, but for some utterly bizarre reason, on this coat designed for Baltic weather, the arms were detachable with a zip. I mean, why  That became the bane of Sean’s existence as we used to take off the arms and hide them and he would have to walk around school looking for them. But he loved that coat! Sean and I were also among the few in the school who, when we turned  – on the exact same day – refused to drink alcohol. I was never that interested and he was the same, but that lasted about as long as a Celtic title challenge these days as our other class mates – Colm McCloskey, Neal Sharkey, Paul McColgan, Gerard Grey and Piaras O’ Donaghalie got their hands on him. Before you knew it, Sean was living the le and living the hangovers, and that innocent -year-old teetotaller was lost to history. Le took us in dferent direction for a few years after that but it was Derry City FC which brought us back into the same circles. I was a junior reporter at the Derry News, and Stephen Kenny was taking the team places after years of struggle. Like any true Derry bandwagoner, Sean decided to come along and see what the fuss was about, bringing his good friend Damien Tracey along with him. The fact that his sister Ciara was playing for Derry City Ladies and dating Gareth McGlynn may have had something to do with it also. For a number of years, we would always meet at the games, and revel in a rich period for the Candystripes. It got to the stage that we went in on a bet together – Derry City to win - every game. I remember one such game, City were - up and won a penalty. Mark Farren stepped up to hit it and he missed! Sean was not amused, but luckily Liam Kearney headed one in late on and we were delighted, taking back everything we called Farrenso! I clicked so well with Sean, but I could never be as outspoken as him. He wasn’t shy in holding back his opinion and I always marvelled at that, simply because I couldn’t do it. I’m sure his colleagues and students at St. Joseph’s know what I’m talking about he was just so interesting, and he never failed to make me laugh with his witty observations and devastating putdowns. The fact that both Damien and Sean are gone now weighs heavily on me. I was driving on Saturday evening and it struck me how I wouldn’t hear Sean’s voice again, or read his texts when he would be calling Scott Brown a fraud or Neil Lennon a joke, or venting about whoever had annoyed him that particular week. Sean was able to accompany me to the Brandywell twice last year, for games against Shamrock Rovers and Drogheda United, and I’m so glad that happened. I know he enjoyed those games, and I enjoyed his company, and we laughed about the stupid things as we always did. I can’t claim to be Sean’s best friend, and I don’t knowhe would describe me as a friend or an acquaintance, but the fact that I could always text him about stupid stuff was something I always appreciated. I was on the periphery of his le in the sense that I didn’t go out with him or wasn’t party to his struggles as he fought, fought and fought his battles, but I have always considered him a friend, and I am so damn sad that he has gone. I’m in this job nearly  years and still I would be asking him to correct my headlines andthis or that sentence was grammatically correct. He was a self-proclaimed ‘Grammar grump’, as am I, which brings up another memory. We were in Wexford for the  League Cup final, and in the bar for the celebrations afterwards, another friend of mines looked on agog, as Sean and I complained about people’s grammar. It was ridiculous, but that’s what we were like together. Football, WWE and grammar. I know Sean was so well thought of at St. Joseph’s, at Tristar, and far beyond both in local circles. We were born on the exact same day – March ,  – and maybe that’s the reason I always felt so strongly linked to him. But we were linked by much more than our date of birth, and for that I am appreciative and for that I’ll remember him forever. Others can tell better stories and others will have been much closer to Sean than I was, and I can only imagine what they’re feeling today. Those students who have paid tribute to him on Facebook had a wonderful teacher – not just someone who knew the dference between a comma and an apostrophe, but who was willing to talk to them, to tell them stories, to give them advice, to connect with them on a human level. That kind of teacher is not so easy to find, believe me. Those students are the lucky ones. His best friends, who spent so many hours with him in good times and bad, are the lucky ones, His family, who were with him every step of the way, who made him laugh, who made him strong, who cared and consoled and supported him in those hard, hard days – they are the lucky ones. To have known him at all, makes me a lucky one. It is so hard to say goodbye to you Sean, so I won’t. Instead I’ll say thank you, so much, for arguing with me all those years and for making me laugh so often. And for the record – it took him  years, but he did eventually admit that he was wrong about Jackie McNamara. Better late than never. The page is blurry now as I write these final lines with tears in my eyes, but I’m pretty sure Sean is reading over this shaking his head at any spelling or grammar mistakes I must surely have made. I would expect nothing less from one of the best people I ever knew. Thank you for everything Sean. Until we meet again.

Pic by Tom Heaney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Jan Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Caolan McLaughlin is determined to use his loan spell at Institute to prove to Ruaidhri Higgins that he can be a part of his plans at Derry City. googletag.cmd.push The -year-old made his ‘Stute debut last Saturday and played the full  minutes in the - Irish Cup defeat to Portstewart at the Brandywell. He is likely to feature again in the away game at Ballyclare this weekend, with coach Brian Donaghey promising first team experience in his six-month loan spell. It is a chance that McLaughlin is determined to make the most of. “I think it’s a great opportunity for me to go and play games and show people what I am all about,” he said. “Hopefully then I can come back after the loan spell and see what happens I’ll be knocking on the manager’s door for a place in the team. “Last season there was talk about a loan but nothing came from it, but now I’m just eager to go out and play football and show everyone that I can play. I had a chat with Ruaidhri. We had a good meeting and he knew it was best for me and I knew it was best for me too. It was best for both parties to be honest.” McLaughlin made his Derry City debut last March away to Longford under Declan Devine and went on to make six first team appearances in all throughout the  season. He featured in big games against Dundalk and Shamrock Rovers, but didn’t appear in the first team picture at any stage after May. With Higgins’ midfield options only strengthened due to recent arrivals at the club, a loan spell where became the more realistic option.  “That was all good experience for me, coming off the bench and hopefully now, with getting more experience with Institute I can go back and play more part in the games for Derry” he continued. “It was a bit frustrating , but it was a hard season at the start. Since Ruaidhri came in the standard has gone up. It’s all about biding my time at the minute and hopefully I can get the opportunity to play and hopefully I can take it. “I know the standards have gone straight through the roof with players like Patrick McEleney and Mickey Duffy coming in, and I know what Will Patching can do too, so I will be hard to get a place in the team, so hopefully with this opportunity with Institute, I can do it.” Settling in McLaughlin’s ‘Stute debut did not go as planned with an unexpected defeat to an Intermediate League opponent, but he is optimistic that with other new arrivals, things will start to pick up for the club in the coming weeks. “It was a bit of a disappointing result but it was good to get out there,” he agreed. “It was only my first game so it’s about settling into the team. The more games I play the more settled I’ll be. They are a great much of lads so hopefully we can pick up results and climb up that league. “I have known Briansince I was younger because I played in the county team with him. I can’t say a bad word about him, he’s a great manager and a great person. I had a chat on the phone for him for about  minutes and I know his aspirations for the second part of the season. It was a no-brainer to go to them to be honest. “These games that are coming up now will stand me in great stead. Coming back to Derry with that experience under my belt will be good. I need to be playing men’s football at the age I am, that will take me on and develop me as a player.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Pic by Tom Heaney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Jan Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Caolan McLaughlin is determined to use his loan spell at Institute to prove to Ruaidhri Higgins that he can be a part of his plans at Derry City. googletag.cmd.push The -year-old made his ‘Stute debut last Saturday and played the full  minutes in the - Irish Cup defeat to Portstewart at the Brandywell. He is likely to feature again in the away game at Ballyclare this weekend, with coach Brian Donaghey promising first team experience in his six-month loan spell. It is a chance that McLaughlin is determined to make the most of. “I think it’s a great opportunity for me to go and play games and show people what I am all about,” he said. “Hopefully then I can come back after the loan spell and see what happens I’ll be knocking on the manager’s door for a place in the team. “Last season there was talk about a loan but nothing came from it, but now I’m just eager to go out and play football and show everyone that I can play. I had a chat with Ruaidhri. We had a good meeting and he knew it was best for me and I knew it was best for me too. It was best for both parties to be honest.” McLaughlin made his Derry City debut last March away to Longford under Declan Devine and went on to make six first team appearances in all throughout the  season. He featured in big games against Dundalk and Shamrock Rovers, but didn’t appear in the first team picture at any stage after May. With Higgins’ midfield options only strengthened due to recent arrivals at the club, a loan spell where became the more realistic option.  “That was all good experience for me, coming off the bench and hopefully now, with getting more experience with Institute I can go back and play more part in the games for Derry” he continued. “It was a bit frustrating , but it was a hard season at the start. Since Ruaidhri came in the standard has gone up. It’s all about biding my time at the minute and hopefully I can get the opportunity to play and hopefully I can take it. “I know the standards have gone straight through the roof with players like Patrick McEleney and Mickey Duffy coming in, and I know what Will Patching can do too, so I will be hard to get a place in the team, so hopefully with this opportunity with Institute, I can do it.” Settling in McLaughlin’s ‘Stute debut did not go as planned with an unexpected defeat to an Intermediate League opponent, but he is optimistic that with other new arrivals, things will start to pick up for the club in the coming weeks. “It was a bit of a disappointing result but it was good to get out there,” he agreed. “It was only my first game so it’s about settling into the team. The more games I play the more settled I’ll be. They are a great much of lads so hopefully we can pick up results and climb up that league. “I have known Briansince I was younger because I played in the county team with him. I can’t say a bad word about him, he’s a great manager and a great person. I had a chat on the phone for him for about  minutes and I know his aspirations for the second part of the season. It was a no-brainer to go to them to be honest. “These games that are coming up now will stand me in great stead. Coming back to Derry with that experience under my belt will be good. I need to be playing men’s football at the age I am, that will take me on and develop me as a player.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Festival organisers plan to give out the honours at an in-person event in the coastal Calornia town on March  . The eight actors singled out for the award also include newcomers, such as Saniyya Sidney, who plays Venus Williams in King Richard, and Coda’s Emilia Jones and Troy Kotsur, as well as more familiar faces, including Simon Rexand Dornan. The event, hosted by TCM’s Dave Karger, will include discussions with the talent – which could for some be a stop on the road to the Oscars on March . Karger said the honorees are “integral parts of the season’s most exciting and emotional films”. Previous recipients have included Zendaya, Riz Ahmed and Awkwafina. The long-running film festival, now in its th year, regularly attracts more than , attendees to the idyllic town for films,  and tributes. The full line-up for the early March gathering will be unveiled in February. Organisers are planning for the -day event to be in-person come March , although Covid concerns have once again disrupted many early-year film and awards season events. Last week saw the cancellation of the Palm Springs International Film Festival, which was set to start this week, and the Sundance Film Festival announced this week that it would pivot to a virtual festival. Both the Academy’s Governors Awards and the Critics Choice Awards were postponed from their mid-January dates as well.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on. --  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnailsADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Last updated    : Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Tributes have been paid to Sean OrsquoKane since his death on Friday.

Registration had opened months in advance and entries sold out in record time, a clear indication that this race has become a firm favourite for the elite and the not so elite runner.For most, it is the sense of turning up on the day not knowing what to expect. The race has two unique selling points.Firstly, you have to run with a partner and you are only ever as good as your other half.Many alliances come unstuck on the hills and in the mud and friendships are often lost, regained and lost again as the race unfolds.Secondly, and perhaps more uniquely, only a select few know the course in advance and they are sworn to secrecy.This is unusual in that most of us go to a race knowing what to expect in terms of distance, terrain and elevation: not so with this one.The only information is that it begins and ends in Castlewellan and it is between eight-and-a-half and nine miles .The course this year was a very tightly guarded secret with only those entrusted to assist with the marking on the eve of the race getting any real insight.When asked to describe the course, the Prophet simply stated: lsquoit will stun the legs and play with the headrsquo.These words rang in my head as I ran around fields that I never expected to, climbed hills that I never climbed before and at one point,my eyesight is not failing, saw Sherpa Tenzing throwing down ropes and herding a cabinet of yaks.At the business end of proceeding, there was some real class on parade with Irish mountain running sensation Zak Hannapaired with Andrew Annett , a man in great form as evidenced by his superb win in the Armagh Ten.This international pairing with real climbing pedigree firmly lived up to their billing as odds-on favourites and were almost three minutes ahead of their nearest challengers, the youthful pairing of Jared Martinand Tom Crudgington .With many years of running ahead, both these young men are capable of winning the race in the not-too-distant future.The podium was completed by the last minute pairing of Jonny Scottand Aaron McGrady , who hooked up on the morning of the event due to late withdrawals.The chemistry was clearly good and the partnership worked as they came home in just over  minutes ndash  seconds adrt of Martin and Crudgington.The ladiesrsquo race was a tighter affair with Amanda Perry and Denise Logue from Ballydrain winning by  seconds from Dearbhla Coxand Niamh Donnelly .The podium was completed by Clair Quigley and Fiona McQuillan .The mixed team event is always closely fought and this year was no dferent. With a mile to go to the finish, eventual winners Aidan Brownand Nakita Burkewere still under pressure from Stephen Connolly and Caitlyn Harvey from North Down AC.However, in the final twists and turns the former prevailed and ran out winners by around a minute, finishing eighth and tenth overall respectively.The podium was completed by Neil McGeough, Newcastlersquos rising star, and his partner, Irish Olympian Kerry OrsquoFlaherty, an athlete more at home on the track and over barriers than climbing ditches.Throughout the field there was great camaraderie and the craic was mighty. Social media was buzzing after the race with participants commenting that this was the best course they had ever ran over, despite the numerous challenges that it presented.The race organisers are indebted to everyone, too many to mention inidually, who contributed in any way to the success of the event.It brought great joy to those taking part and spectating at a time when anything that improves our well-being is something to celebrate..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5_January2022_Down.jpg","title":"McCartan hopes for dream start back at the helm  ","story":"DOWN manager James McCartan will be looking for a dream start to hisat the helm this Friday when his Mourne side take on Donegal in the first round of the Dr McKenna Cup.The red and black outfit will travel to MacCumhail Park for a .pm throw-in, in what will be the first piece of action for the county this year.The ing fan favourite will not be under any illusions as to the level of stf competition his footballers will face off against, as they travel to the home of last yearrsquos Ulster semi-finalists.Antrim are the other outfit that make up Section A, with Down welcoming the Saffrons to Newry in their second game next Tuesday.McCartan has already faced adversities in his second stint as boss before his team have even lined out, due to a number of regular Mourne players ruled out of contention.Carryduff duo James Guinness and Owen McCabe, Bryansford shot-stopper Marc Reid and experienced Burren duo Gerard McGovern and Donal OrsquoHare are among those unavailable.The former All-Star man in charge, alongside assistant Aidan OrsquoRourke, have already began drafting in suitable replacements and have recently been given a notable boost in the form of ing former captain Niall McParland.The Glenn clubman has ed following three years teaching in Doha, Qatar, and will be someone who McCartan looks to in order to bring his wealth of experience to the rest of the side ndashespecially those who are up and coming talents.ldquoThe squad has changed but itrsquos good to see some new faces in the , said McParland.ldquoJames and Aidan have a handle on everyone in the county and they have a good squad together so far.ldquoI was happy to get the call to go back because I didnrsquot knowI would get it ndash I donrsquot take anything for granted, he continued.ldquoNow Irsquom fighting for my place in the team.Alongside this encouraging news for the county, current star Barry OrsquoHagan believes Down could benefit even further from an influx of Kilcoo players.However, the current champions of Down are currently hoping to retain their Ulster title when they face off against Derrygonnelly on January , which will see them out of action until things unfold.With this meaning they will not be available for selection for the Dr McKenna Cup, this doesnrsquot necessarily rule out some of the  featuring in the Division Two league campaign.ldquoAt the minute, therersquos probably eight or nine of them you would definitely want in, said OrsquoHagan.ldquoWhether they commit or not I donrsquot know, itrsquos up to those men, but you need the talent and the experience those boys have.ldquoObviously their full focus is on Kilcoo at the minute, as yoursquod expect..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5_January2022_TableTennis.jpg","title":"Owenbeg are on title march  ","story":"IT was an early Christmas present for Owenbeg with a double win over St Johnrsquos to keep their Division One title hopes on track.The current league champions still have three outstanding matches with league leaders Banbridge, so it is still all to play for in this ision.In Division Two, Drumaness kept their title hopes alive with their win over St Johnrsquos.

He also taught commercial subjects like arithmetic and bookkeeping, for use in commerce and industry.Dr Neilson and his clergymen sons were notable for their warm cross-denominational outlook.Fr Luke Walsh, PP in North Antrim, near Ballycastle, spoke highly of his old Kilmore tutor: ldquoI was educated by a Presbyterian clergyman, a man of as great moral worth and sterling integrity as Ireland could boast of.In , as Bishop of Down and Dromore, William Crolly described Rev James Neilson of Downpatrick as ldquoone of the most liberal and respected clergymen in Co Down.Around  Moses began compiling an Irish grammar, later assisted by his son William. In their pursuit of Irish studies, the two Neilsons collaborated with Patrick Lynch, principal of a distinguished Irish and Classical academy in Loughinisland, six miles away.In March  William Neilson was installed as minister of Dundalk Presbyterian Church. This was a perfect fit for his developing academic interests. Attached to the Dundalk congregation was a colony of Gaelic-speaking Scots Presbyterians living in Ballymascanlon.Originally from Argylle, they had fought for King William in . Hence it was a standing requirement that the congregationrsquos clergy be fluent in Irish.William thrived in Dundalk. In the late s Irish was still the first language with large parts of the population in Down and Louth . He preached widely in Irish. In July  he went on a preaching tour of Ulster, achieving wide popularity.RebellionBack in Co Down, and during the  Rebellion period, his preaching activities on one occasion brought him into collision with the military authorities. His father was actually Moderator in the year of the Rising.Dr Moses needed permission from General Nugent to hold the General Synodin Lurgan that August. One Sunday in  his son William was invited back to his fatherrsquos church, to preach in Irish. The event generated considerable interest, and the church was packed.The authorities were nervous in the wake of the rebellion and news of this unusually large assembly soon reached official ears.Halfway through the sermon a party of yeomen entered the church. With no space left to seat them, they occupied the twin staircases leading up to the pulpit. When William had finished preaching they promptly arrested him, and seized theof his sermon.The soldiers involved were likely from the Kilmore Yeomanry. Their Lieutenant at the time was Charles Hamilton, William Strain of Kilmore was a sergeant, and Patrick Soy of \"Tollinagrew\" a private.They marched William all the way to Down Gaol in Downpatrick, newly opened on the Mall in  . Their arrival likely caused some consternation with the Gaol Governor, because the Neilson clergy were widely known to be loyal to the Crown.Rev William bailed by Rev JamesScrambling to smooth over this military faux pas, the Governor sent across town for James Neilson, brother of the prisoner, and minister of the nearby Stream Street Presbyterian congregation. The Rev William was then bailed into the custody of the Rev James,with instructions to appear in court next day.Next morning the magistrate encountered a dficulty mdash he couldnrsquot understand the manuscript of Williamrsquos sermon, preached in Irish the day before. William helpfully offered to translate. It transpired the contents were innocuous, and the prisoner was promptly released. The details of this intriguing episode were recorded a century later by a Neilson descendant .Academic careerIn Dundalk William ran a Classical and mercantile academy similar to his fatherrsquos. In an astonishing burst of creativity, he continued to develop his skills as a linguist.In  he published Greek exercises in syntax, ellipsis, dialects, prosody and metaphrasis. In recognition of this, Glasgow University awarded him an honorary DD in . In  he was elected Presbyterian Moderator. In  he published Introduction to the Irish language, on the basis of which he was elected MRIA in .There were a number of advantages in learning Irish, William explained. For academics, it gave essential insights into other European languages. And for the wider population, it enabled competent communication with those large sections of the population whose first language was still Irish.In contemporary Ireland, he asserted, clergymen, lawyers and farmers could not conduct their business properly without a knowledge of Irish.Paradoxically, the subjects taught in schools run by the Neilson clergy, and others, eventually undermined the use of Irish nationally. The Industrial Revolution was in full swing, and employment opportunities in industry and commerce were exploding.For those without a knowledge of English, Irish-only fluency was becoming an overwhelming disadvantage. When the new national school system was instituted in Ireland in , teachers knew that English was now the essential passport to wider employment.The great Daniel OrsquoConnell ruefully acknowledged the new reality. ldquoAlthough the language is associated with many recollections that twine round the hearts of Irishmen, yet the superior utility of the English tongue, as the medium of all modern communication is so great, that I can witness, without a sigh, the gradual disuse of Irish.At that time there were a number of ieties of Irish, but under the new dispensation the vernacular spoken in East Ulster eventually became extinct. Fortunately William Neilson preserved many Co Down examples in his  Grammar. In the words of his descendant Joseph Nelson, Williamrsquos ldquodialogues and familiar phrases, which form the second part, are a complete guide to the ideas as well as the phrases of the peasantry.Untimely deathIn  William was appointed professor of classical languages and Hebrew at the Belfast Academical Institution. In April  he was elected professor of Classics at Glasgow University. However, he had contracted rheumatic fever, and died on the th of that month, aged only . He was buried in the family vault close to the west gable of his fatherrsquos church in Rademon.A full colour pamphlet based on this article has been produced by Rowallane and Slieve Croob Community Group, to accompany Joyce Gibsonrsquos ongoing Irish language classes in Ballynahinch Market House..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5January2022_LinenHall.jpg","title":"Tributes to former chief librarian at Linen Hall Library who was also decorated Gaelic player  ","story":"A LOUGHINISLAND man who was the custodian of some of Northern Irelandrsquos most precious books and written history will be buried tomorrow.The former chief librarian of Belfastrsquos Linen Hall Library, John Killen was hailed as a ldquogentleman and friend to all after he died peacefully at his home on Sunday.A respected author, historian and former Gaelic footballer, Mr Killen was aged .He had worked at Irelandrsquos oldest and last subion library for  years and became friends with some of its most regular visitors, such as the poet Seamus Heaney, writers Sam Hanna Bell, John Hewitt, Joseph Tomelty and the artist Padraic Woods.Mr Killen retired in January , after taking up his first role as an Irish reference librarian at the Linen Hall in .He was known for continuing the work of a former colleague, Jimmy Vitty, by establishing an extensive political papers section of posters, prisonersrsquo books and records from the Maze Long Kesh.The collection houses more than , separate items and is now used by academics and students from across the world.Among the many books written by Mr Killen was the story of the  year-old library, along with the Irish Christmas Book and The Unkindest Cut: A Cartoon History of Ulster -, as well as books on the Irish famine and the United Irishmen.One of his most recent books was The St Patrickrsquos Treasury, a celebration of the myths, legends and traditions of Irelandrsquos patron saint who is buried in the grounds of Down Cathedral.Mr Killen was also highly regarded as a county hurler and Gaelic footballer who won championship medals, having played for his home club Loughinisland, Downpatrickrsquos RGU and Queenrsquos.Loughinisland GAC said on social media the club was ldquodevastated to learn of Mr Killenrsquos death who had also been a member and secretary in .He won two championship medals with the club in  and .Mr Killen, who was reared in Saul, started as a Gaelic footballer with RGU.He won several Minor championships medals for the Downpatrick side, including leading them to victory over Loughinisland in the SFC final in .Queenrsquos GAA remembered on social media how Mr Killen was a former Sigerson Cup player from - and was also part of the first All-Ireland Freshers winning team in .The Linen Hall Library shared its reaction to the sad news on social media.It said of its former head: ldquoJohn joined the Library in  and dedicated the next  years to this institution.

They aim to break down the dferences we have as a society by promoting better knowledge, tolerance and understanding.ldquoThe laws that govern us all, especially those written in relation to females, do definitely need to change for equality to happen.She continued: ldquoWe, as a society, also have to encourage change from the ground level up. Educating our young people and changing adult preconceived perceptions are also so important.ldquoBoys and girls, men and women. We are all iniduals who should be treated fairly and equally.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

As you will have heard in the media, this new Omicron iant of COVID is very infectious. But it does not appear to cause serious illnessyou have been double or triple vaccinated. But frankly I am shocked how badly the biochemistry of this virus has been explained by politicians and so-called experts. As a biochemist with an international reputation please forgive meI try to explain. When you are vaccinated in the arm the main antibody generated is called IgG. This should stop serious illness. But when you get infected in the respiratory tract you also produce another type called IgA. This is secreted into the tract. Also, there is a dferent T-lymphocyte response when you are infected directly there. So, vaccination in the arm will not necessarily stop you getting COVID because your vaccination doesnt activate the IgA production sufficiently. Furthermore, for your immune system to activate against COVID, you have to produce some of the virus and its antigen. This would make you test positive by PCR, which is very sensitive, and probably by lateral flow. Thus, the problem is thatyou get COVID, even mildly, then you would have to isolate for ten days, and this would spoil Christmas again. We can’t risk this. That is why Penarth Bridge Club will close until th January . But here is an interesting hand from last week where the challenge for North South was to bid a slam. But which one – six hearts or seven clubs The AuctionSouth opened the auction with his five-card heart suit. North with fteen points knows game must be on, and maybe a slam. So, he bid two clubs. South felt his hand was strong enough now to reverse, keeping his support for clubs till a later bid. North was tempted to jump to four hearts but this might prevent them reaching a slam. So, he bid three hearts, knowing his partner would bid on after his reverse bid of two spades. Indeed, South now needed to show his support for clubs and so bid four clubs. North now bid four no trumps, Roman key card Blackwood. They were playing   so South’s response of five diamonds must show three key cards with clubs as trumps. North now could see seven clubs must be on, as South’s key cards must be the ace of spades, the ace of hearts and the king of clubs..removeThe playTrick  – East led the queen of diamonds, declarer winning the trick with his ace of diamonds, discarding a spade from dummy. Trick  – North considered the hand. Was he going to take the spade finesse  In fact,the hearts were   or   then he could discard his losing spade on the final heart. But trumps first. He played the ace of clubs from his hand. Trick  – He followed this by winning the next trick with dummy’s king of clubs. Good news. The defenders trumps were  , so he would not have to risk taking the spade finesse. Tricks ,  and  - Declarer then won the next three tricks with his king and queen and dummy’s ace of hearts. Trick  – He then ruffed a heart in his hand, establishing dummy’s last heart as a winner. Trick  – Declarer then ed to dummy by ruffing a diamond. Trick  – He then played dummy’s winning last heart, discarding the two of spades from his hand. Tricks  and  – He then played the ace of spades, followed by a small spade which he ruffed in hand. Trick – Declarer then ruffed his last losing diamond with dummy’s last trump. Tricks  – Declarer then claimed the last trick with his remaining club, the grand slam making with thirteen tricks for score of  - one spade, four hearts, one diamond, two diamond ruffs in dummy, and five clubs in hand. Well bid and well played. Six hearts makes but not seven, because East held four trumps.What have we learnt . It is often a good idea to show your partner a strong hand by reversing, as here, before showing support for his suit.. Once again Roman key card Blackwood.is an essential part of your armoury to reach a slam.. Always checkyou can establish small cards in a suit by ruffing before considering a finesse.Penarth club resultsFriday  December . Trish Tracey and Tony Campbell. Jim Elder and Meryl Skipper.

Coli.The waters would then get a classication of excellent, good, sufficient or poor, which is then published by the Welsh Government.If successful, the beaches would be granted bathing water status by May , when the bathing season begins.There are  bathing waters in Wales, with the closest one to Penarth being located in Barry.This is despite many local groups taking to the water in Penarth early in the mornings.James Tennet, , is the Penarth resident behind the application.Mr Tennet said: \"No one really knows what the water quality is.\"Lots of people say the waters arent very nice in Penarth while others will say Ive been swimming there for  years and its fine.\"But theres no actual data, nobody really knows because its not tested.\"If the tests show that the water is poor, then steps will have to be taken to improve the quality of the water.If the tests are poor for five years in a row, then the bathing water status will be revoked and advice given to avoid the water.:Mr Tennet has been open-water swimming since November, but has been travelling to Barry instead of using the water in Penarth.\"As a permanent resident, Id like to swim more, but I dont have time to drive to the nearest designated bathing area in Barry every day,\" said Mr Tennet.\"Wild swimming is so good for mental wellbeing and I think thats why it would be so greatPenarth Beach was a designated bathing water - in order to allow so many other people to benefit in this way as well..remove\"There are still people who are hesitant because of this unknown of what the water quality is like.\"The public consultancy stage runs until February .To take part in the consultancy, visit the Welsh Government page here and complete the survey.Although both Penarth Beach and Col-Huw Beach are listed in the same survey, you may ignore the questions on one of the beaches as one beach being granted bathing water status isnt reliant on the other also being granted the status. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Members were informed the council will be launching an online survey to judge where or , there is enough interest in providing the borough’s citizens with allotment space.The survey will run for a period of eight weeks and once completed, officers will provide councillors who sit on the committee with options on how best to move forward on the matter.Speaking at the meeting, Alliance Party Councillor Eoin Tennyson said he would be delightedthis process resulted in an enhancement of allotment provision in the borough.An online survey is to be carried out to seetheres a demand for allotment space.“It is great to see the online consultation coming forward to determine what the demand is in the community,” he said.“I know allotment projects have been successful in other parts of Northern Ireland and there are good private providers here so it would be fantastic , out of this process, we could enhance our own provision or even have better partnerships with those providers in the borough.“That would be really positive for those in the borough who want to grow their own food.”Ulster Unionist Party Councillor Julie Flaherty told the chamber she believed there would be strong demand for this service.An online survey is to be carried out to seetheres a demand for allotment space.“I suspect there will be a huge interest in these allotments,” said Cllr Flaherty.“In the centre of Portadown there is a vegetable group, the group attached to that has  members and some of them are growing at home and learning how to use what they grow.“Recycling, composting, you name it, there are over  members there in the centre of Portadown. That is a good gauge of the level of interest and we are very proud of the guys at sustain who have worked very hard over lockdown too.”Speaking after the meeting, Cllr Tennyson continued to speak highly of the proposal and noted the strong demand for allotment space in other council areas.“Community allotments can have a positive impact on mental health and wellbeing, and on the local environment,” said Cllr Tennyson.“We have some fantastic allotment providers in the borough. However, there is clearly huge demand and it would be fantastic to see greater council support for existing providers and potentially even some new council-owned sites.I first raised the issue of allotment provision at committee in September. It’s fantastic to see progress on the matter. The proposed survey will be good news to many local residents who wish to grow their own food but don’t currently have access to appropriate facilities.“Information presented at committee clearly highlighted the popularity of allotments in other areas with both Antrim and Newtownabbey and Mid and East Antrim Council, with some having waiting lists of five years or more.“Once the online survey has been completed, Council will analyse the results to determinethere is demand additional allotment provision and put plans in place to meet that demand.”Craigavon Borough CouncilBanbridgeArmagh CityUlster Unionist Party  \"       \"  ]]Most PopularFuneral arrangements for young Co Armagh footballer Jamie Ho...NewsBacklash after Portadown FC sign Joe Gorman: Fans vent over ...NewsDelays expected during Newtownabbey works...NewsAngle grinder used during break in at Craigavon shops after ...NewsLarne charity founder receives Points of Light award from Pr...NewsMost Popular                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleYour Northern IrelandRecommendedMore from Northern Ireland WorldAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessArchiveSubscribeEventsPlace your AdReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gsNilK sc-bXTejn cGeDpV iufVtK\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement       \" d\"M.,.c-.-.-.-.-.-.c-.-.-.-.,-.c.-.,.-.,.,l.-. c.,.,.,.,.,c.-.,.-.,-.L,.c.,.,.,.,,.C.,.,.,.,.,.\"   \" d\"M,.c.,.,.,.,.,.c.,.,.,.,,.c-.,.-.,.-.,l-.,. c-.-.-.-.-.,c-.,.-.,.,,.L.,c-.-.-.-.,-.C.,.,.,.,,.\"   \" d\"M.,c.,,.,.,.,.c,.-.,.-.,.S,.,,.C,.,.,,.,\"    News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationEnvironmentPeopleRead ThisFootball\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      FootballIrish League FootballSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCarsFamilyRetroOpinionYour NI\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Your NI​Antrim and NewtownabbeyArmagh Banbridge and CraigavonBelfastCauseway Coast and GlensLondonderry Derry City and StrabaneLisburn and CastlereaghMid and East AntrimMid UlsterFermanagh and OmaghNewry Mourne and DownArds and North DownMust ReadContact usAdvertise My BusinessFollow us      "},{"url":null,"title":"sugden reiterates support for portrush skatepark ","story":"Call to suspend house building at Larne West ‘until link road completed’   Tributes to young Co Armagh footballer Jamie Hoye who died suddenlyNewsCoronavirusTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsHealthBusinessEducationPeopleEnvironmentRead ThisFootballIrish League FootballSportMotorcyclingIce HockeyOther SportWhats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyleFood and DrinkTravelHomes and GardensCars FamilyYour NIRetroOpinionAdvertise My BusinessNewsPoliticsCouncilSugden reiterates support for Portrush skateparkEast Londonderry MLA Claire Sugden has reiterated her support for a skatepark to be built in Portrush.By Una CulkinTuesday, th January , : pm  \"       \"  Ms Sugden said it would be an “investment in youth” at a time when youth services were underfunded and under-resourced. A proposal to lease land at pole Park for such a facility will be considered by Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council’s Leisure and Development Committee on Tuesday .“There has been a large community of skateboard, rollerblade, scooter and BMX users in the town for decades,” Ms Sugden said. “Dferent areas around the town have been used by them over the years, but this is not ideal and can create safety issues both for them and other members of the public.“Having a dedicated space for these urban sports would enable them to thrive and create a hub where people of all ages can engage in these sports.“Young people are often scrutinised when they gather in groups in town centres. Providing a relevant focus for young people in the town would demonstrate our commitment to supporting their interests.“Many successful skateparks have been created across Northern Ireland, but not many places have the same tradition and community of urban sports as Portrush does.
