The Royal baby won’t be a prince or princess, despite being seventh in line to the throneWhy won’t the Royal baby be a prince or princess?Meghan and Harry’s baby is expected to take their father’s title, Sussex, as the surname—just as Princes George and Louis, and Princess Charlotte took the surname Cambridge.But as the second son of the Prince of Wales, Harry’s children are not entitled to receive a HRH title.That is because of Harry’s great-great-grandfather King George V. The monarch limited the titles given within the Royal family in 1917.He declared: \u0027The grandchildren of the sons of any such Sovereign in the direct male line (save only the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales) shall have and enjoy in all occasions the style and title enjoyed by the children of Dukes of these Our Realms.’This means that if the new Royal baby is a boy, he will become the Earl of Dumbarton, a subsidiary title given to Prince Harry on the day of his wedding.If the Royal baby is a girl, she would be  Lady (first name) Mountbatten-Windsor, with her sons being Lord Mountbatten-Windsor.However, this is only the case as it stands the Queen can make changes that would see Meghan and Harry’s children become princes and princesses. She did just that ahead of the birth of Prince George, issuing a Letters Patent that ensured all of William and Kate Middleton’s children had HRH titles.Without the Queen’s intervention, Charlotte and Louis would have automatically been Lady and Lord. Prince George would still have been a prince because he was the eldest son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales. The Queen may decide to do the same for Harry’s children.Chance the Rapper went undercover as a Lyft driver to raise money for Chicago Public SchoolsJennifer Aniston is helping Selena Gomez after she was hospitalized for mental breakdownSpecial Edition Diablo 3 Bundle for Nintendo Switch announcedMeghan Markle pregnant: Royal baby traditions the Duchess will have to followThe Conners: What time is the premiere and how does Roseanne die?Fortnite will be the most popular Halloween costume in 2018Dancing With the Stars trio week: Who will be joining the couples?Michael Buble net worth revealed as singer quits musicWhen is Spring 2019: When is the first day of spring and how is it decided?Why did Ariana Grade and Pete Davidson split up?Meghan Markle pregnant: This is why Prince Harry\u0027s baby won\u0026#8217t get a prince or princess title like George and Charlotte doMeghan Markle Prince Harry Royal Tour: What will the couple do in Australia?Man Booker Prize 2018 long list: All you need to know Meghan Markle pregnant: All you need to know about Prince Harry and Meghan\u0027s babyMeghan Markle pregnant: When is the Royal baby due? X Factor 2018 spoilers: Who are the final 16 and when are the live shows?EuroMillions results: Winning lottery numbers for Friday, October 12"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/14/21/5152C16800000578-0-image-m-12_1539550196913.jpg","title":"Heavily pregnant Pippa Middleton spotted arriving Lindo Wing","story":"    James Matthews carries two large bags into the Lindo Wing yesterday at St Mary\u0027s Hospital in Paddington, West London          James Matthews, carrying a £78 Cam Cam Copenhagen baby changing bag and another holdall, entered the hospital on Monday          Mr Matthews arrived at the private maternity unit three days after attending Eugenie\u0027s wedding with Pippa in Windsor Kate suffered from severe morning sickness when she was expecting her children, but Pippa has boasted that she was enjoying a Zen-like pregnancy - using meditation to cope with the last few weeks before she gives birth.The socialite attended the royal wedding of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank at Windsor Castle last Friday, sitting in the front row of the nave at St George\u0027s Chapel with her husband plus her brother James Middleton.Not so understated after all!

He thinks Meghan will make a great mum as she is already so maternal,\u0027 said a source to The Sun. Meghan is believed to have not spoken to her father since before her wedding to Prince Harry in May after Thomas backed out at the last minute due to ill health. Her half-sister Samantha was pictured yesterday buying a congratulatory card for the couple. She told The Sun she hoped the baby would bring the family closer together. She said: \u0027I would hope that — for the sake of the baby, the family, the world and my dad — that leaving him out of the statement was not intentional.\u0027I hope my dad is included and at a proper time. If he is excluded, I won\u0027t be happy. It is in the best interests of the baby for my dad to be included.\u0027A baby changes everything and softens everyone. I would only hope that there would be some adjustment or some way of including him.\u0027             Doria Ragland, pictured with her daughter in May, said she was \u0027very happy about this lovely news\u0027 and \u0027looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild\u0027            Meghan is seen resting her head on Prince Harry\u0027s shoulder as the meet and greet came to an end on Tuesday afternoon            The royal couple are pictured coming down the steps of the iconic Sydney Opera House to speak with fans waiting outside      The Duke and Duchess of Sussex revealed the news of their pregnancy just days after telling the Queen at Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding (above) Thomas was spotted out and about buying groceries during which time the former Hollywood lighting director denied reports that he dabbled with using cocaine as he brought Meghan up.\u0027Never happened, no comment,\u0027 Thomas said when asked about the drug use reports. Grandfather-to-be Thomas was spotted shopping alone for groceries as Meghan and Harry were breaking news of their pregnancy to the Royal Family who he has never met.The Duchess of Sussex\u0027s father drove across the US border from his home in Rosarito, Mexico on Friday around the time his daughter and son-in-law were telling relatives at Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding they were expecting their first child.Thomas appeared to be in high spirits as he was pictured buying beers, pot pies and firewood from the grocery store in San Ysidro, California.A store employee was spotted helping the 74-year-old wheel his shopping cart to his car and load his groceries into his trunk.              Prince Harry and Meghan Markle meet Findlay Blue , four, and Dasha Gallagher, six,  after they officially opened the Taronga Institute of Science and Learning at Taronga Zoo in Sydney today Meghan\u0027s mother, meanwhile, released a statement expressing her joy about the news she is set to become a grandmother for the first time.Doria Ragland said she was \u0027very happy about this lovely news\u0027 and \u0027looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild\u0027. Last month, Ragland was spotted taking baby-care classes in her hometown of Pasadena, California. There is a possibility she could move to London to help look after the child because Meghan may not want to hire a nanny. Kensington Palace declined to comment on whether Meghan\u0027s father was told.\u0027Thomas sees this as a chance to fix the problems between him, Meghan and Harry. He is desperate to be there for his grandchild and wants to play an active role in their life\u0027, Thomas\u0027s other daughter and Meghan\u0027s half-sister Samantha said to The Sun. \u0027It just makes everything that happened over the last year disappear. I want Meghan to be happy and calm and have peace. Everybody needs to be positive.\u0027I would hope that — for the sake of the baby, the family, the world and my dad — that leaving him out of the statement was not intentional.\u0027I hope my dad is included and at a proper time. If he is excluded, I won\u0027t be happy. It is in the best interests of the baby for my dad to be included.  \u0027A baby changes everything and softens everyone. I would only hope that there would be some adjustment or some way of including him.\u0027 \u0027At a proper time, there should be a sit-down wherein everyone can address this properly. Everything has to work itself out. I want to allow Meg and Harry to bring my dad into it in their own appropriate time because they very well should do. Although I can still say I love my sister, I wasn\u0027t happy with the way my father was being treated.\u0027But, you know, we\u0027re also seeing now that there was a lot going on — there may have been a lot of stress.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex revealed the news of their pregnancy just days after telling the Queen at Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding. Meghan, who wed Harry just five months ago, has had her 12 week scan and is believed to be due in late April. Kensington Palace made the announcement after the couple arrived in Sydney on Monday on the eve of their 16-day major tour which will take in Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga.  Kill him with politeness: Harry effortlessly bats away Australian serial prankster during walkabout... and for once the joker is lost for words The last time Prince Harry was in Australia, radio prankster \u0027Intern\u0027 Pete Deppeler made a fool of himself by repeatedly yelling  \u0027The floor is lava!\u0027 at the young royal.And it appears the KIIS FM producer didn\u0027t fare much better on Tuesday when the Duke of Sussex returned to Sydney with his pregnant wife Meghan Markle.Pete was stationed at the Opera House to cover the couple\u0027s official tour for the Kyle \u0026amp Jackie O Show, but Harry refused to humour his attention-seeking antics. Meghan chats to TV personality Eddie Woo during royal visitMoment vehicles avoid crash with car driving the wrong way on the M40Meghan wears Australian designer whilst with Harry at Admiralty HouseFirst look at Meghan\u0027s \u0027bump\u0027 following pregnancy announcementFrank Field and Esther McVey clash over Universal CreditWoman fights a large man over parking disputeHarry and Meghan closer than ever following pregnancy announcementCar and caravan crash into vehicles after going the wrong wayPrince Harry laughs as girl gives bouquet of flowers to MeghanThomas Markle shops alone while Meghan announces her pregnancyHarry gives koala a good scratch whilst Meghan looks interested at zooMeghan and Harry: Duchess of Sussex expecting a babyA royal disaster!

Come spring, all being well, he and Meghan will have a baby.The Duchess no doubt will look wonderful cradling the child on the steps of the Lindo Wing, like her mother-in-law Diana and her sister-in-law Kate before her. But let’s come clean, it’s actually Harry we’re delighted for, isn’t it?For as these glorious pictures show, here is a boy who was born to be a dad.Our Harry, the likely lad, the mischievous redhead who didn’t think much of school but relished Army life — ‘running down a ditch full of mud, firing bullets — it’s the way I am, I love it!’.            Father material: Prince Harry cuddles baby Jean Luc in a visit to the Queen Elizabeth II Children\u0027s Hospital in Bridgetown, BarbadosThis is the larky young man who, when caught out starkers playing strip-billiards in Vegas, handsomely apologised and explained that it was just ‘a case of too much Army, and not enough prince’.But this is also a man who soberly pledged himself to his charities and duties, and founded the Invictus Games to bring respect and fun to injured servicemen.He’s our Harry. Few characters are more beguiling than a wild boy who gets into scrapes but does no real harm, then settles down to duty far more merry, open-hearted and tolerant of others than if he’d been a cautious prig all along. Hearts have ached for Harry, too, as he opened up publicly about losing his mother: about walking behind her coffin, trying for years to blank out the sorrow, at last coming to terms.            Born to be a father: Prince Harry visits 8-year old Junior Maynard in the paediatric ward at the Queen Elizabeth II hospital in 2010Meghan chats to TV personality Eddie Woo during royal visitMoment vehicles avoid crash with car driving the wrong way on the M40Meghan wears Australian designer whilst with Harry at Admiralty HouseFirst look at Meghan\u0027s \u0027bump\u0027 following pregnancy announcementFrank Field and Esther McVey clash over Universal CreditWoman fights a large man over parking disputeHarry and Meghan closer than ever following pregnancy announcementCar and caravan crash into vehicles after going the wrong wayPrince Harry laughs as girl gives bouquet of flowers to MeghanThomas Markle shops alone while Meghan announces her pregnancyHarry gives koala a good scratch whilst Meghan looks interested at zooMeghan and Harry: Duchess of Sussex expecting a babyIn 2016, when he was first with Meghan, he said he hoped Diana was looking down and approving of how he and his brother turned out. He added, ‘I’m sure she’s waiting for me to have kids so she can be a grandmother again.’Earlier, a bit wistfully after a few failed courtships, he had admitted: ‘I’ve longed for kids since I was very, very young. I’m waiting to find the right person, someone who’s willing to take on the job.’He has shown us and told us enough about himself to make us rejoice in the idea of him having a family of his own.            Happy family: Harry lifts a three-year-old orphan called Lerato during a visit to Phelisanong Children\u0027s Home in Maseru, LesothoNot least because he should be good at it: one of the vital, underestimated qualities of good parenting is that you enjoy it. A reluctant, distant or runaway dad is a sad thing to contemplate. Every woman approaching the joys and unending anxieties of motherhood is delighted to find a partner who is properly, keenly, up for it.We want a man who is not nervous of babies, enjoys the wayward comedy of toddlers, and puts shy older children at their ease. So just look at how Harry keeps proving all of those things day after day, trip after trip.            Helping hand: The 19-year-old prince plants a tree with young orphan Mutsu Potsane, 4, at the Mants\u0027ase Children\u0027s Home   in Lesotho, southern AfricaSee him cradling seven-week-old Jean-Luc in Barbados, high-fiving a young girl in Africa’s Lesotho, swinging a laughing three-year-old round like everyone’s rumbustious favourite uncle. See him lifting kids, upending them with squeals of glee, larking, pulling faces with an eight-year-old boy in hospital in Barbados, scooping up a young winner of a child bravery award (who had just asked him, ‘Where’s your crown?’) or holding hands and planting a tree with a four-year-old orphan in Lesotho.Watch him make pretend-fierce faces at that little girl who kept stealing his popcorn in the stands at the Invictus Games. Brilliant.These are not just photo-ops, children carefully selected for charm and whisked away if they misbehave. His charities report it is hard to move Harry on, that he notices any shy or confused child in the background and includes them, that a malnourished or injured infant moves him to lean in with instinctive comfort.            Funny faces: Harry, patron of the Invictus Games Foundation, attends Sitting Volleyball competition at the games in Toronto, Ontario, CanadaBabies and small children move us all to protectiveness, and toddler mischief makes almost everyone laugh. But there are a few good omens too for Harry’s future children as they get older.Who can forget his admission about growing up in a royal world of formality. ‘To be honest,’ Harry said, ‘dinner conversations were the worst bit about being a child and listening to the boring people around me.’This, one feels, will be the kind of father who, after decent politeness, lets his children unobtrusively sneak away from the table.            High five! Prince Harry plays a young child who is going through a programme for malnourishment during a visit to Mokhotlong, LesothoAs for the teenagers, he should have enough fresh memories of his clubbing days both to give them advice, and to see right through any stratagems.It is fashionable to pretend that mothers and fathers are not only equal parents but identical.Certainly men can do traditionally female tasks with nappies and bottles (Harry seemed very adept bottle-feeding that baby rhino recently, even dropping a kiss on its horny face).But there is often something refreshing and breezy about the male approach to childcare.             Prince Harry scoops up six-year-old Alex Burke from Manchester, winner of the Bravest Child Award, who had just asked \u0027where\u0027s your crown?\u0027As the poet and broadcaster Mike Rosen once said, you do all the mum things but you do them in a blokey way. A woman with a young baby is tired, physically battered, exalted and proud, but also probably spends too much time half-crippled with anxiety.Most of us fret about getting everything right and not only being a perfect mother but looking like one: not only must we make the baby contented but avoid criticism from in-laws, neighbours or Mumsnet bullies.Fathers, on the other hand, are more likely to be just plain soppy with pride at having created this perfect creature. There’s no doubt Harry will be proud as Punch. And unlike many new dads, he won’t need much help or advice either.He’ll be right in there, storming through, from nappies to Nintendo and beyond. Lucky baby.  Baby on board! Beaming Meghan and Harry set sail for their first official engagements in Australia including the Opera House and Sydney zoo - hours after revealing their baby joyThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex couldn\u0027t hide their delight as they stepped onto a boat to take a tour around Sydney Harbour this morning - hours after revealing their joyous baby news.The beaming couple looked the epitome of cool as they stepped onto the boat, with Prince Harry lovingly holding onto his pregnant wife\u0027s hand as he helped her onto the vessel. They enjoyed a packed day of engagements, which included being introduced to their koala namesakes and a \u0027stud\u0027 of a short-legged echidna, as they admired the \u0027so cute\u0027 wildlife of Taronga Zoo. After the short tour, the Duke and Duchess went to unveil a plaque commentating the opening of a research centre. Departing, the couple were treated to a ride in a gondola, giving spectacular views over Sydney Harbour and allowing a glimpse of other animal enclosures, including a curious baby elephant.After the Duchess changed into flat shoes, they walked the short journey down a ramp and out of the zoo, catching a ferry - made private for the occasion - to the Sydney Opera House surrounded by armed security.The royal couple were greeted by a sea of well-wishers at the Opera House, where they mingled with the crowd.

The selection process takes into account the benefit a person will get from competing.Team UK has been delivered through a partnership of Help for Heroes, The Royal British Legion and the Ministry of Defence.            The Invictus squad for 2018 is made up of veterans and injured military personnel, with the competitors selected from 451 applicants Defence Secretary, Gavin Williamson wished the team well.He said: \u0027I wish all of our UK competitors the best of luck in Australia. The word \u0027Invictus\u0027 means unconquered and perfectly embodies the fighting spirit of our Armed Forces and ex-service personnel. Meeting many Invictus competitors this year I learnt how sport is spurring on recovery.\u0027Our Armed Forces have a world-class attitude and I am sure they will make their mark.\u0027                                                    The royal couple arrived on Monday on a Qantas A380 flight from London via Singapore, and touched down at Sydney Airport to be greeted by hundreds of supporters. Meghan, wearing skinny black pants and a black, burgundy trimmed coat, was smiling and clutching folders, while Harry gave a thumbs up to bystanders.The couple is due to spend a week in Australia, the Duchess of Sussex\u0027s first ever trip Down Under, before jetting to Fiji on October 23 where they will spend two days.On Sunday, October 28 they will cross the Tasman Sea to New Zealand, visiting Wellington, the Abel Tasman National Park, Auckland and Rotorua before heading home on Wednesday, October 31.The announcement of the pregnancy confirmed weeks of speculation from royal watchers about why Meghan was not joining Harry on his Sydney Harbour Bridge climb set for Friday.Sydney\u0027s weather is expected to be drizzly and cool on today, with showers forecast for most of the week.This won\u0027t be the first time Harry has had to brave the rain in Sydney. Last year, he made a whirlwind visit to cast his eye over the Invictus Games preparations, where he charmed his fans during torrential rain.The tour coincides with the games, which start in Sydney on Saturday. The sporting event, founded by Harry in 2014, gives sick and injured military personnel and veterans the opportunity to compete in sports such as wheelchair basketball.Harry and Meghan will attend the games\u0027 opening and closing ceremonies. In all, they have 76 engagements scheduled over 16 days in Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand.The royal couple\u0027s visit comes six months after Harry\u0027s father, Prince Charles, made his 16th official visit to Australia, primarily to open the 21st Commonwealth Games at Gold Coast city in Queensland.  \u0027He couldn\u0027t be happier\u0027: Prince Harry is an \u0027emotional wreck but in a good way\u0027 say insiders after he and Meghan announce they\u0027re expecting the baby \u0027he\u0027s wanted for a long time\u0027 By Rebecca EnglishPrince Harry is \u0027happier than he has ever been\u0027 as he and Meghan prepare to become parents next spring.He has been an \u0027emotional wreck - but in a good way!\u0027 since discovering the Duchess of Sussex is pregnant, one source said last night.\u0027It is something he has wanted for a long time and he couldn\u0027t be happier. He is so protective of her,\u0027 the source added.The news was announced by Kensington Palace yesterday after the smiling couple arrived in Sydney for the start of a gruelling 16-day tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga.            Meghan walking out of Sydney Airport on Monday ahead of the news of her pregnancy announced a day later They insisted on going ahead with the trip in spite of Foreign Office advice to pregnant women about the risk of the Zika virus. There is no vaccination to prevent infection by the virus, which causes foetuses to develop severe deformities, but the couple will still travel to Fiji and Tonga next week,Last night it emerged:Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland was among the first to know - likely told in person when she visited London last month.Miss Ragland was \u0027very happy about this lovely news\u0027 and \u0027looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild\u0027.Meghan\u0027s estranged father Thomas Markle is \u0027absolutely delighted\u0027 and told her by letter: \u0027You will make a great mother\u0027. Kensington Palace refused to comment on whether Meghan had told her father directly.The baby will be seventh in line to the throne and likely be titled Earl of Dumbarton or Lady (first name) Mountbatten-Windsor unless the Queen bestows prince or princess on them.Moments after the baby announcement, Sarah Ferguson began tweeting a series of pictures from her daughter Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding day last Friday – leading some to question if she felt upstaged.Meghan, 37, has \u0027just\u0027 had her 12-week scan, the Mail understands. It means she is already in her second trimester, when the risk of miscarriage is deemed to lessen considerably.The couple excitedly told the rest of the Royal Family last Friday when they saw them at Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding.The joyous news sets the seal on a whirlwind year for Harry, 34, who in recent years has made no secret of his desire to settle down and start a family.It is only 12 months since the couple stepped out together in public for the first time, when they appeared together at the Invictus Games in Toronto. At the time, Meghan was still living full-time in Canada, although preparing to move to London, and the couple were not even engaged.After Harry popped the question at the end of last year, they married in May and just two months later, towards the end of July, conceived their first child.In mid-July, Harry and Meghan were on a \u0027mini-moon\u0027 royal tour to Dublin, their first trip together as a married couple. And on August 4, they were partying at the wedding of Harry\u0027s best friend Charlie Van Straubenzee.Yesterday a Kensington Palace spokesman said the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were all \u0027delighted for the couple\u0027.\u0027They were able to share their happy news with the Royal Family in person at Friday\u0027s wedding,\u0027 said an aide, which may have accounted for their low-key appearance at the nuptials.A friend added: \u0027They didn\u0027t make a grand announcement but had conversations with their family and friends and told them their news.\u0027Meghan is said to be in \u0027good health\u0027 and has not had to cancel any public appearances because of her pregnancy, unlike the Duchess of Cambridge who sadly suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum, a several form of pregnancy-related sickness.Her pregnancy is likely to be monitored closely, however, as by the age of 35 any woman expecting a baby is technically classed by doctors as a \u0027geriatric mother\u0027.The couple\u0027s tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga will be highly demanding. It includes opening the prince\u0027s inspirational Invictus Games for injured service personnel in Sydney later this week.Harry and Meghan have insisted their trip to the two most remote South Pacific islands will go ahead despite the risk of Zika there, which can cause abnormalities in foetuses. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office advises pregnant women to avoid \u0027all but essential travel\u0027 there.               Kensington Palace announced via Twitter on Monday that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting a baby in the springA source told the Mail last night: \u0027It\u0027s early days but everything seem to be progressing well and there won\u0027t be changes to the Duchess\u0027s diary. She has a busy tour ahead of her.\u0027 It is believed one of the first to know about the pregnancy was Meghan\u0027s mother, whom friends suspect she told in person when she came to visit her in London last month.In a statement issued through Kensington Palace - no less - Miss Ragland said she was \u0027very happy about this lovely news\u0027 and \u0027looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild\u0027.Speculation has raged in recent months that the yoga teacher and geriatric therapist would move to London permanently to support her daughter - and now her grandchild too. It emerged she gave up her full-time role as a social worker in May, then last month she was spotted taking baby-care classes in Pasadena, California, with reports in some international media claiming it was because Meghan does not want to hire a nanny.But senior royal aides played down any suggestion Miss Ragland would move to London, with one telling the Mail: \u0027This is just not true.\u0027 Another added: \u0027Meghan is very close to her mother and they see each other as much as they possibly can. Once the baby is born, of course Doria will be keen to visit her grandchild frequently. But she has her own life and home in LA, with her dogs, and it will continue that way.\u0027Meghan\u0027s father, Thomas Markle, from whom she is estranged after a series of hugely public embarrassments, is believed to have been informed by Miss Ragland \u0027a little while ago\u0027, said a friend, and is \u0027absolutely overjoyed\u0027 at the news.Last year, asked if they had plans to try for a baby, Harry replied: \u0027Not currently, no,\u0027 garnering a laugh from his then wife to be. \u0027Of course, one step at a time and hopefully we\u0027ll start a family in the near future,\u0027 he added.Around the time she met the prince, in the spring of 2016, Meghan gave an interview to Best Health Canada when she said becoming a mother was \u0027on her bucket list\u0027, adding: \u0027I can\u0027t wait to start a family, but in due time.\u0027In its statement yesterday, Kensington Palace said: \u0027Their Royal Highness the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are very pleased to announce that the Duchess of Sussex is expecting a baby in the spring of 2019.\u0027Their Royal Highnesses have appreciated all of the support they have received from people around the world since their wedding in May and are delighted to be able to share this happy news with the public.\u0027The couple\u0027s new baby will be seventh in line to the throne but will not be a prince or princess because of rules brought in by George V. Instead, a son would be styled the Earl of Dumbarton, one of Harry\u0027s lesser titles, and a daughter Lady (first name) Mountbatten-Windsor.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/15/16/4AD94EBA00000578-0-image-a-6_1539619187330.jpg","title":"Man Booker Prize 2018 long list need know","story":"Robin Robertson (UK) - The Long Take (Picador)Scottish poet Robin Robertson’s \u0027The Long Take\u0027 is a novel in verse that follows a Canadian who has been recently demobilised after the war.‘A book about a man and a city in shock, it’s an extraordinary evocation of the debris and the ongoing destruction of war even in times of peace.

The Royal couple arrived on a Qantas A380 flight from London via Singapore, for their first major international tour since their world-stopping nuptials.They shunned a private jet to travel on flight Qantas flight QF2 from London via Singapore.The couple were in the first class cabin but non-royal passengers were also with them with one saying they were heard saying how \u0027excited\u0027 they were to be travelling to Australia. With them was their entourage of 10 staff members, including press secretaries and a hairdresser, and several more security staff. Royal fans already suspected the Duchess was pregnant after she wore a suspiciously wide-fitting Givenchy coat to Princess Eugenie\u0027s royal wedding on Friday.Many TV viewers were sure they could see a baby-bump beneath her long, navy blue coat as the Duchess was whisked into St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor by her doting husband. The couple held hands when they arrived in Sydney early on Monday morning on a Qantas A380 flight from London via Singapore.Meghan was wearing her favourite Sarah Flint heels, which she teamed with the two tone coat she wore in a photo of her and Harry posing with the official 2018 Invictus Games flag last week.Earlier she sparked a storm of pregnancy speculation after she touched down in Sydney clutching two purple folders in front of her stomach.Meghan Markle was seen holding the items in her right arm as she stepped off the plane on Monday morning with Prince Harry, leaving fans of the Royal couple guessing what information they could contain. For many, the folders added to speculation Meghan Markle is expecting a baby, fuelling the fire already stoked by the large blue coat she wore at Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding last week. The couple returned to their own wedding venue at Windsor Castle on Friday but missed a lavish second day of celebrations on Saturday because of their flight to Australia.            Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are pictured arriving at Admiralty House in Sydney\u0027s Kirribilli as keen Royal watchers look on          The motorcade carrying Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, and his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, makes its way through peak hour traffic on Sydney\u0027s Eastern Distributor on Monday morningMeghan chats to TV personality Eddie Woo during royal visitMoment vehicles avoid crash with car driving the wrong way on the M40Meghan wears Australian designer whilst with Harry at Admiralty HouseFirst look at Meghan\u0027s \u0027bump\u0027 following pregnancy announcementFrank Field and Esther McVey clash over Universal CreditWoman fights a large man over parking disputeHarry and Meghan closer than ever following pregnancy announcementCar and caravan crash into vehicles after going the wrong wayPrince Harry laughs as girl gives bouquet of flowers to MeghanThomas Markle shops alone while Meghan announces her pregnancyHarry gives koala a good scratch whilst Meghan looks interested at zooMeghan and Harry: Duchess of Sussex expecting a baby    Prince Harry appeared to take some time out on Monday during his trip to Admiralty House, spotted perched on a step alongside a man believed to be a security guard (pictured)          Flying from London to Sydney is a tiring journey, but The Duchess of Sussex was in the best possible cabin for the 23-hour trip – first class in a Qantas A380 (file picture).It\u0027s a state-of-the-art aircraft with in-built anti-jet-lag technology.It produces 50 per cent less cabin noise than a 747 and has cabin air pressure that\u0027s equivalent to an altitude of 1,500 metres (5,000ft). The 747\u0027s is 2,500 metres (8,000ft).Plus, cabin air is recycled every two minutes to keep the atmosphere fresh.Then there\u0027s the Qantas touch.Meghan would have been in an \u0027expansive armchair\u0027 that converts to a fully flat bed.Cabin crew would have given her a pillow menu, a 100 per cent cotton woven throw, a duvet and a memory foam mattress. And cotton pyjamas with matching slippers.She would also have been able to enjoy an in-seat massage at the touch of a button and pressed another one to lower and raise the window blinds.It\u0027s definitely an aircraft fit for pregnant royalty.                                                      They will spend a week in the country and then on Tuesday, October 23 they will head to Fiji for two days and then on to Tonga before returning to Australia.On Sunday, October 28 they will cross the Tasman Sea to New Zealand, visiting Wellington, the Abel Tasman National Park, Auckland and Rotorua before heading home on Wednesday, October 31. \u0027The programme across these four Commonwealth countries will focus on youth leadership, environmental and conservation efforts, including the dedication of several new Queen\u0027s Commonwealth Canopy projects, and the recovery and rehabilitation of servicemen and women through the Invictus Games Sydney 2018,\u0027 the palace said in a short statement when announcing the tour itinerary.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex will attend 76 engagements across the four countries, including the Invictus Games in Sydney, which runs from October 20 and October 28.Prince Harry founded the sporting event, which gives sick and injured service personnel and veterans the opportunity to compete in sports such as wheelchair basketball and sitting volleyball, in 2014.The couple will mark the games\u0027 launch and closing ceremony. And to officially welcome the Invictus Games to the city, Prince Harry, prime minister Scott Morrison and athletes will scale the Sydney Harbour Bridge to plant the Invictus flag. Among the other highlights of their tour will be a visit to the world-renowned Taronga Zoo, in Sydney, where they will meet two koalas and their joeys. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited the zoo with Prince George during their royal tour in 2014.Elsewhere the couple will visit Australian farmers struck by drought. The couple\u0027s arrival in Australia comes just days after they attended the wedding of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank where they told close family their happy news.   Revealed: How Meghan and Harry\u0027s baby will be SEVENTH in line to the throne - but WON\u0027T be a prince or princessThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0027s child will be seventh-in-line to the British throne. The child will come behind his or her father Prince Harry in the line of succession, bumping his uncle, the Duke of York, further down the line into eighth place.  However the child will not be given the title of prince or princess unless the Queen steps into change the rules. Instead a son would be styled the Earl of Dumbarton, while a daughter would be Lady (first name) Mountbatten-Windsor.             The Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u0027s child will be seventh-in-line to the British throne. The couple, pictured two weeks ago, announced today that they are expecting their first child            It means Harry\u0027s uncle the Duke of York will be bumped further down the line into eighth place.

The baby will bump Harry\u0027s uncle the Duke of York into eighth place in the line of succession.Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie move into ninth and 10th place, and the Earl of Wessex - the Queen\u0027s youngest son - drops out of the top 10 for the first time to 11th in line.How will the baby be related to the Queen?The baby will be a great-grandchild of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, and the Prince of Wales\u0027s grandchild and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s niece or nephew.Will he or she ever be monarch?Unlikely. The baby will have three cousins Prince George - a future king - and Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, who are further up the line of succession, so it is a safe bet that throne will stay on the Cambridge side of the family.What will the baby be called?William and Kate chose royal favourites for their children.But will Harry and American-born Meghan go classic or break the royal mould when naming their baby?If they stay traditional, something like Alice, Mary, Elizabeth or Victoria for a girl, and James, Philip, Frederick or Arthur for a boy are possibilities.In the US, the most popular name for a baby girl is Emma and Liam for a baby boy.Will the baby be a prince or princess?No they will not be a prince nor a princess, nor an HRH because George V limited titles within the Royal Family in 1917.So what will their title be?A son would be known as Earl of Dumbarton - because a first son of a duke is allowed to use one of his father\u0027s other lesser titles as a courtesy title.Harry was also made the Earl of Dumbarton on the morning of his wedding, as well as being given a dukedom.A daughter would be Lady (first name) Mountbatten-Windsor.But the Queen could change this?Yes. The Queen stepped in ahead of George\u0027s birth to issue a Letters Patent to ensure the Cambridges\u0027 children had fitting titles, but this royal baby is much further down the line of succession.Will Harry and Meghan hire a nanny?Harry has been close to all his nannies and it is likely he and Meghan will arrange for a nanny to care for their baby while they are on official engagements Kate and William have the help of their full-time live-in nanny Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo. But Meghan\u0027s mother Doria has been seen attending baby care classes, suggesting that she may move to the UK to help out. When and where will the baby be born?Kate had three successful deliveries at the private Lindo Wing in St Mary\u0027s Hospital, Paddington, so Meghan might follow her sister-in-law\u0027s lead. Harry was also born there in 1984. It is close to Kensington Palace and well practised at dealing with royal births, and the publicity surrounding them. But Meghan could do down a different path and have a home birth. Will the baby have dual citizenship?Harry and Meghan could apply for their child to have dual US-UK citizenship. Meghan is planning to become a British citizen - but it is not known whether she will hold dual nationality, and at present is still a US citizen.Kensington Palace announced today the Duchess of Sussex is pregnant with her first child. The baby is expected in Spring next year. The happy news was announced hours after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex touched down in Sydney for their first major international tour since their wedding in May.A Kensington Palace said: \u0027Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are very pleased to announce that The Duchess of Sussex is expecting a baby in the Spring of 2019.\u0027Their Royal Highnesses have appreciated all of the support they have received from people around the world since their wedding in May and are delighted to be able to share this happy news with the public.\u0027The Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were told in person at the wedding of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank at Windsor Castle last Friday.  Rumours were rife that Meghan may be pregnant after her mother Doria Ragland was seen taking baby-care classes in Pasadena with a view to looking after her new grandchild. The duchess has also been seen in a number of looser-fitting outfits over recent weeks.  The new royal baby is expected to take the surname Sussex in the same way that Prince William\u0027s children, George, Charlotte and Louis have taken his title Cambridge as their last name at school and nursery. The baby will supersede Prince Andrew in the line of succession, regardless of whether they are a boy or a girl, following a 2011 change in law that granted the same status to sons and daughters.However as the second son of the current Prince of Wales, Harry\u0027s children are not automatically given the title of prince or princess.King George V - Harry\u0027s great great grandfather - limited titles within the royal family in 1917.This means Harry and Meghan\u0027s first born, as a great-grandchild of the sovereign, is too far down the line of succession to be an HRH.George V declared that: \u0027the grandchildren of the sons of any such Sovereign in the direct male line (save only the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales) shall have and enjoy in all occasions the style and title enjoyed by the children of Dukes of these Our Realms.\u0027The eldest son and heir apparent of a duke can use one of his father\u0027s lesser grade peerage titles by courtesy, according to Debrett\u0027s.So a first son of Harry\u0027s would become Earl of Dumbarton - one of the subsidiary titles Harry received from the Queen on the morning of his wedding. A daughter would be Lady (first name) Mountbatten-Windsor, and any subsequent sons Lord (first name) Mounbatten-Windsor.But the Queen could make changes to allow Harry and Meghan\u0027s children to be HRHs and princes and princesses.Ahead of Prince George\u0027s birth, the monarch issued a Letters Patent to ensure the Cambridge children had fitting titles.Without this Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis would have been a Lady and a Lord instead, but Prince George, as the eldest son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales, would still have been a prince.The Queen could decide to do the same for Harry and Meghan\u0027s baby.  The Earl and Countess of Wessex\u0027s children Lady Louise Mountbatten-Windsor and Viscount Severn are actually entitled to be a princess and prince as children of the son of the sovereign.But the couple decided, with the Queen\u0027s agreement, that their children would use the courtesy titles as sons or daughters of an earl rather than the style prince or princess.The Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced their engagement in November 2017, shortly after confirming their relationship. The couple married at St George\u0027s Chapel, Windsor Castle, in May this year.   Is Fergie\u0027s tweetstorm a swipe at Meghan for upstaging Eugenie with baby news at her wedding?

Just hours before Harry and Meghan\u0027s happy news was announced this morning, fans couldn\u0027t help but notice the strategically-placed plastic folders the Duchess was clutching to her chest after touching down in Sydney in an oversized coat and polo neck            Meghan\u0027s choice of outfit for Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding - a structured A-line Givenchy coat - sent the rumour mill spinning as fans noticed she appeared to have deliberately covered up her frame (pictured with the Queen and Prince Harry outside St. George\u0027s Chapel)But it was her choice of clothing that was the most telling, with the Duchess - once a fan of figure-hugging silhouettes - wrapping up in a turtleneck jumper and oversized navy coat.Likewise, her choice of outfit for Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding last week - a structured A-line Givenchy coat - sent the rumour mill spinning as fans noticed she appeared to have deliberately covered up her frame.Coincidentally, it was also the day that Meghan and Harry chose to share their happy news with the rest of the family. Celebrity stylist Lucas Armitage told Femail: \u0027We are so used to seeing Meghan in form-fitting apparel, it was hard not to speculate that a new arrival was imminent when she recently started to sport baggier items. \u0027The use of knee-length coats has cleverly helped Meghan avoid speculation and, as it\u0027s now very much the autumnal season, the use of long oversized coats didn\u0027t arouse suspicion. Meghan chats to TV personality Eddie Woo during royal visitMoment vehicles avoid crash with car driving the wrong way on the M40Meghan wears Australian designer whilst with Harry at Admiralty HouseFirst look at Meghan\u0027s \u0027bump\u0027 following pregnancy announcementFrank Field and Esther McVey clash over Universal CreditWoman fights a large man over parking disputeHarry and Meghan closer than ever following pregnancy announcementCar and caravan crash into vehicles after going the wrong wayPrince Harry laughs as girl gives bouquet of flowers to MeghanThomas Markle shops alone while Meghan announces her pregnancyHarry gives koala a good scratch whilst Meghan looks interested at zooMeghan and Harry: Duchess of Sussex expecting a baby      Earlier this month, Meghan visited Sussex in a businesslike bottle-green ensemble but was careful to drape a structured coat over the top to carefully conceal her silhouette (pictured with Prince harry at Edes House in Chichester on 3 October)    Careful planning: Meghan wore a draped Givenchy dress at the Royal Academy of Arts in September (left) and an Oscar de la Renta peplum top in Loughborough in September (right)Meghan chats to TV personality Eddie Woo during royal visitMoment vehicles avoid crash with car driving the wrong way on the M40Meghan wears Australian designer whilst with Harry at Admiralty HouseFirst look at Meghan\u0027s \u0027bump\u0027 following pregnancy announcementFrank Field and Esther McVey clash over Universal CreditWoman fights a large man over parking disputeHarry and Meghan closer than ever following pregnancy announcementCar and caravan crash into vehicles after going the wrong wayPrince Harry laughs as girl gives bouquet of flowers to MeghanThomas Markle shops alone while Meghan announces her pregnancyHarry gives koala a good scratch whilst Meghan looks interested at zooMeghan and Harry: Duchess of Sussex expecting a baby      Covering up: Meghan wore an oversized blue coat for the launch of a charity cookbook at Kensington Palace last month (pictured with Prince Harry and mother Doria Ragland, who said today she was \u0027very happy\u0027 about the couple\u0027s pregnancy news and may move to the UK)            Baby blue? The Duchess of Sussex wore a baggy Jason Wu number when she joined Prince Harry at a gala music evening in September - sending the baby rumour mill into overdriveWhile any baby bump will not have been visible until recently, the mother-to-be has been careful to avoid fuelling speculation by keeping her tummy firmly covered.Earlier this month, she visited Sussex in a businesslike bottle-green ensemble but was careful to drape a structured coat over the top to carefully conceal her silhouette.    Likewise, a draped Givenchy dress she wore to the Royal Academy of Arts in September and a peplum Oscar de la Renta top she wore in Loughborough, worked wonders to hide her midriff.  Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland - said to be planning a permanent move to the UK - said in a statement she was \u0027very happy about this lovely news\u0027 and \u0027looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild\u0027.Which countries are Harry and Meghan visiting during whirlwind three-week tour of Australasia?

The United States is the dominant energy player so we\u0027re in pretty good shape, in my opinion, with our energy boom to cover any shortfalls.

Chief Executive Jamie Dimon and Ford Motor Co. Executive Chairman Bill Ford.          Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi (pictured)News that the CEO of Uber, Dara Khosrowshahi, would pull out of the conference drew angry responses across the region.The foreign minister of the neighboring island kingdom of Bahrain, Khalid bin Ahmed Al Khalifa, tweeted Sunday night that there should be a boycott of the ride-hailing app both there and in Saudi Arabia.Late Sunday, Saudi King Salman spoke by telephone with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan about Khashoggi. Turkey said Erdogan \u0027stressed the forming of a joint working group to probe the case.\u0027 Saudi Arabia, meanwhile, said King Salman thanked Erdogan \u0027for welcoming the kingdom\u0027s proposal\u0027 for forming the working group.The king also said Turkey and Saudi Arabia enjoy close relations and \u0027that no one will get to undermine the strength of this relationship,\u0027 according to a statement on the state-run Saudi Press Agency. While Turkey and the kingdom differ on political issues, Saudi investments are a crucial lifeline for Ankara amid trouble with its national currency, the Turkish lira.Prince Mohammed, King Salman\u0027s son, has aggressively pitched the kingdom as a destination for foreign investment. But Khashoggi\u0027s disappearance has led several business leaders and media outlets to back out of the upcoming investment conference in Riyadh called the Future Investment Initiative.Khashoggi has written extensively for the Post about Saudi Arabia, criticizing its war in Yemen, its recent diplomatic spat with Canada and its arrest of women\u0027s rights activists after the lifting of a ban on women driving.

I am immensely proud of this film and everyone involved,\u0027 he said.Singer was fired from the film two weeks before production ended for repeatedly failing to show up to set. He was replaced with director Dexter Fletcher, but will still receive directing credit when the Freddie Mercury biopic is released on November 2.            Singer has been accused by multiple men of rape and sexual abuse in the past and posted a statement via Instagram that refuted those claims           He said the article is timed perfectly with the release of his latest film, Bohemian Rhapsody (pictured is a still from the movie) Last December, an attorney for Cesar Sanchez-Guzman filed court documents accusing Singer of sexually assaulting his client in 2003.The lawsuit claims that Singer, who is raising a three-year-old son Dashiell Clunie-Singer with actress Michelle Clunie, offered to take a then-17 Guzman on a tour of a yacht, but when they got to one of the rooms, the director allegedly forced the teen to the floor, shoved his crotch against Guzman\u0027s face and demanded he perform oral sex.Share this articleGuzman claims in the suit that Singer then pulled out his penis and forced it into his mouth, causing him to choke as he begged him to stop.Singer allegedly forcibly performed oral sex on Guzman, who repeatedly told him to stop, before he anally raped him, according to the lawsuit.The suit states that Singer later threatened Guzman, telling him he was a powerful Hollywood producer and that he could hire people to ruin his alleged victim\u0027s reputation.In May, Singer was denied his initial request to dismiss the court case as he continues to deny the incident ever happened.          A sexual assault lawsuit against Singer was filed in December, just days after the director was fired from the upcoming Freddie Mercury biopic Bohemian Rhapsody. He\u0027s pictured on set above right, with Rami Malek          He says the article is a \u0027reckless disregard for the truth\u0027, adding it will attempt to \u0027rehash false accusations and bogus lawsuits\u0027Actor Michael Egan made accusations against Singer in his own 2014 lawsuit, which claimed he began being sexually abused when he was 14 or 15 after moving to Los Angeles with his family to start his acting career. Egan said he was in a pool, and nude, at a party hosted by Hollywood powerplayer Marc Collins-Rector who approached him and ordered him out to hug Singer, who allegedly grabbed his bare butt.He claimed Singer later said he was \u0027sexy\u0027 and went on to masturbate the underage boy and perform oral sex on him. The director then told Egan to do the same to him, but he says he resisted.Singer denied these allegations, claiming they were \u0027outrageous, vicious, and completely false.\u0027Egan ultimately withdrew his lawsuit after turning down a $100,000 settlement from Singer with an option to re-file at any time.Singer launched his career with The Usual Suspects and later earned raves for his work in the first two X-Men films, though he followed that up with a number of underwhelming flops, including Superman Returns and Jack the Giant Slayer. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/14/21/5152C16800000578-0-image-m-12_1539550196913.jpg","title":"Heavily pregnant Pippa Middleton spotted arriving Lindo Wing","story":"    James Matthews carries two large bags into the Lindo Wing yesterday at St Mary\u0027s Hospital in Paddington, West London          James Matthews, carrying a £78 Cam Cam Copenhagen baby changing bag and another holdall, entered the hospital on Monday          Mr Matthews arrived at the private maternity unit three days after attending Eugenie\u0027s wedding with Pippa in Windsor Kate suffered from severe morning sickness when she was expecting her children, but Pippa has boasted that she was enjoying a Zen-like pregnancy - using meditation to cope with the last few weeks before she gives birth.The socialite attended the royal wedding of Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank at Windsor Castle last Friday, sitting in the front row of the nave at St George\u0027s Chapel with her husband plus her brother James Middleton.Not so understated after all!

Equinoxes are when the day and night are equal in length, meaning that the whole planet will get 12 hours of lightness and darkness on an equinox.The term equinox comes from the Latin ‘equi’, which means equal, and ‘nox’, which means night.Spring is set according to the date of the spring equinox, which falls on March 20, 2019, with the season ending on the day of the summer solstice, June 21.The summer solstice marks the longest day of the year, where the Northern Hemisphere gets the most amount of sunlight in the year.Because equinoxes and solstices are related to the Earth’s tilted axis and orbit around the sun, they are not fixed.Therefore, the spring equinox can fall at any point around March 20 and March 21, thus explaining why the first day of spring 2019 will not be the same as the first day of Spring in 2007 (March 21).Chance the Rapper went undercover as a Lyft driver to raise money for Chicago Public SchoolsJennifer Aniston is helping Selena Gomez after she was hospitalized for mental breakdownSpecial Edition Diablo 3 Bundle for Nintendo Switch announcedMeghan Markle pregnant: Royal baby traditions the Duchess will have to followThe Conners: What time is the premiere and how does Roseanne die?Fortnite will be the most popular Halloween costume in 2018Dancing With the Stars trio week: Who will be joining the couples?Michael Buble net worth revealed as singer quits musicWhen is Spring 2019: When is the first day of spring and how is it decided?Why did Ariana Grade and Pete Davidson split up?Meghan Markle pregnant: This is why Prince Harry\u0027s baby won\u0026#8217t get a prince or princess title like George and Charlotte doMeghan Markle Prince Harry Royal Tour: What will the couple do in Australia?Man Booker Prize 2018 long list: All you need to know Meghan Markle pregnant: All you need to know about Prince Harry and Meghan\u0027s babyMeghan Markle pregnant: When is the Royal baby due? X Factor 2018 spoilers: Who are the final 16 and when are the live shows?EuroMillions results: Winning lottery numbers for Friday, October 12"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/15/12/06E3997F000003E8-0-image-m-27_1539604008201.jpg","title":"Arlene Foster calls cool heads Brexit talks ahead meeting Leo Varadkar","story":"    Arlene Foster (pictured today in Brussels) today called for \u0027cool heads\u0027 in the Brexit talks amid growing fears that Britain will crash out of the bloc without a dealCalls for Commons Speaker John Bercow to QUIT after damning...Donald Tusk says a no deal Brexit is \u0027more likely than ever\u0027...Share this article    In a statement to MPs, the Prime Minister urged \u0027cool heads\u0027 and said the \u0027broad shape\u0027 of a orce deal was becoming clear\u0027We are entering the final stages of these negotiations,\u0027 she said. \u0027This is the time for cool, calm heads to prevail.\u0027And it is the time for a clear-eyed focus on the few remaining but critical issues that are still to be agreed.\u0027 But Mrs May added that she would not tolerate the proposals for a \u0027backstop to the backstop\u0027.\u0027The EU says there is not time to work out the detail of this UK-wide solution in the next few weeks,\u0027 she said.\u0027So even with the progress we have made, the EU still requires a \u0027backstop to the backstop\u0027 – effectively an insurance policy for the insurance policy.\u0027And they want this to be the Northern Ireland-only solution that they had previously proposed.\u0027We have been clear that we cannot agree to anything that threatens the integrity of our United Kingdom.\u0027    "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/16/08/515939F000000578-6278499-Insiders_have_said_Prince_Harry_is_happier_than_he_has_ever_been-a-2_1539675792944.jpg","title":"Thomas Markle spotted shopping Meghan reveals shes pregnant","story":"    Grandfather-to-be Thomas Markle was spotted shopping alone for groceries in California on Friday as Meghan and Harry were breaking news of their pregnancy to the Royal Family          Insiders have said Prince Harry is \u0027happier than he has ever been\u0027 as he and Meghan prepare to become parents next Spring    The Duke and Duchess of Sussex walk in the grounds of Admiralty House in Sydney on the first day of their visit to AustraliaThe announcement by Kensington Palace revealed  Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland was \u0027very happy\u0027 about her daughter\u0027s pregnancy, but Thomas was not mentioned.A source told The Sun: \u0027Thomas is absolutely delighted.

At this station, Southern had 66 per cent of trains late or cancelled, while Thameslink was only marginally better, with 59 per cent.The analysis adopts a more stringent approach to punctuality than the rail industry, which only classifies a train as late if it arrives at its final destination more than five minutes behind schedule. This rises to ten minutes or more for long distance trains.But Which? - which obtained the data between January 1 and September 30 from tracking site On Time Trains - marked a train as late if it arrived at least one minute behind schedule.It said that even a delay of a few minutes can have a knock on effect on other services on the network, and can cause a passenger to miss their onward journey.

But they have changed their tune as satellite imagery and documents issued by their own government have made that position untenable.   Beijing had rolled out an \u0027intensifying government campaign of mass internment\u0027          A propaganda billboard shows Chinese President Xi Jinping with ethnic minority children and the words \u0027sincerely thank the passionate care of the Party Central Committee with Comrade Xi Jinping as the core\u0027In recent weeks the story has shifted from outright dismissal to acknowledgement that the camps exist, with the caveat that they are being used primarily for \u0027vocational education\u0027 in a bid to halt separatist sentiments and religious extremism.Zakir said the facilities were intended to improve job skills and Mandarin abilities among minorities with \u0027a limited command of the country\u0027s common language and a limited sense and knowledge of the law\u0027.Those who struggled to find work as a result, he added, were \u0027vulnerable to the instigation and coercion of terrorism and extremism.\u0027He said that the \u0027free\u0027 programmes were limited in duration, \u0027trainees\u0027 signed a contract with the centres that laid out a clear plan of study and included a stipend.Asked about the future of the programmes, Zakir said \u0027some trainees\u0027 were \u0027expected to complete their courses successfully by the end of this year.\u0027  Police are seen across Xinjiang as they ramped up their presence in cities and villages  China\u0027s treatment of its Uighur minority has sparked protests in countries like TurkeyHe reiterated: \u0027Today\u0027s Xinjiang is not only beautiful but also safe and stable. No matter where they are or at what time of the day, people are no longer afraid of going out, shopping, dining and travelling.\u0027  The comments follow weeks of efforts by Chinese officials and state media to defend China\u0027s actions in Xinjiang, where riots and attacks led to hundreds of deaths in recent years.Op-eds by Chinese diplomats have appeared in newspapers around the world, arguing that the programme is an effective means of eliminating the threat posed to the region by religious extremism.An editorial in the nationalist tabloid the Global Times warned foreign governments on Tuesday not to meddle in Xinjiang\u0027s affairs.\u0027Obviously vocational education is a periodic and temporary plan aimed at eradicating extremism,\u0027 it said, adding that criticism was \u0027just messing up the whole thing and creating a narrative against China.\u0027           Children play outside the entrance to a school ringed with barbed wire, security cameras and barricades near a sign which reads \u0027Please use the nation\u0027s common language\u0027 indicating the use of Mandarin in Peyzawat, western China\u0027s Xinjiang region          A Uighur man looks on as a truck carrying policemen travel along a street during an anti-terrorism oath-taking rally in Urumqi.

I\u0027m going to get my wife to come over to say hello,\u0027 he said to Ms Dunne, before introducing his wife to her.\u0027Oh my goodness, is this Daphne? I\u0027m so happy to finally meet you. I\u0027ve heard so much about you - all good things,\u0027 Meghan said as the two women clasped hands. Ms Dunne replied: \u0027It\u0027s wonderful, the two of you\u0027 as she  congratulated the pair on their exciting baby news: \u0027Congratulations, it\u0027s just what Harry needs.\u0027He will be a marvellous dad. He won\u0027t let anything stand in his way and he will be so gentle and loving.\u0027During their heartwarming encounter, Prince Harry noticed something different about Ms Dunne.\u0027Have you dyed your hair a shade of pink?\u0027 he asked, to which she responded \u0027yes\u0027.The royal fan gifted the couple flowers, as Meghan thanked her, adding: \u0027Hopefully next time we see you, we\u0027ll have a little one with us.\u0027 Meghan chats to TV personality Eddie Woo during royal visitMoment vehicles avoid crash with car driving the wrong way on the M40Meghan wears Australian designer whilst with Harry at Admiralty HouseFirst look at Meghan\u0027s \u0027bump\u0027 following pregnancy announcementFrank Field and Esther McVey clash over Universal CreditWoman fights a large man over parking disputeHarry and Meghan closer than ever following pregnancy announcementCar and caravan crash into vehicles after going the wrong wayPrince Harry laughs as girl gives bouquet of flowers to MeghanThomas Markle shops alone while Meghan announces her pregnancyHarry gives koala a good scratch whilst Meghan looks interested at zooMeghan and Harry: Duchess of Sussex expecting a baby      Daphne Dunne has been reunited with Prince Harry, and she got to meet wife Meghan Markle    A blast from the past: The pair reunited on Tuesday (right) after meeting in 2015 (left) and 2017            Ms Dunne (pictured) first met Prince Harry at the Opera House when he visited Sydney in 2015Speaking to AAP following her meet-and-greet with Meghan, Ms Dunne said: \u0027She said she had heard all about me, she\u0027s so beautiful.\u0027Ms Dunne first met the Prince at the Sydney Opera House in  2015 where she nabbed a kiss on the cheek after he noticed the Victoria Cross she wore.Two years later, the pair crossed paths again when they shared a kiss and hug after she waited to meet him in the pouring rain for seven hours with an esky full of beers.Appearing on the Today show on Tuesday  before the meeting, the super royal fan shared her excitement about the prospect of meeting Prince Harry for the third time.\u0027I\u0027m quite excited. I don\u0027t think he has changed very much but I probably have. Seeing my age is going up, up, up,\u0027 she told reporter Sylvia Jeffreys.\u0027He\u0027s a natural. He just loves what he\u0027s doing but seems to fit in with everything he says. I\u0027m very happy for him. I\u0027m glad he\u0027s got a wife now and soon a bubba.\u0027            Prince Harry introduced his wife to Ms Dunne, who waited to meet the couple with flowers            Meghan told Ms Dunne that she hopes the next time they meet again, she would see their baby            Beautiful moment! Ms Dunne was overjoyed when she got to see her Prince again on TuesdaySpeaking fondly about the Prince, Ms Dunne told Sunrise: \u0027Harry is just wonderful, you couldn\u0027t describe him any other way.\u0027I have to meet Meghan because she and Harry are really in love, you can see it coming out of their eyes and out of their hearts too.\u0027Weighing in on the baby joy, Ms Dunne said: \u0027I\u0027m thrilled for them, especially Harry because I know how he wanted a baby, now he\u0027s got his wish.\u0027She added that Prince Harry will be a \u0027hands on\u0027 father when the baby arrives.Reminiscing their heartwarming encounter, Ms Dunne told the Today show a selfless Prince Harry seemed unfazed when he braved the rain to talk to her in May 2015.\u0027He didn\u0027t worry about, he just continued on with what he was doing, which was talking to me,\u0027 she recalled.\u0027When he started to go, he gave me a kiss on the cheek. And when he came back later, he gave me another one because I was lopsided, and I had to have another kiss to put me right.\u0027When asked where the third kiss will go, Ms Dunne laughed as she responded: \u0027I don\u0027t know, I might not even get one.\u0027       Thomas Markle, the father of the Duchess of Sussex has said he believes she will be a \u0027great mom\u0027 - but his daughter did not tell him she is pregnant            Insiders have said Prince Harry is \u0027happier than he has ever been\u0027 as he and Meghan prepare to become parents next SpringMeghan chats to TV personality Eddie Woo during royal visitMoment vehicles avoid crash with car driving the wrong way on the M40Meghan wears Australian designer whilst with Harry at Admiralty HouseFirst look at Meghan\u0027s \u0027bump\u0027 following pregnancy announcementFrank Field and Esther McVey clash over Universal CreditWoman fights a large man over parking disputeHarry and Meghan closer than ever following pregnancy announcementCar and caravan crash into vehicles after going the wrong wayPrince Harry laughs as girl gives bouquet of flowers to MeghanThomas Markle shops alone while Meghan announces her pregnancyHarry gives koala a good scratch whilst Meghan looks interested at zooMeghan and Harry: Duchess of Sussex expecting a baby      The Duke and Duchess of Sussex walk in the grounds of Admiralty House in Sydney on the first day of their visit to AustraliaThe announcement by Kensington Palace revealed that  Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland knew about the pregnancy and was said to be \u0027very happy\u0027. Thomas was not mentioned.  \u0027Thomas is absolutely delighted. He heard the news before it was made public and was overjoyed. He thinks Meghan will make a great mum as she is already so maternal,\u0027 said a source to The Sun. Meghan is believed to have not spoken to her father since before her wedding to Prince Harry in May after Thomas backed out at the last minute due to ill health. Her half-sister Samantha was pictured yesterday buying a congratulatory card for the couple. She told The Sun she hoped the baby would bring the family closer together. She said: \u0027I would hope that — for the sake of the baby, the family, the world and my dad — that leaving him out of the statement was not intentional.\u0027I hope my dad is included and at a proper time. If he is excluded, I won\u0027t be happy. It is in the best interests of the baby for my dad to be included.\u0027A baby changes everything and softens everyone. I would only hope that there would be some adjustment or some way of including him.\u0027             Doria Ragland, pictured with her daughter in May, said she was \u0027very happy about this lovely news\u0027 and \u0027looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild\u0027            Meghan is seen resting her head on Prince Harry\u0027s shoulder as the meet and greet came to an end on Tuesday afternoon            The royal couple are pictured coming down the steps of the iconic Sydney Opera House to speak with fans waiting outside      The Duke and Duchess of Sussex revealed the news of their pregnancy just days after telling the Queen at Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding (above) Thomas was spotted out and about buying groceries during which time the former Hollywood lighting director denied reports that he dabbled with using cocaine as he brought Meghan up.\u0027Never happened, no comment,\u0027 Thomas said when asked about the drug use reports. Grandfather-to-be Thomas was spotted shopping alone for groceries as Meghan and Harry were breaking news of their pregnancy to the Royal Family who he has never met.The Duchess of Sussex\u0027s father drove across the US border from his home in Rosarito, Mexico on Friday around the time his daughter and son-in-law were telling relatives at Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding they were expecting their first child.Thomas appeared to be in high spirits as he was pictured buying beers, pot pies and firewood from the grocery store in San Ysidro, California.A store employee was spotted helping the 74-year-old wheel his shopping cart to his car and load his groceries into his trunk.              Prince Harry and Meghan Markle meet Findlay Blue , four, and Dasha Gallagher, six,  after they officially opened the Taronga Institute of Science and Learning at Taronga Zoo in Sydney today Meghan\u0027s mother, meanwhile, released a statement expressing her joy about the news she is set to become a grandmother for the first time.Doria Ragland said she was \u0027very happy about this lovely news\u0027 and \u0027looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild\u0027. Last month, Ragland was spotted taking baby-care classes in her hometown of Pasadena, California. There is a possibility she could move to London to help look after the child because Meghan may not want to hire a nanny. Kensington Palace declined to comment on whether Meghan\u0027s father was told.\u0027Thomas sees this as a chance to fix the problems between him, Meghan and Harry. He is desperate to be there for his grandchild and wants to play an active role in their life\u0027, Thomas\u0027s other daughter and Meghan\u0027s half-sister Samantha said to The Sun. \u0027It just makes everything that happened over the last year disappear. I want Meghan to be happy and calm and have peace. Everybody needs to be positive.\u0027I would hope that — for the sake of the baby, the family, the world and my dad — that leaving him out of the statement was not intentional.\u0027I hope my dad is included and at a proper time. If he is excluded, I won\u0027t be happy. It is in the best interests of the baby for my dad to be included.  \u0027A baby changes everything and softens everyone. I would only hope that there would be some adjustment or some way of including him.\u0027 \u0027At a proper time, there should be a sit-down wherein everyone can address this properly. Everything has to work itself out. I want to allow Meg and Harry to bring my dad into it in their own appropriate time because they very well should do. Although I can still say I love my sister, I wasn\u0027t happy with the way my father was being treated.\u0027But, you know, we\u0027re also seeing now that there was a lot going on — there may have been a lot of stress.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex revealed the news of their pregnancy just days after telling the Queen at Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding. Meghan, who wed Harry just five months ago, has had her 12 week scan and is believed to be due in late April. Kensington Palace made the announcement after the couple arrived in Sydney on Monday on the eve of their 16-day major tour which will take in Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga.  Kill him with politeness: Harry effortlessly bats away Australian serial prankster during walkabout... and for once the joker is lost for words The last time Prince Harry was in Australia, radio prankster \u0027Intern\u0027 Pete Deppeler made a fool of himself by repeatedly yelling  \u0027The floor is lava!\u0027 at the young royal.And it appears the KIIS FM producer didn\u0027t fare much better on Tuesday when the Duke of Sussex returned to Sydney with his pregnant wife Meghan Markle.Pete was stationed at the Opera House to cover the couple\u0027s official tour for the Kyle \u0026amp Jackie O Show, but Harry refused to humour his attention-seeking antics. Meghan chats to TV personality Eddie Woo during royal visitMoment vehicles avoid crash with car driving the wrong way on the M40Meghan wears Australian designer whilst with Harry at Admiralty HouseFirst look at Meghan\u0027s \u0027bump\u0027 following pregnancy announcementFrank Field and Esther McVey clash over Universal CreditWoman fights a large man over parking disputeHarry and Meghan closer than ever following pregnancy announcementCar and caravan crash into vehicles after going the wrong wayPrince Harry laughs as girl gives bouquet of flowers to MeghanThomas Markle shops alone while Meghan announces her pregnancyHarry gives koala a good scratch whilst Meghan looks interested at zooMeghan and Harry: Duchess of Sussex expecting a babyA royal disaster!

Come spring, all being well, he and Meghan will have a baby.The Duchess no doubt will look wonderful cradling the child on the steps of the Lindo Wing, like her mother-in-law Diana and her sister-in-law Kate before her. But let’s come clean, it’s actually Harry we’re delighted for, isn’t it?For as these glorious pictures show, here is a boy who was born to be a dad.Our Harry, the likely lad, the mischievous redhead who didn’t think much of school but relished Army life — ‘running down a ditch full of mud, firing bullets — it’s the way I am, I love it!’.            Father material: Prince Harry cuddles baby Jean Luc in a visit to the Queen Elizabeth II Children\u0027s Hospital in Bridgetown, BarbadosThis is the larky young man who, when caught out starkers playing strip-billiards in Vegas, handsomely apologised and explained that it was just ‘a case of too much Army, and not enough prince’.But this is also a man who soberly pledged himself to his charities and duties, and founded the Invictus Games to bring respect and fun to injured servicemen.He’s our Harry. Few characters are more beguiling than a wild boy who gets into scrapes but does no real harm, then settles down to duty far more merry, open-hearted and tolerant of others than if he’d been a cautious prig all along. Hearts have ached for Harry, too, as he opened up publicly about losing his mother: about walking behind her coffin, trying for years to blank out the sorrow, at last coming to terms.            Born to be a father: Prince Harry visits 8-year old Junior Maynard in the paediatric ward at the Queen Elizabeth II hospital in 2010Meghan chats to TV personality Eddie Woo during royal visitMoment vehicles avoid crash with car driving the wrong way on the M40Meghan wears Australian designer whilst with Harry at Admiralty HouseFirst look at Meghan\u0027s \u0027bump\u0027 following pregnancy announcementFrank Field and Esther McVey clash over Universal CreditWoman fights a large man over parking disputeHarry and Meghan closer than ever following pregnancy announcementCar and caravan crash into vehicles after going the wrong wayPrince Harry laughs as girl gives bouquet of flowers to MeghanThomas Markle shops alone while Meghan announces her pregnancyHarry gives koala a good scratch whilst Meghan looks interested at zooMeghan and Harry: Duchess of Sussex expecting a babyIn 2016, when he was first with Meghan, he said he hoped Diana was looking down and approving of how he and his brother turned out. He added, ‘I’m sure she’s waiting for me to have kids so she can be a grandmother again.’Earlier, a bit wistfully after a few failed courtships, he had admitted: ‘I’ve longed for kids since I was very, very young. I’m waiting to find the right person, someone who’s willing to take on the job.’He has shown us and told us enough about himself to make us rejoice in the idea of him having a family of his own.            Happy family: Harry lifts a three-year-old orphan called Lerato during a visit to Phelisanong Children\u0027s Home in Maseru, LesothoNot least because he should be good at it: one of the vital, underestimated qualities of good parenting is that you enjoy it. A reluctant, distant or runaway dad is a sad thing to contemplate. Every woman approaching the joys and unending anxieties of motherhood is delighted to find a partner who is properly, keenly, up for it.We want a man who is not nervous of babies, enjoys the wayward comedy of toddlers, and puts shy older children at their ease. So just look at how Harry keeps proving all of those things day after day, trip after trip.            Helping hand: The 19-year-old prince plants a tree with young orphan Mutsu Potsane, 4, at the Mants\u0027ase Children\u0027s Home   in Lesotho, southern AfricaSee him cradling seven-week-old Jean-Luc in Barbados, high-fiving a young girl in Africa’s Lesotho, swinging a laughing three-year-old round like everyone’s rumbustious favourite uncle. See him lifting kids, upending them with squeals of glee, larking, pulling faces with an eight-year-old boy in hospital in Barbados, scooping up a young winner of a child bravery award (who had just asked him, ‘Where’s your crown?’) or holding hands and planting a tree with a four-year-old orphan in Lesotho.Watch him make pretend-fierce faces at that little girl who kept stealing his popcorn in the stands at the Invictus Games. Brilliant.These are not just photo-ops, children carefully selected for charm and whisked away if they misbehave. His charities report it is hard to move Harry on, that he notices any shy or confused child in the background and includes them, that a malnourished or injured infant moves him to lean in with instinctive comfort.            Funny faces: Harry, patron of the Invictus Games Foundation, attends Sitting Volleyball competition at the games in Toronto, Ontario, CanadaBabies and small children move us all to protectiveness, and toddler mischief makes almost everyone laugh. But there are a few good omens too for Harry’s future children as they get older.Who can forget his admission about growing up in a royal world of formality. ‘To be honest,’ Harry said, ‘dinner conversations were the worst bit about being a child and listening to the boring people around me.’This, one feels, will be the kind of father who, after decent politeness, lets his children unobtrusively sneak away from the table.            High five! Prince Harry plays a young child who is going through a programme for malnourishment during a visit to Mokhotlong, LesothoAs for the teenagers, he should have enough fresh memories of his clubbing days both to give them advice, and to see right through any stratagems.It is fashionable to pretend that mothers and fathers are not only equal parents but identical.Certainly men can do traditionally female tasks with nappies and bottles (Harry seemed very adept bottle-feeding that baby rhino recently, even dropping a kiss on its horny face).But there is often something refreshing and breezy about the male approach to childcare.             Prince Harry scoops up six-year-old Alex Burke from Manchester, winner of the Bravest Child Award, who had just asked \u0027where\u0027s your crown?\u0027As the poet and broadcaster Mike Rosen once said, you do all the mum things but you do them in a blokey way. A woman with a young baby is tired, physically battered, exalted and proud, but also probably spends too much time half-crippled with anxiety.Most of us fret about getting everything right and not only being a perfect mother but looking like one: not only must we make the baby contented but avoid criticism from in-laws, neighbours or Mumsnet bullies.Fathers, on the other hand, are more likely to be just plain soppy with pride at having created this perfect creature. There’s no doubt Harry will be proud as Punch. And unlike many new dads, he won’t need much help or advice either.He’ll be right in there, storming through, from nappies to Nintendo and beyond. Lucky baby.  Baby on board! Beaming Meghan and Harry set sail for their first official engagements in Australia including the Opera House and Sydney zoo - hours after revealing their baby joyThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex couldn\u0027t hide their delight as they stepped onto a boat to take a tour around Sydney Harbour this morning - hours after revealing their joyous baby news.The beaming couple looked the epitome of cool as they stepped onto the boat, with Prince Harry lovingly holding onto his pregnant wife\u0027s hand as he helped her onto the vessel. They enjoyed a packed day of engagements, which included being introduced to their koala namesakes and a \u0027stud\u0027 of a short-legged echidna, as they admired the \u0027so cute\u0027 wildlife of Taronga Zoo. After the short tour, the Duke and Duchess went to unveil a plaque commentating the opening of a research centre. Departing, the couple were treated to a ride in a gondola, giving spectacular views over Sydney Harbour and allowing a glimpse of other animal enclosures, including a curious baby elephant.After the Duchess changed into flat shoes, they walked the short journey down a ramp and out of the zoo, catching a ferry - made private for the occasion - to the Sydney Opera House surrounded by armed security.The royal couple were greeted by a sea of well-wishers at the Opera House, where they mingled with the crowd. Meghan shared a touching moment with one young girl, and said: \u0027Thank you all for the big welcome.\u0027Scroll down for video.     The Duke and Duchess of Sussex wave to thousands of royal fans who turned out in Sydney for day two of their Australian tour            The royal couple looked the epitome of cool as they stepped onto the boat, with Prince Harry lovingly holding his wife\u0027s hand and helping her onboard             Crew members on board the vessel await the arrival of the parents-to-be, before taking them on a trip across Sydney Harbour             The Duke and Duchess looked effortlessly chic as they strode towards the boat in Sydney Harbour   Be a vision in white with Meghan\u0026#39s dress by Karen GeeBuy it here!Hours after announcing her pregnancy, the Duchess of Sussex kicked off day one of the royal tour in Sydney with a sartorial bang.

The word \u0027Invictus\u0027 means unconquered and perfectly embodies the fighting spirit of our Armed Forces and ex-service personnel. Meeting many Invictus competitors this year I learnt how sport is spurring on recovery.\u0027Our Armed Forces have a world-class attitude and I am sure they will make their mark.\u0027                                                    The royal couple arrived on Monday on a Qantas A380 flight from London via Singapore, and touched down at Sydney Airport to be greeted by hundreds of supporters. Meghan, wearing skinny black pants and a black, burgundy trimmed coat, was smiling and clutching folders, while Harry gave a thumbs up to bystanders.The couple is due to spend a week in Australia, the Duchess of Sussex\u0027s first ever trip Down Under, before jetting to Fiji on October 23 where they will spend two days.On Sunday, October 28 they will cross the Tasman Sea to New Zealand, visiting Wellington, the Abel Tasman National Park, Auckland and Rotorua before heading home on Wednesday, October 31.The announcement of the pregnancy confirmed weeks of speculation from royal watchers about why Meghan was not joining Harry on his Sydney Harbour Bridge climb set for Friday.Sydney\u0027s weather is expected to be drizzly and cool on today, with showers forecast for most of the week.This won\u0027t be the first time Harry has had to brave the rain in Sydney. Last year, he made a whirlwind visit to cast his eye over the Invictus Games preparations, where he charmed his fans during torrential rain.The tour coincides with the games, which start in Sydney on Saturday. The sporting event, founded by Harry in 2014, gives sick and injured military personnel and veterans the opportunity to compete in sports such as wheelchair basketball.Harry and Meghan will attend the games\u0027 opening and closing ceremonies. In all, they have 76 engagements scheduled over 16 days in Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand.The royal couple\u0027s visit comes six months after Harry\u0027s father, Prince Charles, made his 16th official visit to Australia, primarily to open the 21st Commonwealth Games at Gold Coast city in Queensland.  \u0027He couldn\u0027t be happier\u0027: Prince Harry is an \u0027emotional wreck but in a good way\u0027 say insiders after he and Meghan announce they\u0027re expecting the baby \u0027he\u0027s wanted for a long time\u0027 By Rebecca EnglishPrince Harry is \u0027happier than he has ever been\u0027 as he and Meghan prepare to become parents next spring.He has been an \u0027emotional wreck - but in a good way!\u0027 since discovering the Duchess of Sussex is pregnant, one source said last night.\u0027It is something he has wanted for a long time and he couldn\u0027t be happier. He is so protective of her,\u0027 the source added.The news was announced by Kensington Palace yesterday after the smiling couple arrived in Sydney for the start of a gruelling 16-day tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga.            Meghan walking out of Sydney Airport on Monday ahead of the news of her pregnancy announced a day later They insisted on going ahead with the trip in spite of Foreign Office advice to pregnant women about the risk of the Zika virus. There is no vaccination to prevent infection by the virus, which causes foetuses to develop severe deformities, but the couple will still travel to Fiji and Tonga next week,Last night it emerged:Meghan\u0027s mother Doria Ragland was among the first to know - likely told in person when she visited London last month.Miss Ragland was \u0027very happy about this lovely news\u0027 and \u0027looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild\u0027.Meghan\u0027s estranged father Thomas Markle is \u0027absolutely delighted\u0027 and told her by letter: \u0027You will make a great mother\u0027. Kensington Palace refused to comment on whether Meghan had told her father directly.The baby will be seventh in line to the throne and likely be titled Earl of Dumbarton or Lady (first name) Mountbatten-Windsor unless the Queen bestows prince or princess on them.Moments after the baby announcement, Sarah Ferguson began tweeting a series of pictures from her daughter Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding day last Friday – leading some to question if she felt upstaged.Meghan, 37, has \u0027just\u0027 had her 12-week scan, the Mail understands. It means she is already in her second trimester, when the risk of miscarriage is deemed to lessen considerably.The couple excitedly told the rest of the Royal Family last Friday when they saw them at Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding.The joyous news sets the seal on a whirlwind year for Harry, 34, who in recent years has made no secret of his desire to settle down and start a family.It is only 12 months since the couple stepped out together in public for the first time, when they appeared together at the Invictus Games in Toronto. At the time, Meghan was still living full-time in Canada, although preparing to move to London, and the couple were not even engaged.After Harry popped the question at the end of last year, they married in May and just two months later, towards the end of July, conceived their first child.In mid-July, Harry and Meghan were on a \u0027mini-moon\u0027 royal tour to Dublin, their first trip together as a married couple. And on August 4, they were partying at the wedding of Harry\u0027s best friend Charlie Van Straubenzee.Yesterday a Kensington Palace spokesman said the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were all \u0027delighted for the couple\u0027.\u0027They were able to share their happy news with the Royal Family in person at Friday\u0027s wedding,\u0027 said an aide, which may have accounted for their low-key appearance at the nuptials.A friend added: \u0027They didn\u0027t make a grand announcement but had conversations with their family and friends and told them their news.\u0027Meghan is said to be in \u0027good health\u0027 and has not had to cancel any public appearances because of her pregnancy, unlike the Duchess of Cambridge who sadly suffered from hyperemesis gravidarum, a several form of pregnancy-related sickness.Her pregnancy is likely to be monitored closely, however, as by the age of 35 any woman expecting a baby is technically classed by doctors as a \u0027geriatric mother\u0027.The couple\u0027s tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga will be highly demanding. It includes opening the prince\u0027s inspirational Invictus Games for injured service personnel in Sydney later this week.Harry and Meghan have insisted their trip to the two most remote South Pacific islands will go ahead despite the risk of Zika there, which can cause abnormalities in foetuses. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office advises pregnant women to avoid \u0027all but essential travel\u0027 there.               Kensington Palace announced via Twitter on Monday that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting a baby in the springA source told the Mail last night: \u0027It\u0027s early days but everything seem to be progressing well and there won\u0027t be changes to the Duchess\u0027s diary. She has a busy tour ahead of her.\u0027 It is believed one of the first to know about the pregnancy was Meghan\u0027s mother, whom friends suspect she told in person when she came to visit her in London last month.In a statement issued through Kensington Palace - no less - Miss Ragland said she was \u0027very happy about this lovely news\u0027 and \u0027looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild\u0027.Speculation has raged in recent months that the yoga teacher and geriatric therapist would move to London permanently to support her daughter - and now her grandchild too. It emerged she gave up her full-time role as a social worker in May, then last month she was spotted taking baby-care classes in Pasadena, California, with reports in some international media claiming it was because Meghan does not want to hire a nanny.But senior royal aides played down any suggestion Miss Ragland would move to London, with one telling the Mail: \u0027This is just not true.\u0027 Another added: \u0027Meghan is very close to her mother and they see each other as much as they possibly can. Once the baby is born, of course Doria will be keen to visit her grandchild frequently. But she has her own life and home in LA, with her dogs, and it will continue that way.\u0027Meghan\u0027s father, Thomas Markle, from whom she is estranged after a series of hugely public embarrassments, is believed to have been informed by Miss Ragland \u0027a little while ago\u0027, said a friend, and is \u0027absolutely overjoyed\u0027 at the news.Last year, asked if they had plans to try for a baby, Harry replied: \u0027Not currently, no,\u0027 garnering a laugh from his then wife to be. \u0027Of course, one step at a time and hopefully we\u0027ll start a family in the near future,\u0027 he added.Around the time she met the prince, in the spring of 2016, Meghan gave an interview to Best Health Canada when she said becoming a mother was \u0027on her bucket list\u0027, adding: \u0027I can\u0027t wait to start a family, but in due time.\u0027In its statement yesterday, Kensington Palace said: \u0027Their Royal Highness the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are very pleased to announce that the Duchess of Sussex is expecting a baby in the spring of 2019.\u0027Their Royal Highnesses have appreciated all of the support they have received from people around the world since their wedding in May and are delighted to be able to share this happy news with the public.\u0027The couple\u0027s new baby will be seventh in line to the throne but will not be a prince or princess because of rules brought in by George V. Instead, a son would be styled the Earl of Dumbarton, one of Harry\u0027s lesser titles, and a daughter Lady (first name) Mountbatten-Windsor.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/15/12/06E3997F000003E8-0-image-m-27_1539604008201.jpg","title":"PM gathers Cabinet scrambles EU talks track","story":"    Theresa May (pictured in Downing Street yesterday) is trying to steady her restive Cabinet as Brexit tensions riseTheresa May is trying to steady her restive Cabinet today as she braces for a crucial 48 hours that could decide the fate of Brexit.The Prime Minister is gathering her senior team amid desperate efforts to get negotiations with the EU back on track.After dramatically pulling the plug on a fledgling orce agreement on Sunday, Mrs May has been frantically ringing round fellow leaders to appeal for a shift in their position. Tomorrow night she will make a make-or-break pitch to EU counterparts at a summit in Brussels - with council president Donald Tusk warning that a chaotic no-deal Brexit is now ‘more likely than ever before’. German minister Michael Roth said this morning that Mrs May needed to \u0027take responsibility\u0027 for the talks.In signs that concerns are growing within the Cabinet, around a third of the ministers met over pizza in Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom\u0027s office last night to consider the state of play. Four senior figures including Mrs Leadsom are thought to be ready to resign if the PM goes too far in concessions to the EU.Mrs May came under fire from angry Eurosceptics and Remainers in the Commons last night as she updated MPs on the standoff. The DUP has also stepped up its rhetoric again by threatening to \u0027paralyse\u0027 the government if Mrs May agrees to anything that would risk splitting the UK.Negotiations with Brussels hit the rocks on Sunday after Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab rejected the latest proposals on the Irish border at a hastily-arranged meeting with Michel Barnier.Calls for Commons Speaker John Bercow to QUIT after damning...Car manufacturer Ford warns \u0027no deal\u0027 Brexit would be a...Share this articleMrs May insisted hopes for a deal were still alive, saying the two sides were not ‘far apart’, but made clear Brussels will have to make concessions for there to be any chance of a settlement. The breakdown in talks centres on the so-called ‘backstop’ plans designed to prevent the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland.Mrs May revealed for the first time that the EU has agreed to consider her plan to keep the whole UK in a ‘temporary customs arrangement’ if a backstop is needed. But she told MPs that Brussels had also demanded a ‘backstop to the backstop’, which would ultimately require Northern Ireland to remain in the customs union – an idea Mrs May said was unacceptable. She insisted that a deal was still ‘achievable’, but government sources played down hopes of a breakthrough this week.She voiced her ‘frustration’ that the Irish issue was holding up talks, but added: ‘We are entering the final stages of these negotiations. This is the time for cool, calm heads to prevail.’    Andrea Leadsom (left) and Liz Truss are among the ministers at the Cabinet meeting today          Donald Tusk, pictured right with Michel Barnier in Brussels today, has warned that a no-deal Brexit is now ‘more likely than ever before’  Penny Mordaunt and Sajid Javid, pictured left and right respectively arriving for Cabinet today, are believed to be concerned about concessions in the Brexit negotiationsMrs May was repeatedly challenged by Eurosceptics including Boris Johnson over whether her \u0027backstop\u0027 plans for the Irish border will have a hard end date. She played down the idea of a date, but insisted she accepted the need for some form of exit mechanism or break clause.‘People are rightly concerned that what is only meant to be temporary could become a permanent limbo, with no new relationship between the UK and EU ever agreed,\u0027 she said.‘I am clear we are not going to be trapped permanently in a single customs territory unable to do meaningful trade deals.’The premier also dashed Brexiteer hopes she will shift from her Chequers blueprint for future trade to a looser Canada-style deal.She said that model was only on offer if the UK was willing to see Northern Ireland ‘carved out’ into a permanent customs union with the EU – something she would never contemplate.Eurosceptic MPs accused No 10 of manufacturing a ‘confected row’ with the EU to distract attention from a potential sellout. Former Brexit minister Steve Baker said the breakdown in talks was ‘almost certainly theatre’.  But in better news for Mrs May, Mr Baker also admitted that there was neither time nor support for a leadership challenge.\u0027There really isn\u0027t time for a long leadership contest going to the party and probably a general election,\u0027 he said.\u0027And if people were to look at a spreadsheet of where people stand on Euroscepticism and the Prime Minister there are not Eurosceptic numbers to change Prime Minister.\u0027Meanwhile, DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds has warned that his party\u0027s 10 MPs - who are propping up Mrs May in power - will effective go on strike if she does not stick to red lines on splitting the UK.\u0027We will have to say — How can we continue implement your domestic agenda, your budgets and everything else?\u0027 he told the BBC\u0027s Newsnight.\u0027Under the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act there are a lot of things that we can not support in terms of the government’s domestic and financial and welfare agenda which does not trigger the possibility of Jeremy Corbyn coming into No. 10.\u0027          Mrs May has been frantically ringing round fellow leaders including Emmanuel Macron (pictured) to appeal for a shift in their position          In the Commons last night, Boris Johnson pressed the PM on whether the Irish border \u0027backstop\u0027 would be time-limited           DUP leader Arlene Foster (pictured speaking with Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin and Bishop of Glendalough, Michael Jackson in  Dublin yesterday) has been demanding Mrs May holds to her red lines against anything that would split the UK "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/10/16/06/515A849E00000578-0-image-m-85_1539669458364.jpg","title":"Lady Collin Campbell calls Meghan Markle narcissist Good Morning Britain Paul Burrell","story":"Lady Colin Campbell and Princess Diana\u0027s former butler Paul Burrell were on Good Morning Britain today to discuss the royal baby news           But asked what she thought of Meghan, 37, Lady Campbell (pictured), 69, accused her of being a narcissist and slammed her decision to cut out her father and half sister from her wedding Meghan\u0027s touching tribute to Diana: Pregnant duchess honours...\u0027We\u0027re ready and excited to join the club!\u0027 Pregnant Meghan...We couldn\u0027t think of a better place to announce the baby, be...Meet the OTHER Meghan and Harry!

It’s going to have black blood, but it\u0027s also going to have white blood.Paul Burrell, who has repeatedly hit the headlines over the years for his claim about the Princess of Wales, said he thinks Meghan is a \u0027breath of fresh air\u0027\u0027You can\u0027t be seven eighths white and be called black. \u0027I think that\u0027s racism of the highest order. Its rather like Hitler’s definition of a Jew. If you\u0027re an eighth Jewish you\u0027re completely Jewish and therefore into the ovens.\u0027If you\u0027re partly black you’re partly black. You\u0027re not fully black.\u0027 Meghan and Prince Harry are currently in Sydney where they are on their first tour of Australia since getting married. They announced the news they are expecting their first child next spring yesterday and told members of the royal family at Princess Eugenie\u0027s wedding on Friday. Mr Burrell added that he \u0027knew it would happen\u0027, telling GMB: \u0027Harry has always wanted to be part of a larger family.\u0027He also said he hopes Meghan can try reconciling with her family \u0027behind closed doors\u0027 and believes it should be done in private.           The soon-to-be-mother of Prince Harry\u0027s child has not spoken with her father Thomas Markle, 74 (pictured) since before their wedding          The Duchess also has an estranged relationship with her half sister, Samantha (pictured) "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14a89a9d23d317c22304157057d4fd0aa8d16a8e/0_314_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ec3904043bd23cbbdc3df5e2c7985de5","title":"david goldblatts photographs documenting the casual horror of apartheid south africa","story":"Goldblatt’s photographs capture the understated unease of living an ordinary life in a society that was anything but normalThe photograph makes me squirm. Four young women, cling-wrapped in awkward swimsuits and perched on high heels, stand on display. One smirks, the other three look unsure. They clutch their competition numbers and present their naked white legs for consideration by the unseen judges.Behind the stage, a crowd of mostly women and children cluster around the elevated stage, their faces resigned or perplexed. Dotted among the crowd, a few white men stare blankly, appraising the women’s bodies, while the only black man frowns. Most people seem bemused by the uncomfortable spectacle taking place in their local supermarket. Outside the frame, shoppers push their trolleys through the aisles, taking toilet paper and bread rolls and washing powder off the shelves.It makes me shudder because David Goldblatt took the photograph “Saturday Morning at the Hypermarket: Miss Lovely Legs Competition” at the supermarket where my mother shopped when I was a child growing up in South Africa. And if my seven-year-old self wasn’t there on that day in 1980, I probably was later that week.In itself, the image is ordinary. Like many of Goldblatt’s photographs, it isn’t dramatic, the subjects unknown. But it shows the casualness of a society separated by apartheid. It captures the uneasiness that pulsed through my childhood growing up in South Africa. It recalls things I saw but did not see. And it drags up the old questions that lurk beneath my memories – how could such ordinariness take place while countless horrors were happening off camera?The image will be among many in the exhibition David Goldblatt: Photographs 1948–2018 at Sydney’s Museum of Contemporary Art over the summer. The vast exhibition, which was planned and curated before the late South African photographer died in June this year, will include his earliest work, his later portraits of miners, of Afrikaners, of exhausted early morning commuters and those affected by Aids, as well as his numerous landscapes of meaning-laden buildings and the lumbering mines that built the fortunes of the white ruling class thanks to black labourers. Most are in black and white – Goldblatt famously said “Colour was too sweet for apartheid” – and capture seven decades of a country and people ided by racism.Goldblatt didn’t see himself as an artist. As he told the Australian’s Tim Douglas in his last interview: “I am a photographer. I don’t hold exhibitions to glorify my artistic skill. These things I capture in my work are real. I photograph things that are important to me and to ­society. I want the pictures to be seen, because I want the message to be heard. But I’m not in the slightest bit interested in art and the glorification of art for art’s sake. It means nothing to me. I couldn’t give a fuck.”Instead he saw himself as a documentarian. When asked, he explained the purpose of his photographs to his friend and colleague Paul Weinberg: “I was asking myself how it was possible to be so apparently normal, moral, upright – which almost all those citizens were – in such an appallingly abnormal, immoral, bizarre situation. I hoped we would see ourselves revealed by a mirror held up to ourselves.”There is no violence in Goldblatt’s photograph – no schoolchildren fleeing police gunfire on the Soweto streets no bodies strewn on the ground after the Sharpeville massacre. Just everyday life. Goldblatt wasn’t interested in those sort of images he described himself as a coward who would “run away from violence”.Like all South Africans, my family experienced violent crime: my only uncle was murdered in a burglary gone wrong, a 16-year-old neighbour raped and murdered, our home burgled three times. None of these crimes made the headlines, none were exceptional – in fact we would be considered relatively fortunate. But as I stare at the faces in this series, I feel the same old prickling of fear – and the same need to understand. These are the people that committed the terrors that haunt me and they look so ordinary. Like many in South Africa, they aren’t monsters they’re just people who did appalling things.I haven’t been back to South Africa for more than 20 years. The country has moved on in vast leaps but, in my mind’s eye, much of it is frozen in its horribleness, its racism, its misogyny, just like one of Goldblatt’s pictures.But the photographs are also a powerful reminder that while ordinary people went about their daily lives, atrocities were committed and excused in their name. They are a warning that awful things happen on a normal day.• David Goldblatt: Photographs 1948-2018 exhibition will be on at Sydney’s Museum of Contemporary Art Australia from 19 October 2018 to 3 March 2019"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf1cf37abafafc6c6298b5fc0d6adfab61df9478/0_681_1882_1129/master/1882.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=28c32d73df0657256976a391689148e6","title":"david goldblatt and the everyday reality of south african racism in pictures","story":"David Goldblatt considered himself a documentarian rather than an artist, and the central concern of his work was apartheid.

Here’s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week.John Kennedy Toole’s A Confederacy of Dunces had several admirers last week. Peter Law-Jones wrote:Coming to the end of A Confederacy of Dunces by John Kennedy Toole, a surreal journey through a febrile mind and New Orleans. The sense of a truly absurd world is both unsettling and very funny. An excellent read.And the Thepuffpastryhangman said:I’m enjoying A Confederacy of Dunces for a second time. An utter joy. The descriptions of Ignatius’s ‘hobby’ make me snork every time. Second only to the magnificent Lucky Jim for laughs.On the subject of rereading, bobthekelpie has had an interesting experience with “an old favourite that I periodically reread”, The Swish of the Curtain by Pamela Brown:What I did not realise until I started reading my daughter’s copy, is that the version I loved as a child, that I have faithfully reread all these years, was heavily abridged. OMG MIND BLOWN.So I’m now reading an old, but wonderfully new and better version of one of my favourite books.Meetings with Remarkable Manuscripts by Christopher de Hamel is “an amazing, amusing, informative book” according to Dogbertd, who has to be quoted in full:I’m really glad I stumped up for the hardback because the pictures are (naturally) an integral and important part of the book, and you’ll want time to examine them closely. Hamel is an engaging and amusing guide to 12 of the most precious books written in Europe in the period before Gutenberg made print accessible to all.Hamel uses the same method throughout. First, a description of where the book is housed – along with sometimes caustic comments on his experience of getting his hands on the books – he hates those white gloves you’re sometimes forced to wear, but he loves the librarian in St Petersburg who gives him chocolates to eat as he’s perusing a 15th-century manuscript. Then he describes the book itself, pointing out the most interesting features: it’s like having the the best tour guide in the world at your side – in one book on the Apocalypse he notes that the Antichrist has had his face scratched out by an outraged reader – as has the Whore of Babylon (serves her right, he says). He then expounds on the history of the book and the sometimes murky routes it has taken to its current resting place.Along the way you’ll learn what a Psalter or Book of Hours is, why many manuscripts have pictures of cats playing viols (and it’s not because of the connection to catgut) and why the pope and the Archbishop of Canterbury both bowed down before de Hamel.It’s a superb book if you love books and history, the Middle Ages, literature and art.Here’s a brave admission from NorthernSceptic:No doubt. Meanwhile, Grumpywoman56 recommends A Day in the Life of a Smiling Woman by Margaret Drabble:It’s a collection of short stories and I’m really enjoying it. She eloquently expresses the hidden thoughts (even to themselves) of women. They were written in the 70s but it could apply to today’s society. It’s spurred me on to read more of her work.I needed something light-hearted and his equal parts interesting and amusing style is perfect. The only trouble is, I’ve read nearly 250 pages since Sunday night so I’ll need to find something else by the end of the week …How about Émile Zola’s The Beast Within? It has grabbed beingsentient:Tolstoy’s War and Peace has won over FrogC:I am reading War and Peace for the first time, at the age of 61. Only about 200 pages to go now. It is extraordinary, and there is no other novel like it. All the same, the essays on history, where Tolstoy forgets his characters for a few chapters and just rants about the errors of historians, are very strange, and one is inclined to think a novelist can’t do that. The only reason he gets away with it is that there is so much else going on at the same time.And tericheri adds of the same epic novel:That’s what I call a good read. The rest are mere trifles.All of them?!Interesting links about books and readingIf you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

The deal also marks a significant expansion and ersification for Drax, whose main business is a coal- and biomass-fired power station in North Yorkshire.Included in the £702m sale are four gas power stations in England, two hydro schemes and a pumped storage plant in Scotland. That leaves Scottish Power producing all its power from windfarms. While it has many onshore, the firm’s growth is in offshore windfarms, including East Anglia One, which should take the crown of the world’s largest when it opens in 2020.However, the company’s 5 million domestic customers will still be supplied with a mix of green and brown electricity, with some bought from other coal and gas power plant operators.The ScottishPower chief executive, Keith Anderson, said: “We are leaving carbon generation behind for a renewable future powered by cheaper green energy.”Drax, for its part, will see an immediate boost in its earnings, adding an estimated £90m-£110m profit in 2019.The acquisition positions Drax as a key player to fill in the gaps in the UK energy system at times when solar and wind power output is low.It also means that if the company fails to secure the subsidies needed for the new gas power station it wants to build at its North Yorkshire site then it will still have a broad portfolio.The chief executive of Drax Group, Will Gardiner, said: “As the system transitions towards renewable technologies, the demand for flexible, secure energy sources is set to grow. We believe there is a compelling logic in our move.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/622f8231593796df943d0df97926dd900ff8f693/0_311_5100_3060/master/5100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7de7c3efb59bb88d7eada0f0a53cb118","title":"the mexican town that refused to become a smart city","story":"Santa Maria Tonantzintla was set to be one of Mexico’s first smart cities – but residents saw it as an attempt to westernise their town and leave tradition behindLupita Tecual Porquillo had heard a rumour that the plaza was going to be “remodelled”. The 51-year-old grocery store owner lives around the corner from the centre of Santa Maria Tonantzintla, a sleepy town in the state of Puebla, about three hours from Mexico City. She assumed “remodelling” meant repairing the plaza’s centuries-old cobblestone pavement.In November 2017, heavy machinery arrived to tear out the characteristic cobblestones and replace them with smooth, uniform stone tiles. On 11 January, Tecual Porquillo discovered the municipality had also knocked down the clock tower and stucco bridge – both beloved landmarks in the central plaza.Rumours spread among the residents of Tonantzintla. They heard that a gourmet market would open along the plaza, that ticket booths would appear outside the church to charge for entry, that a building would be demolished to make room for a parking lot for tourists. Some even said that religious processions – a crucial part of civic life – would no longer pass through the plaza.A meeting for affected residents later revealed that Tonantzintla was to become part of a pilot project: smart cities.Smart cities integrate technology into urban infrastructure, usually to improve sustainability, maximise efficiency and minimise energy usage. It’s a strategy generally undertaken in major metropolitan areas – like Singapore, Barcelona and Seoul – with specific technologies and strategies varying from place to place. In London, for instance, it involves the use of sensor networks to monitor traffic flow and allows citizens to report graffiti using an app.Last year Puebla’s governor José Antonio Gali Fayad announced a statewide Barrio Smart (smart city) initiative in conjunction with the organisation Alianza Smart Latam. According to the initiative’s website, the project has “the objective of constructing spaces that benefit citizens through the implementation of technology”.Smart city technology in Puebla is slated to include “safe crosswalks, free internet, video surveillance, seismic alarm, playground, trash cans, signage, ecological benches and payment modules”. In January, the city of Atlixco, about half an hour from Tonantzintla, became Latin America’s first smart city, complete with a new bike path, security cameras, speed sensors for cars and free internet access.But in being presented with this futuristic-sounding vision, it appears that residents of Santa Maria Tonantzintla found themselves caught in a conflict repeated the world over, between centuries-old customs and new development trends.Residents like Tecual Porquillo don’t understand the true goal of the project, says architect Victor Campos, who was involved in the design on behalf of the municipality’s secretary of public works.“The purpose was to order the urban spaces so that they would function correctly,” he says. The tourist buses that pass through Tonantzintla for brief stints each day bring little economic benefit for the town as a whole – the tourists file into the church, file back onto the bus and leave. The plan, according to Campos, had to do with improving the streets to better regulate vehicle flow and expanding the plaza to allow for more space for local events.“This was all so that the community would benefit,” Campos says. Moreover, the municipality turned the publicity of the project over to local authorities who represent the interests of residents, he says. But Tecual Porquillo says the municipality organised a consultation meeting involving just 15 or 20 residents – not a representative sample. The failure of communication and understanding between the municipality, planners and locals cuts to the heart of conflicts around urban development: how can planners achieve local buy-in, and how can residents truly play a role in determining what happens to their cities?Like the vast majority of Latin American towns from the colonial era to the present, Tonantzintla’s centre – physically, civically and culturally – is a church set on a plaza. Tonantzintla’s church is particularly notable, attracting dozens of tourists each day. The interior is covered with elaborate gilded carvings, in a style that fuses the baroque decorations of the late 17th century with indigenous carvings.Tonantzintla’s residents take enormous pride in the church, and diligently raise money to preserve it. The town is deeply tied to its Catholic and indigenous traditions, so even superficial changes like the repaving of the old cobblestone roads signify a departure from culture and identity. The smart city proposal – which insinuated that the way things had been was now somehow inadequate – touched a nerve.Mercedes Tecuapetla Quechol, a local resident, attributes the changes to a sort of cultural racism. Mexicans call this phenomenon malinchismo: a feeling that the foreign, particularly western, is always preferable to tradition. “They are ashamed of their roots,” Tecuapetla Quechol says. “They saw something they liked in the United States or in Europe, so they want to put it here.”Within weeks of the smart city’s construction, a group of residents brought complaints against the initiative. After discovering that the municipality hadn’t secured the necessary permits from the National Institute of Anthropology and History, they filed an injunction that put the project on hold and finally caused the municipality to cancel it.In Puebla, around 15 more cities are slated to become smart cities. The Atlixco project (the only finished project so far) has also sparked an outcry – at the end of July, the bike lane was removed because it was only used about once every two weeks, according to residents. Some local business owners have also complained that their sales have dropped significantly since the project began.On a Thursday afternoon in late June, Tonantzintla’s plaza is sparsely populated. People pass by on their way from school or work, and a few vendors mill around the edges selling ice cream, quesadillas, chocolate. At around two o’clock a tour bus pulls up, and a group of visitors file out of the doors, taking photos before entering the church. “This is what the city wants,” says anthropologist Julio Glockner, who has written a book on the iconography in the church and supported the residents who oppose the smart city.Looking out at the plaza, Tecuapetla Quechol sighs. “It looks bald. I miss the bridge and the clock,” she says. “They think this is what tourists want.” After passing through the church and snapping photos of the plaza, the visitors return to the bus and drive away to continue on their circuit around Cholula.Later that afternoon a priest leads a procession of 10 or 15 people through the plaza. A woman scatters flower petals and together a few men support the shrine of a saint. Several musicians playing drums and brass instruments follow behind. “This is Tonantzintla,” Tecuapetla Quechol says. “This is our heritage. If you don’t like it, it’s because you don’t love your roots.”Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c5afc402c7767bd823ddd912e8e16ab3075cceb/0_83_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ce94961b244beee8eff2c526399811b","title":"theresa may brexit norway solution peoples vote","story":"Theresa May’s week began with an early-morning visit to a loneliness charity. She needed its help in parliament today, stymied still by intransigence on the Brexit backstop. She will need it tomorrow, with half of her cabinet toying with self-serving resignations. David Davis’s rebel cry at the weekend urged them to rise up against her and “exert their collective responsibility”, but around that table it’s every man and woman for themselves, each eyeballing the others for fear someone else might make some grandstanding demarche. This improbable crew commands our fate. Never in living memory was Britain worse governed.Nadine Dorries’ call for Davis to be imposed as “interim” prime minister is as alarming as the thought of picking a new leader from this cabinet of knaves, fools and fantasists. Who in their right mind would think this a good moment to pause while the Tories run a leadership election? Whichever Brexiter they chose would face precisely the same set of options – and in the course of wooing their Brexit-fanatic members, the winner would pledge an even tougher stance. Expect no attack of moderation from Tory members who booed whenever the Financial Times was mentioned at their conference.Feel no pity for May. At first she seemed plausible as the least incapable pair of hands on offer. But she threw away every chance to escape this Brexit dead-end by turning to her extreme wing. In the more than 18 excruciating months since she recklessly triggered article 50 with no plan, nothing has changed. The Brexit conundrum remains where it began, except she has made it far worse. There stands the same giant boulder in the road that is Northern Ireland’s borders. All she has contributed is mutually contradictory “red lines” that made any solution impossible. Frictionless trade, with no adjudication by the European court of justice, with no customs union, no single market and no hard border in Ireland: this was not any old cake-and-eat-it but a bankrupted Patisserie Valerie confection. And there she has stayed.Why the surprise that no last-minute deal was fixed when Dominic Raab dashed to Brussels on Sunday night? Nothing had changed – and this man, yet another leadership contender, ideologue of the Britannia Unchained Brexit-right coterie, was certainly not the one to concede anything. Far from making new concessions in the Commons, May is still driving, foot flat down, at the Irish boulder, with no sign she means to swerve before crashing out with no deal, the “clean Brexit” called for by growing numbers of kamikaze Brexiters. Open Europe’s Simon Wolfson complains of a “superstitious reluctance” to prepare for their preferred no deal, whose costs will, he says, seem “small” in 13 years despite the IMF’s warning of “dire consequences”.The closer we get to that Armageddon, the louder the Brextremists ramp up their Dad’s Army rhetoric. Nigel Farage, at his rallies, is “building an army to fight for Brexit”. Warning of lost sovereignty, Davis asks: “What will be our future as a free nation?” Jeremy Hunt, after comparing the EU to a Soviet gulag, claims May is “battling for Britain”. Boris Johnson writes of the “disastrous surrender of our country”. But Andrea Jenkyns MP puts it best: “It is better to go down fighting and honouring the democratic decision of our British people than be reduced to waving a white flag and surrendering to EU demands!”Going down? Hadn’t these Captain Mainwarings better ask the people before they sink us all? Next Saturday’s march for a People’s Vote is timely as the Brexiters admit their way means “sacrifice”, not those promised pots of gold at the rainbow’s end.Some deal may yet be cobbled together. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, hinted on Sunday that instead of a date for Britain to leave the customs union, “conditions” could be set, releasing us whenever some magico-techno solution is finally found for a no-checks Irish border. If May put almost any deal to parliament, a sigh of relief at avoiding no-deal disaster risks blinding too many Caroline Flints to what a terrible deal this would still be. We pay £39bn-50bn to leave, we stay in a customs union without a say on future rules, we are rule-takers and we accept whatever trade deals they make, such as a TTIP with the US, while losing global influence. In the cold light of day, when the shouting is done, would many citizens support terms so much worse than what we have now?A plan B is gaining ground among the sane. Nick Boles MP proposed it, and others across the spectrum are gathering round it. Prolong the transition for, say five years, until there’s a deal. Make the whole UK temporary associate members of the EEA and EFTA, close to the single market and in the customs union, with frictionless trade with the EU and its 60 other trading countries, outside EU agriculture and fisheries. Immigration is still a stumbling block, but the EEA offers more flexibility: no freedom of movement for all, only for EU workers with jobs already. Polling suggests that’s far more acceptable. There’s no perfect solution: there usually isn’t. But a Norway Brexit as an EEA associate looks closest – and the Commons could pass it.When May meets her fractious cabinet, she should thump the table so the water glasses jump and put to them the only plan B that stands a chance. If they refuse, then tell them only the people can break this impasse: put it to a people’s vote. Johnson’s latest mock-Churchillian advice is: “There comes a point when you have to stand up to bullies.” He meant the EU – but she needs to confront her party’s bullies. As she spoke in the Commons, AstraZeneca suspended future investment in Britain due to Brexit.

I urge world leaders to agree to establish a sanctuaryI thought it would be cold. Not just cold, but colder than anything I had experienced in my life. I had visions of bedraggled explorers in blizzards with ice-covered beards.But standing there, in the bright Antarctic sun, watching creaking blue icebergs, penguins bursting in and out of the water, I felt utterly content in this glistening wilderness.What I hadn’t thought about was the dark. And not the dark of night – although as a European, that brought a dazzling new astronomy of the southern hemisphere to me – but the dark of the deep, icy, ocean depths. I was going almost half a kilometre down to the Antarctic seafloor.It was back in January of this year, and I had joined a Greenpeace research expedition as part of a campaign to create a vast Antarctic ocean sanctuary. At 1.8m square kilometres, it would be five times the size of Germany. If it’s created, which it could be when governments meet in the next few weeks, it would be the largest protected area anywhere on Earth. I am one of two million people who want it to happen.Scientists on the ship were using tiny submersibles to go where humans had never been before to explore ecosystems we know so little about: deep habitats they had been looking at on screens all their working lives but had never seen with their own eyes. The excitement was more arresting than the cold of the Antarctic summer.So there I was, descending, in a small, two-person submarine to the frontiers of human knowledge. The light faded, and the sea around us turned a heavy blue. As we sank to hundreds of metres below the surface, I was surrounded by a thick blackness. It was a colour that I had no idea the ocean could turn. Pitch black.A torch at the front of the submarine shone like a night-light for a child afraid of the dark. It showed the way to the seabed.The sight as it came into view was staggering. Out of the dark and freezing depths emerged a moving, crawling, vibrant mass of life.The temperature is so low that vegetation barely survives down here. Nearly everything is an animal: bizarre and ghostly icefish that are semi-transparent sea spiders that look like something out of a science-fiction film colourful, tendrilled, feather stars, basket stars, corals, sponges.I’m told that more people have been to the moon than have been to the bottom of the Antarctic ocean. Maybe that’s apocryphal, but it certainly feels like it. We know precious little about this alien environment, which is why it is so crucial to protect it before it is too late.Emerging back into the light at the surface, the bubbles of the submarine hull clearing, it was like waking from a dream, the intangible creatures of the abyss left far behind.I had truly seen the light and the dark of the Antarctic. At its surface, penguin colonies stretch for miles on snow-capped islands, with millions of breeding pairs across the region, raising their chicks in this inhospitable environment. Enormous whales surface all around, feeding on huge pink clouds of the small shrimp-like krill, which nearly all wildlife here relies on. Fur seals and elephant seals lounge on drifting blocks of ice. While below, another world goes on existing in dark vitality.So often, we lament the destruction of the environment once it has taken place. And it is true that wildlife in the Antarctic is facing threats from climate change, pollution and industrial fishing. But this area still remains one of the least-touched regions on the planet.Right now, we have an opportunity to protect this place. The governments responsible for conservation of the Antarctic’s waters meet in Hobart, Australia, in the second half of October. What better conservation of the Antarctic ocean could there be than the creation of the largest protected area on Earth at its heart, in the Weddell sea. It would put the area off-limits to future human activity, protect wildlife such as penguins, seals and whales, and help to tackle climate change.I am proud to stand as one person in a movement of more than two million that has come together this year to demand world leaders protect the Antarctic.Most of these people will never visit the Antarctic, but their passion for protecting it inspires me. Across the world, people have written to their politicians they have encouraged their friends and family to take action they have dressed up as penguins and danced on ice to raise awareness from the streets of Buenos Aires to Beijing they have installed penguin sculptures from Johannesburg to Seoul. This is a global movement for a region that belongs to us all.Now, as governments prepare to meet at the Antarctic ocean commission there are millions of eyes watching them and urging them to act. To secure the Antarctic for future generations. To allow its abundance of wildlife to flourish and its migratory species to thrive between the world’s oceans. To help create healthy oceans that contribute to global food security. To preserve the Antarctic ocean’s functions as one of the world’s largest carbon stores. Because, truly, what happens in the Antarctic affects us all.• Javier Bardem is an Oscar-winning actor and an Antarctic ambassador for Greenpeace"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d64ef6d3bf88fd5b67fa040234639441d6da56a4/0_148_4502_2702/master/4502.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4e5648a180624293b93c6f6ea5373db","title":"britain eu brussels brexit","story":"Brussels’ Brexit policy has always been clear. We’re in this mess because British politicians never took it seriouslyAt every step of the Brexit process, there has been a reliable way to predict what the European Union will do. This technique yields top intelligence on the motives of the key continental players. It is devilishly simple, too. The trick is to listen to what they actually say.The inevitable dynamic of the negotiations was spelled out even before the referendum result was known. Angela Merkel described it, three weeks before polling day. The German chancellor was reluctant to intervene in domestic British debate, understanding that anything she said would be seized upon by the leave campaign as proof of meddling by beastly foreigners. (And in paranoid Eurosceptic folklore, none are beastlier than the Germans.)But Merkel also saw how important facts were not being aired in the campaign. She expressed a “personal hope” that Britain would stay in the EU and added that to leave would be to surrender influence, because the best deals were done on the inside. The UK, she warned, would not find it comfortable negotiating from “outside the room”.Merkel was right. From the moment the article 50 trigger was pulled, the Brexit process has followed an EU timetable on terms defined by EU treaties. At every stage, European leaders have repeated the golden rule, in private, in public, in print: privileges of membership are unavailable to non-members. Britain must decide what it likes about its current arrangements and then negotiate a price for retaining them. The latest terms and conditions have been regularly updated on the European commission’s website.This has made it easy to test the feasibility of any idea offered up by a Brexit supporter. First, examine what the plan involves in terms of keeping a benefit of EU membership (frictionless movement of goods across borders, for example). Then ask what the plan’s author is willing to surrender, as a budget contribution or by submission to European court jurisdiction. If the answer is nothing, the proposal can be ignored.When this test is applied, everything Boris Johnson has said on the subject of Brexit, including his latest “Super Canada” notion, is exposed as bilge. Strip away Johnson’s rococo verbiage and you find refusal to accept that Brexit involves any cost to Britain. Yet the underlying reason he left the government, alongside David Davis, was shame at feeling the cost up close. To continue in the cabinet would have meant owning the weakness of one national government trying to negotiate with a continental bloc.Few things have demonstrated the logic of the European project as effectively as the spectacle of hollow Eurosceptic rhetoric bouncing off the wall of continental unity – and back into the faces of people who didn’t believe Britain had anything to gain from that kind of solidarity.The only surprise for the EU side has been the obstinacy of British politicians ignoring what their counterparts in Brussels, Berlin and Paris have been saying and their cowardice in refusing to pass the message on to voters. This isn’t a symptom of foreign politicians being more virtuous. Honesty is pretty evenly distributed among nations. It is simply a feature of a multinational union that common positions, once established, are not readily changed. And in the case of Michel Barnier’s mandate as the EU’s chief negotiator there has been no incentive for member states to break ranks.Brexit is just one of the EU’s problems and not the hardest one. The financial stability of the eurozone migration across the Mediterranean trade war with Donald Trump populist demagogues undermining the rule of law in Poland, Hungary and Italy cyber-sabotage by the Kremlin – those are the pressing items on a Brussels to-do list. And while every EU member has an interest in Brexit being settled safely, and many governments profoundly wish Britain would stick around to help grapple with Europe’s collective woes from inside the room, the act of leaving means automatically having your own national needs downgraded. And goodwill towards a neighbour and ally doesn’t translate into indulgence of every rancid burp of an idea rising from the guts of a Tory party struggling to digest its historic miscalculation.None of this is meant to romanticise Brussels’ handling of Brexit. I have heard European diplomats complain about intransigence on their own side in terms much like the frustrated laments that echo around Whitehall. A common gripe is that the French and Germans are too spooked by fear of nationalist contagion too fixated on the need for Euroscepticism to be exposed as a road to nowhere. But even in capitals traditionally attuned to the British position in Europe, where disappointment at the UK’s departure is greatest, there are no hidden wells of eagerness to bail out Theresa May. The calculation is the same: every leader with a seat at the summit table where Brexit matters are ultimately decided values that seat more than they value any aspect of their bilateral relationship with the UK. And May isn’t at that table.This is what Merkel was talking about in June 2016. Her one foray into the debate was dismissed by leavers as a denigration of British economic clout and an affront to democracy, but it was no such thing. It was just maths. Many countries together are greater than one. That was the argument for Europe all along and it is the reason why Brexit is failing why it was always going to fail."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bdff09f949a2afece386d3c591109506a474c7ab/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d3fe2b65eea69fc11c503bec84153b37","title":"four day week parents","story":"Imagine a Friday morning with no rude awakening by shrill alarm, no dastardly commute: just the joyful prospect of a three-day weekend and the delicious knowledge that it’s yours to enjoy week in, week out.That might sound like wishful thinking. But a full-pay four-day working week is an idea fast gathering pace. Last month, the TUC backed it. And the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has hinted it could feature in Labour’s next manifesto.And why not? Who’s to say the daily grind should for evermore take the form of a five-day, 37.5-hour week? In the late 1800s, a six-day, 60-hour week was standard. Perhaps in 2100, people will wonder why on earth we put up with the hours we do today. While there were two big reductions in working hours in the last century, after each of the two world wars, things have stalled since: just two and a half hours shaved off in 70 years.But if history is anything to go by, perhaps not. Technological progress – from the invention of the wheel to the washing machine – has made us collectively richer by enabling us to get more stuff done in the same time. Twenty years ago, it would have taken one person at the supermarket checkout to ring up each basket of shopping. Today, that person might oversee four or five people using self-service checkouts.This is how the TUC believes a four-day week could become a reality. As automation and artificial intelligence make us all richer, we should, in theory, face a choice: work fewer hours for the same salary or the same hours for more. There are good reasons to go for the former: sacrificing a bit of growth so we all get more leisure time is better for the planet, not to mention our wellbeing, and might even make us more productive when we are at work.But there are two barriers to realising this working-week nirvana. Britain simply isn’t investing in technological development at anything like the rate needed to make us all more productive. (This is why calls for a robot tax are economically illiterate.) And while technology has made us collectively richer, some have done much better out of it than others. When the ability of shopfloor workers to demand higher wages is diminished – as the declining power of trade unions means it is today – then the supermarket bosses who invested in self-service technology can pocket all the gains themselves.Fortunately, there is another way. While the average working week for full-timers hovers at around 37 hours, the average for all workers – including part-timers – is 32 hours a week, not far off a four-day week. There’s a massive gender gap in part-time working: four in 10 female workers are part-time, but just one in eight men. Fixing this could be the key to getting us to a four-day week.Some might argue this is no business of the state it’s just families sharing out their earning and caring responsibilities as they wish. But it’s something the state should care deeply about. Women being more likely to work part time explains a big chunk of the gender pay gap: it holds women back in the workplace, making it harder for them to get promotions and pay rises. Until more men, particularly those in senior positions, work part time, workplaces will never evolve so that it’s possible to progress while working three days a week. Moreover, it’s better for children to have the closer relationship with both parents that comes from caring responsibilities being shared more equally.Sophia Parker, chief executive of Little Village, has established a part-time week as standard at her charity to attract ambitious people who don’t want to work full-time. She works a three-day week and shares the care of her three children with her husband, who also works a three-day week in a job-share at Aviva. “Not only has Will had to step up to the role of ‘wife’, I’ve had to step back to let him in,” she tells me. “It’s something I found really hard to do after being the primary carer for a number of years – my identity had become very bound up in childcare and running the house.”Attitudes are shifting in this direction: half of millennial fathers say they would take a pay cut to achieve a better work-life balance, and more than half say childcare should be shared equally. But fathers can often face discrimination from employers if they break with cultural stereotypes and ask to work flexibly.The state could do much more to support couples to share caring and earning more equally. Currently, mothers and fathers can share their entitlement to parental leave in their baby’s first year. But take-up by fathers has been low: men earn more, paternity pay is worse than maternity pay in most workplaces – meaning sharing leave makes bad financial sense – and men’s requests may not be well received by their employer.This is in stark contrast to Iceland, where three out of nine months of parental leave must be used by each partner. Because it is use-it-or-lose-it leave, it has quickly become culturally acceptable to take it: the vast majority of Icelandic fathers now spend three months at home caring for their babies. These fathers are not only more likely to do their fair share of domestic work for many years afterwards, they are more likely to go back to work flexibly and share in the caring in the long term too.The old tools for winning a reduction in the working week – such as trade union bargaining – no longer exist in the same way. But establishing at least three months of shared leave for each parent would help create the social norm that no father or mother should be working more than three or four days a week: a norm that could eventually set the standard for people without children too. Getting men and women to more equally share caring and earning is the best route to a four-day week.• Sonia Sodha is chief leader writer at the Observer and deputy opinion editor at the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c1da896c4a4a85091deb502fd84b01aa21bfc72/0_253_3762_2257/master/3762.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6bd239580e6481217764eb1bf4254626","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of yellow","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘yellow’The closing date is Wednesday 17 October September at 10am.

Ask the people who live there …Cleopatra Browne, founder of Celtic Quest Coasteering I’ve visited many coastal destinations across the globe, but nothing compares to Wales’s wet and wild coastline. The rock formations, sandy beaches, sheer cliff faces, Atlantic swell and abundance of marine life are all world-class.When the sea is rough, the coastline is truly wild, with waves crashing along the cliffs or rolling into the sandy beaches. When calm, the stunning glassy ocean allows us to explore caves and hidden coves. Then there are the people – Pembrokeshire folk are extremely welcoming. I love learning about the history of our little stretch of paradise from locals.My outdoor career began 20 years ago at a multi-activity centre on the Pembrokeshire coast, where I gained experience in kayaking, surfing, climbing and ing. Coasteering was by far my favourite – it is often described as extreme rock pooling. You explore a stretch of coastline at sea level, traversing the rocky shore, adventure swimming, cliff jumping, exploring caves and more. I saw an opportunity to offer the activity to everybody – not just outdoor enthusiasts. We tailor the experience to the expectations and abilities of each inidual. Being able to swim helps but is not essential as the safety equipment can do the floating for you.What’s great about coasteering is that participants can get up close and personal with the coastline without the need for boats, boards or ropes. All that is required is a wetsuit, a buoyancy aid and a helmet – as well a sense of adventure and a guide with a good splash of local knowledge. Then you’re set for hours of fun.Wales has a reputation for wet weather, but seeing as you can’t get much wetter than when jumping from cliffs into the Celtic Sea, that doesn’t put a stop to our activities. That said, the Welsh coastline is stunning in the sunshine. Looking down from the Wales Coast Path over the crystal-clear waters, visitors often remark that their visit has exceeded expectations.All of our adventures finish in the Blue Lagoon, an old slate quarry flooded by the sea. Its waters are 25 metres deep and the cliffs climb 30 metres above. If you park at Abereiddi beach, the lagoon is a short walk along the coast path – it’s the location of the World Series Cliff Diving competition, and truly is a stunning spot.Cwm-yr-Eglwys between Fishguard and Newport is another favourite, also off the beaten track. A secluded cove with clear blue water, it’s perfect for snorkelling, kayaking and standup paddle boarding.Wales is a truly world-class adventure destination, which offers just about every activity you can imagine.Catherine Williams, operations manager at Snowdonia-ActiveGrowing up near the Peak District, I developed a love of exploring the outdoors. But because the area is landlocked, with the nearest coast more than two hours away, I chose to do my degree in north Wales to satisfy my love of the mountains and desire to be close to the sea.My academic background is in psychology, and my master’s degree investigated the mutually beneficial relationship between people and nature. This led me to my role at Snowdonia-Active, where we fully believe in and promote the benefits of spending time being active outdoors.The Welsh coast is a mecca for outdoor activities, and home to some of the most beautiful coastline in the world. I’ve lived here for 12 years and I’m still finding new coastal spots that amaze and inspire me. It’s super accessible and on the doorstep to the mountains – I can’t think of many places in the world where you can spend the morning in the mountains and the afternoon by the coast.I have three favourite spots. My must-do activity is coasteering on Anglesey – an activity that involves scrambling, climbing, jumping and swimming your way around the coast. I’ve recently had a little girl, so I’m seeking some softer adventures at the moment too, such as exploring the hidden coves at Borth y Gest near Porthmadog and dipping our toes in the sea. I also love Rhoscolyn Beach for sea kayaking, followed by a glass of wine at the White Eagle – a favourite with William and Kate when they lived in Anglesey.With a place as special as Snowdonia, it is vital to promote quiet enjoyment through recreation, as we do at Snowdonia-Active. Wales is leading the way in this area, with wildlife and conservation organisations working and the outdoor sector collaborating on education, wildlife monitoring and practical conservation projects. Whether you want quiet coves, busy beaches, clifftop walks, climbing, wildlife spotting or simply to hang out in a beer garden with an incredible sea view, the Welsh coast has it.Phil Scott, founder of RibRide I’ve lived in north Wales since 1991, apart from an eight-year stint in the Caribbean. I’m passionate about watersports: sailing and Ribs (rigid-hulled inflatable boats), windsurfing and kite-surfing. I also love running and mountain biking.North Wales is simply the best location in the UK to enjoy these sports at a high level in a stunning environment. I feel so lucky to live here and be bringing up my family to enjoy the unique culture and opportunities.After returning to north Wales from the Virgin Islands where I was skippered a luxury yacht, my business partner and I invested in a Rib to start RibRide, the first adventure boat tour company in north Wales. We now have 11 boats, a storage yard, a training academy, six full-time staff and an award-winning track record – we are listed as the top outdoor activity provider in Wales on TripAdvisor.The region has one of the largest tidal ranges in the UK, and one of the longest tidal estuaries, the Menai Strait, which causes one of the fastest tidal currents. People think the Menai Strait is a dangerous stretch of water, but it’s actually one of the most sheltered, user-friendly locations there is as long as you have the right knowledge and experience.An ideal day for me would be a visit to the Marram Grass restaurant in Newborough with a short walk to the Roman stepping stones and the home of Maurice Wilks, the original designer of the Land Rover – followed by a two-mile walk to Newborough Beach over one of the largest sand dune systems in the UK.With its assorted beaches, cliffs, islands and coastal paths, north Wales is one of the most peaceful, soulful, relaxing and energising places you will ever find.Adventure holidays across Wales are made for all ages and abilities. When undertaking any activity, always be adventure smart and stay safe using only approved activity operators.

From rugged clifftop peaks to sprawling, serene beaches puffins to porpoises ­– natural beauty of incredible variety and scale is everywhere. Wales is the only country in the world that boasts a walking trail ning its entire coastline. The really dedicated can tackle the whole 870 miles. You can even run it – the current record is 23 days.For those more inclined towards a gentle hike or a relaxed amble, taking in glorious sunsets from castles or viaducts, here are eight of the best coastal walks.Aberaeron to New Quay (6.5 miles)New Quay claims to be the inspiration for Llareggub, the fictional seaside village at the centre of Dylan Thomas’s masterpiece Under Milk Wood – and it is worth a visit alone so that you can make your own mind up. This easy trek between two of the loveliest fishing towns in Wales takes you through forests, waterfalls and fern, finishing at glorious Traeth Gwyn beach in New Quay. Make sure to plan your timing with the tide in mind so you get the full experience, and have time for a swim in fine weather. The Hotel Penwig boasts a seafront location and is ideal for an overnight stay or just a drink to toast a fine walk.St Govan’s chapel, Pembrokeshire, to Stackpole Quay (5.5 miles)Expect medium intensity here, mainly because of the steep steps that take you down to the mystical St Govan’s chapel, the real draw of this lovely walk. St Govan’s origins are debated, including the suggestion that he was Gawain, the legendary knight. Another story has him as an Irish Christian missionary who took shelter from pirates in these rocks and then created his monastic chapel in thanks to God for his survival. The remarkable stone structure has been as weathered by the sea as the rocks around it, but it remains in good shape. Look out for the bird life – chocolate brown guillemots and black razorbills come in the summer to breed on the cliffs. For a different wildlife experience, the walk also takes in Bosherston Lily Ponds, where house martins and swallows skim over the lily-covered fresh water. Also nearby is the beautiful Barafundle Bay – with its clear waters and expanse of golden sands, it is the closest Britain gets to the Caribbean.This short and slightly steep walk is well worth it. One of the best views in Wales awaits you, only a small, well-signposted distance from the town of Barmouth, which was a favourite of the poet William Wordsworth. At the summit, you’ll have a view of the dramatic upland landscape of Cadair Idris, as well as the Mawddach Estuary, but be sure to make time for the spectacular wooden Barmouth Bridge. It is just over 150 years old and, at 699 metres long, it is Britain’s longest wooden railway bridge. You can walk or cycle over the bridge for free.Mumbles to Three Cliffs Bay (12.5 miles)This is a long walk made easy thanks to the well-maintained path. Three Cliffs Bay is a perfect example of the particular charms of the Welsh coastline – the wildness, the feeling of being outside of time, the awe-inspiring peace. This walk is the perfect summer outing, and the bay provides a picturesque picnic location that would be hard to beat. The Gower Coast Path has many highlights, and this scenic walk is one of the most breathtaking.Holyhead to Trearddur Bay (12 miles)You are spoiled for idyllic walks in Anglesey and this stretch offers a perfect mix of cliff-hiking and open coastal views. You begin in the impressive Holyhead Breakwater country park, built on the site of an old quarry. Regular exhibitions and displays offer information about the local wildlife – which include falcons and peregrines – to any accompanying little ones, and a friendly cafe with local suppliers will set you up for the day. The entire Anglesey coastline is designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and this walk has some of the most breathtaking views. Visit South Stack lighthouse to watch the breeding seabirds on the cliffs and experience the full drama of wind and sea. You can also get guided tours of the lighthouse. Once you’ve arrived at your destination, a stay at the seafront Trearddur Bay hotel is highly recommended.The Glamorgan Heritage Coast is so-called because it’s been recognised as an area of notable natural beauty or scientific significance, and walking it you can see exactly why. It’s as much a treat for amateur geologists as it is for keen walkers. You’ll pass by Dunraven Castle, and although it hasn’t survived intact, it makes for a striking and almost magical scene. If you decide to do the full walk, make sure you’re aware of the tides as they can take you by surprise. The Blue Anchor is the perfect traditional countryside pub for a pie and a pint when you’re done.Conwy to Llandudno (18 miles)This ambitious walk is perfect for experienced long-distance hikers, but the route is also easy to ide into smaller sections for those who only have an afternoon. It will take you up the Conwy River estuary and around the Great Orme, allowing for spectacular views of the north Wales coastline. As well as being a scenic delight, this is a walk for the historically minded – Llandudno has managed to keep its briny Victorian charms intact, and Conwy boasts an imposing medieval castle built in the 13th century.A very good walk based around some of Dylan Thomas’s old haunts, taking you via the River Taf and a Norman castle. The Dylan Thomas Boathouse is a must-see, bound to inspire those of a poetic bent – and the deck is the perfect place to sit with a coffee to take in the estuary. Laugharne Castle is a well-preserved and strikingly beautiful site, with a glorious view from the top of the tower. On your return, why not enjoy a beer in famous literary watering hole Brown’s hotel, where Thomas entertained his fellow writers and students.

Forty years later, she toured the area with her teenage daughter. Is it still as enchanting? Back in the 1970s, a good 20 years before the advent of low-cost airlines made short European breaks as cheap as a trip to the local seaside, my family made regular jaunts to an Italian village that was only two hours, door to door, from our home in Manchester. The place was the height of exotica: it had a campanile and a pantheon, palm trees and fountains, a cluster of brightly painted houses on the clifftop overlooking the lagoon, and the locals spoke another language. Only the weather punctured the illusion that we were on the Italian Riviera or the Amalfi coast because we were, in fact, in Wales.But in my memory the sun often shone in Portmeirion: and when I returned last month with my teenage daughter, to show her where I spent so many holidays, there was sunshine again (some of the time). My daughter, it’s fair to say, was sceptical about our expedition. Holidays for her tend to begin with a short train ride from our house in south London to Gatwick this one started with a five-hour drive through a cloudy Wales. But when we reached Snowdonia the clouds lifted, the day brightened, and suddenly Catriona was being wowed by vistas of green and blue mountains, fields full of sheep and cows, and tantalising glimpses of lakes. There were occasional animals on the roads, but hardly any other cars.We breezed into Portmeirion, crossing the threshold I remember so well into the magical kingdom founded by architect Clough Williams-Ellis in the 1920s. Williams-Ellis was an eccentric who first started to dream of setting up the place as a child of five or six, before going searching for the perfect island on which to site it in the early 1920s. But no island seemed quite right and then he discovered a rocky promontory outside Porthmadog, and set to work. First came Hotel Portmeirion, which opened in 1926 across the years that followed came the gatehouse and the battery, the prior’s lodging and the campanile, the roundhouse, and pastel-coloured cottages with names such as Dolphin and Angel. As the place grew, its fame expanded, and it soon became the “It” location for A-listers such as George Bernard Shaw, Daphne du Maurier and HG Wells. Noel Coward came here to write Blithe Spirit part of the Inn of Sixth Happiness, with Ingrid Bergman, was filmed in Portmeirion’s pagodas and it was the Village in the 1960s cult series The Prisoner, alongside Patrick McGoohan, who starred as “Number Six”. But topping all this, for Williams-Ellis himself, was the visit of Frank Lloyd Wright, who declared its creator a true architect.The village today is exactly as I remember it, with the delicious addition of an Italian gelateria Catriona thought that it was like a more upmarket and colourful Center Parcs, set by the waves rather than among trees. We ate focaccia laced with Anglesey salt and feasted on the tenderest assiette of Welsh lamb with shallots and turnips in the opulent dining room of the main hotel, beside a bank of windows overlooking the estuary, before wandering up the hill to our room in Castell Deudraeth, neglected during my childhood but now reinvented as a cooler and more laid-back version of its big sister by the shore.Day trippers are welcome at Portmeirion, but part of the enchantment if you’re staying is to see the village empty of visitors, either at first light or when it’s floodlit. By day we headed off to explore north Wales beyond Portmeirion: and first stop was the station at Porthmadog, meeting point of two narrow-gauge heritage railways, the Ffestiniog and the Welsh Highland lines. We opted for the latter, and as we chugged through the countryside wrapped in billowing steam I was transported back 40 years. “This is exactly how it was when I was young,” I told Catriona and to my surprise (because this was not the sunniest moment of our trip) she said she was loving it too. By this time she had discovered that Snowdonia has the fastest zip wire in the world, and was begging me to book our next holiday here as we couldn’t fit it in on this visit. First, though, there was Beddgelert to explore, eight miles and 40 minutes down the line from Porthmadog: it’s a picture postcard village named after the grave of a dog called Gelert, hound of one Prince Llewelyn who, the story goes, killed it after mistakenly blaming it for mauling his son. In fact, the dog had fought off a wolf trying to do just that when the stricken Llewelyn realised his mistake he rushed back to his faithful friend, who gamely licked his hand with its final breath. A brilliant story, agreed Catriona with tears in her eyes, even if it’s more likely to be folklore than truth.Our final stop was Criccieth, where we wandered along the beach at dusk, enjoying the views of the 13th-century castle that sits on a hillside high above it. Lloyd George, though born in Manchester, is the local hero, as he spent his childhood from 1864 to 1880 in a house that’s now a museum: you can see the future prime minister’s school desk, and the workshop where his uncle made shoes.Criccieth has the feel of a fairly traditional Welsh seaside town, but its dining scene is pukka 21st century since the reopening of a sweeping art-deco-style glass-fronted building designed by Williams-Ellis and used in the 1950s for tea dances. Today, we’re eating at Dylan’s, one of a trio of seaside restaurants specialising in local food and a neighbourly conscience: there’s a sign advertising the next beach clean-up at the gate, recycled plastic bottles have been turned into a stunning fish mosaic above the entrance, and the menu features mussels from the Menai Strait and lobster from Morfa Nefyn across the peninsula. And while the food might be local, the vibe is unashamedly big city hustle and bustle – a perfect combination, as far as my teenage daughter was concerned.For inspiration to plan your break in Wales check out visitwales"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1ad5a896eb4935a5b666ccdff67338c37e6b85fd/0_109_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=686073bd5b0c4a376e790b918d857a2f","title":"visit wales 12 of the best welsh beaches","story":"The coastline of Wales is dotted with more than 100 beaches, many of them award-winning.

It is really sad to think that in 10 years it could be much smaller.”The government has guaranteed all research cash awarded in the current €70bn (£62bn) European research programme, Horizon 2020, which funds cutting-edge science. But researchers have no idea what to expect beyond 2020.When Britain leaves the EU it could pay to be an associate member of the next European research programme, Horizon Europe, which is expected to distribute another €100bn to researchers over seven years. But many academics warn that a hard Brexit, or what one vice-chancellor describes as “a cataclysmic no-deal”, would wrench apart research collaborations with Europe, and UK disciplines could be left with huge holes in funding.“A lot of academics feel we should have done more to fight this,” says Gosden. “But when you don’t know what’s going on, it’s hard to oppose. We are shuffling around in a fog.”Gosden’s institute has been awarded 10 major European Research Council grants since 2007, awards prized by academics for their international prestige as well as their monetary value. They allow his researchers to work on a scale that would not be possible otherwise, he says.He adds that big collaborative research projects take up to two years to plan, and British academics already need to be thinking beyond 2020. “We are all desperately hoping it will sort out, but we haven’t got a plan B,” he says.Simon Marginson, professor of higher education at Oxford, who is researching the impact of Brexit on universities, thinks the outlook for research is gloomy. “In my judgment we are likely to have a hard Brexit, or at best an unresolved research funding picture. In terms of people in research and higher education, the fallout will be massive.”He says that stepping up research partnerships outside the EU is not a solution. “In research funding, other countries naturally give priority to their own citizens or residents. That is why the EU research programmes are so valuable. They make decisions on merit across a large number of countries, dramatically widening the potential pool of talent and ideas, and they encourage collaboration.”Behind the scenes, vice-chancellors are racing to find ways to safeguard European research collaborations. Prof Colin Riordan, of Cardiff University, a member of the prestigious Russell Group, says: “We are doing detailed planning for a no-deal Brexit. It is a massive headache and a huge ersion of time and effort.”“The bottom line is that we want to continue taking part in European research,” Riordan says. “We are exploring lots of back-up options to maintain our collaborations with European universities, through things like joint contracts and honorary professorships.”However, Gosden points out that life split between two countries may not appeal to many. “To be eligible to apply for funding you have to spend considerable time in the other country. I wouldn’t have wanted to go abroad for three months at a time when I had young kids.”Lee Cronin, regius professor of chemistry and one of the research stars at Glasgow University, says Brexit is driving him “insane”, because it is impossible to plan future research.If Brexit ruins research, he won’t stay. “Although I’m British, if I can’t run a world-leading team of researchers here I’m not going to let the skills, knowledge and momentum we’ve built die because of a hard Brexit. Many of us will be forced to move our research abroad or seek joint affiliations in the EU.”Cronin is frustrated that discussions about the potential impact of Brexit on science are being “drowned out” by other concerns. “The simple fact is that without alignment, UK science crashes out of the biggest collaborative network ever built in the history of humanity,” he says.He has a team of 57 researchers: 20 are Europeans and 19 are from the rest of the world. He is furious about Theresa May’s recent pledge to reduce migration by giving priority to migrants, including those from the EU, earning more than £50,000. “Many of the researchers in our team earn less than £50,000, but skills-wise they are worth their weight in gold. So I’ve got a politically mandated brain drain since we would not be allowed to hire people below this level,” he says.Johannes Angermuller, professor of discourse at Warwick University, says remaining part of the European research programme is about wanting to collaborate with the best people, as much as it is about money. “The prospect of being confined to an island is not appealing to any researcher,” he says.But the head of one university, who wishes to remain anonymous, is cautiously optimistic. “Everyone you speak to in Europe admits that to have an EU research space without the UK would be a lose-lose scenario. They say if we ally with countries like Israel for research, why wouldn’t we ally with Britain?”The vice-chancellor says that with a soft Brexit deal Britain should easily negotiate an “associated country” status on the next European research round. “But a cataclysmic no deal would, of course, put all of that at risk.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6cca6d435bc0d58b523dda01ae9280323ef6a711/0_278_4803_2882/master/4803.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64c6e7984d4658412c7d2a80225eceb9","title":"principal closes college staff students march westminster","story":"Protesters to join colleges from around UK to highlight discriminatory funding of further educationIn his tailored navy suit and tortoiseshell spectacles, Gerry McDonald looks an unlikely rebel. Yet on Wednesday this well-mannered college principal will make history when he shuts the college doors and heads for Westminster.He is urging staff and as many of the 25,000 students as possible to accompany him on a march from Pall Mall to Westminster to mark Colleges Week, a campaign organised by the Association of Colleges to raise the profile of further education (FE) and persuade the government to redress eight years of underfunding.It’s the first time a college has closed to allow staff to demonstrate but McDonald, principal of New City College in London, says FE has to make itself heard. “We have got to the position where it is no longer tenable to go on having polite conversations with officials from the Treasury that lead nowhere. So now we want to make a bit of a noise,” he says.The college is made up of four merged institutions in Tower Hamlets, Hackney, Epping and Redbridge and all will close on Wednesday 17 October. “The nurseries will remain open for those who need childcare and our staff will make sure that students catch up with work they missed,” says McDonald.“Teachers here are enthusiastic and we can send hundreds down to rally and say: ‘Look, this is time for FE now. If you want to skills-proof the UK post-Brexit you are going to need us.’ We have done everything we can to make the books balance but we can’t go on merging and cutting costs for ever.”In real terms, sixth-form colleges received £1,380 a year less per student in 2016-17 than in 2010-11, according to their association.Staff recruitment and retention is at crisis point in many parts of the country. The average salary of FE teachers in London is £5,000 less than that of schoolteachers, and outside the capital it rises to a deficit of £7,000 a year. Yet most FE lecturers have to be doubly qualified – in their own trades or professions and as teachers.McDonald has been in further education for 25 years and a principal for five. The value of FE to social cohesion, employers, the government’s skills agenda and to local communities is so clear to him that the only reason he can think for the lack of investment is prejudice and elitism in Whitehall.He believes officials in the Treasury are prejudiced against FE because they don’t understand it. “Many officials in Whitehall have gone straight from school to university. They look you straight in the eye and say: ‘Tell me, what exactly is it that you do here?’”.Even the government’s skills minister, Anne Milton, has appealed for support. At a fringe event at the Conservative party conference in Birmingham this month she urged teaching unions to talk up the importance of FE to give her “the tools to go into battle with the Treasury”. Staff from other colleges will also join tomorrow’s march, including Jo Maher, the principal of Boston College in Lincolnshire. “This is the eighth year in a row without a real-terms funding increase, while all our costs are rising. We need people with skills and they are extremely hard to recruit on the money we can afford, particularly engineers and electrical installers,” she says.Elly Tobin, the principal of Joseph Chamberlain sixth-form college in Birmingham, says enrichment is suffering. “Ninety six per cent of our students are from ethnic minorities and we want to build up their social and cultural capital and give them opportunities for work experience and visits to employers. However, we can’t afford the transport.”A Department for Education spokesman said: “Our FE colleges do a brilliant job and we would like to thank them. Base rate funding for 16-18-year-olds has been protected until 2020.” An extra £500m a year plus £38m for equipment was being provided for the development of T-levels, the new technical A-levels. “We will continue to look carefully at funding for the sector in preparation for the next spending review,” he added.New City College’s students gained these qualifications in the year 2017-18:English for speakers of other languages 4,753Higher education qualifications 1,475 Access to higher education 132"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab677f396ea3a2afe11009f1e2844bc7c33751c3/0_2_4743_2845/master/4743.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a56e9d88beebca910d8f488a31cb0a9b","title":"shift over jeremy corbyn let angela rayner do her job labour","story":"The Labour leadership is stifling its increasingly popular education spokeswomanLabour should be unbelievably popular with teachers right now. School budgets are shot, which led to an unprecedented protest by headteachers. Teacher retention is at a record low and the government has missed all recruitment targets for five years. Secondary school places are in short supply. And yet, in a recent survey of more than 2,500 teachers, fewer than half said they would vote Labour if an election were called tomorrow.So, what is Labour’s problem? The so-called National Education Service is the linchpin of the party’s planned fightback – but no one knows what it means. In part, that’s because Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, isn’t being allowed to develop it properly.Over the summer she ran a series of public meetings to work out the details of the policy. Everywhere she went, Corbyn would turn up – shaking hands, kissing babies. It’s hard for Rayner to run a serious policy forum when participants are queuing up for selfies with Corbyn. To some of us, it looked like a panicked leader worried by the growing popularity of a junior.On top of this, Rayner has other issues to contend with: John McDonnell promising bizarre things, such as refusing to pay the private companies who run some school buildings (good luck with the legals on that) the financial burden of Corbyn’s promise to make university free (seen by many as an enormous transfer of wealth to the middle class). And a continued hokey cokey over academies: are they coming back into local council control or staying out? No one knows.Teachers are battle weary and their appetite for more big reform is low. If the Conservatives were to lift austerity as promised and put a cash boost into schools, while promising to change little else, this could seem appealing. May’s team has also pulled back on free schools and put aside money for mental health programmes. Teachers may not like what they are getting with the Conservatives, but at least they more or less know what it is.The education secretary, Damian Hinds, is leaning into the situation. Last week he attacked Corbyn’s “control freakery” and said giving schools back to councils would mean putting politicians in charge, rather than headteachers. It’s not a fair statement, but in a world where people are fed up with politicians, it’s a canny one.Relying on the Conservatives to make the same mistakes as in the last election would be a fool’s errand. Money will be conjured up just in time for voting grammar schools will be hidden in a weasel-worded policy about “allowing selective schools to expand”.Labour needs to get wise. If there is a general election in the offing it will be hard to go to the polls offering unrealistic sums of cash for an amorphous set of revolutionary-sounding ideas. Teachers are too tired. Parents will find it confusing.The National Education Service needs to be as simple as possible: free childcare, a good quality school place for every child, subsidised university and workplace learning for all. Simple to understand, if horribly complex to deliver. But that’s grown-up politics for you.In the end, teachers and parents of school-aged children are a huge political opportunity. There are 12 million of them. If Labour can win their support, the party has decent prospects in a future election. As it stands, votes are going spare and the Conservatives are on a hunt to catch them.Rayner has the right instincts to fight Hinds, but Corbyn needs to stand back and let her fly. A future election may depend on it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f8e23fdb87c7eb3690a79058df9067838fbcfff/0_0_2548_1529/master/2548.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e52218a74041c5044cbf268cd11c5f76","title":"a star is reborn what we can learn from actor turned director debuts","story":"As Bradley Cooper and Jonah Hill step behind the camera for A Star is Born and Mid90s, how do their films benefit from their A-list status?A critic will often watch a director’s first film with one eye on what is and one on what might be. For novice feature film-makers, a debut doubles as a diagnostic, an opportunity to show potential as much as present skill. Because first-timers often have to work within constricting parameters – a finite budget, a caliber of actors commensurate with that budget, limited access to the resources of a studio – viewers will give a little leeway in the understanding that they’re watching the film the director was able to make until he or she gets the green light to make the film they truly want to.Such is not the case with a pair of new releases from untested talents in theaters this month. Bradley Cooper and Jonah Hill have both made new forays into feature directing with the latest remake of A Star Is Born and the coming-of-age drama Mid90s, respectively, and their celebrity affords them luxuries unavailable to most film-makers starting out. While shooting, Cooper leveraged his profile and connections to sneak onstage at the Coachella and Glastonbury music festivals, infiltrate the Grammys, and poke around Saturday Night Live’s studio with “guest host” Alec Baldwin. Hill licensed a treasure trove of music that can’t have come cheap, from Herbie Hancock’s funk standard Watermelon Man to the Pixies’ alt-classic Wave of Mutilation to the Smiths cut pre-approved by his pal Morrissey. In either case, the production was the realization of a dream long held by its creator, a true passion project straight out of the gate.It’s a curious phenomenon, when resources and permissions usually reserved for seasoned pros are afforded to artists at the novice level. (Both Hill and Cooper give the Steadicam a workout, but don’t quite know where to take it.) The resultant odd pairing of highly professional polish with developing ability is just one of the qualities of the beginner actor-director, a specific breed of cineaste with a consistent set of virtues of weaknesses. A handful of recent efforts have brought the type into sharper relief, and started to chip away at – though by no means completely overwriting – the image of the preening thespian who utters those dreaded words: “But what I really want to do is direct.”The public presumes a certain measure of vanity when an actor gets behind the camera, a belief proven wrong as frequently as it’s proven right. In some instances, the whiff of ego isn’t quite so faint Ewan McGregor must have been feeling pretty good when he offered to not only dip his toe into film-making with an adaptation of heavy literary hitter Philip Roth, but to assay a neurotic Jewish businessman as a born-and-bred Scotsman. After years of salty-mouthed comedy, Hill is on a crusade to be taken seriously, donning the artiste’s de facto uniform of blocky glasses and all-black ensemble. Many critics scoffed at Cooper’s decision to cast himself as a rock star who romances a girl played by world’s second-biggest pop star because the biggest pop star was busy.It’s not for nothing that the long take, a medium-to-close shot holding on a performer’s face and letting them do their stuff, is the favored implement in any multi-hyphenate’s toolbox. From Hill and Cooper to the more accomplished ranks of Paul Dano (who shows tremendous promise with this year’s Wildlife) and Angelina Jolie, actors place a lot of trust in actors, sometimes to a fault. Not everyone has the chops to hold their own while delivering a monologue without anyone or any edits to hide behind, but the actor-director’s code states that everyone at least deserves a chance to try. Cooper and Hill care about their characters more than any audience could possibly hope to, and the open-hearted empathy can be a wonder all its own.What these films sometimes lack in technical proficiency, they attempt to make up in passion, the result being occasionally amateurish work with a titanic emotional scale and the industry firepower to back it up. Like actors themselves, they want nothing more than to be loved."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4189d8435a2650bd45dc62ec9f3ee3af7271d060/0_28_4049_2430/master/4049.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9b7ef45c47554f29009bc6b855b94f1","title":"glasgow city champions league barcelona scotland","story":"The Scottish champions face a grandstand finish to their domestic season but first visit Spain in search of a last-16 shockThis is a season-defining week for the Scottish champions, Glasgow City. A 2-1 defeat by their title rivals, Hibernian, in the Scottish Women’s Cup semi-final was not the ideal start to the crunch period, which reaches its climax on Sunday with the two teams – separated by two goals only – meeting in their penultimate league outing. Hibs have won their last five knockout games against City but have not beaten them in the league for a staggering 11 years.Now, the amateur side head to Spain for a David v Goliath style match-up with star-studded Barcelona. It is hard to overstate the task at hand and the delicate decisions their manager, Scott Booth, has to make. With a packed fixture schedule, the former Aberdeen player’s squad is being stretched.At the extreme end the 16-year-old school student and central defender Carly Girasoli has played nine games in 28 days, including three times for Scotland’s under-19 side in their successful European Championship qualifying campaign. These are not full-time players pulling their socks up three times a week – they are, on the whole, students and workers juggling a professional level schedule with their careers.The likely title-deciding clash between two unbeaten sides at the top of the Scottish Women’s Premier League has to be the priority but, if they cause an upset against Barcelona, they will at the very least match their best run in the Champions League, when they reached the quarter-finals in 2014-15.The 12-time Scottish champions have not had an easy route to the last 16. City finished level on points with Anderlecht and the Polish club Gornik Leczna in qualifying Group 3, topping the group on head-to-head results. In the round of 32 they won 2-0 away to Cyprus’s confusingly named Barcelona FA after goals from the winger Hayley Lauder and the midfielder Leanne Crichton, before a nervy 1-0 home defeat ensured their passage to the last 16.Barcelona and Glasgow City are worlds apart. While the Liga Iberdrola runners-up have seen revitalised support from their parent club in recent years, their Scottish opponents are one of the few clubs still an independent entity.Having played football at university, Laura Montgomery linked up with her friend Carol Anne Stewart in 1998 to co-found the side for which she would go on to appear over 250 times. Stewart remains chairperson of the club.City have had unprecedented domestic success, with 27 trophies in a 20-year history, but they battle a problem faced by all Scottish sides – that of retaining players in an amateur league with European giants, not least those south of the border, eyeing their top talent. The Scots Lisa Evans and Emma Mitchell, starters in Arsenal’s 5-0 demolition of the Women’s Super League champions, Chelsea, on Sunday, both began their careers with the Scottish champions, as did the Chelsea defender Erin Cuthbert and the West Ham forward Jane Ross.It means their side struggles for balance, with players poached when they are showing signs of promise, leaving the club with youngsters looking to make a breakthrough or players joining towards the end of their careers. Seven of the 20-player Champions League squad are teenagers while five are between 27 and 37.While Glasgow head to Catalonia with heads bowed after their cup defeat Barcelona have scored 21 goals in their last four games, most recently a 9-1 hammering of Rayo Vallecano in which Alexia Putellas scored four. They have four league wins in four and sit behind the champions Atlético, who have five wins from five. With the Netherlands’ Euro 2017 star Lieke Martens, England’s Toni Duggan and Brazilian Andressa Alves – three of the club’s top scorers last season – among their recent recruits, the club were more conservative in the summer of 2018, instead promoting from the B team and signing a few more muted names from Europe.Having finished one point behind Atleti, Barcelona are craving a first league title in four years but on top of that they want to make their mark on the continent and are likely to treat the underdogs Glasgow with the seriousness this stage of the competition merits.An away goal, a clean sheet, a narrow defeat or – dare they dream – a win to take back to Petershill Park and keep the tie competitive would give the Glasgow side huge momentum heading into their crunch league match with Hibs.Elsewhere Chelsea will be hoping to recover from their bruising defeat by Arsenal when they host the Italian side Fiorentina while the current Champions League holders Lyon travel to Ajax. PSG visit the Swedish side Linköping FC, who are to miss out on Champions League football next year after a 1-0 defeat by Eskilstuna United ruled out any hopes the reigning domestic champions might have had of a top-two finish.The Norwegian champions, LSK Kvinner, host Denmark’s Brøndby, Atlético Madrid – who knocked out Chelsea in the last 32 – face the 2018 runners up, Wolfsburg, and Zurich welcome Bayern Munich. On Thursday Rosengård – currently second in the Damallsvenskan – play the Czech side Slavia Praha.• The US and Canada confirmed their places at the Women’s World Cup in France by winning their Concacaf Championship semi-finals. A 6-0 win against Jamaica confirmed the US’s berth, with two goals each from Tobin Heath and Alex Morgan added to by Julie Ertz and Megan Rapinoe. Meanwhile Christine Sinclair scored in Canada’s 7-0 defeat of Panama to edge within eight goals of Abby Wambach’s all-time international record of 185 goals. Panama will now play Jamaica in the third place play-off with the winner also going to France, while the loser will play Argentina for the region’s final qualification spot.• The Netherlands, Euro 2017 winners, face Switzerland in a play-off final for a place at the Women’s World Cup next summer. The Dutch defeated Denmark while Switzerland saw off Belgium to set up the showdown. The first leg is on 9 November at Stadion Galgenwaard in Utrecht."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac569168c07d2c5c34d5671c2839a984167d824c/396_27_2236_1344/master/2236.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6376cff19a100b2a5f8e3d72fdbe14c4","title":"neon corporate dystopias why does cyberpunk refuse move on","story":"Repeatedly reproduced and reimagined since the 80s, the tropes of cyberpunk must evolve or dieThe future has looked the same for almost four decades. A skyline of densely packed skyscrapers, corporate logos lighting the night sky, proclaiming ownership over the city below. At street level, a haze of neon shines down from the cluster of signs above and shimmers at your feet in the rain that runs down the filthy streets. Here, the have-nots, excluded from the safe, luxurious enclaves enjoyed by the super-rich, are preyed upon by hustlers dealing in illegal tech and street gangs composed of green-haired, leather-clad technopunks, decked out with cyborg enhancements and high on synthetic drugs.You know this city. You’ve seen it a million times since it was first constructed in the 80s by the pioneers of cyberpunk, most notably William Gibson in Neuromancer and Ridley Scott in Blade Runner. Hollywood recently returned to it with Blade Runner 2049. In the first episode of Netflix’s Altered Carbon, an adaptation of Richard K. Morgan’s 2002 novel, protagonist Takeshi Kovacs gazes upon it from his window fire flickers from the top of a tall tower, just as it did in opening scene of Blade Runner, prompting a double-take where you wonder whether the window is actually a screen replaying Scott’s movie.Cyberpunk 2077, an upcoming video game based on the tabletop game Cyberpunk 2020, revisits it in its trailer, where dilapidated high-rise tower blocks are juxtaposed with flying cars orbiting the decadent securitised spaces of the ultra-rich. And, of course, the neon.These examples not only serve as evidence of the genre’s endurance, but of how remarkably static its vision of the future has remained. Why is it that cyberpunk still looks like it did in the 80s? Perhaps there has been no need for it to change: it continues to resonate with us because the world it depicts is the one we live in. The genre was formed as a response to a world where corporate power was proliferating and expanding across the globe, inequality was growing, and AI, computers, and other new forms of technology offered both the promise of liberation and the potential for new and dangerous forms of domination.“Cyberpunk offers a vision of a post-national, globalised society where those who know how to manipulate information will come out on top, a vision of the world very recognisable to us today,” says Dr Anna McFarlane, a cyberpunk scholar at the University of Glasgow. In 2018, state governments grovel at the feet of Amazon for the privilege of hosting their second headquarters, an echo of a world sketched out by Neal Stephenson in Snow Crash. Facebook has the power to spread election-turning fake news, realising anxieties expressed in the likes of Pat Cadigan’s novel Synners, where dreams shared on the net have lethal consequences in reality. Google creates AI technology for the Pentagon, just as the fictional Neutron Corporation created the AI dubbed “The Puppet Master” for its government client in 1995’s Ghost in the Shell. And all three exploit their status as trans-national global entities to horde billions through tax loopholes, like Neuromancer’s Tessier-Ashpool corporation, so powerful that it literally looks down upon the earth from its orbiting space station.The metaphors cyberpunk employed to explore our increasingly intimate relationship with technology, meanwhile, are as apt as ever. Our smartphones function as pseudo-cybernetic attachments, as artificial memory, GPS system, and dopamine deliverer. “Cyberpunk is a genre that said new technologies will colonise our bodies and interpenetrate our lives, like Molly in Neuromancer with her sunglasses literally inset into her face,” says Adam Roberts, science fiction writer and professor at Royal Holloway. “The reality is that technology has colonised not so much our bodies as our social interactions, with Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and so on – with far-reaching consequences.”This realisation of the once-fictional realm of cyberspace has been both a blessing and a curse, just as cyberpunk predicted. It has provided an architecture for liberation, supporting grassroots movements and campaigns that include the Arab Spring, the #metoo movement and the election of the status-quo challenging Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. It has also proved to be a tool of domination, a means to harvest our data and manipulate, surveil and profit from us.Cyberpunk brings into focus the injustice of our system, and reminds us that the dystopia we’ve been facing for decades will become ever more concrete if we do not direct our anger to confront it. More than that, it can offer us hope. Even in these worlds of corporate domination, defiance rises out of destitution to twist the tools of power in unexpected ways. (“The street finds its own uses for things,” as Gibson wrote in Burning Chrome.) In cyberpunk fiction, inidual acts of rebellion from the disenfranchised rarely coalesce into organised resistance Case gets rich in Neuromancer, and Major Kusanagi reclaims ownership of herself from the military-industrial complex in Ghost in the Shell. But at least they start to pry open the cracks.Nobody has yet imagined a way out of the typical cyberpunk dystopia, however, which is surely a symptom of a creative block. It is no coincidence that cyberpunk came of age in the era where capitalism was moving towards global dominance, culminating in its symbolic triumph at the fall of the Berlin Wall. Competing concepts were delegitimised by the Thatcher-Reagan axis, and neoliberalism became a consensus that successfully foreclosed the imagining of alternatives. This political event horizon was also a death for utopian sci-fi. We internalised the idea that the system we live in is an inevitability and with that, our imaginations stalled, unable to conceive of a future that moves beyond it – like we’re stuck on a loop in one of those computer simulations the genre loves so much.As a result, cyberpunk is being stripped of any political power it once had. In its formation, the genre was at least intended to portray rampant corporate power and social inequality as vulgar and dangerous (though, admittedly, there was also a countervailing tendency to romanticise it). It would be unfair to judge Cyberpunk 2077 before the game is out, but its trailer exemplifies this loss. Hacking: check. Cybernetic enhancements: check. Street crime: check. Punk fashion: check. Urban sprawl: check. These are all just cool cyberpunk symbols, rather than allegorical systems that need to be challengedThis is also how the features of cyberpunk manifest in Altered Carbon. Familiar themes are there, but they don’t parse as important. The idea of the rich being able to buy de facto immortality by reinserting their consciousness into new bodies is a useful premise for a locked-room detective mystery, rather than a lever for thinking about inequality. Subjects such ascorporate power and urban destitution become equivalent to neon lights or hair dye.“Ironically, the fate of cyberpunk in our current media culture shows us the ways in which the genre’s original pessimistic predictions have come true,” says Christopher Bolton, professor of comparative and Japanese literature at Williams College, on “the copycat cyberpunk” we see today. “We are living in a future where the original, the physical, and the political are increasingly eclipsed, replaced by virtual, mediated realities in which things are copied and re-copied in an endless distorting chain.”To combat this stasis, cyberpunk has to reconnect with sci-fi’s utopian tradition. It has the tools to do so. Its artificial bodies and uploaded consciousness can work to challenge conceptions around race, sexuality and gender Samuel Delany’s proto-cyberpunk novel Babel-17 features polyamorous bisexual relationships and extreme body modification. The rebellious underdog punk is a compelling figure, but these characters have tended towards nihilism, kicking back against corporate power to get revenge or get rich, mirroring the inidualist ideology of the system they supposedly reject. Why not take inspiration from emergent grassroots union movements led by cleaners and food delivery workers instead? Ursula Le Guin offered us a provocative vision of the anarchist planet of Annares in The Dispossessed we need underdogs with a collective goal, provoking us to think about how we might build new networks of power that oppose corporate totality.It is alarming that we are starting to accept the dystopian features of cyberpunk as an inevitable part of our future. The neoliberal milieu, the crucible in which cyberpunk was formed, is crumbling. Cyberpunk’s stasis leaves little room to map the emerging nationalisms, fascisms, political populisms and revitalised leftist movements seeking to challenge political and economic orthodoxy. New potential futures are finally emerging. It may be time for cyberpunk to evolve or die."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81a3490035318cff53ca1f49745c3da8f9b8133c/0_113_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46859099051f30e4b44ee7b9d04dd988","title":"ecuador embassy tells assange clean bathroom feed the cat do laundry","story":"WikiLeaks founder told by Ecuadorian embassy to respect rules or lose diplomatic asylum Ecuador has laid out a stringent new set of house rules for Julian Assange, warning the whistleblower to avoid online comments about political issues – and ordering him to clean his bathroom and take better care of his cat, or risk losing his pet.Assange, who has been living in Ecuador’s UK embassy since June 2012, must obtain approval for all visitors from diplomatic staff three days in advance. He is expressly banned from activities which could be “considered as political or interfering with the internal affairs of other states,” according to the memo seen by the .Julian Assange has been in the Ecuadorian embassy in central London since June 2012. He initially sought asylum following a series of legal challenges through British courts to a European arrest warrant issued by Sweden, where he was accused of rape and sexual assault, which he denies.In February, a judge upheld a warrant for his arrest for skipping bail, meaning that although Swedish prosecutors have\u0026nbspdropped their investigation into alleged sexual offences, Assange faces being arrested if he leaves the embassy, and fears he would be subsequently extradited to the US for questioning about WikiLeaks’ activities.The Ecuadorian government partially lifted restrictions Assange’s internet access at the weekend, but the document stipulates that the WikiLeaks founder will only be allowed to use the embassy wifi for his personal computer and phone.The Australian and his guests are explicitly prohibited from using or installing “unauthorised equipment”.According to the memo, the embassy “reserved the right to authorise security personnel to seize equipment” or ask the British authorities to enter the embassy and do so. Any attempt to bring such equipment into the embassy would be reported as a “security breach and reported to the competent British authorities.”Ecuador’s government suspended Assange’s internet access in March, saying that he had breached “a written commitment made to the government at the end of 2017 not to issue messages that might interfere with other states”.However, Assange had previously operated freely within the embassy – even compromising its communications system, the  detailed in a series of reports in May.Assange was told to take charge of the “well-being, food, hygiene and proper care” of his pet cat, in the memo written in Spanish and first published on the Ecuadorian Código Vidrio website.It warned that if the WikiLeaks founder did not take care of the pet, it would be given to someone else or handed in to an animal refuge.“It’s virtually a prison regime,” Carlos Poveda, Assange’s lawyer in Quito told the . “This new regime goes against his basic human dignity as an asylee,” he said. Poveda added that as of Monday Assange had not had his internet restored and had not been able to read and understand the memo as it had not been translated from Spanish.The memo implored Assange and his guests to keep the bathroom clean and stated the diplomatic mission would not pay towards his food, laundry or any other costs related to his stay from 1 December 2018 onwards. Assange must also have quarterly medical check-ups that he must pay for too, it stated.Any failure to comply with the news house rules “could lead to the termination of the diplomatic asylum granted by the Ecuadorian state,” it added."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf9dede4db77e47bbbb9ec13efecd7bcc117ad72/0_66_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea53516460c551e15b183bb60001d7be","title":"norwegian airlines extraordinary circumstance claim","story":"It tried to avoid a payout by claiming a punctured tyre was an ‘extraordinary circumstances’I am a member of the Facebook page “Norwegian Airlines Experiences from Hell” citing numerous nightmares people have endured. Our original flight to Gatwick was due to depart Fort Lauderdale at 22.00 on 16 February. As the plane was pushed off from the gantry we were told that it ran over debris, which punctured the tyres. We disembarked and queued for several hours for information and accommodation, eventually giving up and taking a taxi back to our old hotel in Miami.At 5am the next day we got a text message confirming the cancellation of the flight due to “technical issues” with a replacement flight number. However, the departure time of this changed several times – sent via successive text messages – while we were unable to get through on the helpline. We contacted the airline in March listing our extra expenses and claiming compensation. But the company insisted the disruption was caused by “extraordinary circumstances” which could not have been avoided. Eventually, it reimbursed our food and taxi expenses but refused compensation. The EU regulation EC2612004 is the bugbear of the airline industry. It sets out compensation levels payable if a flight to or from an EU country is delayed by more than three hours and, given that it entitles passengers to claim up to €600 (£526) each, airlines will typically do all in their power to duck their responsibilities. They can legally refuse to pay if the delay was caused by an “extraordinary circumstance” beyond their control.Norwegian still supports its original decision. It says: “We sincerely apologise for any inconvenience caused by the cancellation and subsequent delay of their flight which was due to extraordinary circumstances beyond our control ... in this instance, the claim was not applicable. However, we have reimbursed the additional expenses the customer incurred.” We’ll be adding this to our growing list of questionable excuses.We welcome letters but cannot answer inidually.

Marshall first heard the song in an ex-boyfriend’s car, but it was a few years later when she became attached to it – once performing it 16 times during a karaoke session.Cat Power is far from the first to pay homage to the woman responsible for one of the best pop songs ever (that would be Umbrella), with Stay being one of the most popular choices.Here’s a run down of the best, quirkiest and most unexpected Rihanna covers, in ascending order of greatness.OK, so this isn’t a real cover – it was part of Grande’s superb impressions skit when she hosted SNL. But I am including it because it still makes me laugh. Incidentally, this whole segment proves how talented Grande is, both in singing and comedy. Prepare to be amazed at her Shakira impression in particular. Watch the whole thing here.Yes, this does sound like Zola Jesus just going off on one with a drum machine in her bedroom but somehow it works. The vibe is very much: Let’s have fun with this and bang it up on SoundCloud. Jesus almost bellows the chorus like she’s trashed, but that – and the almost cartoon reverb at the end – comes off as kind of endearing, rather than awful.If you’re going to cover a Rihanna song, then picking the one with Paul McCartney and Kanye West is a ballsy move. But that’s the one One Direction plumped for. Debatable whether Louis should have had his mic switched on, but ’twas ever thus.After professing their love for Beyoncé (“How can you not like Beyoncé?”), Metallica prove themselves Rihanna fans. “We played a show with her … She was awesome. A lot of energy, great band”, says Lars Ulrich, before the band sing along to Diamonds during a segment of Apple’s Carpool Karaoke.Jared Leto often sounds as if he’s singing through congested sinuses, but here there is enough of a Pixies edge to his vocals to make it work. It’s the rendition that your high-school boyfriend would play, pulling up on a motorcycle with a ghetto blaster secured to the back, before removing his Aviators, kissing you and breaking your heart six months down the line.The Swedish singer absolutely smashes a rendition of the doo-wop-inspired Love on the Brain during a session on the BBC’s Live Lounge. Apart from the final note, but let’s not dwell too much on that when the rest of it work, work, work, work, work works.Can’t say SOS is the best Rihanna cut (my favourite thing about it is that it knocked Daniel Powter’s Bad Day off the top of the charts), but Alex Turner and Miles Kane transformed it into three minutes of unhinged, vampiric synth-saturation during a Radio 1 Live Lounge outing. The Tainted Love sample here is in the vein of the Marilyn Manson version rather than Soft Cell’s original. As with all the best cross-gender covers, the lyrics aren’t changed.Crowds at SXSW in 2016 got treated to a sexy version of Kiss It Better by Miguel. They did have to help out a lot, directed in a call-and-response chorus. It wasn’t great that Miguel got out his phone in the middle of it and started recording himself. But, hey, it’s Instagram’s world now, and we’re all just living in it.Man Down is a reggae song from the album Loud, with a protagonist who shoots, well, a man down (“in Central Station  In front of a big ol’ crowd”). Lewis reworked her hit Better in Time with ragga elements before slipping into a rendition of Man Down on a number of live session performances around 2011, and it hits the spot.Technically this is a DJ Khaled featuring Rihanna song, but I’m including it. Following the blueprint of his solo debut album, Styles changes Wild Thoughts into a 70s prog-rockish number. Disappointingly, he does not attempt the rap.I should start by saying nothing can top the original. But Coldplay go full Coldplay here, and, though Chris Martin is unsuited to the vocal, the piano intermissions add a different mood. A box drum is involved and it’s a shambles, but a cute one. It also very much sounds as if they listened back to this and then wrote Sky Full of Stars.There’s a very simple reason Sia does such a great job on Diamonds, and that’s because she wrote the song (in just 14 minutes). There’s an acoustic version out there and an even earlier sketch, but proper, fleshed-out, choreographed performances have featured in recent shows. In many ways, I think this could have done just as well as Rihanna’s version, but it was written at a time (2012) when Sia was very firm on her wish to be out of the spotlight, and producers Benny Blanco and StarGate had been specifically tasked with creating a song for Rihanna.One of the highlights of Rihanna’s 2016 album Anti, Love on the Brain suits Clarkson’s voice – always one of the best in pop – perfectly. Even better, it seems Clarkson just knocked this out during a quiet moment in the studio.You might not ordinarily put Patti Smith and Rihanna together, but this is precisely the sort of juxtaposition that often results in the best covers. Smith’s rendition at New York’s Webster Hall works surprisingly well, her lower register adding a jagged edge to Mikky Ekko’s piano melody. Even when Smith messes up (“Oh no! I’m sorry, I’m just nervous … I was doing it so good, too!”) it only speaks to her love of the song. “Rihanna!” she shouts at the end, grinning from ear to ear, like a proper fan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0c49d054419c7139c5a287929403c4c5c54af40/0_32_2614_1568/master/2614.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8c86b84460a676b12ed9e249bf7473ab","title":"earth science in our lives photography competition winners 2018","story":"The Geological Society of London has announced the results of its 2018 Earth Science Week photography competition.

The rollout will then increase from 2020 onwards. It will be slow and measured, and we will adapt and change as we go.”Leaked documents obtained by the BBC appeared to suggest the benefit is now not expected to be fully operational until December 2023, and the government is considering spending millions more to mitigate some of the problems with the changeover.This would make the full rollout nine months later than scheduled and six years later than originally planned. Migration had initially been expected to start for small numbers of current claimants in January.Numbers were expected to significantly increase in the summer, with more than 2 million households – including about 1 million working families, as well as 750,000 disabled and ill claimants unable to work – transferred to universal credit under “managed migration” over three years.Campaigners have said there should be no mass transfer of claimants until it is clear the system can accommodate them and problems with payment delays have been fixed.Claimants will be sent a letter giving them three months to apply for universal credit before their current benefits are cancelled, which MPs and charities have warned will see many vulnerable people fall out of the benefits system.The shadow work and pensions secretary, Margaret Greenwood, said the Tories had “quietly accepted that their flagship social security programme isn’t working”.“The government must stop the rollout of universal credit immediately,” she said. “We need urgent answers from Esther McVey about what’s going on and what action the government will take to tackle the many flaws in the system.”Dame Louise Casey, the former head of the government’s troubled families team, said the “constant tinkering” with universal credit was not helping families.“My worry about more pauses is this needs to be halted and sorted out. Something also needs to be done for the thousands of people who have already transferred over to it who are now in crippling debt,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme on Tuesday.“People having to wait for five weeks, who are used to being on either weekly or fortnightly pay, just doesn’t add up, and making those people take out loans just pushes them further and further into destitution.”The documents obtained by the BBC suggested the government is drawing up plans to mitigate some of the effects of the rollout, including continuing to pay income support, employment and support allowance, and jobseeker’s allowance for two weeks after a claim for universal credit has been made. A similar policy for housing benefit was introduced in the budget last year.The Department for Work and Pensions said it could not comment on the leaked document, calling the report speculation.“We will publish full plans for the next stage of universal credit rollout, including managed migration, in due course,” a spokesman said. “Anything before that point is speculation and we do not comment on leaks.”The DWP needs to pass regulations in the autumn to implement the next phase of the managed migration to the new system, but a growing number of Conservative MPs have publicly expressed concerns."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcea54fddc362db29806267451127267b580c543/0_127_8167_4900/master/8167.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=399ff83ffcd61f37e8bff8e7ca41db77","title":"stephen hendry yips snooker interview","story":"“It was a mixture of embarrassment, anger, frustration, sadness, everything,” Stephen Hendry says as he remembers how his dominance of snooker unravelled into, in his mind, a shambling wreck of a game. When the end came, in the quarter-finals of the 2012 world championships, Hendry was so besieged by psychological demons “there was nothing positive left”.Hendry’s favourite sportsmen are Tiger Woods, Michael Schumacher, Nick Faldo and AP McCoy and he was once as imperious as they had been. He holds the record for the most world titles, with all seven being won in the 1990s, and he was world No 1 for eight successive seasons. But the great champions feel it most when vulnerability takes over.“It started about 12 years before the end,” Hendry says of his slow decline. “Of course it’s psychological and, when you strike a cue ball, you’re supposed to accelerate through the ball. But as you tighten up you end up decelerating. By 2012 my game was shot. You’re sitting on your chair watching players leagues below you play shots you can’t. That destroyed me.”In his new book, which provides graphic insight into this implosion, Hendry accepts that people compare his condition to a golfer’s ‘yips’. He scrunches up his face. “That trivialises it. I hate the word because it’s much more than that.”It resulted in humiliation for Hendry. He had to qualify for his final world championship by playing at the Institute of Sport in Sheffield instead of his beloved Crucible. “It felt degrading. That’s no disrespect to other players but I had owned the Crucible for a decade with seven wins and two finals.”Hendry ground his way through qualifying and in the first round against Stuart Bingham at the Crucible he sank a 147 maximum. Hendry had already decided to retire and become an ambassador for 8-ball pool in China. “I got to the Crucible having flown to China and back, with one day there to meet my new employers. Somehow the 147 came about. It was amazing because, of the 36 shots, only six were played properly. My game had debilitated so far it was mostly shots I wasn’t hitting properly. I’d given every shot a pint of blood to get it in the pocket. The outsider was probably saying, ‘That’s amazing.’ Inside, it felt horrible.”He beat John Higgins in the second round but, 3-0 down to Stephen Maguire in the quarters, it was over. “Clearing up in the fourth frame, I knew if I didn’t get perfectly on the blue I’d leave myself this pink. So consequently, on the brown, you’re thinking about two shots later and ‘I can’t play it.’ I was finished.”He admired the way in which Woods, at his most swaggering, rarely looked surprised or elated when winning. “I really empathise with that. When you get a trophy why go jumping and crying? Winning’s a great feeling but everything else is an anticlimax. I really had to force a smile because winning was my job.”In his book Hendry details the way in which his manager, Ian Doyle, controlled him. Doyle even made Hendry break up with his girlfriend, Mandy, because he believed the young Scot should be consumed by snooker. Later, when he had finally married Mandy, Hendry horrified Doyle by mixing with other players. But Hendry believes now that losing his Ice Man image undermined him.“Without a doubt. In the 90s I never socialised with other players. That changed. I wanted to spend more time in the players’ lounge. I became friendly with Mark Williams. There’s no doubt it affected my invincibility. Ronnie O’Sullivan is still the best player in the world on his day now and he doesn’t mix with the players. You need that coldness. But I missed out as a teenager and thought: ‘I want to enjoy being with people and going out for dinner.’ It was to my detriment as a competitive animal.”During his 26-year career Hendry straddled different eras and faced a range of compelling players from Alex Higgins to O’Sullivan. He describes how drink once ran through the game. “Jimmy White and the others would have half a lager while playing. Bill Werbeniuk had to start drinking four hours before a match. He had this condition where he either took beta blockers, which were banned, or alcohol to calm his heart rate. If he had a match at 10 in the morning, he got up at six to start drinking beer. Alex obviously liked to drink. Sometimes we practised and he used the table to hold himself up. But he still played unbelievable snooker.”Higgins was initially kind to Hendry but “it turned to resentment. He directed it at Steve Davis and then me because Alex believed he made snooker. In a way he was right. But when he wasn’t as good as us he couldn’t cope.”Hendry was still disappointed when many younger players failed to travel with him to Belfast for Higgins’s funeral in 2010. He feels even deeper affection for White, his boyhood hero, whom he beat in four of his seven world championship final victories.He smiles with nostalgia rather than in judgment. “Kenny Dalglish said: ‘Show me a good loser and I’ll show you a loser.’ Jimmy was an amazing loser. I’m sure inside he was devastated but he never showed it. If I’d had lost that final, I would be inconsolable.”Hendry was still a teenager when Davis demolished him in every frame of a six-game exhibition. “I hated it, losing to Steve night after night but I would do the same in his position. I’d be willing to kill the young upstart every night.”Davis did not compliment Hendry when the Scot finally beat him – and Hendry shared that mentality. “I’d practised with John Higgins for years and when he became world champion I couldn’t congratulate him. A normal person says: ‘Well done.’ I couldn’t. It didn’t matter if it was my best friend, my brother, I didn’t want anyone else to win. It still hurts me, watching people win at the Crucible. Steve let it go years ago. That’s why he played longer than me. He treated it as a day out. I could never do that.”Hendry and O’Sullivan have fallen out occasionally but now “we get on”. Mates is probably too strong a word because Ronnie is complex. There are times you’ll be his best friend and times he’ll virtually not say hello to you.”There is, instead, respect and rivalry. “Ronnie’s the best player I’ve ever seen and people forget I actually played him. I was obviously on my way down and he gave me some hammerings.”Hendry responds emphatically when asked what would happen if he and O’Sullivan met each other at their very peak. “I believe I would win. If we had a four-session match, where things change, I would back myself every time. I was stronger mentally. But he’s more talented than me, making shots left-handed and sinking a 147 in 4½ minutes. My fastest maximum would be over nine minutes.”Flying to China 15 times a year, to promote Chinese pool, and working as a UK snooker pundit, Hendry admits that, “compared to the 1990s life now is dull. Back then you were the world’s best player. Nothing could touch you. I’ve not got a bad life now but I have days where I think: ‘What is there to look forward to? What’s the buzz?’”He takes solace in his belief that, as arguably the greatest snooker player in history, his world championship record of victories remains safe. “I can’t see anyone beating it. O’Sullivan’s got five. He can do it if he keeps playing. But there are four others playing at that level. At his absolute best Ronnie wins. But he’s getting to that age where he’s not doing it often. He’ll talk all sorts of bullshit, saying he doesn’t care about the record. But deep down he wants to beat me while, of course, I want to hold on to the record.”Hendry sounds, briefly, like a perennial winner again. But he is too likeable now not to give in to honesty as, considering his involvement in a new senior circuit, he admits his game is still ruined. “I’ve played it a few times and in practice I’m fine because no one’s watching. But once it starts I’m totally embarrassed by my shots. It’s horrible.”The 49-year-old former world champion laughs ruefully. He then shakes his head when asked if he will ever free himself of these demons. “There’re probably people out there who think they can cure me but it’s a mental thing. At exhibitions I have a couple of drinks before I play to relax. It works sometimes but that’s not a way out.

Facebook will also reveal the number of people who saw the ad, the money spent on it and the age, location and gender of the recipients.Facebook will not, however, reveal how the advert was targeted beyond those broad demographics, meaning political advertisers can continue to target messages to specific groups in secret using keywords and interests.Any inidual or organisation running adverts with political content will be forced to register and verify their identity by 7 November, a rule Facebook intends to enforce using human and machine moderation.The transparency overhaul will also apply to political adverts on Facebook-owned Instagram and enable political rivals to see the messages their opponents are promoting, making it easier for journalists and the public to hold politicians to account.Unlike in the US, where the political transparency features were launched this year, the British iteration will not require adverts on political issues to be labelled and registered.Instead, the company is taking a narrow view, requiring registration for ads “that reference political figures, political parties, elections, legislation before Parliament and past referenda that are the subject of national debate”.This means that while adverts on topics such as Brexit will be made public in the ad archive, promotions on general topics such as immigration will not be covered.Both sides in the EU referendum spent heavily on Facebook adverts, with Vote Leave later fined for breaking electoral law by illegally coordinating spending to increase its presence on the social network.Iniduals can register as political advertisers by uploading a scan of their UK driving licence or UK or EU passport, which will grant them a 21-day temporary registration. To be cleared fully, they must wait for Facebook to post a letter to a UK postal address, in order to prove they have a physical presence in the country.“We see this as an important part of ensuring electoral integrity and helping people understand who they are engaging with,” said the Facebook executives who announced the move, Richard Allan and Rob Leathern, in a blogpost.“We recognise that this is going to be a significant change for people who use our service to publish this type of ad. While the vast majority of ads on Facebook are run by legitimate organisations, we know that there are bad actors that try to misuse our platform. By having people verify who they are, we believe it will help prevent abuse.”Controversially, Facebook will continue to include news organisations in the archive if they pay to promote stories involving political topics. The UK is only the third country in which Facebook has rolled out the features, after the US and Brazil.The government is considering whether to back calls from the Electoral Commission and legislate to require a public archive of all online political adverts.Google and Twitter have launched similar advertising transparency operations in the US. Twitter, which declined to give a timeline for when it would roll out those tools to the UK, said: “Our new Ads Transparency Centre provides users with insight and clarity into every single ad that runs on the service.”Google declined to comment, but a person familiar with the company’s plans said it was focusing on launching tools before the European parliament elections in May – with the UK excluded, as it was scheduled to have left the EU by then."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fd899c1b8b517c48a392f2ed877a9f8254a2d85d/0_284_5142_3086/master/5142.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a19f44eb8e900276b92df94fad5329a","title":"facebook political activism pages inauthentic behavior censorship","story":"The removal of hundreds of pages came as a shock to many on both the left and right, who say their work is being censoredOn Thursday, Facebook announced it had removed more than 800 political pages and accounts for “coordinated inauthentic behavior” and spamming.This week, the people behind the pages Facebook purged for being inauthentic are angry. They feel they’ve been unfairly targeted for practices they say are common across the entire social network.And those who have built their livelihoods around the power of Facebook to drive traffic to their websites are wondering what to do next.The controversy highlights the challenges Facebook and other social media sites face when attempting to police the content their members freely provide.In a related move, on Tuesday, the company announced a way for members to report inaccurate information designed to suppress voter turnout, such as providing the wrong dates or methods for voting. Facebook has been removing this form of misinformation since 2016.As a private entity, Facebook can enforce its terms however it sees fit, says the ACLU attorney Vera Eidelman. But this can have serious free speech consequences, especially if the social network is selectively enforcing its terms based on the content of the pages.“Drawing the line between ‘real’ and ‘inauthentic’ views is a difficult enterprise that could put everything from important political parody to genuine but outlandish views on the chopping block,” says Eidelman. “It could also chill iniduals who only feel safe speaking out anonymously or pseudonymously.”In a statement posted to its online newsroom, Facebook says it purged these pages because their owners were using fake accounts, sharing the same content between multiple pages, and linking to ad-supported websites it calls “ad farms”.But what the social network calls spam, the owners of these pages call standard procedures for operating on Facebook.Nearly all the page owners contacted by the  say they use “backup” or fake accounts along with their real ones. They do it in part to protect themselves from being targeted by political opponents and having their real accounts end up in “Facebook jail”, says Edward Lynn, the editor-in-chief of Reverb Press, a left-leaning news site whose Facebook page disappeared yesterday.Lynn says he discontinued the practice of allowing writers to post under pseudonyms when he became editor-in-chief earlier this year.“Lock Him Up was for people who liked funny stuff,” he says. “Proud Snowflake was for people interested in social justice issues. Angry Americans was full of economic stuff. When a post did really well on one page, and it fit the theme of one of the other pages, I’d share it across them.”Facebook removed his pages a month ago. Until yesterday’s news, he thought his banishment was an isolated case.“The problem with language like ‘inauthentic coordinated behavior’ is that everyone in this space coordinates,” says Chris Metcalf, who operated nine pages that were purged, including Reasonable People Unite, the Resistance, and Snowflakes. “We swap each other’s best-performing content. I shared content from many of the biggest, most reputable political pages, and they shared mine. But I’m not a bad actor. I’m a legitimate political activist.”Emma Llansó, the director of the Free Expression Project for the Center for Democracy and Technology, says Facebook is playing a dangerous game trying to differentiate between legitimate political dialog and spam.“I absolutely believe savvy spammers realize that polarizing political views drive a lot of traffic,” says Llansó. “But there are also a lot of people who fervently believe their political views and are trying to drive traffic to their posts and ideas. They’re probably also running ads on their sites to make money off doing so. The line between spammer activity with a financial motive and spammy-looking political advocacy is incredibly hard to draw.”For many, the most frustrating aspect of the purge has been their inability to reach someone at Facebook to make their complaints heard.Mountain, a disabled veteran, says he stood outside the company’s Menlo Park, California, headquarters for a day last month holding up a protest sign, trying to get someone to talk to him about why his pages were taken down. No one did.Brian Kolfage, another disabled veteran who administered the Right Wing News page as well as three other conservative pages that were removed, says his organization worked closely with Facebook. He shared copies of emails with a Facebook executive, in which he tried to set up a meeting to talk about how his pages could adhere to the network’s evolving policies regarding political content.The meeting was abruptly cancelled. A week later his pages were gone.“I’ve talked with Facebook maybe 50 times in the last few months,” he says. “Not once did they ever say we broke any rules or did something wrong. If they had an issue, they could have brought it up. We had a really close working relationship. That’s why this whole thing is a complete shock.”Lynn found out Reverb’s page was gone after reading about it in the Washington Post.“They know who I am, I have a profile on their services, it’s my real name,” he says. “All they needed to do was reach out. I would have taken Mark Zuckerberg’s phone call. But I guess they’ve decided that they just don’t want to.”Metcalf says he has no problem with Facebook taking down pages peddling disinformation and conspiracy theories, but that his don’t fit that description.“I was happy to see Alex Jones go,” he says. “But this isn’t about enforcing violations of Facebook’s terms. This is about Facebook repeatedly moving the goal posts with vaguely worded standards and then arbitrarily enforcing the rules because they’re fearful of congressional oversight.”Under intense scrutiny from regulators, and with the midterms coming up, Facebook may have simply wanted to rid itself of another potential headache. Instead, it’s created a new one.“I don’t think Facebook wants to fix this,” says Mountain. “I think they just want politics out, unless it’s coming from the mainstream media.”Facebook did not respond to requests for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ac832aec73e6ef161fa45dd524e4511dad5d5a2a/2_0_4500_2702/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32a432175f559499c8c4da1bcf5b252c","title":"microsoft surface pro 6 review windows 10 tablet","story":"It looks, feels and works great, is cheaper than the previous version and lasts longer on a charge, but it still doesn’t have USB-C or Thunderbolt 3The new Surface Pro 6 the latest version of Microsoft’s category-defining detachable tablet PC, but do a price cut, faster chips and a new paint job make it worth buying?From the outside it looks like very little has changed, and that’s because the Surface Pro 6 is practically identical to its predecessor.It has the same beautiful 12.3in screen, the same front-firing speakers, the same dimensions and weight, and the same brilliant kickstand out the back. It even has the same quality-feeling magnesium body with slightly rounded edges for hand-held comfort.The Surface Pro is arguably the best made Windows 10 tablet going. Unfortunately the Surface Pro 6 also has exactly the same port selection as the previous couple of models, which was old in 2017, but looks positively ancient in 2018.New for this year is a sleek black paint job, joining the platinum silver. The slightly textured, but smooth finish and colour combination are gorgeous. Black is definitely the one to get.Compared with the competition, the 770g Surface Pro is around 100g heavier than the 12.9in Apple iPad Pro with similar dimensions. The slightly larger 13in Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Tablet is more than 100g heavier but the smaller 10in Surface Go is 248g lighter.With the Type Cover attached the Surface Pro weighs 1.08kg, which makes it lighter than most ultrabooks, but more than 313g heavier than the Surface Go with Type Cover.All of that is to say that the Surface Pro is one of the easiest full-power PCs to cart around, either in the hand or in a bag, beaten only really by the smaller Surface Go and mobile tablets such as Apple’s iPad.New for this year are Intel’s latest eighth-generation Core i5 and i7 chips, both of which are faster and more efficient than their predecessors.Performance across the board was excellent, blowing through even very large image manipulation jobs in Affinity Photo. The integrated Intel UHD 620 graphics chip means you’re unlikely to be able to play any modern graphically intensive games on high settings, nor be able to edit multiple 4K videos, but the Surface Pro should handle everything else with ease.Unlike the fifth-generation Surface Pro, even the Core i5 version of the Surface Pro 6 has a fan which helps maintain performance when pushed.Most of the time the fans are completely inaudible, making the Surface Pro practically silent in day-to-day operation, so I think this is a good design decision.Battery life has improved significantly. The Core i7 variant of the Surface Pro 5 only lasted six hours 40 minutes between charges. The Core i5 version as tested lasted nine hours, which is long enough to go out for day’s work without having to pack the charger.That was with recommended brightness and power mode (Better Battery), using word processor Typora, multiple instances of Chrome, Nextgen reader, Affinity Photo, Evernote, Windows Mail and Wire.The Core i7 will have shorter battery life than the Core i5 version, but should have at least an hour or so more battery life than last year’s version.The internals might be modern, but the ports certainly aren’t. The tablet has the magnetic Surface Connector for power and expansion, which works just as well as previous versions with the included power adapter or the Surface Dock. There’s a microSD card reader under the kickstand, which works well and is useful if you’re trying to pull images from a camera.The full-sized USB 3.0 port is also welcome, while the mini DisplayPort is less useful, requiring a dongle or new cable to connect to most displays that are either full-size DisplayPort or HDMI.The big thing missing is any form of USB-C or Thunderbolt 3 connectivity, which is inexcusable on a premium computer in 2018. The decision to omit the modern port is bizarre from Microsoft, given it has already shipped the Surface Book 2 and Surface Go with USB-C.The benefits of USB-C are clear, not only from a connectivity perspective with the port the gold standard for connecting practically anything. But having USB-C should also allow the PC to be charged from any number of USB Power Delivery chargers, which are cheap to buy and ship with most other computers in 2018, in the same way almost any phone can be charged from any USB power adapter today.I’m not advocating that Microsoft ditch the Surface Connector, but it should offer at least a couple of USB-C, preferably Thunderbolt 3, ports too. Microsoft does make a Surface Connector to USB-C adapter, but it doesn’t appear to be on sale in the UK.This year the consumer version of the Surface Pro ships with Windows 10 Home, not Windows 10 Pro, which means you have a “Pro” machine shipping with the non-Pro version of the operating system.Naming oddities aside, the biggest difference between Windows 10 Home and Pro is the latter’s support for enterprise networking and domain joining, as well as Microsoft’s Bitlocker encryption tools for securing your data.On the Surface Pro 6, as with the Surface Go, Windows 10 Home ships with device encryption, meaning your data is safely protected if the tablet gets stolen, which I believe is essential in all new portable machines.As such I don’t think the downgrade to Windows 10 Home is something to worry about for the majority of consumers. Those who need Windows 10 Pro will have to pay £120 to upgrade through the Microsoft Store, although models with Windows 10 Pro for enterprise will be available at some point.The Type Cover remains the best typing experience on any detachable or convertible tablet and is an essential purchase with the Surface Pro. It attaches to the bottom of the tablet with a reassuring magnetic snap and closes on the screen to protect it on the move.For comparison, the last year’s Surface Pro was at least £100 more expensive with like-for-like specifications, with the top two specifications being £350 and £550 cheaper respectively. The Surface Pro 6 is the best detachable Windows 10 PC money can buy, except for one glaring error: no USB-C or Thunderbolt 3.It’s cheaper, more powerful, lasts longer and is just as well made, portable and easy to carry and live with as last year’s model. Its additional Type Cover keyboard is an essential additional purchase, while the Surface Pen is also good, but not essential for most. It even looks fantastic in the new black colour.But when you’re spending as much as this on a machine you want it to be future-proofed so that it can last as long as possible and keep up with new developments. On the port and connectivity front, the Surface Pro 6 doesn’t even keep up with the present, let alone the future.So unless you’re happy spending at least £1,274 on a machine that you will have trouble connecting to things at some point, the Surface Pro 6 is the best Windows 10 detachable you shouldn’t buy.Pros: great screen, good battery life, brilliant keyboard (essential additional purchase), microSD card reader, excellent kickstand, Windows Hello, fast but quiet, solid build, easy to carry, USB-ACons: no USB-C or Thunderbolt 3, less expensive (but still quite expensive), keyboard should be included, only Intel UHD 620 graphics This article contains affiliate links, which means we may earn a small commission if a reader clicks through and makes a purchase.

Behind him, a bow-tie wearing, opaque-eyed zombie with dental health issues (half his mouth is missing) is checking his phone.Recoiling, my husband makes one final escape attempt: “Do we have to take part? Can’t we just watch?”Foolish man. I’m sporting black velvet wings and a silver updo. Like a schlock-horror teen approaching THAT abandoned forest cabin, surely he realises there’s no turning back now?“Over my dead body. I’ve waited years for this,” I tell him. “Besides, these people need us.” Beneath my teenage son’s Joe’s “Vendetta” mask, I sense a sardonic eyebrow raised.Tonight, 60,000 spooks, kooks and the occasional smutty nun will put on one of the biggest Halloween parades on the planet. And we’re the opening act.The roots of NYC’s Village Halloween Parade extend back to 1973, when Greenwich puppeteer and mask-maker, Ralph Lee, took his kids and several of his creations on a spooky mooch around the neighbourhood. The following year, the march from Lee’s home to Washington Square Park was 200-strong. Featuring dozens of Ralph’s giant puppets and masks – and a bloke in a seven-foot-high lobster suit, borrowed from a Sam Shepard play – the Village Halloween Parade was officially spawned.In 1985, the procession relocated to Sixth Avenue where, under artistic director Jeanne Fleming, it has metamorphosed into the city’s largest participatory parade. Free to join on the night, the only rule is “no costume, no entry.”With imagination given free rein, the resulting artistry is astonishing. A zombie-eyed Medusa, her green beehive a swirl of serpents, wears a rubber python for a necklace, while a seriously terrifying horned demon, all flayed flesh and fur, sports a garland of dried fruits. Robotic-armed cyberpunks bare grilled teeth at La Catrinas, their exquisitely painted faces a conflict of vibrant petals and brutal stitches. Best of all, though, is a humongous “Wild Thing”, with his baby son, Max, in a crown and white sleepsuit. The devil is in the detail.For someone who struggles to put on eyeliner, such professionalism could seem off-putting. But here’s the thing: each year a menagerie of puppets, operated by 400 volunteers, forms part of the mile-long cavalcade. So, as no experience or costume is necessary (“Just wear black” made packing easier), I’ve enrolled us into the Ghost-Butterfly swarm.Signing up via the official website a few months before the event was easy. It’s first come, first served – but there are always cancellations and no-shows, so last-minute volunteers are usually welcomed. And on years where the weather has been foul or the subways have played up, Jeanne and her team have even had to grab people off the street.Mercifully, before the Flanagan males can flit off, I spot our peppermint-tressed, peacock-feathered butterfly captain, Kristie, who hands us each a vast moth on a 10-foot-pole, and a standard-bearer belt to secure it in. With the cumbersome puppet now semi-supported, manoeuvring it one-handed, while using the other to animate its wings, is relatively easy.The drums are pounding as we cram into Canal Street. Nearly 60 bands, from bagpipes to samba, will play tonight, and they’re all tuning up. Then the clock strikes seven and we’re off – lunging between gyrating stilt-walkers, a rattling puppet army of 12-foot-tall Dia de los Muertos skeletons and a vast spider-monkey.All awkward British reserve is jettisoned as we work the two million spectators cramming the sidewalks mischievously dipping our winged-spectres low to catch them by surprise. “Happy Halloween!” we yell.Trumpets are blaring the NYPD is smiling (even when I veer off-courseto spook a spectator-crammed side street: “Mam, please return to the official route. Now.”), and creative energy fills the air. Cats and werewolves are ensuring numerous Donald Trumps meet grisly ends … and, is that really a Trump-tampon, declaring “Make America Menstruate again?”It’s not all horror: Marshmallow Men wobble, Pac-Men gobble and a Superman-caped Pitbull is along for the ride. And here comes Dorothy, Toto and the Tin Man, too (although the latter looks demented and I think the dog is dead).Arms aching bathed in sweat and grinning manically, we frontrunners hit 16th Street in just under two hours. Behind us, that herd of walking dead just keeps on coming. Absolutely knackered but buzzing, it’s been one of the most exhilarating nights of our lives.Would we do it again? Hell, yes. In an undead heartbeat.How to join:The 45th New York City Village Halloween Parade will take place, come rain or shine, on 31 October, 2018.

It brings the rest of its cast back intact – John Goodman as the gruff-but-loving patriarch Dan recent Oscar-nominee Laurie Metcalf as aloof Aunt Jackie Sara Gilbert and Lecy Goranson as night-and-day sisters Darlene and Becky Michael Fishman as the constantly ignored DJ and the various newcomers and guest stars (including Johnny Galecki, Juliette Lewis and Mary Steenburgen) that make up their various kids, partners, exes, friends, neighbors and co-workers – as well as its trademark brand of character-driven humor suffused with working-class melancholy. It also retains its interest in issue-driven storylines (the two episodes screened early for critics, one and four, deal with addiction, sex, sexual orientation, healthcare and job security), while this time avoiding any explicit mention of current controversies and figures (ie there’s no mention of Trump).Of course, the main questions surrounding The Conners isn’t what’s in them, but rather, what’s missing from them.First and foremost, while Roseanne Barr may be gone, Roseanne Conner isn’t. The show picks up on a number of plot points left dangling from the truncated 10th season – a couple of which now come off as extremely serendipitous – and without going into the details surrounding her character’s fate (as per studio mandate), those who watched probably have a pretty good idea as to how things play out (though, to its credit, the show throws in a reveal that muddies the waters and makes for good drama). Roseanne’s absence isn’t a logistical hurdle, but the focus not only of the premiere but, judging by the other episode I saw, the season as a whole.While it seemed unlikely The Conners would write off its main character and move on without looking back, it’s not as if other long-running shows haven’t done exactly that (see Two and a Half Men – or, rather, don’t). Given the charged political nature of Barr’s dismissal, there surely must have been those behind the scenes advocating for the series to get any mention to her out of the way as quickly and succinctly as possible. It is a sitcom, after all if it can make people laugh, it may well make them forget. That the show has chosen not to do such speaks to its strengths as a cultural institution, as well as its faith in the cast.When it comes to the latter, that faith is mostly well-founded. Political and personal viewpoints aside, Barr’s time away from the camera was highly noticeable last season in her muggy performance and stilted line delivery. Goodman, arguably our most consistent character actor of the last several decades, has no such problem. His acumen at drama proves especially essential, as the new series is constantly taking turns in heavy territory. Goodman makes it possible to forget that you’re watching a three-camera sitcom reboot (of a reboot) mired in annoying controversy and invest purely in his three-dimensional portrayal of a man forced to deal with a sudden load of emotional strain.The same can be said of Metcalf, who is given a lot of the heavy lifting when it comes to the dramatic scenes, although for the most part her character remains the high-energy doofus she’s always been. Gilbert also proves surprisingly adept at switching between drama and comedy (not to sell her previous work short, but she’s had less opportunity to show off her chops over the years). She has the hardest job of anyone in the case, moving as she does into the lead role, even as her characters takes up the mantle as the acid-tongued, steel-spined matriarch of the family.Despite The Conners’ mature handling of Roseanne’s departure and the gameness of its lead cast, the rest of the show proves to be a standard sitcom in every way. The jokes are half-clever, with one in 10 truly landing. That seems unlikely to drive away fans, though, indistinguishable as it is from what they’re used to by this point.As far as the chances of the show’s broader success, that’s harder to predict. Those who came to Roseanne specifically for the title character andor Barr’s singular comic persona will definitely feel her absence, while her political partisans seem unlikely to return in the first place, let alone give it a fair shake if they do (especially now that, without Barr serving as a counterbalance, the show’s liberal bent is far more prevalent). But to those who found the larger family dynamics and humor of the show engaging, and for who Roseanne herself isn’t a deal breaker, The Conners is offers as dignified and consistent a transition as could reasonably be expected.That smoothness does, however, signify the lack of an edge, the same which Roseanne brought to it even before her rightwing conversion and public disgrace. Whether or not The Conners can sustain itself without that edge remains to be seen."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7de132528a950e9bac8aad86cef9dc0bc53df69/0_217_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f24ed017389f3a9c114affd927c6772a","title":"internment camps make uighurs life more colourful says xinjiang governor","story":"China on defensive over camps where ex-prisoners have told of arbitrary detention, abuse and indoctrinationA senior official in Xinjiang has described mass internment camps for Muslim minorities as “training” and “boarding schools” where residents receive vocational, legal, and language training as well as “de-extremisation education”.Beijing has faced growing international criticism for its crackdown in Xinjiang, a far north-western territory of China where it holds as many as a million Muslims prisoner in camps. Former detainees have said that they were subjected to political indoctrination and abuse.In a rare, detailed interview published by the state-run news agency Xinhua, the Xinjiang governor, Shohrat Zakir, said: “Xinjiang conducts vocational skills education and training according to law. The purpose is to fundamentally eliminate the environment and soil that breeds terrorism and religious extremism, and eliminate the terrorism activities before they take place.”Over the last few months, as scrutiny over the situation in Xinjiang has grown, Chinese officials have shifted from denying the existence of such camps to justifying and reframing how they are described. Zakir’s interview represents one of the most detailed accounts of China’s defence of the centres and what goes on inside them.Zakir said residents at the centres in Xinjiang learn Mandarin “to accept modern science and enhance their understanding of Chinese history and culture”. Students received vocational training, including courses on making clothing and footwear, assembling electronics, hairdressing and e-commerce, he added.Students undergo legal training on the Chinese constitution, China’s legal code, and local regulations, according to the governor. He said the centres were for people “influenced by terrorism and extremism” and suspected of “minor criminal offences” to receive “free vocational training”.The interview follows a revision of local rules last week to allow the regional government to officially permit the use of “education and training centres” to incarcerate “people influenced by extremism”. The interview, detailing daily life at the camps and the various kinds of vocational training, appears to be an attempt to normalise the system.“The Communist party is clearly on the defensive, seeking to deflect international criticism of its radical new policies in Xinjiang and justify them retrospectively,” said James Leopald, a scholar focusing on Chinese ethnic policies at La Trobe University in Melbourne.Former detainees of camps in Xinjiang told the  they did not receive vocational training but spent most of their time being forced to study Mandarin, pledge allegiance to the Chinese Communist party and memorise patriotic songs. Ex-detainees have detailed being tortured, isolated and cut off from their families. Most of those detained are ethnic Uighurs, as well as Kazakhs, Hui and other Muslim minorities.The governor of Xinjiang described a life in the centres that is in stark contrast to the accounts given by witnesses of poor nutrition and constant surveillance. One former detainee told the  he had attempted to kill himself.Zakir said the training institutions “care about the mental health of students” and provide counselling services. He said the cafeterias in the camps prepare “nutritious diets” and that all dormitories were equipped with radios, televisions, and air conditioning. Facilities for basketball, volleyball, table tennis and stages for performances have been built, he added. Activities such as writing, singing and dance contests are also organised for students, he said.“Many trainees have said they were previously affected by extremist thought and had never participated in such kinds of arts and sports activities. Now they realise how colourful life can be,” Zakir said.The governor did not say how many “trainees” were at the centres or how long their courses were but indicated the programmes were temporary. Zakir said some trainees were “expected to complete their courses successfully by the end of this year.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fa888691ce4377fb40d43bba3c1deca23626f176/0_199_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b80d33a2e232b78f8726809fc97010b","title":"jamal khashoggi disappearance mike pompeo saudi arabia salman","story":"Mike Pompeo meets King Salman amid reports Riyadh may admit journalist was killed in Istanbul consulateThe US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has met King Salman in Saudi Arabia to discuss the disappearance of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi, as reports emerged that Riyadh was poised to acknowledge that Khashoggi was killed in its consulate in Istanbul.Pompeo landed in Riyadh on Tuesday morning and met the king immediately to discuss the crisis surrounding Khashoggi, who vanished two weeks ago during a visit to the Istanbul consulate. Speaking at the royal palace, where Salman greeted him, America’s top diplomat thanked the king “for accepting my visit on behalf of President Trump” before going into a closed-door meeting.Turkish officials say they fear Khashoggi was killed and dismembered inside the consulate. Saudi officials have called the allegations “baseless”, but reports in US media on Tuesday suggested the kingdom may acknowledge the writer was killed there.Earlier on Tuesday morning, a Turkish forensics team completed a search inside the consulate. Technicians in overalls, gloves and covered shoes treated the diplomatic mission as a crime scene during their hours-long search. It was not immediately clear what evidence they gathered.Donald Trump, after speaking with King Salman, had dispatched Pompeo to speak to the monarch of the world’s top oil exporter over Khashoggi’s disappearance. The president himself said without offering evidence that Khashoggi could have been murdered by “rogue killers”, offering the US-allied kingdom a possible path out of a global diplomatic firestorm.However, left unsaid was the fact that any decision in the ultra-conservative kingdom rests solely with the ruling Al Saud family. Noticeably absent from discussions was the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, about whom Khashoggi wrote critically for the Washington Post and whose rise to power prompted the writer to go into a self-imposed exile in the US.What evidence Turkish officials could gather at the consulate remained unknown. Saudi officials have been in and out of the building since Khashoggi’s disappearance on 2 October without being stopped. Under the Vienna convention, diplomatic posts are technically foreign soil that must be protected and respected by host countries.Turkey had wanted to search the consulate for days. Permission apparently came after a late Sunday-night call between King Salman and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. In statements after the call, both praised the creation of a joint Saudi-Turkish investigation.Khashoggi wrote extensively for the Washington Post about Saudi Arabia, criticising its war in Yemen, the recent diplomatic spat with Canada and its arrest of women’s rights activists after the lifting of a driving ban for women. Those policies are all seen as initiatives of Prince Mohammed, the son of King Salman, who is next in line to the throne.Prince Mohammed has aggressively pitched the kingdom as a destination for foreign investment. But Khashoggi’s disappearance has led several business leaders and media outlets to back out of the upcoming investment conference in Riyadh, called the Future Investment Initiative.Trump previously warned of “severe punishment” for the kingdom if it was found to be involved in Khashoggi’s disappearance, which has spooked investors in Saudi Arabia and SoftBank, a Japanese firm that manages tens of billions of dollars for the kingdom.Trump’s warning drew an angry response on Sunday from Saudi Arabia and its state-linked media, including a suggestion that Riyadh could wield its oil production as a weapon. The US president has been pressing King Salman and Opec to boost production for weeks to drive down high crude oil prices, caused in part by the coming reimposition of oil sanctions on Iran after the US withdrawal from that country’s nuclear deal with world powers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3317534a7154f368e76fc8ba281a8cdcc577607/0_258_7693_4616/master/7693.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8afca7a081434f71a1b0b65888926564","title":"the sand diggers of mali in pictures","story":"A building boom in the capital, Bamako, has sparked a surge in demand for bricks made from high-quality sand dug by hand from the bed of the Niger River.

Video: Simon Carswell\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tHaulier Stephen Heasley  at Manfreight  in Portadown, Co Armagh. Photograph: Liam McBurney for The Stephen Heasley carries out a few final checks at the back of the lorry to make sure the load is secure.As a cold mist drifts down over him from the minus-22-degree air inside, he pulls at a metal bar that will keep the 20-plus tonnes of frozen chicken in his refrigerated lorry in place for the 620km journey – lasting 12 bumpy hours – to the east midlands of England.The chicken has come from a processing plant in Dungannon, Co Tyrone and before that from Northern Irish farms. Our destination is a cold-storage facility outside Grantham in Lincolnshire. Grantham is probably best known as the birthplace of Margaret Thatcher, but it’s also one of the locations where Northern Irish chickens are dismembered, sent for repackaging and distributed to supermarket chains such as Tesco, Sainsburys and Aldi across the United Kingdom and Ireland.It is another type of dismembering that Heasley and other hauliers fear most: the chopping-up of delicately balanced supply chains. These ensure that animals reared in one island and processed in another can be prepared for customers across both jurisdictions, guaranteeing that products maintain the commercially viable shelf life of five to six days that keeps supplies flowing and money changing hands.The UK voted to leave the European Union 28 months ago and yet, with less than six months to go to “Brexit Day” (the UK is scheduled to leave at 11pm British time on Friday, March 29th, 2019), British and European politicians have not agreed an exit deal. Such a deal would protect those supply chains while both sides hammer out a longer-term agreement governing future trading between the world’s second-largest economic bloc and its fifth-largest economy.Heasley – a 43-year-old from Lisburn, Co Antrim – knows the road ahead better than most. He has made the journey from Portadown, Co Armagh, across the Northern Ireland-Republic of Ireland Border and on to Dublin Port, Holyhead and then England many, many times in his two-decade career driving lorries.“Watch yourself, there’s a bump coming up,” he says, pointing into the distance to a ridge you still can’t see, minutes after we have pulled out of the haulage yard of Manfreight, the Portadown company he works for.You tend to feel most things on the road in a 44-tonne, 500-horsepower Volvo FH4 lorry, particularly with a load of between £40,000 (€46,000) and £60,000 (€68,000) worth of frozen chickens in the back.Heasley and hauliers like him feel Brexit more keenly than most of us, but they know too that the political road ahead is difficult to navigate.Transport companies such as Manfreight have developed decades-long supply routes, carefully managed on delicate profit margins and strictly regulated man-hours for the company’s 180 drivers. For these businesses, which rely on certainty, Brexit is chaos. Nobody knows what will happen, and planning ahead is complex.“There is nothing an average man or company can do because they don’t know what is going to happen,” says Heasley, 11 kilometres from what is right now an invisible border.“They don’t know what they can do. They just don’t want delays.”From Portadown, it is about 140km to Dublin Port. Heasley knows he can make the 8.40pm Stena Line to Holyhead in plenty of time. There is little traffic on the road this Wednesday evening.Less than an hour into our journey, as we approach the Border, the Volvo truck is powering ahead steadily at 56mph, or 90kmh. Suddenly, the continuous white line on the side of the road becomes a broken yellow one, and roadside signs turn bilingual, in Irish and English. Speeds and distances now appear in kilometres rather than miles. These are the only indicators that we have crossed the Border at Carrickcarnan, Co Louth.“Other than that, you wouldn’t know the difference,” says Heasley.Brexit has left a dark cloud of uncertainty over this border road and the rest of the 499km frontier from Carlingford Lough to Lough Foyle.While the EU and UK have said they want to avoid a hard border post-Brexit, they still have not agreed a plan to achieve this. Both have agreed that within the treaty covering the UK’s exit from the EU there must be a “backstop” – a guarantee to have no hard border unless and until a future trade deal offers a better solution to avoid one – but no backstop has been agreed.It has become the most intractable part of the Brexit negotiations, threatening to scupper an overall exit deal and heightening the pressure on EU and UK negotiators to agree some compromise for this week’s crunch EU summit in Brussels.“Nobody is actually sure what’s going to happen with the Border,” says Heasley, eyes fixed on the road ahead. “We’re hoping for transport companies’ sake and the customers’ sake that there are no border crossing checks and no security, because it will have an impact on us as drivers and the loads we are carrying.”He explains that under EU rules heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers must have a 11-hour rest every day, though it can be reduced to nine hours, three times a week. That means from the moment a driver starts driving, they have a 15-hour period – a “spread-over,” Heasley calls it – to get their goods to a destination.And there are plenty of goods heading to destinations on these roads. The Revenue Commissioners estimates that 13,000 commercial vehicles cross the Border every day. The UK’s Freight Transport Association has warned that a bad or no-deal Brexit could lead to “near-paralysis of freight” at the Border.Some Northern Irish hauliers have tried to Brexit-proof their businesses. Manfreight has opened an office in Clonshaugh, north of Dublin. Others are unwilling to invest without knowing what Brexit will likely bring.“It is that lack of clarity, people are unwilling to take a gamble,” says Seamus Leheny, policy manager at the Freight Transport Association in Northern Ireland.Driving across the Border, we have about an hour and a half to make the 8.40pm ferry. If we miss that boat, the next one from Dublin Port to Holyhead is at 2.15am. This would mean pulling out of the port at Holyhead on the other side of the Irish Sea at around 6.15am. With more than four hours driving still to go to reach Grantham – and with Heasley’s 15-hour spread-over expiring at 9am – he would not get there in time.“That is what a driver is up against,” he says. “If I was out of time, they would have to find another driver to lift that food. It might not be our man it might be a subbie. You have all that additional cost either way.”The margin of error is extremely narrow. Any kind of delay on the Irish Border after Brexit could knock a tight schedule for a haulier like Heasley out.“The boat waits for no man. It is not interested because some customs man kept me for an hour or two up the road,” he says.Heasley’s colleague Henry Totten, a 75-year-old who has been driving since he was 21, knows about delays at the Border better than most from his days transporting goods north and south at the height of the Troubles. Checks on the goods he was hauling had to be carried out by customs agents on either side of the Border, in both Newry and Dundalk, and then at the Border itself, adding up to five hours to a journey time.“You were wasting half a day no matter what way you looked at it,” he says.Carrying “groupage” – a mix of goods collected from different customers to create an economic full-load – made customs checks even more complicated, he recalls.“You could have sat there all day. The customs official could have said, ‘I want to see such and such an article,’ and you would have to take half the load off to get to it,” says Totten.Now he can complete a run from Northern Ireland to Cork and back in a single day.“It is the best thing since penicillin,” says Totten of the invisible border that has been in place for more than 20 years. “You have no stops to do.”We make good time to Dublin. There was just a two-minute slow-down at an M1 toll booth north of Dublin city and some light traffic heading into Dublin Port.Heasley drives into the holding lorry park at the port with 28 minutes to spare before the ferry leaves.The port is Ireland’s busiest for freight by some distance. Central Statistics Office figures show that 992,295 loaded freight vehicles and trailers passed through the port in 2017. It is a key transit point to access the UK from Ireland and over the so-called UK “land-bridge” to continental Europe.The Freight Transport Association estimates that 60 per cent of the 475,000 freight containers shipped to Britain have their final destination in Britain and that most of the remainder ends up being transported on to other parts of the EU.Welsh first minister Carwyn Jones said on a visit to Dublin this week that some 70 per cent of goods moving between Ireland and Britain pass through Holyhead and Pembroke Dock, the other Welsh port for freight transportation. “Any kind of delay is bad. It is not just bad in terms of being able to export from Ireland into Great Britain, but onward traffic going through Dover into the continent. This point has been made to me by Irish haulage companies,” Jones says.Any collapse in Brexit talks could hurt Ireland’s trade with the UK and the rest of the EU. There is lots at stake: Ireland exported €14.8 billion of goods to the UK in 2016 – 12.5 per cent of all the country’s exports, while it imported €20.5 billion – 28 per cent of all imports coming into the country, according to the Central Statistics Office.As Heasley drives his lorry into the port, an official tells him that all the “plug-ins” on the boat have been taken. This means he cannot plug into an electricity mains to keep his refrigerator running. Trucks are prohibited from running their own engines for the duration of the roughly 3½-hour sailing to Wales.Heasley’s chickens are frozen so it is not a problem on this trip, but if he was carrying fresh “just-in-time” products such as dairy items – yoghurts, ice cream and the like – or “something that is a bit vulnerable”, he would need a plug-in. Otherwise, “a lollipop would run off a stick,” he says.At the check-in hut at the port, Heasley discovers he is not booked onto the ferry. There has been a mix-up. He makes a phone call back to Manfreight and, a few minutes later, Heasley has our tickets in his hand.Eighteen minutes after arriving at the port – and with no checks of his goods on board – he drives onto the ferry at 8.30pm, the third-last lorry onto the boat with 10 minutes to spare before departure.Upstairs, we tuck into a meal of meatballs and chips in the Truckers’ Restaurant, surrounded by grey-looking drivers dressed in checked shirts, combat T-shirts and baseball caps.Heasley says that some of the chicken we are transporting will end up being served in fast-food restaurants back in Ireland after being processed and breaded in another factory before being distributed to customers. This is how circular supply chains work in Britain and Ireland. The economies are more closely intertwined than many consumers realise.He explains the meticulous choreography of supply chains: hauliers often have a set time to deliver food produce to a distribution centre in time for other lorries to transport it on to other processing centres.Brexit and border hold-ups could mean missing a crucial delivery window, landing additional costs on the haulier. Regular delays might even lead to the loss of contracts to suppliers operating closer to the distribution centre. It is all about maintaining the critical shelf life of products. Fail to do so, and costs could increase and availability of products could fall.“Down the line, everybody will pay for it,” says Heasley. “It is going to have an impact across the board.”A day before our journey, Heasley’s boss, Chris Slowey, Manfreight’s owner, explains that drivers are the biggest commodity in the haulage business, and a driver being delayed for one 24-hour cycle a week because of Brexit would mean a requirement for 20 per cent more drivers when there are shortages of drivers generally.“If each driver of ours loses a day, it would effectively mean we would have to renegotiate all our rates with our customers,” he says, explaining the havoc Brexit could cause freight operators.“From an exam to a marriage, you have a period of preparation because you know what is coming. With Brexit there are so many unknowns,” he says.On the ferry over dinner, Heasley explains other challenges lorry drivers face on the road: diesel stolen from tanks while drivers sleep in their cabs “curtain sider” lorries being knifed open and goods stolen toilet emergencies.An unintended consequence of Brexit-related delays at borders could lead to a boom in sales of Lucozade and Oasis drinks bottles, both popular with lorry drivers who have to answer the call of nature on the road. “They have a wider neck,” Heasley explains. He makes clear this is not something he resorts to himself.Four hours after driving onto the ferry in Dublin, Heasley drives down the ramp at Holyhead. Apart from a short delay as a result of congestion from hundreds of trucks disembarking from two ferries arriving at the same time in Wales, we are out of the port within 13 minutes. Only one piece of paperwork is handed in to a port official.“Everything’s smooth. Everything’s all right,” says Heasley as he heads for the dual-carriageway and the M56 to take us to the M6, the motorway spine running down the west of England from the Scottish border.Heasley explains that the majority of Manfreight’s traffic goes “over the top” via ports at Larne and Cairnryan, through Scotland and down into England. This route makes sense for deliveries in the north of England because there is less driving time required, but a lower speed limit in Scotland is a big downside.The strict limits on driving times determines everything, however.“Going through Dublin tends to be easier,” says Heasley. “If a man’s going to the south of England, it just means it brings you out in the middle of England so you have less driving time.”Barrelling down near-empty roads as we cross into England, Heasley says he was not among the 56 per cent of Northern Irish voters who elected to remain in the EU in the June 2016 referendum. He voted Leave along with other “lorry men” because of strict EU rules on drivers and their hours, and the heavy fixed penalties that enforce them.The damage he saw to lorries at Calais port in France during the migrant crisis also encouraged him to vote Leave. Information shared on lorry driver groups on Facebook about what was happening to the lorries and drivers helped to sway his vote, he says.“People never knew when they voted what the impact of Brexit was going to be,” he says.He points to the British morning TV interview with Brexiteer Nigel Farage the day after the referendum, when Farage admitted that the Leave campaign misled the public about EU money going to the health service post-Brexit.Does he regret voting to leave now?“Aye,” says Heasley. “I believe Brexit is going to impact on our cost of living, so I do. It is going to be more expensive for a man to run a haulage company now than it was previously. People don’t understand that. I never understood that at the time.”And if he had the opportunity to vote again? “I wouldn’t have voted Leave,” he says.As Heasley explains the challenges around the EU regulations, he grimaces – and it has nothing to do with the regulations. “That’s a rabbit I just killed there,” he says.Our early-morning discussion turns to roadkill, the perils of speeding, his advice for trainee drivers and his favourite route (dawn on the West Pennines, he says).“I killed a deer one time on the A75 in Scotland . . . bigger than a dog,” he says.Heasley pulls into a services stop near Crewe in England, still almost two hours from our destination in Grantham. He has hit his four-hour driving limit so, under EU regulations, he has to take a 45-minute break.Inside, we grab a tea and coffee and some chocolate. Heasley explains the dietary toll and the poor physical shape this gruelling work life leaves some lorry men in. Heasley sometimes likes to walk up and down factory yards for exercise after “tipping” his loads.After Heasley’s compulsory 45-minute rest-up and a quick check that the temperature around the chickens is still well below freezing, we are back on the road.Still in darkness, Heasley navigates a final dangerous junction, waiting a few minutes for a safe gap to cross two lanes of fast-moving oncoming traffic. The morning commuters are on the road. A little after 6am, we pull in to our destination: the cold store in Grantham.Heasley exchanges paperwork at a check-in hut and pulls around the back. He opens the back door for the first time since Portadown and reverses the six-axle lorry slowly up to a hatch for the chickens to be unloaded.It is completed in 19 minutes, leaving him with more than two hours still to go within his driving limit. That is enough time to head north and make his next collection point for his return back to Portadown “over the top” via Scotland.“Smooth and no delays,” he says of the 12-hour, 22-minute door-to-door trip.Brexit will likely make this journey rougher, he acknowledges, given the potential for delays at the Irish Border or at Holyhead once the UK is no longer in the the EU.“Come March it is a different story, all uncertain,” he says, before starting the next leg of his journey.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Dave MeehanMore than 100 Irish troops returned to Dublin Airport on Tuesday morning, following a six-month deployment to Syria. The personnel from the 57th Infantry Group had been due home the first week of October but had to remain in the Middle East. Minister of State with Responsibility for the Defence Forces Paul Kehoe said on October 4th the problem was due to what he termed “diplomatic clearance” not having been obtained but he refused to explain what that meant. He refused also to say where the problem originated – in Ireland, the Lebanon or Syria – but acknowledged that he became aware of it several days before the abortive attempt to get the soldiers home on October 2nd.The problem is understood to have prevented the troops crossing a frontier to start their journey back to Ireland from Syria.The 57th Infantry Group is a force reserve company that provides a rapid reaction response to threats against the United Nations observer force in an area of separation between Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and Syria proper.In the case of those who were due to return to Ireland, families who had booked holidays and scheduled other family events had to make other plans. Mr Kehoe announced compensation to each serving member affected of €1,000.Personnel from the 57th Infantry Group were met at the airport on Tuesday morning by friends and family. The group were the first Irish unit to redeploy to Syria following a UN evacuation of personnel in 2014. The majority of the 119 troops are drawn from the 3rd Infantry Battalion based in Stephens Barracks, Kilkenny. “There were lots of families and lots of tears. . . everything went great” a spokesman for the Defence Forces said.

A large majority, however, say it will make no difference.Asked if the Government was right to favour public spending increases over tax cuts, 42 per cent say the Government was right, while 47 per cent would have preferred more tax cuts.Government satisfaction declines by five points to 39 per cent since April, while Taoiseach Leo Varadkar’s approval rating slips by four points to 51 per cent.Nationally, Fianna Fáil is a few points ahead of where it was before the 2016 election, though its support in Dublin still lags, at 19 per cent.

A photograph purporting to show six airline staff sleeping on the floor of the crew room was posted on the Facebook page Ryanair Must Change. The incident occurred on Saturday as Storm Leslie hit Portugal meaning that many flights had to be erted to Spain. A statement from Ryanair indicated that this picture is “clearly staged” and no crew slept on the floor. “Due to storms in Porto (13 Oct) a number of flights erted to Malaga and as this was a Spanish national holiday, hotels were fully booked. The crew spent a short period of time in the crew room before being moved to a VIP lounge, and returned to Porto the next day (none of the crew operated flights).”However, Portuguese union official Fernando Gandra – who is a former cabin crew member with Ryanair – said the airline’s European operations in Dublin were contacted late on Saturday night about arranging accommodation for the crews.Mr Gandra said the photograph illustrates the conditions provided by Ryanair for crews’ rest on Saturday nightSunday morning. He said the allegation that the photograph was staged was “completely irrevelant”. “I’m not going to comment on whether it was staged or not. Only the people who were there can make that statement,” he said. He added that what is relevant is the fact that 24 Ryanair crew had only eight chairs between them to sleep on Saturday night. “The only place they had available was the floor . . . The point is that Ryanair did not give their crews any place to rest.” He added that 800 Ryanair passengers also spent the night in the terminal with nowhere to sleep or eat. He also stated that all the other airlines affected by the storm in Portugal treated their passengers and crew properly. “Ryanair is the exception, not the rule,” he said.The photograph was shared on Twitter by former Ryanair pilot Jim Atkinson who tweeted: “This is a Ryanair 737 crew based in Portugal, stranded in Malaga, Spain a couple of nights ago due to storms. They are sleeping on the floor of the Ryanair crew room. RYR is earning €1.25 billion this year but will not put stranded crews in a hotel for the night. @peterbellew?” Peter Bellew is Ryanair’s chief operations officer. He responded: “Unfortunately all hotels were completely booked out in Malaga. The storm created huge damage in Portugal. Later after this the crew moved to VIP lounge. Apologies to the crew we could not find accommodation.”Mr Atkinson then posted a couple of incredulous messages from Ryanair staff on a pilots’ WhatsApp group. “Off season? No hotels?!?! There are thousands of hotels along the gold cost (sic). All hotels sold out that probably cost less than 35 euro a night and gave a discount for taking the no breakfast tariff!” Mr Atkinson said the experience of the Ryanair staff at Malaga Airport is a scenario “which is all too familiar for me having flown for Ryanair. Their mistreatment of staff is legendary, and being forced to recognise unions in the past year has only embittered Ryanair (Michael O’Leary) further”. Mr Atkinson worked as a Ryanair pilot from 2006 to 2014. He has been a stern critic of the airline. He said the staff shortages last summer which caused thousands of flights to be grounded were the result of pilots leaving because of working conditions. The claim has been denied by Ryanair. The duty manager at Lesma, Ryanair’s groundhandlers at Malaga, who was tasked with finding alternative accommodation told the Ryanair crews there was nothing available. Mr Gantra said: “It is not known if he had the authority to pay for these rooms on Rynair’s account andor if he was under budget restrictions which would impede locating rooms.” He said all the crews were flown back the following morning to Porto. When they asked the European operations headquarters in Dublin if they could have soft drinks and sandwiches courtesy of the airline, they were told that they could not. A spokesman for Forsa, which represents Irish pilots, said the photograph raised “very serious” issues about the treatment of Ryanair staff. He added: “It’s clearly unacceptable that flight crew aren’t properly accommodated in circumstances like these. Every member of the crew plays an important role in flight safety. In this instance, the facilities were inadequate to say the least. It’s undignified for the crew and compromises their health, safety and wellbeing.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3664590.1539633816!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit legal argument over scope of article 50 central to difficulties","story":"An argument between lawyers about whether the EU treaty’s withdrawal article, article 50, limits the scope of what can be in the orce treaty – the withdrawal agreement – appears to be crucial to the current difficulties in the Brexit talks.A senior EU official in Brussels, responding to comments in the Commons on Tuesday by British prime minister Theresa May, confessed that member states remained in the dark about the precise nature of the breakdown issues, but said that “article 50 is not a basis for solving permanent issues relating to the relationship between the EU and UK”.He expected the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, to clarify these issues when he briefed ministers today.The French are understood to be arguing that, because of the constraints in article 50, a customs union provision is not legally possible in a withdrawal agreement. Such a provision just for Northern Ireland may be possible.However, the senior official briefing journalists insisted that, as he saw it personally, article 50 was “broad” enough to include any question relating to withdrawal, not least a temporary customs union arrangement.A European Commission spokesman would only say that “despite intense negotiations, several key issues remain unresolved” and that there would be no talks ahead of Wednesday’s summit.However, there is an expectation here that talks will resume after the summit in which leaders will confirm a date for a special summit in November.Mr Barnier will today come to Luxembourg to brief the European Parliament’s Brexit working group and European affairs ministers at the General Affairs Council. Afterwards he would normally brief journalists – but not this time.On his way in to a meeting of foreign ministers in Luxembourg, Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney admitted to “frustration and disappointment” at the impasse but expressed confidence that a deal could still be done.And he insisted that the Irish backstop commitment by the UK “cannot be time-limited”.“That’s new and has not been there before” as a demand, he said. The backstop was supposed to remain “unless and until something better is agreed”.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

Photograph: Gareth Chaney CollinsAs Taoiseach Leo Varadkar mulls what may be the most fateful decision of his political career – the future of the confidence-and-supply agreement and the prospects for an early general election – today’s opinion poll will encourage those around Varadkar who are beating the election drums.Parties want to fight elections when they are strong, and today’s numbers show that Fine Gael maintains a strong eight-point lead over Fianna Fáil.A year ago, it was two points. In that period it has gone from two to 11 to nine to five and then to eight today. Polls fluctuate, and there’s a margin of error. Things change during a campaign. But there’s a pretty consistent trend of Fine Gael leading Fianna Fáil now. The average in polls over the last year is eight points. Reproduced on election day, it would give Varadkar a commanding lead and put him in a strong position to lead the next government.The Fianna Fáil leader is looking over both his shoulders at his often restive party, fed up with playing second fiddle to Fine Gael, and at Sinn Féin, within touching distance of him today.Neither challenge is new to Micheál Martin, currently engaged in a delicate dance with Varadkar over the extension of confidence and supply. But never has his leadership of his party looked more like juggling on a tightrope than it does today. He has managed the task with some aplomb but it must be a fraught business for his inner circle.Two important caveats, based on past experience, should be added to these numbers, though. One is that in the last election, Fianna Fáil support increased in the general election campaign period. And it did in the one before that too. That suggests that there are some natural or historic party loyalists who tend to “come home” during a campaign. That might not happen again of course but precedent suggests there’s a good chance it will.The second thing is that Sinn Féin’s support on election day rarely matches their mid-term levels. What tends to happen is the party’s support peaks between elections but falls off towards polling day. In October 2014, the party was at 24 per cent it fell back to 14 per cent by the 2016 election. Today, it’s back at 24 per cent. Mary Lou McDonald may have changed the profile of the party but has she changed it enough?The aggregate support for the fourth pillar of Irish politics, the Independents (governing and non-governing alike) and small parties (not including Labour), slips again today, down two points to 14 per cent. This is less than half the 30 per cent that this umbrella grouping received in the last general election, before some of their number joined the Government.Though it protests it is not a party – and certainly lacks the coherence of one – the Independent Alliance seems to be experiencing the traditional fate of a small party in coalition with a larger one: decimation. Its support registers at just 1 per cent nationally today.It is not alone in that. All the minnows register in the 1-2-3 per cent range: Solidarity-People Before Profit (3 per cent) The Greens (2 per cent) the Social Democrats (1 per cent) Independents for Change (2 per cent) other groupings or parties (1 per cent) not stated (1 per cent). Only those who respondents say are “not a member of any group” (4 per cent) get their noses past 3 per cent. It has long been apparent that one of the post-crash effects on Irish politics was a fracturing of a part of the political spectrum. Today’s poll confirms that the fractions are getting smaller.Labour, meanwhile, trundles along with little sign of a revival. It is down one today to four per cent.Varadkar doesn’t get things all his own way. His satisfaction slips by four points today (after falling by five in April), though it remains high by recent historical comparison. Satisfaction with the Government also falls away, down by five points to 39 per cent, though again that is high by post-crash standards. The other party leaders are largely unchanged.Voters are underwhelmed by Paschal Donohoe’s budget, with the great majority of voters saying that it will make no difference to them. Even Fine Gael supporters shrug at it.However, Varadkar – one-time champion of tax cuts for those who get up early in the morning – will likely note that almost half of voters (47 per cent) would have preferred a greater emphasis on tax cuts rather than public spending increases in the budget.But it is the findings today about the public’s attitude to a general election that will attract most interest in political circles, as everyone watches Varadkar and Martin circle each other warily.Voters are pretty evenly ided on whether they want the present Government to continue, or to have an election. The view in some circles that the public are firmly against an election – and that anyone who caused one would be punished – is not borne out here.Brexit remains a significant barrier to an election – and in truth, it is difficult to see how either major party leader could prompt one in the midst of such uncertainty – but the voters appear pretty sanguine on the question. That will come as a surprise. Rarely has the immediate future of Irish politics looked more unpredictable."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3664603.1539635351!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"theresa may says eu and uk not far apart on backstop","story":"British Prime Minister Theresa May has urged the European Union not to allow a stand-off over the so-called Irish backstop to derail the Brexit talks, saying she believed a deal was achievable. Video: UK Parliament TVDonald Tusk has urged European Union leaders not to give up on reaching a Brexit deal as Theresa May said Britain and the EU were “not far apart” on the Northern Ireland backstop. Downing Street confirmed last night that the prime minister would address EU leaders before dinner at a summit on Wednesday evening.In a letter to EU leaders ahead of the summit, Mr Tusk, the president of the European Council, said Brexit negotiations, which broke down on Sunday, had proven to be more complicated than some had expected.“We should nevertheless remain hopeful and determined, as there is goodwill to continue these talks on both sides,” he said.Ms May blamed the impasse on the EU’s insistence that there should be a Northern Ireland-only backstop in the withdrawal agreement as well as a UK-wide customs backstop in the political declaration on the future relationship between Britain and the EU. The two sides also disagree about whether the backstop should be time-limited, as Britain wishes.The prime minister told MPs, however, that negotiators had made good progress on the withdrawal agreement and the shape and scope of the political declaration.“We cannot let this disagreement derail the prospects of a good deal and leave us with the no-deal outcome that no one wants. I continue to believe that a negotiated deal is the best outcome for the UK and for the European Union. I continue to believe that such a deal is achievable. And that is the spirit in which I will continue to work with our European partners,” she said.Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster has strongly reiterated her view that Northern Ireland must leave the EU on exactly the same terms as the rest of the UK. “We need to make sure that the whole of the United Kingdom leaves the European Union together and there are no differences made between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

This set the UK on course to leave the EU, but left all the details of its exit still to be decided. The timetable was set the following March 29th, when British prime minister Theresa May took the formal step, required under EU law to start the exit process, of triggering Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. Under the two-year process the UK will leave the EU on March 29th, 2019. An extension to the exit period is possible\u0026nbspif all 28 EU members agree. However negotiations have been taking place on the assumption that the UK leaves in March 2019.\u0026nbspThe talks between the UK and EU started in June 2017 and so far have focused on the details of the UK’s withdrawal, which must be set down in a formal, legal agreement. Outline agreement has been reached on what the UK will pay the EU after departure – the so-called exit bill or orce bill – and on the mutual recognition of the rights of UK citizens in the EU and EU citizens in the UK. However on the other crucial issue related to the withdrawal agreement, a backstop for the Irish Border, an agreement is still being sought.\u0026nbspThe backstop is a legally operable text which would provide a guarantee that there be no hard Border on the island of Ireland no matter what future trade arrangements are agreed between the EU and UK.\u0026nbspBefore the UK leaves, the two sides must also agree a political declaration outlining the principles for future negotiations. Under the withdrawal agreement, a so-called transition period, a kind of standstill in current arrangements, would apply from March 2019 until December 2020. This is to allow future trade arrangements and the wider ongoing relationship between the EU and UK to be negotiated.For a country to leave the EU is unprecedented ‑ and the extent of the complications has\u0026nbspslowly become evident\u0026nbspin the last couple of years. EU membership is a central part of the economy and society of all its members and unscrambling this is very complex, before account is even taken of sketching out how the two sides will relate to each other in future.Much of the discussion has been about the UK’s membership of the EU trading bloc. There are two elements to this. First, the UK is part of the EU customs union. This is a free trade area under which allows goods to circulate freely through the EU. Part of this is a commitment by all members to impose the same import tariffs – or taxes – on goods entering from outside the EU.The UK is also part of the EU single market, the system of rules and regulations which allow free movement of goods, services, people and capital. Together, membership of the customs union and single market allows goods to move freely across the EU and also for free trade in services like banking. Common EU regulations also underpin trade in a host of different areas, for example pharmaceuticals and food.The single market also allows free movement of people across the EU. The UK is also involved in common international policies co-ordinated at EU level, notably in foreign policy and defence and in trade deals with other countries.Current formal discussions are focusing on managing the UK’s exit. However there is also significant debate, in the UK in particular, about how areas like trade and immigration will work in future.Brexit talks between the UK and the EU are taking place in a sequenced order, which has led to no little confusion in the debate. What has to be decided upon now are the terms on which the UK leaves.These will be contained in the withdrawal agreement. A political declaration on what the future relationship might look like also has to be agreed before the UK leaves. However, details of the future relationship between the EU and UK will be decided in talks after the UK actually leaves, assuming the two sides are still talking.In the short term the conclusion of the withdrawal agreement would mean that once the UK leaves next March a transition period, a kind of standstill, would commence and last until the end of 2020. If this happens, not much will change next March, except for the UK’s formal departure.If there is no withdrawal agreement, then the UK would leave the EU in a so-called “no-deal” Brexit in March 2019, which could be chaotic as barriers to trade would go up overnight and there would be uncertainties in areas ranging from aviation to pharmaceuticals to co-operation in nuclear regulation. There is speculation that the EU and UK would work together to try to avoid the worst of the chaos – though they could only do so much ‑ \u0026nbspor even that there might be late moves to delay the UK’s exit date.If a withdrawal agreement is finalised, then talks move on to how the two sides will relate in future in areas such as foreign policy, defence and security and, crucially for Ireland, trade.In terms of trade, the UK could have a close relationship with the EU – like Norway, which follows many EU rules and regulations and is in the single market – or have a free trade deal with the EU, like Canada.The crunch point is that the EU insists that the UK must either be fully in the EU trading bloc and accept all the rules, or be out of it, and have a relationship similar to the EU and Canada. For the UK, the more closely aligned it remains with the EU, the less freedom it will have to set its own economic course after Brexit.The UK’s departure from the EU means Northern Ireland is leaving the bloc too so checks would be required along the 499-kilometre Irish Border as different trade rules would apply north and south after Brexit. The Border in Ireland will become the only land border between the UK and the EU after Brexit.The 1998 Belfast Agreement laid the foundation for Northern Ireland’s peace process with many all-island rules and institutions. Neither side wants the return of border checks because of the risk to peace whereby a physical border infrastructure would be considered a potential target for paramilitaries.The economic impact of Brexit is negative, for both the UK, Ireland and the rest of the EU. The biggest impact will be in the UK itself and in Ireland, its closest trading partner. \u0026nbspFor the UK, any trade arrangement reached after Brexit – barring full membership of the EU trading bloc, which the UK has ruled out – will be less favourable than current arrangements. Economists say that any new trade opportunities elsewhere will not make up for losses in trade with the EU. Weaker sterling since Brexit has already cut the purchasing power of UK consumers and uncertainty has hit investment, with growth estimated to be 1 to 2 per cent per annum lower over the couple of years.For Ireland, growth remains strong and the main short-term impact has been via a weaker sterling exchange rate, which is good if you’re going to the UK to buy a second-hand car but bad if you’re an exporter to the UK market.\u0026nbspThe main long-term threat to Brexit comes from barriers to exports to the UK and also delays and higher prices for importers of UK goods to Ireland. Forecasters have estimated that in a harder version of Brexit, where the UK leaves the EU trading bloc, the Irish economy could be 4 to 7 per cent lower in a decade’s time, with most of the hit in the first five years.May meets fellow EU leaders and the European Commission to try to seal deals on the terms of Britain’s withdrawal and what kind of relationship it has in the future. This should cover trade and how to prevent a return of controls on the Border. These are the main areas of disagreement which have all but stalled negotiations and caused May’s government to step up preparations for leaving without any deal.Both sides are still working towards an October deadline, although it may be possible to extend that to December and still allow time for both sides to approve the deal. \u0026nbspEuropean Council president Donald Tusk has described the October summit as “the moment of truth” for Brexit negotiations. If, however, the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier tells EU leaders at that summit in Brussels that a deal is within touching distance, then he will recommend a special summit of EU leaders be held in mid-November, most likely some time during the week beginning November 12th.An EU Council meeting is also planned for December 13th and 14th.British parliamentary vote on Brexit deal - unscheduled.If May secures a deal, she has to get parliament to approve it. Her Conservatives hold 316 seats in the 650-seat lower house, and she relies on Northern Ireland’s Democratic Unionist Party to win parliamentary votes.To win approval, she must overcome differences between Conservatives who want a radical break with Brussels, and those who want closer ties.Otherwise, she may have to look to the opposition for support. Both paths are full of uncertainty.Failure could trigger a move against her leadership of the Conservative Party, or the government’s collapse and an early election.The UK is schedule to leave the European Union on this date."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3658814.1539355373!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"welcome to bulgaria the world s fastest shrinking nation","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBulgaria’s Central Bank  in Sofia. While on average the top one-fifth of people in EU states earn 5.2 times more than the bottom one-fifth, in Bulgaria the haves make more than eight times more than the have-nots. Photograph: GettyBulgarians and visitors to their capital Sofia were offered a dazzling show of ancient and modern wealth earlier this year. The country’s national gallery, housed in an elegant former royal palace, displayed 62 glittering treasures dating back to 1,000BC in an exhibition called “The Golden Fleece. The Quest of the Argonauts”.It included 16 pieces that were on show for the first time, having resided in the well-guarded storehouses of the Thrace Foundation, a creation of multi-millionaire businessman Vassil Bojkov. The exhibition brought some cultural sparkle to Bulgaria’s six-month presidency of the EU, and may also have added a little lustre to Bojkov’s shadowy reputation.Established in 2004, the Thrace Foundation says it funds research and improves access to museums and protection of cultural heritage while caring for its founder’s collection of more than 3,000 precious artefacts.Bojkov, whose name is sometimes spelled Vasil Bozhkov, is thought to be Bulgaria’s richest man, with an empire ning construction to gambling operations that he built during his nation’s chaotic and sometimes bloody switch from communism to capitalism in the 1990s. With the Thrace Foundation perhaps the tycoon nicknamed “The Skull” is trying to give something back to the poorest and most unequal country in the EU.Some 11 years after Bulgaria joined the EU – raising hopes for a swift rise in prosperity, a more robust democracy and broader social justice – data from Eurostat in Brussels now make for bleak reading.Bulgaria has the lowest average salary in the EU (€575), the lowest minimum wage (€260) and the smallest average pension (€190).The upshot is that more than 40 per cent of Bulgarians are now at risk of poverty and social exclusion – twice the proportion of Germans who find themselves in the same predicament.In addition, while on average the top one-fifth of people in EU states earn 5.2 times more than the bottom one-fifth, in Bulgaria the haves\u0026nbspmake more than eight times more than the have-nots – without accounting for undeclared wealth.“There are three Bulgarian realities,” says Daniel Kaddik, the Sofia-based director of the Friedrich Naumann Foundation in southeast Europe.“People with an average salary don’t live a good life here, with prices for food, energy and other things that are comparable with elsewhere in Europe.”“Then there is a relatively small middle class who have their own bubble, and work in start-ups or international companies, and live in some areas of Sofia that are comparable with parts of Berlin, for example.”“Then there’s the upper class, which is detached from everything else. They have very fancy cars and private members’ clubs, and there is very often an overlap with shady business.”“I lived in Berlin and I never saw a Maybach,” he adds. “In Sofia I’ve already seen three.”The economy is growing at around 3.5 per cent, but the World Bank says it needs to expand “by at least 4 per cent per year over the next 25 years for Bulgaria to catch up with average EU income levels and thus boost shared prosperity”.Bulgaria leads the EU when it comes to one unpalatable indicator – the prevalence of corruption, and graft is draining the economy, scaring away foreign investors and serving to keep people poor.The country was the EU’s most corrupt nation in the latest Transparency International index, ranking in 71st place alongside South Africa and Vanuatu.Just as alarmingly, an EU survey found last year that only one-quarter of Bulgarians would trust the police to deal with a corruption complaint, and police and customs officers are seen as the public servants most likely to take bribes.The European Parliament estimates that corruption costs Bulgaria about 15 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and graft reaches into every facet of life – from rigged tenders, opaque contracts and kickbacks in multimillion-euro deals to the need for ordinary citizens to pay bribes to smooth their path through the country’s health and education systems and its Byzantine bureaucracy.All these backhanders, big and small, feed a grey economy in Bulgaria that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) found last year was equivalent to 29.6 per cent of its GDP, the largest such share in the EU.The result is a debilitating cycle of tax evasion and capital flight, depleted revenues for the government, sub-standard services for the public, and a grinding sense of injustice, grievance and mistrust towards officials and state institutions.An EU survey last year found that when it came to achieving success in life, more than twice as many Bulgarians believe that “knowing the right people” is a bigger factor than having a good education.This feeling that the game is rigged in favour of those with connections, and that poverty is permanent, is writ large in Bulgarian demographics - young people are leaving, couples are having fewer children and the population is falling fast.The UN says Bulgaria is actually the world’s fastest shrinking nation, with its current population of about 7 million people expected to dwindle to 5.4 million by 2050 and 3.9 million by the end of the century.Bulgaria has already lost almost 2 million people from a peak of nearly 9 million in 1989, revealing the massive and long-term impact of the transition from communism to capitalism on eastern Europe - where eight other countries are also expected to suffer a population decline of more than 15 per cent by 2050.The EU’s highest mortality rate, coupled with one of the bloc’s lowest birth rate and the emigration of tens of thousands of workers each year, leave Bulgaria with a headache over how to fund pensions and healthcare for an ageing population.It is no surprise that tens of thousands of Bulgarians seek jobs abroad each year, with Germany, Britain and Spain their favoured destinations, creating a chronic shortage of staff in country’s health service, schools and other major sectors.“There are now places where you don’t have doctor within radius of 50km. You have to bring own toilet paper to the hospital and these kinds of things. It’s a climate that lots of people just don’t want to live in anymore,” says Kaddik.While young professionals are leaving home in search of higher wages, better working conditions and a less corrupt environment, many Bulgarians do not even wait until graduation to start looking abroad for opportunities.About 17 per cent of Bulgarian students went to a foreign university last year, and some of the country’s top universities are now trying to fill hundreds of empty places for the new term.A glimmer of good news for people returning from abroad is that they will probably find the family home waiting. About 84 per cent of Bulgarians own the place where they live, compared to just 53 per cent in Germany.“People were given the apartments where they were living (when communism collapsed) and they are lucky to own their homes, otherwise they simply could not afford their housing,” says Kaddik.“A lot of Bulgarians, especially the elderly, rely on food grown on a little family plot outside the city. The family bond is strong here, and among friends and relatives there is a lot of exchange of small services and helping each other out – but it’s out of necessity because of a lack of good services.”"},{"url":null,"title":"cctv footage shows jamal khashoggi walking into saudi consulate","story":"  October 10, 2018Turkish investigators say Saudi leadership ordered murder of dissident Jamal Khashoggi   October 11, 2018Senior Republicans signal they are prepared to force US action if kingdom implicated   October 13, 2018US will inflict \u0026lsquosevere punishment\u0026rsquo if the kingdom is found to be responsible   October 15, 2018Turkish police enter consulate in Istanbul as more attendees quit Saudi conference   October 16, 2018Mike Pompeo arrives in Saudi Arabia as Trump speculates \u0026lsquorogue killers\u0026rsquo may be responsible "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3665166.1539676738!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"second brexit referendum should be held says tory mp","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Andrew Adonis: ‘Once the treaty is rejected and there can’t be a no deal, it is inevitable that there will be another referendum.’ Photograph: John PhillipsGetty ImagesIt is inevitable that there will be another Brexit referendum, a former British Labour cabinet minister has said while a Tory MP says the question must be put to the people once again. The comments come as president of the European Council Donald Tusk urged EU leaders not to give up on reaching a Brexit deal as British prime mininster Theresa May said Britain and the EU were “not far apart” on the Northern Ireland backstop. Downing Street confirmed last night that the prime minister would address EU leaders before dinner at a summit on Wednesday evening.Ms May blamed the impasse on the EU’s insistence that there should be a Northern Ireland-only backstop in the withdrawal agreement as well as a UK-wide customs backstop in the political declaration on the future relationship between Britain and the EU. The two sides also disagree about whether the backstop should be time-limited, as Britain wishes. DUP leader Arlene Foster has strongly reiterated her view that Northern Ireland must leave the EU on exactly the same terms as the rest of the UK.Conservative MP Anna Soubry says the Brexit negotiations are “a terrible mess” the issue should be put to the British people again in the form of another referendum. Ms Soubry said the British people were told “fibs” and voted yes in the Brexit referendum because of notions of lost sovereignty and perceptions about immigration “that had diddly squat” to do with the EU, she told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland.“This issue was never properly discussed and has had profound consequences. The issue should never have been put to the British people in the first place.”Ms Soubry said that people understand more about Brexit now and know the reality of what it will mean. There is no other credible way out of it but to have another referendum where people will be given the option to leave with no deal or to remain in the EU and reform from within, she said. She said there could not be a time limit of a back stop which is meant to come into place “if we don’t get a magic trade deal”.The backstop agreement was made by Ms May, she said, but then certain cabinet colleagues and the DUP “would not have it. They don’t even represent the majority in Northern Ireland.”She said the United Kingdom is being run “by a small number of people who don’t represent the majority of people - the DUP and the hard Brexiteers. “We lost the last general election and any mandate for a hard Brexit.” The situation is as “undemocratic” as one could find, she said. Meanwhile former Labour cabinet minster Andrew Adonis, who is predicting a second referendum, said that when faced with the option of staying in the EU or going with whatever deal is negotiated by Ms May, the DUP “will vote with her.”Speaking on Newstalk Breakfast, Mr Adonis said the the British parliament will not allow a no-deal scenario saying “there is a big difference between talks breaking down and there being no deal next March. There are talks every day.”He warned that the prime minister cannot appease both sides within the Conservative party and will find it difficult to agree a treaty.Mr Adonis said Ms May is facing not just resistance from the DUP, but also from a third of her own party led by Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees Mogg. “These people will reject her treaty. Once the treaty is rejected and there can’t be a no deal, it is inevitable that there will be another referendum - to either stay (in the EU) or to accept her treaty.“Some Conservatives will rally to support her and I think the DUP will vote with her. It will be a case of stay in or her deal.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches. See more here.

But when her Boko Haram handler escorted her to the target, she recognised faces in the crowd as former neighbours. She hesitated just long enough for police to arrive.A year on, Aisha is among hundreds of ex-Boko Haram captives at a rehabilitation charity in Maiduguri, the dusty city in north-east Nigeria where the country\u0027s jihadist movement sprang up.Recovering from life in a group that treats women as either sex slaves or cannon fodder is not easy: Aisha was so traumatised that she was mute for the first few months, while others are plagued by nightmares, flashbacks and thoughts of suicide.Yet for Fatima Akilu, the NHS-trained psychologist who runs the charity, what is equally disturbing is that not every former hostage regrets their time with the group.In the remote, impoverished villages where Boko Haram has its strongholds, becoming a bush wife is the closest some women ever get to empowerment.A teacher holds a counselling session for boys at the Neem Foundation\u0026#39s school in Maiduguri, NigeriaIt isn\u0027t true of all cases, but some of the wives of senior Boko Haram commanders have told me that while they were with the group, they felt empowered for the first time in their lives, said Dr Akilu, a Nigerian Muslim is also a children\u0027s author.They\u0027d often be in command of a harem of women themselves, sometimes hundreds of them, and they\u0027d learn how to use weapons as well.They felt a power they\u0027d never have in their own communities, where they\u0027d usually get married aged 12, and where husbands would then dictate their lives.Counterintuitive though they may be, Dr Akilu\u0027s insights draw on a lifetime studying the murkier side of the human psyche.Educated at boarding school in Tunbridge Wells, she studied psychiatry in Britain and the US before working with young offenders, paedophiles and murderers, including John Hinckley Jr, the man who shot President Ronald Reagan.In 2012, Nigeria\u0027s National Security Agency asked her to devise a local equivalent to Britain\u0027s Prevent counter-extremism project, after reading articles she had written on the role of education in fighting radicalism.How the Nigerian government is fuelling Boko Haram\u0026#039s kidnapping industryAs Director for Behavioural Analysis, she ran prison deradicalisation programs for jailed Boko Haram commanders and their wives, before setting up her own charity, the Neem Foundation, in 2016. It aims to help the tens of thousands of other Nigerians who have spent time in Boko Haram camps, be it voluntarily or as hostages.The group, which has killed an estimated 20,000 people, remains a force to be reckoned with, despite losing much of its turf in the past three years. It still holds around 100 of the 276 schoolgirls snatched from the town of Chibok in 2014, and last month also killed one of three kidnapped local aid workers.But as well as the ongoing military struggle, there is now a hearts and minds challenge to re-integrate those once brainwashed by the group. There are thousands of these people now drifting back into cities and refugee camps,” Dr Akilu said. “They need help, otherwise the problems could last for decades.”At a compound down a backstreet in Maiduguri, the Neem Foundation provides a school for female ex-captives, which is often their first experience of a classroom.\u0026#34Amina\u0026#34, a 17-year-old former hostage of Boko Haram at the Neem Foundation school in Bakassi refugee camp in Maiduguri. She spent 18 months with the groupConducted in English rather than local languages, it is a rebuff to Boko Haram\u0027s mantra that Western education is sinful, although the syllabus goes beyond just the 3Rs. Diversity is an important lesson too, given the inter-tribal chauvinism that Boko Haram exploits.A lot of our pupils are brought up to believe that their own tribe is greatest, be they Hausa, Fulani or Kanuri (the latter the tribe of Boko Haram leader Abubakr Shekau), said Aisha Bukar, the school\u0027s deputy head. By getting them to swap tribes in role-plays, we teach them that Nigeria is a place of many tribes and faiths.Indeed, a few of the program\u0027s clients are unaware that Nigeria even exists as a country, thinking it represents just the wider area around their village.Such limited horizons make them easy prey for Boko Haram’s doctrines, which include the bizarre claim that the world is flat. It also lets the group present itself variously as a world-conquering jihadist force, a glamorous Mafia, and even a local version of the Boy Scouts.There\u0027s a whole range of reasons why people join up, mostly to do with lack of opportunity, said Dr Akilu. For some, it\u0027s the chance to be in a gang and carry a gun. For others, especially adolescents, it\u0027s just a chance to be part of something, to have an adventure. Then there some who join up because Boko Haram gave them money to start a business. It may be just cash to buy a wheelbarrow, but that means the world to people in communities that have nothing.She stresses that despite such blandishments, Boko Haram still has to recruit most of its followers by force. Yet stigma abounds.In a refugee camp where the charity runs another program, Amina Ahmed, 17, who was impregnated by her captors and then miscarried, told how even her own mother blamed her at first. She asked me: \u0027why did you accept?\u0027, and I told her it was because I had no choice, she said, a tear rolling down her cheek. Here I can at least meet other people who\u0027ve had the same problems.A \u0026#34conflict resolution\u0026#34 class at the Neem Foundation\u0026#39s school in Bakassi refugee camp in MaiduguriTo date, the Neem Foundation has helped more than 7,000 people affected by Boko Haram, some via a special counselling on wheels service that sends staff out to remoter areas. How successful it will be, only time will tell, although Dr Akilu does already have an endorsement from one important source.During her time working with Boko Haram\u0027s jailed commanders, she persuaded one of the group\u0027s chief imams to back her program, after months of fiery debate about different interpretations of Islam.  He was one of the main leaders who opposed Western education, but halfway through the program, he changed his mind and decided he\u0027d been misleading people. she said. He asked if we could get his children into school, which we did, and now that he\u0027s been freed from prison, he\u0027s gone back to school too.The names of some interviewees have been

Worldpay\u0026#39s own data found that in June 51 per cent of all card payments in shops were by tap-and-go cards, up from 50 per cent in MayRetail and Consumer industryShoppers using chip and PIN cards in shops have been eclipsed by those paying by tap-and-go technology for the first time, data shows.Until now chip-and PIN cards have been the most common way to pay in stores but now time-saving contactless technology has taken over. Analysis of payment provider Worldpay\u0027s own data found that in June 51 per cent of all card payments in shops were by tap-and-go cards, up from 50 per cent in May.  Fashion retailers saw the greatest shift from Chip and PIN to contactless, with four times as many payments year-on-year increase, the data showed.Mobile contactless payments, including Apple Pay, also rose significantly in the clothing and footwear sector, up by almost five times over the past year. Betting shops and department stores also saw significant growth of mobile contactless payments.  Steve Newton, executive vice president at Worldpay, said: “The data clearly shows that shoppers are moving towards more convenient forms of payment. This aligns to what we’re seeing in a number of sectors: time-poor consumers want instant access to their goods.Whether buying clothes or booking holidays, speed and ease are the watch words for meeting consumer expectations. The popularity of online shopping, mobile payments and click-and-collect is testament to this.Guidelines for contactless payments“The rise of contactless is part of a bigger story: it’s not simply about tap and go – it’s about convenience and reducing the parts of the shopping experience that customers find irritating, like queuing and waiting to pay.Over 50 per cent of shoppers believe that their phones could replace their wallets within the next five years - the phenomenal growth of mobile contactless is a leap along this path.With the added benefit ‘limitless’ transactions and biometric security offered by mobile wallets, our smart phones could be the key to the next frontier of frictionless commerce.”Retail and Consumer industryAnt McPartlin and wife of 11 years granted orce by judge in under 30 secondsSpeaker John Bercow under huge pressure to resign after Maria Miller and Sir Kevin Barron tell him to goAustralia prime minister considering following US on Jerusalem embassy moveCabinet told to force Theresa May to drop Chequers plan or she will face no confidence vote \u0026#39within days\u0026#39 Mike Pompeo lands in Saudi Arabia as Riyadh \u0026#39set to blame rogue operatives\u0026#39 for killing journalistDuchess of Sussex says \u0026#39we\u0026#39re ready and excited to join the club\u0026#39 after pregnancy announcementStormy Daniels loses defamation case against Trump after president tweeted of \u0026#39con job\u0026#39 over affairPaul Allen dies aged 65: Tributes to Microsoft co-founder who \u0026#39changed the world\u0026#39Comment: We cannot end global hunger without investing to solve the problems of tomorrowComment: We need to stop stressing about things like Parmo – food is supposed to be creative and fun Comment: Malnutrition is a staggering global burden – we must give new meaning to the food we eatSaudi Arabia to \u0026#39admit killing Jamal Khashoggi in botched interrogation\u0026#39Taxes will have to rise to \u0026#39highest level since the end of WW2\u0026#39 to meet pledge to end austerityGPs will not tell couch potatoes that exercise could boost their health  Revealed: UK\u0026#39s least reliable stations where seven in ten trains are lateEight Cabinet ministers with concerns over May\u0026#39s Brexit backstop at Andrea Leadsom\u0026#39s \u0026#39pizza summit\u0026#39 Comment: I\u0026#39ve been called a coconut and worse so I know how important it is to stamp out hate crimeHate preacher Anjem Choudary is banned from speaking to children on jail releaseWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/10/16/TELEMMGLPICT000177951242_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqPoURMoge4zyCm5RemNush9BJAZn0NjCZqoW0yjlVgN4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"mike pompeo lands saudi arabia riyadh set blame rogue operatives","story":"US media reported on Monday that the kingdom is considering an admission that Mr Khashoggi died after an interrogation that went wrongUS top diplomat Mike Pompeo landed in Saudi Arabia for urgent talks with King Salman on Tuesday seeking answers about the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, amid US media reports the kingdom may be mulling an admission he died during a botched interrogation.Rogue killers could be to blame for the disappearance of Khashoggi, who has not been seen since he walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2 to sort out marriage paperwork, US President Donald Trump said after telephone talks with the king.Mr Trump dispatched Mr Pompeo to Riyadh for what the State Department described as face to face meetings with the Saudi leadership.Turkish police on Monday searched the consulate for the first time since Khashoggi, a Saudi national and US resident who became increasingly critical of powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, went missing.Turkish officials have said they believe he was killed - a claim Saudi Arabia has denied - with the controversy dealing a huge blow to the kingdom\u0027s image and efforts by its youthful crown prince to showcase a reform drive.Mr Trump dispatched Mr Pompeo to Riyadh for what the State Department described as \u0026#34face to face meetings with the Saudi leadership\u0026#34But US media reported on Monday that the kingdom is considering an admission that Mr Khashoggi died after an interrogation that went wrong during an intended abduction.Until Monday, Riyadh had not allowed Turkish investigators to search the consulate - officially Saudi territory - with reports both sides were at odds over the conditions.The investigators, who arrived in a motorcade of six cars late Monday, left the premises in the early hours of Tuesday after an an eight-hour search, an AFP correspondent reported.They took samples with them, including soil from the consulate garden that was loaded into vans, one official at the scene said.A Saudi delegation had entered the consulate one hour before the Turkish police arrived and appeared still to be inside as the search was conducted.Trump\u0027s comments came after a telephone conversation with King Salman, father of the crown prince, the first such talks since the crisis erupted.Just spoke to the King of Saudi Arabia who denies any knowledge of whatever may have happened \u0027to our Saudi Arabian citizen\u0027, Mr Trump tweeted.Riyadh\u0027s most recent comments have focused on having no knowledge of any killing or denying any order to kill Khashoggi had been given.The denial was very, very strong, Mr Trump later told reporters at the White House. It sounded to me like maybe these could have been rogue killers. Who knows?But CNN cited two sources as saying the Saudis are preparing a report that his death resulted from a botched interrogation, while the Wall Street Journal said the kingdom was weighing whether to say that rogue operatives killed Khashoggi by mistake.After critical talks in Riyadh Tuesday, Pompeo was expected in Turkey on Wednesday to meet Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, the state-run Anadolu news agency said.Please review our commenting policySpeaker John Bercow under huge pressure to resign after Maria Miller and Sir Kevin Barron tell him to goAustralia prime

Co-op was the only other bricks and mortar retailer to grow market share over the quarter, increasing its portion from 6.2 per cent to 6.4 per cent. Sales went up at all supermarkets, as shoppers began buying seasonal foods again. Kantar reported that £51m was spent on whole chickens and £62m on roasting joints in September, while 8 per cent of households spent a total of £8m on mince pies last month. Aldi considers stockpiling food to cope with BrexitAldi UK sales pass £10bn as discounter plans to open 130 new storesTesco expected to launch new discount storesFraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, comments: “Consumer spending often slows in early autumn, after the excesses of summer barbeques and before the festive season kicks off. \u0026nbspThe arrival of colder weather and darker evenings has inspired consumers to embrace hearty comfort foods and stock up on Sunday roast staples.”Meanwhile, focusing on Tesco, Mr McKevitt noted that despite “widespread interest” in the launch of its discount brand, Jack’s, last month “the small number of stores planned means it won’t impact on Tesco’s market share without a significant expansion”. Tesco opened two Jack’s stores in September and announced plans for up to 15 more next year. The group put itself in direct competition with Aldi and Lidl as it said Jack’s would be “cheapest in town”, with a focus on British products.

Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Asda all lost a portion of market share, while Morrisons held on to its 10.3 per cent stake. Aldi grew its share from 6.8 per cent to 7.6 per cent, with sales rising 15.1 per cent, while Lidl’s share increased to 5.6 per cent from 5.2 per cent, on 10 per cent sales growth. Co-op was the only other bricks and mortar retailer to grow market share over the quarter, increasing its portion from 6.2 per cent to 6.4 per cent. Sales went up at all supermarkets, as shoppers began buying seasonal foods again.

Aldi considers stockpiling food to cope with BrexitAldi UK sales pass £10bn as discounter plans to open 130 new storesTesco expected to launch new discount storesFraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel, comments: “Consumer spending often slows in early autumn, after the excesses of summer barbeques and before the festive season kicks off. \u0026nbspThe arrival of colder weather and darker evenings has inspired consumers to embrace hearty comfort foods and stock up on Sunday roast staples.”Meanwhile, focusing on Tesco, Mr McKevitt noted that despite “widespread interest” in the launch of its discount brand, Jack’s, last month “the small number of stores planned means it won’t impact on Tesco’s market share without a significant expansion”. Tesco opened two Jack’s stores in September and announced plans for up to 15 more next year. The group put itself in direct competition with Aldi and Lidl as it said Jack’s would be “cheapest in town”, with a focus on British products.

It sees the new residential let market as competitive, meaning that landlords have no\u0026nbsppower to pass on additional costs to tenants.“Despite scaremongering by the property industry, renters have little to fear from a housing market that is no longer a playground for speculators,” said Dan Wilson Craw of Generation Rent.“If homes leave the private rented sector then so do the private renters who are now able to become home owners. The balance of supply and demand is unchanged and so are rents.”The group also found no evidence of an increase in rent in the wake of a drop in loans for buy-to-let after tax changes in 2016.In recent years, amid a backlash against the growth of buy-to-let and discontent from private sector renters, the Government has adopted a range of measures to tilt the market in favour of first-time buyers.As well as the increase in stamp duty for buy-to-let investors, it has partially withdrawn their mortgage interest relief and restricted allowable tax deductions for wear-and-tear.At the time of the 2015 stamp duty hike, the mortgage lender Kent Reliance predicted it would lead to £55 a month increase in the rent charged on a £220,000 home.Earlier this year, Simon Rubinsohn of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said: “While it is understandable that the government wanted to provide a lift for first time buyers, this may well come at the cost of higher rents as the appeal of buy to let diminishes.”According to the latest English Housing Survey 20 per cent of households now live in the private rented sector, up from 12 per cent in 2006-07.Data from the Financial Conduct Authority shows that bank loans for buy-to-let purchases shot up from 6 per cent of gross advances in 2009 to 22 per cent in 2016.More recently, research suggests that buy-to-let investors have been withdrawing from the property market, particularly in London.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

We did so in full compliance with our legal obligations to preserve messages.Other apps with messaging functionality, including Snapchat and Facebook-owned Instagram, already allow users to unsend\u0026nbspmessages on their platforms.A Facebook spokesperson was not immediately available for comment but the firm told TechCrunch that it is working on developing the feature.Facebook internally tests products and features before they ship to the public so we can ensure the quality of the experience, the spokesperson said.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It was expected to make upwards of $20m.The film, which has been heavily touted as a possible Oscars contender, faced stiff competition from two films that debuted last weekend: Tom Hardy’s supervillain smash Venom and the Lady Gaga-starring A Star is Born. Both films managed to retain large audience numbers, taking $35.7m and\u0026nbsp$28m respectively.Venom has shrugged off widely negative reviews to take\u0026nbsp$142m over 10 days in the US, while A Star Is Born – a firm awards favourite – has taken\u0026nbsp$94m over the same duration of time.

Dir. the Safdie brothers, stars Robert Pattinson, Jennifer Jason Leigh)A Star is Born likely stole audiences attention away from First Man thanks to its\u0026nbsphigher profile cast (Gaga and\u0026nbspBradley Cooper compared to Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy) and ever-so-slightly better word-of-mouth, landing an “A” Cinemascore. There was also Chazelle’s\u0026nbspcontroversial decision to omit showing the American flag being planted into the moon, which caused a backlash from certain commentators, including\u0026nbspRepublican senator Marco Rubio.\u0026nbspThe controversy began after Gosling said, during a press conference at the Venice Film Festival, that he believed the astronaut’s moonwalk “was widely regarded not as an American, but as a human achievement”.\u0026nbspThe truth behind First Man’s most talked about scene“He was reminding everyone that he was just the tip of the iceberg—and that’s not just to be humble, that’s also true,” he said.\u0026nbsp”So I don’t think that Neil viewed himself as an American hero. From my interviews with his family and people that knew him, it was quite the opposite. And we wanted the film to reflect Neil.”The statement has been widely discussed online, and\u0026nbspalthough the American flag does appear on the moon in the movie, the damage seems to have been done. A spokesperson for the studio behind the $70m-costing First Man, Universal, has\u0026nbspsaid the box office results are not disappointing and pointed out that well-reviewed awards films often have long legs in cinemas.\u0026nbsp“This weekend’s results are\u0026nbspjust a starting point,”\u0026nbspUniversal’s distribution president Jim Orr told Variety.\u0026nbsp”Quality adult dramas released in this time period produce very healthy multiples. This is very much a marathon, not a sprint.”\u0026nbspOther new releases over the weekend in the States include Goosebumps 2: Haunted Halloween and Bad Times at the El Royale, which made $16.2m\u0026nbspand\u0026nbsp$7.2m, respectively. Next weekend looks to be another bumper box office bonanza as Halloween opens\u0026nbspanalysts are expecting the horror to make as much as $60m.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Andrew Grice\u0026nbspasks whether the dominance of big tech is now imperilling our democratic system and considers what can be done about itClick to followThe IndependentAllegations of state-sponsored interference in foreign elections have changed the gameWhen Theresa May called a surprise election last year Labour rushed out a manifesto which proved remarkably popular. There was, however, a hole at its heart. Plans to renationalise the rail, water and parts of the energy industry had a backward-looking feel, and Labour had nothing to say about the new oligopolies such as Facebook, Google, Amazon and Netflix.That is one reason why Jeremy Corbyn was keen to take on the digital giants in his speech to the Edinburgh Television Festival in August, proposing that the BBC receive a “digital licence fee” funded by a tax on tech companies or internet service providers. The Labour leader, who said his party faces “greater hostility from\u0026nbspthe mainstream media than we’ve probably ever had before”, inevitably faced media criticism for some of his ideas – not least in respect of a proposed expansion of\u0026nbsp“public service journalism”, funded by tech firms, which sceptics doubted would be free from political interference.But Corbyn’s proposals on the tech multinationals were well timed and reflect a changing public and political mood. In July, Facebook was fined the maximum £500,000 by the UK Information Commissioner after its data was harvested by Cambridge Analytica. Meanwhile, Vote Leave was fined £61,000 and referred to the police after the Electoral Commission ruled that it exceeded its £7m spending limit by channelling £675,000 through pro-Brexit youth group BeLeave. It must be added that it denies the claim.I’m leaving Facebook – and it’s not because of Cambridge AnalyticaIn the same month, the cross-party Digital,\u0026nbspCulture, Media and Sport Select Committee produced a devastating critique of the new media landscape. Damian Collins, its Tory chair, warned that democracy itself is at risk. The committee proposed that social media sites be held responsible for interference in elections by malicious actors and recommended a “clear legal liability” for tech companies which failed to act against harmful and illegal content.For the past 36 years, I’ve had a ringside seat at the often bruising battles between politicians and the media\u0026nbspthe last 20 of them while working for The Independent. When I became a Westminster-based journalist in 1982, the remnants of a much more deferential age were still evident. The questions we asked were a little more probing than the “is there anything you’d like to say today, prime minister?” style of interrogation that was evident in the 1950s, when television news was launched. But the male-dominated club of parliamentary lobby journalists I joined was unnecessarily secretive. “Maintain the mystique,” one veteran political editor told me.It was an open secret that the Downing Street press secretary – then Bernard Ingham for Margaret Thatcher – briefed the lobby daily. But we were not allowed to quote Number 10 such briefings had to be attributed to “Whitehall sources”. The archaic system would eventually change, with The Independent among those championing reform after its launch in 1986.The pro-Conservative majority among the newspapers was always thereThe lobby has many critics. Yet if it was scrapped today, it would re-emerge in a different guise tomorrow politicians and the media need each other, and they need to talk, however strained the relationship. The lobby is not perfect, and still too dominated by men. But some criticism is overdone. Conspiracy theorists on the left recently claimed the existence of a Press Gallery WhatsApp group showed how the lobby pack agrees the line to take on stories. At the time, the group was discussing smelly towels left in the showers and the price of crisps in our canteen.Much is also made of anonymous briefings by politicians and their advisers. But if these were abolished and all statements were on the record, many would be so bland as to be worthless. It is the journalist’s job to find out what’s going on people are more willing to talk without having their names attached to a quote: such discussions will always take place. Jeremy Corbyn’s team often relies on such briefings. Do spin doctors abuse this system and lie? Occasionally, but less than you might think journalists have long memories and won’t believe them next time if they get caught.The inevitable “poacher versus gamekeeper” relationship between media and politicians has changed markedly during my time at Westminster – and it’s changed for the worse, with both sides being to blame. The pro-Conservative majority among the newspapers was always there. When I joined the lobby, old hands told me: “Right-wing journalists bend over backwards to be fair to the Conservative Party. And left-wing journalists bend over backwards to be fair to… the Conservative Party as well!”What’s shifted is that some national newspapers have crossed a line, becoming players on the political stage rather than impartial analysts. The iding line between news and comment has become blurred, and in some cases invisible. It was as if the papers, hit by declining circulations – which fell from a combined 14.8 million in 1983 to 5.9 million last year – decided to shout louder to grab people’s attention. The launch from 1989 of the 24-hour television news channels – first Sky, then a BBC offering – meant the papers were no longer first with the news, and sometimes became more focused on infotainment than information.The growing influence of TV and the decline of newspapers was made clear when the UK belatedly held its first televised election debates between party leaders at the 2010 general election. The debates dominated press coverage as soon as one debate ended, the papers previewed the next. Nevertheless, the political spin doctors continue to fret 247 about what the papers say, because they often still set the broadcasters’ agenda.Some elements of the press, particularly on the right, have given news an opinionated twist, and has become less reliable as a result. There’s no doubt that hostile, often inaccurate, coverage of the European Union – and underreporting about the benefits of membership – played a critical role in the decision to hold the 2016 referendum and in the result.By then (if not before), some papers had crossed a line between healthy scepticism about politics and its practitioners to unhealthy cynicism. In 2009, The Daily  was absolutely right to expose abuses of the MPs’ expenses system but there has been a feeding frenzy ever since: a misleading presumption that MPs are in it for themselves. In my view, this has gone too far, fuelling in turn public cynicism and a lack of trust in politicians – though it’s also true to say they contributed to this by trying to spin their way out of troubles they had made themselves.At the 1992 election, Neil Kinnock, a modernising Labour leader, faced a barrage of highly personal abuse and criticism in the Tory tabloids. The Sun’s front page on polling day declared that if Kinnock won, “will the last person to leave Britain please turn out the lights?” The Sun claimed to have “won it” when the Conservatives were re-elected but the truth was that Rupert Murdoch liked to back the winner (and be seen to have done so) to maximise his influence.Scarred by Kinnock’s treatment, Tony Blair made a sea change when he became Labour leader two years later. He told me: “I’m not going to let them do to me what they did to Neil. Never again.” In Blair’s view, that meant supping with the devil. He flew halfway round the world to address a conference held by Murdoch in Australia. Blair once said: “It is better to ride the back of a tiger than let it rip your throat out.”The cosying up was accompanied by a much more aggressive response to negative media reports about Labour – there would be a “rapid rebuttal” or even “pre-buttal” when the party got wind of a potentially damaging story. New Labour spin doctors put pressure on journalists, with threats such as “you’ll never get another interview or exclusive if you write this” they complained behind reporters’ backs to their editor, occasionally even demanding their removal.\u0026nbspThey doled out exclusive stories to favoured journalists or papers, though there was nothing new in that.Blair’s “hug them close” strategy worked, at least in opposition. The Sun, the country’s biggest selling paper, came out for Labour at the 1997 election (which it was bound to win in any event). In government though, New Labour became too eager to please its media enemies-turned-friends. Lance Price, who was deputy to Alastair Campbell, Blair’s communications director, said “no major decision could be taken by the government without first assessing the reaction of three people”:\u0026nbspGordon Brown, the chancellor John Prescott, the deputy prime minister and Murdoch.Spin had its limitations of course. Headline-grabbing works in opposition, when the media is your main weapon but in power, New Labour discovered that headlines were no substitute for policy or action. Spin would also, in the end, contribute to Blair’s demise and help to tarnish his legacy. In 2003, he discovered that you cannot spin the case for war, when it is based on non-existent weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.As papers like The Sun tired of Blair and reverted to type, he launched an attack on the “feral beasts” of the media in one of his last speeches as prime minister. I sat in the front row, appalled that he bizarrely singled out The Independent for criticism when his real target was the Daily Mail he was still too frightened of its power to say so.David Cameron copied the New Labour playbook when he began modernising the Conservatives on becoming their leader in 2005. Mirroring Blair’s trip to Australia, Cameron flew to the Google Zeitgeist conference in San Francisco in 2007, symbolically paying homage to the new power in the media world.\u0026nbspCameron, who called Blair “the master”, faithfully adopted his top-down, centralised approach to media management, and imported it into government in 2010. The cosy relationship between leading figures in the government and media was highlighted again during the Leveson inquiry after the phone-hacking scandal.Politics is certainly more polarised that I have ever known...When Theresa May succeeded Cameron after his ill-fated EU referendum in 2016 she set out to do everything differently. That included moving away from a rigid day-to-day “grid” of centrally controlled initiatives designed to allow the government to set the agenda. May tried to curb headline-grabbing stunts, and focus on fewer, bigger statements. It was an honest attempt to combat spin, but didn’t work in a digital age when the battle between government and media (and between parties, and even between factions within parties) had become ever faster and more frenetic. However, it is doubtful whether any administration could dictate the agenda while Brexit eclipses everything.May’s disastrous snap election last year would prove a watershed for the press. Right-wing papers reprised their 1992 treatment of Kinnock to target Corbyn, but this time – refreshingly – it didn’t work. In the age of the insurgent, already exploited by Trump and the Brexiteers, social media helped Corbyn bypass the mainstream media (the hated “MSM” in Corbynland). Friends sharing pro-Labour stories on Facebook and other social platforms proved a powerful weapon. Labour’s machine outgunned the Tories, diluting the impact of the right-leaning press.However, it remains to be seen whether the old media has really been replaced by new media which, despite the early optimism about “digital democracy” during Barack Obama’s presidential campaigns, seems actually to undermine rather than enhance democracy. In those days of hope, I didn’t imagine Trump tweeting from the White House at 5am about the “fake news media” and journalists who are “the enemy of the people”.Politics is certainly more polarised that I have ever known – no coincidence when filter bubbles create echo chambers that reinforce our own views. The abuse hurled around on Twitter, between fellow party members as well as opponents, is nasty, often misogynistic and sometimes racist. It scars our politics.At the 2017 election, parties spent more than 40 per cent of their advertising budgets online. During the EU referendum, Vote Leave devoted 98 per cent of its ad spend to digital, much on highly targeted “dark” ads which no one but the recipients could see. It ran a last-minute blitz claiming falsely: “Turkey (population 76 million) is joining the EU. Our schools and hospitals already can’t cope!”The social media ads used by Donald Trump and the Leave campaign are the most lethal political weapons ever inventedThe tech giants have been slow to put their house in order, and politicians slow to force them. While claiming to be platforms rather than publishers, they have often paid little tax in countries where they made vast profits. They have demolished the economic model of newspapers by gobbling up much of their advertising revenue. Some 300 local papers have closed in the UK in the past 10 years, undermining democracy at local levePoliticians want to sound modern and offer a vision of the future. But Tom Baldwin, a former political journalist who was Ed Miliband’s communications director, believes they do not understand the new technology and are afraid to regulate the new giants roaming the media landscape. In a revealing and thoughtful new book covering politics on both sides of the Atlantic, Ctrl Alt Delete, published by Hurst, Baldwin argues that the new information age “has unpicked truth and hollowed out space for a virulent new strain of populism to spread like a contagion across all forms of media”. He says: “The social media ads that were used by Donald Trump and the Leave campaign are the most lethal political weapons ever invented.”What, then, needs to be done? The government plans to require an imprint showing the identity of those running digital ads, and a new offence of intimidating parliamentary candidates and party campaigners. But it will need to go much further to ensure a system of\u0026nbspelectoral law brought in for an analogue era is fit for a fast-evolving digital age.Created with Sketch.11 useful Facebook features you didn\u0027t know existed Show all 11Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.111 Clean up your News FeedMost of us are Facebook friends with some people we don’t actually care about, and there are several ways to keep their updates off your News Feed.

They could be funded by a levy on the tech giants. There should be a statutory code of practice covering the use of personal data by political campaigns. All political ads should be published in some sort of central register so that everyone can see them. In election periods, ads should be limited to registered campaigns, following evidence of Russian interference in the last US presidential election and the Brexit referendum.There is rising political support for a ban on online political ads, to bring the internet into line with broadcast media. It extends from Baldwin on the left to William Hague, the former Tory leader, on the right. This would help to stop those with the deepest pockets enjoying an unfair advantage, but would not prevent videos being shared.For a government consumed by Brexit, such reforms might not look like a priority.

You may have seen a black laptop before, he says, with a disconcerting sincerity, but you\u0027ve never seen a black laptop like this before.Lifting the lid of the computer, he invites\u0026nbspme to touch it. Go ahead, he says. Stroke it. I do as I\u0027m\u0026nbsptold and run my fingers along the soft\u0026nbspsurface of the palm rest. That\u0027s Alcantara\u0026nbspcloth, he continues. Usually you\u0027d find it in luxury cars. It\u0027s absolutely stunning.Sure enough, it feels\u0026nbspmore suited to being something you\u0027d sit on than cover an electronic device\u0026nbspwith, and even the smell is more like a new car than a laptop. Researching it later I learnt Alcantara\u0026nbsphas been used in everything from Formula 1 race cars to space ships, and the fact Microsoft has decided to use it in its latest laptop is a supremely smooth statement of intent in a high-end hardware category typically dominated by Apple.Alcantara material on the palm rests is designed for \u0027maximised typing comfort\u0027 (The Independent)The man from Microsoft - Simon Lambert, devices category lead for Surface - takes 10 minutes just to talk me through the design decisions that went into creating the Surface Laptop 2. For starters, there are no visible screw on its exterior and no bumpers on the edge of the screen to protect it when you close it. (Why would you need them when you\u0027ve got Alcantara\u0026nbspcloth to cushion it?)For a high-performance laptop with an impressive 14.5-hour battery life, it is also absurdly thin. I\u0026nbspuse the smallest flagship smartphone on the market - the Sony Xperia\u0026nbspXZ1 - and at its thinnest point the Surface Laptop 2 is the same width: less than 1 cm thick. As it thickens out towards the base of the screen, it adds less than half a centimetre. Yet despite the slim\u0026nbspprofile, it feels incredibly sturdy and is able to offer a typing experience rarely found in the so-called Ultrabook category of laptops.The most obvious comparison in terms of size and design would be the now-ancient MacBook Air, but in terms of internal specs it would be more appropriate to put it up against this year\u0027s 13-inch MacBook Pro. It features the same 8GB\u0026nbspor 16GB\u0026nbspof RAM, together with an 8th-generation\u0026nbspIntel Core i5 or i7 -\u0026nbspdepending on the version you choose.Beyond specs, Microsoft is also able to put itself alongside both Apple and Google in combining their own hardware with their own software, meaning\u0026nbspthe Laptop 2 is built with Windows 10 in mind.The Surface Laptop 2 comes less than a year and a half after Microsoft unveiled the first Surface Laptop, which the Redmond-based firm described at the time as 50 per cent faster than the MacBook Pro. This time, Lambert tells me the Surface Laptop 2 is 85 per cent faster than its predecessor.Lambert explains that the attention to detail goes right down to the travel of the keys on the keyboard, which punch down 1.5mm - a full 1 mm more than the 13-inch MacBook Pro. For someone who types words for a living, this kind of thought is appreciated. With the Alcantara\u0026nbspcloth cushioning the heels of my hands, and the thick clunk of the keys making each letter from my fingertips feel purposeful, even writing these words for this review feels\u0026nbspgood.Backlit keys also help to improve the typing experience, but it is not just light that emanates\u0026nbspfrom the keyboard.\u0026nbspThe OmniSonic speakers mean sound plays straight out from between the keys, offering both a rich and loud sound that once again belies the delicate size of the Surface Laptop 2.The generous size of the palm rests means that there has inevitably been a compromise with the size of the trackpad. Moving the mouse around the screen felt cumbersome and took some getting used to - a burden that is addressed to some extent by the inclusion of a touchscreen. This proves particularly useful when flicking through Netflix or scrolling down webpages.If you\u0027re looking for further downsides, the other obvious one is the lack of ports. Beyond holes for a power cable\u0026nbspand a single USB drive, there is only a Mini Display Port, meaning anything else like an HDMI cable will require a dongle - proving that Microsoft is able to borrow both the bad and the good from Apple.But overall, the Surface Laptop 2 is a powerful combination of performance, design and battery life, that is able to fulfil even the most fawning of plaudits gushed by Lambert. With the best hardware combined with the best software, he tells me, with genuine adulation,\u0026nbspthis black laptop is the only black laptop that will let you do more, achieve more, and dream more.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Chief among them is that it’s “the best phone you’ve never heard of”, and it’s representative of the rest. Everyone who’s used a OnePlus phone loves it, but the trouble is that group is relatively small.Now the company is hoping that it can jump into the mainstream, taking on the more famous Android phones like Samsung’s flagships and finally putting those “iPhone killer” headlines to the test.It intends to do so in a variety of different ways. But the latest is a major announcement that it will finally be much easier to buy: it has signed new partnerships with the UK\u0027s biggest carriers and shops, so that people will be able to buy it if they\u0027re on EE or Vodafone, or pick one up at John Lewis.Created with Sketch.Gadgets and tech news in pictures Show all 43Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Designed by Pierpaolo Lazzarini from Italian company Jet Capsule.

And it is all part of the company\u0027s plan to finally turn the huge amount of hype around its phones into a similarly huge number of sales.But the new carrier announcements are also actually an extension of the work the company has already done in building its brand and encouraging people to recommend its phones, the company says. And it is adamant it will not come at the cost of the things that have made the phones so beloved, such as the engagement with its community that decides everything including what the phones look like and what features are added to them.OnePlus 6T: Release date announced for super-charged AndroidWe’re a digital brand first, and that means word of mouth is very important – it’s the number one way new users hear about us, Carl Pei, co-founder and head of brand of OnePlus, tells The Independent\u0026nbspin an exclusive interview. You may think that this is counter-intuitive, but partners like EE and Vodafone are actually an extension of our online strategy.Our users advocate us to their friends and family, and having high-street visibility means that now people can try our device in-store. The brand endorsement and support that these prestigious carriers and retailers have given us can also be taken as a compliment.Pei\u0026nbspsays that the new shot at the mainstream won\u0027t change the way the products are designed and made. It will only expand the number of people who are able to contribute towards new ideas and feed back on old ones, he says, allowing OnePlus to keep that approach even while it expands the number of people who are a part of it.As we grow, we’ll get more feedback and pressure about our design choices –\u0026nbspwe only add features which can improve the experience, not because they’re in fashion, he says.\u0026nbspIt’s important to understand what people really need.The UK OnePlus forum\u0026nbspis already one of the most engaged of any country in the world, with 1.5 million active users. More than 1,000 Britons turned up to see the reveal of the\u0026nbspOnePlus\u0026nbsp6, its latest phone, and it would go on to sell more than a million of those devices.OnePlus 5 smartphone at a OnePlus pop-up store at the Bikini Berlin shopping mall on June 21, 2017 in Berlin, Germany (Sean GallupGetty Images)OnePlus has inspired fanatical devotion in its customers, who queue up for the phones and flock to the launch events. Some of that devotion was inspired precisely because the phones have been so complicated to buy: at the beginning, they could only be got through an invitation system that meant users felt they had been allowed access to club, and that exclusivity encouraged loyalty.But Pei\u0026nbspis clear that OnePlus doesn\u0027t intend to give up on that customer – or fan –\u0026nbsprelationship, even if there are many more customers that are a part of it.We’ve always been very focused on our users and we’ll have to work hard to ensure current users feel valued, and new users are welcomed. It’s easy for brands to forget where they’ve come from – we’ve learned a lot from others in the industry, both in success and failure, he says.We’re committed to keeping our core and staying grounded, while expanding our business. The ultimate driver of people wanting to support you is having a great product, and that’s followed by having great service.

It sees the new residential let market as competitive, meaning that landlords have no\u0026nbsppower to pass on additional costs to tenants.“Despite scaremongering by the property industry, renters have little to fear from a housing market that is no longer a playground for speculators,” said Dan Wilson Craw of Generation Rent.“If homes leave the private rented sector then so do the private renters who are now able to become home owners. The balance of supply and demand is unchanged and so are rents.”The group also found no evidence of an increase in rent in the wake of a drop in loans for buy-to-let after tax changes in 2016.In recent years, amid a backlash against the growth of buy-to-let and discontent from private sector renters, the Government has adopted a range of measures to tilt the market in favour of first-time buyers.As well as the increase in stamp duty for buy-to-let investors, it has partially withdrawn their mortgage interest relief and restricted allowable tax deductions for wear-and-tear.At the time of the 2015 stamp duty hike, the mortgage lender Kent Reliance predicted it would lead to £55 a month increase in the rent charged on a £220,000 home.Earlier this year, Simon Rubinsohn of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said: “While it is understandable that the government wanted to provide a lift for first time buyers, this may well come at the cost of higher rents as the appeal of buy to let diminishes.”According to the latest English Housing Survey 20 per cent of households now live in the private rented sector, up from 12 per cent in 2006-07.Data from the Financial Conduct Authority shows that bank loans for buy-to-let purchases shot up from 6 per cent of gross advances in 2009 to 22 per cent in 2016.More recently, research suggests that buy-to-let investors have been withdrawing from the property market, particularly in London.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

That is a bright flash of radioactive\u0026nbspthat flings out huge quantities of important elements like silver, gold, platinum and uranium.The announcement comes after scientists announced last October that they had seen the first explosion of this kind. They spotted super dense stars smashing into each other 130 million light years away\u0026nbsp– wobbling the spacetime of the universe, and allowing them to be picked up by gravitational wave detectors at LIGO.At the time, that discovery was hailed as a new chapter in astrophysics and an unexpected discovery. It allowed scientists to understand the spectacular explosions of neutron stars, as well as answering questions about where gold comes from.Now, scientists have found what they think might be a related event, known as\u0026nbspGRB150101B – and one that suggests such spectacular explosions could be far more common than we had realised. The similarities between the two events have led researchers to suggest they might in fact be related.It\u0027s a big step to go from one detected object to two, said study lead author Eleonora Troja, a researcher at the University of Maryland and\u0026nbspNASA\u0027s Goddard Space Flight Center. Our discovery tells us that events like GW170817 and GRB150101B could represent a whole new class of erupting objects that turn on and off – and might actually be relatively common.The two look very similar: both threw out a short gamma-ray burst and a flash of bright, blue optical light. They also seem to come from very similar galaxies. Together, that has led scientists to believe that they are related – and that therefore many more similar events might be happening throughout the universe.We have a case of cosmic lookalikes, said study co-author Geoffrey Ryan, a postdoctoral researcher in the UMD Department of Astronomy and a fellow of the Joint Space-Science Institute. They look the same, act the same and come from similar neighbourhoods, so the simplest explanation is that they are from the same family of objects.Scientists are able to learn less about the new collision\u0026nbspbecause, unlike in October, they did not pick up the gravitational wave that was thrown out by the explosion because the new one was so much further away. With that data, it is possible to work out the masses of the two objects that merged\u0026nbsp– but they hope to gather that kind of data\u0026nbspin the future.Surely it\u0027s only a matter of time before another event like GW170817 will provide both gravitational wave data and electromagnetic imagery. If the next such observation reveals a merger between a neutron star and a black hole, that would be truly groundbreaking, said study co-author Alexander Kutyrev, an associate research scientist in the UMD Department of Astronomy with a joint appointment at NASA\u0027s Goddard Space Flight Center. Our latest observations give us renewed hope that we\u0027ll see such an event before too long.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The government must stop the rollout of universal credit immediately. We need urgent answers from Esther McVey about what\u0027s going on and what action the government will take to tackle the many flaws in the system.Dame Louise Casey, a former senior government adviser, also told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme that universal credit should be halted and sorted out to prevent thousands of families falling into crippling debt.My worry about more pauses is this needs to be halted and sorted out. Something also needs to be done for the thousands of people who have already transferred over to it who are now in crippling debt, she said.People having to wait for five weeks, who are used to being on either weekly or fortnightly pay, just doesn\u0027t add up, and making those people take out loans just pushes them further and further into destitution.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Prime Minister Theresa May peers into a hot water urn during a meeting at a social group in Vauxhall from a charity working to combat loneliness at the launch of the first loneliness strategy.

This will not begin in January 2019, but later in the year after a period of preparation.\u0026nbsp“For a further year we will then begin migration working with a maximum of 10,000 people, continuing with our ‘test and learn’ approach. This is to ensure the system is working well for claimants and to make any necessary adaptions as we go.”“We will publish full plans for the next stage of universal credit rollout, including managed migration, in due course. Anything before that point is speculation and we do not comment on leaks.”On Monday, in the Commons, Ms McVey was told by Frank Field, the independent MP and chairman of the work and pensions select committee in Westminster, that some women had resorted to prostitution in his Birkenhead constituency after being placed on the new welfare system.He told MPs: Might I raise a question that I wrote to the Secretary of State about, about how Universal Credit is being rolled out in Birkenhead, how it is not going as well as we\u0027re told in the House of Commons, and some women have taken to the red light district for the first time?Might she come to Birkenhead and meet those women\u0027s organisations and the police who are worried about women\u0027s security being pushed into this position?Ms McVey replied: We need to work with those ladies and see what help we can give them - from work coaches right the way through to various charities and organisations.In the meantime, I might add perhaps he could tell these ladies - and the work coaches can - that now we\u0027ve got record job vacancies, 830,000 job vacancies, and perhaps there are other jobs on offer.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Babies are exciting,” his friend said, who noted her family is in the UK and welcomed the news as well.“I hope they name it Di!” after the late Princess Diana the gentleman noted, adding “that would be sweet”. If it is a boy, both agreed any name would be lovely but “not Charles”. One woman said Americans fascination has to do with “the American and the British coming together and now they’re having a baby, it’s a big deal”. She said she thinks it will be a girl, but her friend said she hoped it would be a little boy. “A classic name, something like Catherine,” is what she wanted for a girl, but the other woman thought a baby boy will be named “Harry Jr” after his father. Several others out and about on a rainy morning were a bit ambivalent about the news, but one woman\u0026nbspcarting around her own toddler\u0026nbspsaid she thinks interest will peak when the duchess begins to debut her pregnancy fashion choices.

While the AfD haven’t gone away, Sunday’s Bavarian elections show that the story is more complicated.The main way conservatives across Europe have reacted to the rise of right-wing populism has been to steal its clothes. If this is what voters want, then they can have it, the centre right has said. And they can get it from us.Britain is the best successful example of this strategy, where Theresa May’s Tories have eaten Ukip by embracing Brexit, lambasting “citizens of nowhere” and swelling their poll share to one they have not enjoyed for decades.Brexit talks: What on earth just happened?But Bavaria is now the best example of where this approach has gone wrong. For months before the election the CSU, the regional conservative allies of Angela Merkel who have dominated politics in the state since 1949, banged on about immigration. They faced down the chancellor and forced changes in refugee policy at a national level. The goal was to show voters there was no need to vote AfD if they wanted to be mean to foreigners.When polling day came on Sunday, the CSU lost a good chunk of voters to the AfD, as expected. But it lost more, according to a polling analysis by Der Spiegel, to the Greens – swathes of its one-time supporters apparently horrified at the party’s increasingly xenophobic tenor.The Greens have been unambiguously pro-refugee and are on the rise across Germany, especially so in Bavaria. They took second place and denied the CSU a majority for only the second time since 1949 – in elections fought under a proportional system.The environmentalists, who are less radical than their UK-based counterparts but nonetheless left of centre, are now flying high in the national polls, with an increasing number of surveys showing them taking second place.They have done this before, a few years ago, when a row over nuclear power was making headlines in Germany. Merkel neutered them simply by adopting their policies and pledging to close down nuclear plants. The pragmatic chancellor may have less room for manoeuvre this time, however – with pressures both to her left and right on immigration.AfD says Islam is not welcomeThere are other strands to the story, too. The social democrats, who are in coalition with Merkel’s conservatives at a federal level, lost voters to basically everyone, sinking for fourth place. Once a force to be reckoned with, they are now in serious need of a rethink and recovery if they are to even survive. They yet show little sign of having the energy to reinvent themselves.Their story is common across Europe, from France to the Netherlands from Greece to Italy where once-powerful centre-left social democratic parties are being eviscerated. Germany’s SPD has taken a particular beating from having twice now signed up to work with the conservatives, with little to show for it. When the government does things wrong they get blamed, when it does things right, they get little credit.Whether the Greens will stay on the up is not certain. German politics for the last decade has been a bit of a carousel, with minor parties getting some time in the sun between general elections as voters search around for an alternative before losing interest. The Greens, the Left, even the Pirate Party, have all at various points had temporary surges – but the only force that has sustained increased support so far has been the far right.But what does look certain is that Germany’s conservative establishment is not immune from the rot that has been afflicting its social democratic one. The centre right in European countries – who across the continent have weathered challenges to their dominance with far more resilience than their left-of-centre counterparts– will be watching with an interested fear.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Then, online sleuths reportedly managed to use open-source material to identify at least eight of those allegedly involved in the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, a 59-year-old Saudi journalist, as members of Saudi security forces. One photo purported to show a member of the 15-member team hobnobbing with Mohammed bin Salman, the powerful 33-year-old Saudi crown prince who has become the primary target of\u0026nbspMr Khashoggi’s criticisms. Another identified an alleged team member as Salah Mohammed al-Tubaigy, a name and face matching the head of forensic evidence at Saudi’s General Security department.Sabah purports to identify the 15-member Saudi team allegedly involved in the disappearance of journalist Jamal KhashoggiThe details\u0026nbspwere published by Sabah, a mass-circulation daily newspaper close to the government of president Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Friends, family, and officials say Mr Khashoggi was lured to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October before disappearing.\u0026nbspTurkish media reported that security camera footage from inside the consulate was removed and that staff were ordered to go home the afternoon Mr Khashoggi arrived.On the same day, two private jets, owned by Riyadh based Sky Prime Aviation,\u0026nbspreportedly arrived from Saudi Arabia to Istanbul’s Ataturk airport, carrying the 15 personnel, landing just hours before Mr Khashoggi’s scheduled appointment at the consulate. Some of the 15 checked in to the five-star\u0026nbspMovenpick\u0026nbsphotel near the Saudi consulate in Istanbul’s Levent district.\u0026nbspBoth private jets and the 15 men departed hours later, according to Turkish officials and local press. Khashoggi: Emergence of Saudi dissident and his potentially tragic endTurkish authorities investigating the disappearance of Mr Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi with Turkish ethnic roots, have been leaking information about the probe to local and international media with what appears to be the tacit approval of government officials.Police in Istanbul have formed a special team to investigate Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance, the newspaper Milliyet reported, tasked specifically to use chemicals, dogs, and infrared light to look for DNA, blood and other traces of the journalist at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.The Post and other media also circulated a photo, likely taken from security camera footage, showing a black Mercedes Vito van that was parked outside the consulate and left shortly after Mr Khashoggi’s arrival, parked in front of the residence of Saudi consul general Mohammad al-Otaibi.The 15-member team identified by Sabah are all Saudi men aged between 30 and 57 years old. Those purportedly tracked down via open source internet tools by Oslo-based researcher Iyad al-Baghdadi and others include: a Saudi special forces member a lieutenant colonel in the Saudi civil defence force a major and lieutenant in the Saudi air force a lieutenant in the service guarding the crown prince’s palace and an intelligence service colonel who had once been attached to the Saudi embassy in the UK.Kalin on the disappearance of a Saudi journalist Jamal KhashoggiMr Khashoggi served for years as the right-hand man of Saudi prince Turki bin Faisal, a former intelligence chief as well as Riyadh’s envoy to the US and UK.\u0026nbspIncreasingly frustrated with Saudi Arabia’s\u0026nbspcourse, he began to bristle at the restrictions placed on media and civil society, eventually moving to the US last year amid fears for his own safety. In recent months he had grown increasingly critical of the crown prince, who has been criticised as authoritarian despite attempts to cast himself as a reformer. Saudi officials have denied that they had anything to do with Mr Khashoggi’s disappearance, insisting he left the consulate, but without providing proof, as demanded by Mr Erdogan.\u0026nbspThe disappearance of Mr Khashoggi, a permanent US resident, has put Washington in a tough spot. The crown prince has forged a strong alliance with the administration\u0026nbspof Donald Trump and a personal bond with the US president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. US lawmakers have made tough statements about the Khashoggi affair, but the White House and State Department have been tepid. Saudi Arabia has vowed to buy $110bn in American weapons.“We’re not going to make any judgments about what had happened to him,” Heather Nauert, State Department spokeswoman, told reporters on Tuesday. “The United States is certainly concerned about his whereabouts. Senior officials at the State Department have spoken with Saudi officials through diplomatic channels about the matter. We call on the government of Saudi Arabia to conduct a thorough and transparent investigation.” Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Anyone can post in open comments.

             Brexiteer MP has STERN message for Remainers wanting to THWART BrexitThe committee, which sits in Edinburgh and examines the expenditure, administration and policy of the Scotland Office, heard how some pensions could become \u0026ldquoillegal with a no-deal Brexit.\u0026nbspAlastair Ross, of the Association of British Insurers (AIB), said: You might be in this position where it could be deemed illegal to actually pay somebody the pension that they\u0027ve paid into.This is the advice that we\u0027re getting, dependent on the attitude of the regulator of the country into which you are paying that payment.If it\u0027s considered a regulatory activity then it could be deemed illegal if you do not have consent under a no-deal scenario.That would be a very stark position, but that\u0027s the situation that we\u0027re looking at.\u0026nbspBrexit news: A no-deal Brexit could harm pensioners, finance experts claimed (Image: AFP)The AIB had already spoken against the UK leaving the EU without a deal.In a previous statement on Brexit, the organisation said such a scenario would leave insurance contracts in legal limbo, with firms unsure if they could legally pay claims for contracts drawn up before Brexit.During today\u0026rsquos hearing, Mr Ross repeated the AIB\u0026rsquos warning, saying holidaymakers could lose access to EU health insurance cards in case of a no-deal Brexit.This would put significant pressure on travel insurance premiums, while any requirement to reintroduce insurance Green Cards to enable motorists to drive in Europe could be an extensive exercise, he continued.\u0026nbsp                \u0026lsquoStubborn EU\u0027 attacked by expert for \u0027IRRATIONAL\u0027 Brexit strategyBrexit news: Donald Tusk said a no-deal Brexit is \u0027more likely than ever\u0027 (Image: )The AIB and the other organisations taking part to the meeting were asked by the committee to depict what they believe would happen \u0026ldquoto the continuity of cross-border financial contracts between the UK and EU, and what would this mean for firms and consumers.\u0026nbspConor Lawlor, of UK Finance, the trade association for the finance and banking industry, warned on the potential losses faced by firms working across the border.He said: There are about 27 trillion to 29 trillion dollars (\u0026pound20 trillion to \u0026pound22 trillion) worth of contracts agreed between the UK and the rest of the European Union.The majority of these are insurance and derivatives risk management tools that are incredibly important to supply chains and businesses across Europe.\u0026nbspBrexit news: Theresa May spoke to the Commons earlier today (Image: AFP)If the UK is unplugged from the European Union overnight, a lot of those contracts don\u0027t fall away, they\u0027re still fundamentally based on commercial or corporate law.What\u0027s difficult to do is intervene in those contracts because that would be deemed a regulated activity.In the best-case scenario it means increased costs, in the worst-case scenario it means the business can\u0027t function because a counter-party can\u0027t intervene and make the contract work in the way that it should.The committee\u0027s meeting comes as Theresa May warned parliament the UK may agree on a temporary backstop to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland

UK weather SHOCK forecast: Storm Callum to hit Britain \u0026ldquoThis spell of very cold weather looks like bringing substantial snow to a more widespread area of the country than people would necessarily expect at this time of year.\u0026ldquoWe are also forecasting some very low temperatures, we could see the record for October broken this year.Changes in the structure of the \u0026lsquoplasma layer\u0026rsquo around the sun will trigger wild deviations in the flow of the jet stream, he warned.This will encourage freezing cold air over the North Pole to spill southwards and edge into northern Europe \u0026ndash a so-called displaced Polar Vortex.Several of these events are expected to plunge Britain into freezing conditions through the coming months, Mr Corbyn added.He said: \u0026ldquoAgain we are looking at a wildly meandering jet stream driven by the onset of a period of active Earth-facing solar coronal holes.\u0026ldquoThese are not uncommon but this year is unusual in that they are facing the Earth and they are quite large, this could have a significant effect on the weather in the UK this winter.\u0026ldquoAll of this will affect the air over the North Pole and we could be looking at some pretty decent Polar Vortexes throughout winter which will have a significant effect on temperatures and snowfall.UK weather forecast: Britain is braced for heavy snowfall this month (Image:   WX CHARTS)\u0026ldquoWe could get several repeats of the severe cold weather which we saw earlier this year, or depending on when they happen, they could turn out to be worse.\u0026ldquoWe are expecting the really severe weather from the end of November onwards, so we are definitely looking at an early onset of severe winter weather this year with near-record or record low temperatures throughout the season.Other long-range forecasters agree Britain could be facing an unusually harsh winter this year with the first big freeze likely to grip the nation freakishly early.Bitter cold weather will be given an extra boost of misery by a barrage of Arctic storms set to hammer the country.While snowfall this month may be confined to high ground, flurries will start to affect lower regions before the start of winter, according to some experts.Exacta Weather\u0026rsquos James Madden said November threatens a hellish cocktail of freezing temperatures, storms and howling gales.The mercury will plunge further towards the official start of winter in December with parts of the nation even facing US-style ice storms, he added.He said: \u0026ldquoA notable pattern change towards the end of October will see a drop off in temperatures and the snow risk will significantly increase with some notable wintry weather and potential blizzards developing across higher ground in many parts of the far north.UK weather forecast: Chilly weather and snowfall will hit Britain later this month (Image: WXCHARTS)November will bring a very mixed bag of weather, and combined with unusually low temperatures we could see everything including swings from mild to very cold, strong winds and snow.\u0026ldquoThe second half of the month will turn colder still and it is then that we could start seeing snow to lower levels.\u0026ldquoLong-range forecasts have been showing for a while that December is shaping up to be colder than average and there are likely to be a number of significant snowy spells during the month.\u0026ldquoOne of these could arrive over the Christmas period and there is the possibility this could be severe in nature.\u0026ldquoJanuary is likely to hampered, again by numerous periods of snowfall, and we could be looking at a very cold month overall.\u0026ldquoThis is all intrinsically linked to a period of low solar activity impacting the jet stream and triggering Sudden Stratospheric Warming events similar to the one which led to the bitter cold period of weather just after last winter.\u0026ldquoThe sun is currently blank of sunspot activity, we would need to see a recovery of this geomagnetic activity to stay out of a blocked winter pattern later in the year, the bad news is that this is going to get no better.The UK Met Office said temperatures are likely to dip below normal for the time of year heading into November.UK weather forecast: Temperatures are set to drop in Britain this month (Image: WX CHARTS)Its 30-day outlook states: \u0026ldquoThe beginning of this period could be fairly unsettled with wet and windy weather affecting many areas, especially so across the west and northwest.\u0026ldquoHowever, there is an increasing chance that many could turn more settled towards the end of October as high pressure re-establishes.\u0026ldquoThis will bring lighter winds, with some sunshine by day but some cold nights with frost and fog. As we head towards the start of November, confidence is very low but there are signs it may turn more changeable again.\u0026ldquoTemperatures will probably be close to normal overall, but in more settled weather it is likely to be colder than average, especially overnight.Coronal holes are areas in the matter around the sun \u0026ndash its corona \u0026ndash which have a lower density compared to the rest of the corona and are therefore darker.They form part of the sun\u0026rsquos surface and are in constant motion changing and reshaping emitting solar particles at a varying rate.They are thought to exert an influence over space weather leading to disturbances and are also believed to be linked to patterns of weather on Earth.The current lowest UK temperature recorded during October is -11.7C (10.94F) recorded in 1948 in the Highlands of Scotland.

And try out the windbag oratory on the .million decent British democrats who voted to leave the European Union, and who have been told ever since that they are racist, ignorant ­bigots who should never be allowed near a polling booth.I like Bono. In person, he is a decent, thoughtful man. His band are not bad. But why do the former rebels of rock music always tug their forelocks to the European Union  Why does everyone in leather trousers act like the EU is an unalloyed good thing  Why does rock music have a blind spot when it comes to Brussels How can Bono, right, possibly mistake Jean-Claude Juncker for Joe Strummer   The EU is the ESTABLISHMENT, man! And the EU is the ­establishment at its most ­unaccountable, undemocratic, incompetent and corrupt.The EU is not a beautul thing, Bono. It is a crumbling ­expansionist empire, rotten to the core, merciless in its opposition to democracy.The EU is a gravy train, Bono, a trough for puffed-up political piggies, a sclerotic body of ­privileged old white men in suits with MEPs who do not have to provide receipts for their £,-a-month expenses. The EU really stinks, Bono.And the music that you and I grew up with — the music we loved, the music U and I were inspired by, the music we placed at the centre of our worlds — was meant to be against this kind of thing. Bono bent the knee to the bullies of Brussels in the same week that Bob Geldof sent a ­letter to Theresa May warning her that Brexit will be the day the music dies.“Imagine Britain without its music,” thundered Geldof’s letter, co-signed by musicians including Sting, Ed Sheeran, Jarvis Cocker and Damon Albarn. “If it’s hard for us, then it’s impossible for the rest of the world. Britain does rule the waves. The airwaves. But Brexit threatens, as it does so much , this vast voice.”But it is simply not true that our country owes its musical genius to the European Union. The golden years of British music were before we joined the EU — when it was still being touted to us as a common market — back in .The Beatles, the Rolling Stones, The Who, The Kinks, Pink Floyd and Led Zeppelin all somehow managed to make great music without Brussels. Now Geldof and his co-signatories seriously suggest that British music can’t survive outside the European Union.No doubt the Brexit-loathing Boomtown Rat believes this rubbish but everyone  who signed his Whinge Aid letter should have paused to think before signing. Because by claiming that Brexit will kill British music, Ed Sheeran, Sting and the rest just make themselves look like laughably out-of-touch luvvies. Not a good look for the wild boys of rock ’n’ roll.Geldof is right about one thing — British music has been brilliant for  years because our little country embraced the world.But John Lennon, Jimmy Page, Joe Strummer, Mick Jones, Ray Davies, Robert Plant, Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, Eric Clapton and Pete Townshend opened their ears and their hearts to the sounds coming out of America.The glorious music that smashed down the walls between white music and black music was born in Chicago and Nashville and Detroit and Memphis.  Its roots were in the backwoods of the Deep South and the ­Mississippi Delta, and reached all the way back to Africa. Belgium never came into it, Bob.The Rolling Stones never needed a grant from the EU. They just needed one glimpse of Buddy Holly, one listen to Muddy Waters, one nod from Elvis Presley. British bands changed the world and they sure as hell did it without the help of the European Union. Sorry, Bob. Sorry, Bono. But no British musician in history was ever inspired by the mysterious rhythms coming out of Brussels.PETER JACKSON’S new film, They Shall Not Grow Old, shows painstakingly coloured images from World War One for the very first time.Because we have only experienced World War One in black and white footage and photos, there has always felt like a huge distance between our time and the unimaginable horrors of the trenches.Lord Of The Rings director Jackson has bridged that gap and the results, above, take your breath away. He says: “The war was a colour war. You’re seeing it as they saw it. And they saw it in colour.”World War One never felt closer. And the humour, humanity and courage of the men who fought it has never been more heartbreaking.BEST wishes for the future to Trevor Engelson and his bride Tracey Kurland, who were married in a low-key ceremony in Calornia last weekend.Andyou don’t recognise the names, that is because Mr Engelson has chosen to keep a discreet silence on the subject of his two-year marriage to Meghan Markle.And in an age where every broken relationship is ­dissected on social media, isn’t it refreshing to see a man who can keep a dignied silence “WE lost the match but won the battle,” claimed Conor McGregor after his beating in last weekend’s UFC .  What planet was that victory on then, Conor To the casual fan it looked like McGregor  followed up months of denigrating Khabib Nurmagomedov with a feeble performance in the octagon and a lack of grace in defeat.True, Khabib spoilt his victory by jumping into the crowd to continue the punch-up with McGregor’s corner.  But for the le of me I can’t see how Conor McGregor can claim anything other than unconditional surrender. Neither man brought credit to MMA.There is only one reason why mainstream sports fans have been paying interest to Mixed Martial Arts in recent years and that is Conor McGregor. But after the squalid scenes around Conor v Khabib, many of us will be turning off the MMA.Even Mike Tyson was shocked. And he once bit off part of a man’s ear.WHAT my mum would have found unforgivable about Strictly star Seann Walsh snogging Katya Jones is that it happened when Walsh’s girlfriend, Rebecca Humphries, was home alone on her BIRTHDAY.My mum would never have forgiven that kind of casual cruelty from some curly-haired love rat. And I suspect the great British public will feel the same. But what we call the Strictly curse is really just an office romance that spirals out of control.People get thrown together at work all the time. The dference is that a couple from the accounts department don’t usually spend hours every day rubbing up against each other perfecting their Paso Doble.But the intense, intimate physical contact of doing Strictly makes it certain the curse will strike again.The mystery is why Katya was never led astray by Ed Balls.FEMALE terrorist, married to a British jihadi, claimed a council breached her human rights by not giving her a new home after she turned down seven homes because they were not big enough or not in the right location.Kindly Brent Council also offered her £, to put down a deposit on a home of her own.Are we insane Our welfare state was built to care for the most vulnerable members of our society.Not creatures who would spit on our society’s grave.TINA TURNER is the only female performer who was hotter live than Blondie’s Debbie Harry in her pouting, heavy-lidded prime.So it comes as some surprise to hear Tina say that she never tried to be sexy on stage. “Fishnets are practical,” Tina says primly. “They don’t run. And leather doesn’t show the perspiration on stage or wrinkle. I only wore a mini-dress because everyone knows you can’t dance in a dress that goes past your knee.”OK, Tina, we believe you – even though your practical work clothes launched a million adolescent fantasies.

This kind of thing is so commonplace that many — some as young as eight — feel street harassment is “part of growing up”. How awful is that  Partly, the problem is that somewhere along the line, the idea that schoolgirls are “sexy” has become normalised, acceptable, even mainstream.Yes, I know that the waters were somewhat muddied by the likes of Britney Spears in her Baby One More Time video and Gemma Arterton in her St Trinian’s films — both looking as sexy as heck in school unorm.  And yes, I know a lot of girls look older than they are, and might even try to do so by wearing make-up, smoking or shortening their skirts on the way to and from school.But let’s be really clear about this. — girls young enough to wear school unorm are children. And the idea of any man thinking it’s OK to wolf-whistle, chat up or give any kind of sexual attention to a girl in a unorm is not just seriously worrying. It should be a criminal offence.By the way, I wonder what a similar survey of boys would find. Because the thought of women wolf-whistling schoolboys in the street is unimaginable, right  Parents of ­secondary school children need to give them some freedom to help them on the path to adulthood.Often, that involves letting them walk unaccompanied to school.  But the idea that doing that is exposing their child to the possibility of sexual harassment will be pretty distressing to any parent.One of the saddest things about this report is how many of the girls interviewed thought this kind of behaviour is “normal”. One -year-old said she felt street harassment was part of the “bro culture” and her dad had told her: “You know what men are like.”  What kind of advice is that for your daughter Another girl, aged , said: “It’s just become normal.” But the net result of behaviour like this is that it makes girls scared of walking the streets.All too often, our response to such news is to try to protect girls by telling them not to look too ­provocative. But that just perpetuates the idea men “can’t help themselves” so it’s down to the girls, and the way they dress, to make sure they are left alone.You can’t blame girls or women for men’s behaviour, no matter what theof their skirt. But the dficult truth is that we know women do have to ­mody their behaviour, and the way they dress, to stop men from ­commenting on their appearance, harassing them or worse.Perhaps what I am most shocked about is the young age at which this starts. One good thing is that these days, girls at secondary school have phones. They can record things that happen to them and report it. Also, Plan International UK is calling on bystanders to challenge harassment when they see it.Certainly,I was around someone wolf-whistling schoolgirls, I’d flip my lid. I would not be too scared to speak my mind and verbally intervene. I think my opening ­gambit would be: “How would you feelthat were your sister, ­granddaughter or daughter some old git was harassing ”To any man reading this who thinks it’s OK to talk to schoolgirls like this, let me tell you some of these girls are terried. It’s not funny or cute. It’s threatening. Lots of teen girls look older than they are butyou are confused and in doubt, here is a clue: The school unorm is a giveaway.Any man who leers at a child in a unorm is nothing short of ­disturbed. Andthey can’t stop themselves from doing so, the law needs to intervene.AS you know, I’m a huge advocate of body acceptance and self-love but I confess to a moment of envy at model Rachel McCord’s fantastic figure.Yes, clearly she must spend most of each day at the gym . . . But you have to give credit where credit is due. And she looks amazing!ANOTHER day, another crazy promise from Labour. This time it was Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell saying a Labour government would bring in a four-day working week.This, as Treasury analysis shows, means Labour would have to borrow £trillion to bankroll its spending spree over the next ten years – the equivalent of £, for every UK household. Frankly,the Labour Party gets into power, it will end up being a zero-day week as business will collapse and there will be no jobs to go to. The simple fact is you can’t run a country or a business on a four-day week.I LOVE a good party as much as the next person.But I can’t be the only person who rolled my eyes at the claim that Coldplay frontman Chris Martin and actress Dakota Johnson hosted a “baby gender reveal party” on Sunday.Apparently, large arches of pink and blue balloons were spotted flying above a star- studded bash at Martin’s Malibu home. Moments later, blue balloons were freed into the air, presumably announcing a baby boy is on the way.The couple claim it was just her birthday party but the singer did help introduce us to the term “conscious uncoupling”. Stand by for this being a new thing . . .She was being “punished” for running away with her Hindu boyfriend.Police were reportedly called to the scene but did not make any arrests – which beggars belief, doesn’t it Stories like this are a reminder that religion can be a negative power as well as a positive.I COULDN’T agree more with Sir Anthony Seldon, above, Buckingham University’s vice-chancellor, who wants the uni to adopt an actively anti-drugs stance.My son is at Buckingham uni and they already have snfer dogs all around campus, randomly checking students. Sir Anthony says he wants to create a “psychological contract” between students and the university so undergraduates implicitly agree to shun drugs when they enrol, which I think is a brilliant idea.His approach is the opposite to Sheffield University, where the student union gave advice on how to take ious hard drugs safely. But the fact is drugs aren’t safe and they ruin lives.  Barely a week goes by without another drug death appearing in the news.Some might say a drug-free campus is unrealistic. And sure, you probably can’t stop everyone taking them.  Nor can you prevent people wanting to experiment.  But making young people really aware that drugs are not only dangerous but illegal can only be a good thing.A WRITER called Kamin Mohammadi had an Instagram rant about “manspreading” this week. And yes, I know this happens. But I think we’ve got to get better at politely asking people to just stop it.Forget gender for a moment. I think it comes down to respect: It’s just blatantly rude to invade someone ’s space and the answer, in my view, is to call the person out.  If someone’s arm is on my arm rest on a train or plane, I ask them – in the nicest possible way – to move it.Let’s not be embarrassed when it’s someone’s legs.My personal bugbear is backpacks. I called a man out for keeping his on while on a crowded Tube train this week and he was really apologetic.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

That’s why the Prime Minister’s Chequers proposal was not right.Under such a deal, we would be required to follow EU laws under the EU rule book and we would still be subject to the European Court of Justice.We would be out of Europe, yet still run by Europe. Any proposal that is brought forward and put to Parliament needs to take back control of our laws and make sure the European Court has no say over us.  So what should Theresa May do  The answer, once again, is set out clearly in the  Conservative manesto.It says: “We will seek a deep and special partnership including a comprehensive free-trade and customs agreement.”  That’s why the Prime Minister should move on from her Chequers proposal and seek an advanced free-trade deal with the EU. A comprehensive free-trade deal, like the EU’s free-trade deals with Canada and Japan, is what our manesto promises require.Such a deal would ensure we take back control of our laws, borders, money and trade. It would honour the referendum mandate. It would be in line with our manesto commitments. And it would work for the EU too. The Government’s objection to this is the supposed dficulty of keeping an open border in Northern Ireland.For this reason, Government figures claim we cannot seek a trade deal with the EU unless this problem is solved. This is nonsense.Clear proposals have been set out by two former Northern Ireland Secretaries as to how a frictionless border can be maintained under a free-trade agreement. These proposals have been endorsed by former Brexit Secretary David Davis and Good Friday Agreement architect Lord Trimble.Moreover, former Cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith has set out how we can build on the system of joint border controls at Dover to avoid delays or friction at the UK’s borders — including in Ireland. This would work for the EU’s rules and ensure a positive future relationship going forward.This approach is not simply a bad use of taxpayers’ money. It breaks another manesto pledge.For our  manesto says “it is necessary to agree the terms of our future partnership alongside our withdrawal, reaching agreement on both within two years” of our serving notice to leave the EU. In other words, by the end of March next year.So it is wrong for the Government to agree withdrawal terms without sorting out the full detail of our future relationship. A temporary fix does not honour the referendum mandate, it does not keep our manesto promise and it certainly fails to look after our hard-earned money.Moreover, would this temporary fix really be temporary  Just ask the people of Norway how such a deal turned out for them. In  they signed the European Economic Area Agreement. They were told by the EU their sovereignty would be respected. Yet  years later, this “temporary” arrangement has become permanent.Meanwhile, the cost has increased ten-fold and nearly , EU directives and regulations have been implemented through Norway’s EEA agreement.Our Government should fear to tread such a dangerous path. Voters will not tolerate any “temporary” arrangement becoming permanent. They would see it as a betrayal. People voted to leave the EU because they wanted change. They believed in Britain and the land of opportunity we can build. They voted to take back control of our laws, money, borders and trade.The Conservative manesto promised that we would leave the EU altogether. That we would seek a free-trade deal and a new national future.Now is the time for the Government to honour the referendum mandate and the Conservative manesto by seeking a free­-trade deal with the EU that enables Britain to become an economic powerhouse in the decades to come.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We risk being sold down the river.Barring a last-minute revolt by Tory Brexiteers, Brussels has won and we have lost. The world’s sixth-largest economy will not just be worse off outside the EU, but reduced to a powerless political pawn on its margins — and paying for it.Sniggering can be heard across the capitals of Europe, with France guffawing loudest. The British Lion is a toothless kitten and we are the laughing stock of Europe.Unless stopped by her Cabinet, her MPs or by Parliament itself, this Prime Minister seems to be leading us to the greatest defeat since the Norman Conquest in , the last time we capitulated to a foreign power.The ransom demanded for our degrading humiliation — £BILLION of taxpayers’ money — is merely a down payment. The botched Chequers deal will bind this country in subordination to Europe.Forget about becoming a sovereign, free-trading nation. We will accept EU rules indefinitely while having no say at all in their terms or conditions. In effect, our economy will be run by Brussels, not by our democratically elected government.For an example of missed opportunities and failed leadership, this beats even last year’s election disaster, which wasted the first Tory majority for  years and put Marxist Labour within grasp of power.Worse, it now seems the PM’s apparent last-ditch capitulation was stitched up months ago behind closed doors after a dodgy threat by car giants to leave the UK.Now the Tory party is in uproar, with cries for a leadership contest. Downing Street is stupidly threatening a snap election. Nobody buys that except Jeremy Corbyn, who is licking his lips at the scent of power. Ministers, like frogs in a pot, are sizing up whether to jump or stew. Careers will be made or broken.At least three — and maybe six — are threatening to quit at tomorrow’s Cabinet unless Theresa blinks. Tory MPs are close to triggering a leadership fight, with sketchy plans for a quick and ruthless contest. “We have the numbers,” says one Tory MP.“If anything the mood is hardening, not softening.”Ex-Brexit secretary David Davis, the first rebel to quit Cabinet, will certainly run, infuriating Boris Johnson, who thinks it should be him. Once the gun is fired, half the Cabinet and plenty of hopefuls will join in.Everyone deserves blame, including Brexiteers who assumed the game was over after their victorious out vote and abandoned the field. Remainers are at fault for refusing to accept the will of the people — and the shortcomings of their beloved EU.But it is Downing Street, and Theresa May personally, who must take responsibility. Mrs May has dreamed of being Prime Minister since she was a child.It’s a tough job. It means leading from the front, making swt decisions and rallying the country with confidence and authority in dficult times.Instead, Mrs May’s team talk like defeatists about parliamentary “arithmetic”. How can she push through a dficult Brexit against ferocious opposition without a commanding Commons majority  But who was responsible for that parliamentary arithmetic It was Theresa May alone who decided to call an unforced election and it was she who single-handedly blew it. Her only task was to deliver the referendum mandate handed to her by .million voters. She blew that, too.People knew the risks. They did not vote for us to stay half-in, half-out or to see our sovereignty handed over to foreign powers. To govern is to decide.

After all, as we remember from school, this ancient British queen rose up against the Roman Empire, winning battles, slaughtering enemies and forcing the Romans to contemplate leaving Britain all together.“But, hang on,” I replied. “Wasn’t Boudicca eventually defeated ”Whatever the details, my friend was right. It is time for Theresa May to call on her deepest reserves of defiance and stand up to the European Union.Brussels has rejected her Brexit proposals, insulted us at the recent Salzburg summit and wants to dismember the United Kingdom by effectively annexing Northern Ireland for itself.Theresa May’s respect towards the EU has been met consistently with contempt for Britain. She has wished Brussels every success, while they wish us nothing but failure and decline. She has suggested solutions while they point out problems. And she has taken her Government to the brink by proposing a future relationship that is hated by many of her own MPs and supporters.It is time, now, to stop.Her Chequers plan already goes too far. It would tie us to European laws, over which we would have no say, and force us to accept the rulings of the European Court of Justice.It would prevent us from taking our own decisions and making our economy more competitive. And it almost certainly stops us from striking our own trade deals.Worse still,the Government persists with Chequers, we will end up with something even worse: Chequers Minus, which could mean making annual payments to Brussels, complying with more EU laws and accepting liberal immigration rules that amount to continued free movement.The longer we pretend Chequers can survive, the worse the outcome will be. As we negotiate the Withdrawal Agreement, Britain should be seeking watertight assurances about our future relationship. Without them, we will sign away a £billion orce payment without any confidence we will get a fair deal for the future.But the crisis the Prime Minister described to Parliament yesterday, and which the Cabinet will discuss today, is not about Chequers, but the so-called “backstop” — what should happen to Northern Irelandthere is no eventual agreement on the future relationship.The EU’s proposition is an outrage. If there is no deal on the future relationship, they expect Northern Ireland to remain inside the Customs Union and, in effect, the single market.That would mean, in trying to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic, we would create a hard border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. That’s right, a border within our own country to avoid having one with another.The backstop would mean politicians in the Republic have a say over laws in Northern Ireland, while politicians in Belfast and London would have none. And it effectively breaches the Good Friday Agreement, which demands that Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom is respected unless a majority of Northern Irish people vote for the reunication of Ireland.The one concession the EU seems willing to make is that the whole of the United Kingdom can remain inside the Customs Union, not just Northern Ireland.But it insists there can be no time limit, and no right for the UK to unilaterally withdraw from the backstop.In other words, we would be trapped inside the Customs Union — following laws over which we have no say, letting Brussels grant trading access to our market for other countries and leaving us unable to agree trade deals of our own — for ever.This, of course, has always been the EU’s game. They have cynically used the Northern Irish peace process to try to tie the whole of the United Kingdom to the EU’s rules and regulations. And in their naivety, our negotiators have walked straight into the trap.The PM needs to tell the EU to get stuffed. And she must go back to the drawing board. She must replace Chequers with an ambitious, Canada Plus, free trade agreement between the UK and the EU. She must insist that the Northern Irish solution lies with technology and policy that avoid checks at the border. And she must tear up the backstop.One alternative, still a compromise for Brexiteers like me, is to agree that the UK will remain inside the Customs Union for a period of up to five years while the appropriate systems are put into place.Critics will say the EU will never agree. Butthey cannot accept a trade deal consistent with their principles and which respects the integrity of their single market, we know they seek only a damaging deal for Britain, or no deal at all.Others will say the Government could not get this kind of plan through the Commons. But it stands a better chance than Chequers Minus.This was, in fact, the plan Theresa May first set out at Lancaster House in January .There, she warned against a Chequers-style deal, saying: “We do not seek to hold on to bits of membership as we leave” and “we will not have truly leftwe are not in control of our own laws”.And she warned against what the backstop demands. She insisted on creating “no new barriers to living and doing business within our own Union”, and warned against “an unlimited transitional status”, which she called a “kind of permanent political purgatory”.Instead, she sought “a comprehensive free trade agreement” and the freedom for “Britain to negotiate its own trade agreements” with other countries.In other words, she described the Canada Plus agreement that is prepared and drafted but gathering dust inside the Brexit Department.Many years ago, The Sun advised us to say “up yours, Delors” to a meddling European Commissioner.

Now ministers are set to use the time to fix problems in the system - but the programme wont be halted or scrapped.A series of documents revealed that a whole raft of new changes could be coming to make the transition easier for Brits -they are signed off by the Treasury.It comes after a revolt by Tory backbenchers who demanded that extra cash be put in to soften the blow for Brits on benefits.Plans have been drawn up to spend hundreds of millions of pounds to continue paying some benefits to claimants for two weeks after their new Universal Credit claim has been made.Housing benefit tenants can already get this two week space, after reports of Brits going into debt at last years Budget.The documents also revealed that more help would be given to the self employed, and that the advance payments will be spread out and paid back over a longer amount of time.Labours shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said today the news was proof that the government have quietly accepted that their flagship social security programme isnt working.She went on: The Government must stop the roll out of Universal Credit immediately. We need urgent answers from Esther McVey about whats going on and what action the Government will take to tackle the many flaws in the system.Dame Louise Casey said the design was flawed from the outset and it had pushed people further and further into debt because it tried to force people to be paid monthly.She told Radio : The poorest people are often paid weekly and fortnightly - those are the people we need to help... Civil servants are telling ministers this is a mess, and it needs fixing.If you are experiencing trouble applying for your Universal Credit, or the payments just dont cover it, here are your options:Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently , or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussel Trust website.Even Philippa Stroud, who used to work for the DWP, added that more money needed to be pumped in to offset cuts: Universal Credit is the right mechanism for delivering welfare, but it needs the investment restored.Campaigners including Citizens Advice welcomed the proposed moves, but said that it wouldnt solve all of the problems.Universal Credit aims to roll six benefits into one monthly payment, but the controversial new programme has been hit by a string of problems.First announced in , it was meant to be fully up and running by  - this has now been pushed back to .The new system had also been attacked for taking weeks for claimants to get their first payment, and for stopping domestic abuse victims from leaving their partners as benefits are now only paid into one account per family.Analysis from Labour revealed yesterday that Universal Credit sanctions hit Brits under  the hardest.A Department for Work and Pensions statement said today that it would be putting back the rollout.A spokesperson said: We have long said that we will take a slow and measured approach to managed migration. This will not begin in January , but later in the year, after a period of preparation.For a further year we will then begin migration working with a maximum of , people, continuing with our ‘test and learn’ approach. This is to ensure the system is working well for claimants and to make any necessary adaptions as we go.We will publish full plans for the next stage of Universal Credit rollout, including managed migration, in due course. Anything before that point is speculation and we do not comment on leaks.Claimants are able to get some cash within five days or on the same day they make a claim in emergency cases - rather than waiting weeks for their first Universal Credit payment.But the upfront payment is a loan which means youll have to pay it back.The repayments will be automatically deducted from your Universal Credit payments after youve taken the loan.You should ask for the advanceyou dont think youll have enough money to live on between when you apply and when youll get your first payment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NINTCHDBPICT000394310731.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"samantha markle meghan royal baby pregnancy","story":"Samantha Markle, who learned of the baby by a text from her father as she holidays in Ireland, says that the new arrival changes everything.She told The Sun: “It just makes everything that happened over the last year disappear.

Or you could view it as an act of indulgence by people charged with leading our country through the most important negotiations undertaken in more than seven decades. Either way, it is further proof that the Conservatives’s self interest has always taken precedence over the national interest when it comes to Brexit. Brazenly holding a Cabinet within the Cabinet is not just taking the pizza out of Theresa May. It shows a contempt for those who expect ministers to show some collective responsibility at a key moment in the negotiations. These same ministers will smile for the cameras as they head to No  this morning for a Cabinet meeting that will be dominated by Brexit. Mrs May’s isolation was underlined when she gave her statement to the Commons yesterday.Her tone was noticeably more conciliatory than the plastic Britannia act after the Salzburg debacle. What was less clear was whom the intended audience was.At first it appeared she was trying to buy time from the Tory Brexiteers by recognising their concerns over a lack of an end date to any backstop .This was, she claimed, an insurance to an insurance policy which she hoped never to use. But Conservative eurosceptics quickly smelt a rat and peppered the PM with questions on,the backstop were to be used, would it be time-limited. Mrs May ducked these questions but then gave the game away in answer to an excellent question from Labour’s Pat McFadden. The backstop would be there “for the time until the future relationship can come into place”, she replied. Incidentally, she also used her answer to rule out any Canada-style trade deal, further angering the Tory Brexiteers.

The Prime Minister declared that years of cruel Tory cuts were over in her conference speech this month - and promised voters that “better days” lie ahead. But the Institute for Fiscal Studies said she would need to magic up a massive poundbillion a year just to achieve a “minimal definition” of ending austerity. And evenshe achieved the impossible that would still leave a devastating poundbillion worth of savage cuts to social security. Ahead of the Budget at the end of this month, the IFS also said Mrs May’s boast of ending austerity was “incompatible” with Philip Hammond’s vow to balance the books by his mid-s target.  The IFS said that in order to find an extra poundbillion the Chancellor would have to increase taxes the equivalent of one penny on income tax, National Insurance and VAT. Its report also said there will be “virtually no Brexit idend” to relieve spending pressure on Mr Hammond. Even without taking into account the likely hit to tax revenues following Brexit, the Treasury can expect only a “modest” poundbillion-a-year saving on EU contributions by  . This figure would “easily” be outweighed by additional spending on bureaucracy, such as new border guards, experts said. Unless economic growth is much better than expected, Mr Hammond will face the choice between “substantial” tax hikes or ditching his target of balancing the books by the mid-s. If the Chancellor chooses to fund the end of austerity by raising taxes by % of national income, this would bring the overall tax burden close to its highest level since the end of the Second World War - though it would still be in the middle of the range for developed industrial countries. Even poundbillion of tax increases by   would be enough only to meet existing commitments on additional funding for health, defence and aid - including the the first three years of the five-year poundbillion boost promised to the NHS - while halting real-terms cuts in other areas, said the respected economic think tank.  And this would still leave social security cuts totalling poundbillion to work their way through the system. Describing this goal as “a minimal definition of the end of austerity”, the IFS warned: “Unless there are substantial tax rises, or much-better-than-expected economic growth, the Prime Minister’s aim of ‘ending austerity’ is unlikely to be compatible with the Chancellor’s aim of balancing the books by the mid-s.” This leaves Mr Hammond with “the toughest of circles to square” in his October  Budget and next year’s Spending Review, said IFS director Paul Johnson. The IFS found that the Government has already committed to poundbillion of additional spending on health, defence and aid between   and  . To end austerity, it would also have to halt poundbillion worth of cuts to day-to-day spending in other departments planned for next year, along with a further poundbillion pencilled in for the years to  . Mr Hammond could find this poundbillion sum by hiking every rate of income tax, all National Insurance contributions and the main rate of VAT by p each, said the report. But it also set out a series of alternative tax hikes to target the pain on better-off members of the older generation, including:Ending the practice of writing off Capital Gains Tax on assets in a deceased person’s estate, estimated in  to cost poundmillion a year Abolition of Entrepreneurs Relief, which cost pound.billion in   Charging employee National Insurance contributions on those over state pension age, raising around pound.billion Reforming the “indefensibly generous” treatment of pension pots bequeathed after death, which are not subject to taxthe holder dies before the age of  Reforming council tax so bills are proportional to the value of a property, with a potential poundbillion a year raisedrates on the top four bands were doubled.Mr Johnson said Mr Hammond’s tax and spend choices for the next spending review period, beginning in , will be “the biggest non-Brexit-related decision this Chancellor will make”. “He has a big choice. He could end austerity, as the Prime Minister has suggested. “But even on a limited definition of what that might mean would imply spending poundbillion a year more than currently planned by the end of the Parliament.

Her confession suggests the vast majority of the UKs .million existing benefit claimants will not begin so-called managed migration until then. Now the BBC reports this move will extend UCs estimated finish date from March  to December , the ninth delay to the rollout. And a document leaked to the Corporation also reveals a string of measures to offer people more help.Hard-up families could now get higher transition payments and lower loan repayments after UC drove desperate people to rent arrears, food banks and prostitution.But crucially, there is NO mention of a halt to the rollout or any change to the taper rate - a core problem with the hated policy. Universal Credit is driving women to prostitution says MP Frank Field in astonishing plea to Esther McVeyInstead, according to the document obtained by the BBC, government officials plan to:Continue paying income support, ESA and jobseekers allowance for two weeks after someone makes a UC claim Reduce deductions when some is paying back an advance loan from % to % of monthly benefit Give more help to the self-employed after warnings the policy will force struggling firms to close altogether.The changes would reportedly cost hundreds of millions of pounds . But an extract from the document also warns the changes might not even be possible.We can currently offer no assurance that ultimately these proposals will prove to be deliverable, can survive legal challenges where they can be delivered, and do not invite new political criticism by generating new policy issues, it says, according to the BBC. Critics are likely to say the measures - which have emerged a year after a separate pound.bn package of tweaks - are not enough. There is no commitment to halt the rollout, and no mention in the BBCs report of the taper rate. Universal Credit is handed over in one payment, which tapers away by p for every extra pound people earn above pound a month. Critics have complained that this is too steep and leaves families worse off. Citizens Advice chief executive Gillian Guy said the leaked measures could reduce” hardship. But she warned: “These measures alone will not solve all of the problems. The government must make changes to ensure no one is left without enough to get by.” Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Margaret Greenwood said: “The Government must stop the roll out of Universal Credit immediately. We need urgent answers from Esther McVey about whats going on and what action the Government will take to tackle the many flaws in the system.

But they conceded the phasing of that migration was open to change - and a spokesman confirmed the department would work with a maximum of , people in the first year. Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey, who last week admitted some UC claimants will be worse off, has repeatedly said she was looking at further changes to the system. Yesterday she told MPs: Under the process of managed migration, the roll-out will be slow and measured. It will start not in January , but later in the year. For a further year we will be learning as we go with a small amount of people - maybe , - to ensure that the system is right. More than , people have signed the Mirrors petition to halt the rollout. The Mirror are demanding a halt to the expansion of Universal Credit and for a review to take place. We say there are three options:Redesign UC to be fit for purpose Axe it in favour of the old systemUC is unfixable Introduce a brand new systemSign our petition to stop the rollout of Universal Credit across Britain and to replace it with a fairer system by signing our petition. A DWP spokeswoman confirmed: “We have long said that we will take a slow and measured approach to managed migration. This will not begin in January , but later in the year, after a period of preparation. For a further year we will then begin migration working with a maximum of , people, continuing with our ‘test and learn’ approach. This is to ensure the system is working well for claimants and to make any necessary adaptions as we go.” The spokeswoman added: “We will publish full plans for the next stage of Universal Credit rollout, including managed migration, in due course. Anything before that point is speculation and we do not comment on leaks.

News of Meghans pregnancy was made public just hours after the couple landed in Sydney to begin their royal tour of Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga. Fans of the royal family were overjoyed at the happy news, which came just days after the UK celebrated Princess Eugenies wedding . However, some people couldnt help but draw a connection with the timing of the babys arrival and another massive change going on in the UK at the moment. Self-confessed cynics on Twitter thought the timing of the news couldnt possibly be a coincidence - because the baby would arrive at around the same time the UK will leave the European Union.  The baby news and wide media coverage would be a welcome distraction from what is likely to be Britain crashing out without a deal. Jason Wells even tweeted to Theresa May saying: Ahh bless! A new Royal baby conveniently arriving around the time of Brexit . Bet its just a crazy coincidence! Congrats! Another wrote: Call me a raving cynic, but isnt it funny that when a crucial point in the Brexit negotiations is reached theres another royal baby announcement  The news came the same morning it was revealed Theresa May will be forced to make an urgent statement after Brexit talks with the EU hit a deadlock. This morning the DUP, her key allies, declared a no-deal Brexit is probably inevitable. Still, the news of Meghans pregnancy was welcomed by many on social media.  One wrote on Twitter: Lovely news to awake up .. a little one on the way for Harry  Meghan. Dont understand the ugliness that such beautul news brings. A loving couple adding a child to their loving family seems like a beautul thing .. whoever that couple is! Only much happiness for all! Another said: With so much discord and sadness in the world, its so lovely to hear some good news. A new baby is a reminder of hope. Congratulations Harry and Meghan. Others were happy for the couple but still deeply suspicious about the timing, writing: Brilliant timing again - the new royalbabywill be born in the spring. So thatll be about the time of Brexit and the peoples minds and media will be distracted. Coincidence  Some jokingly suggested the loved-up couple should name their baby Brexit. Harry and Meghan have made no secret of the fact they wanted to start a family.  The prince said in : “I’d love to have kids right now.” He added in his engagement interview: “One step at a time. Hopefully we’ll start a family in the near future.” Meghan also confided in ex-agent Gina Nelthorpe-Cowne, saying: “I’d absolutely love to have children, and I can’t wait to be a mother.” Kensington Palace announced that Harry and Meghan are expecting their child on Twitter this morning.

The couple were formally welcomed to Australia by his Excellency General the Honourable Sir Peter Cosgrove and his we, Lady Cosgrove, on the lawns of the historic building, which offers spectacular views across Sydney Harbour. The couple were given presents of a toy kangaroo and her joey, which prompted Meghan to exclaim: Our first baby gt! They were also given a pair of baby Uggs which Harry said were “awesome”.  During their visit to Taronga Zoo, the pair were presented with more gts, which Meghan said would go in the nursery.There, the Duke spoke of the importance of zoos, telling donors, zoo staff and  volunteers aged - from Youth at the Zoo programme: Zoos in the st century, they have to modernise with everything  thats going on around them.Taronga Zoo seems to be leading the way. Zoos across the world, those that are still going, who have still got the funding, have got a lot to learn from a place like this. Before the ribbon cutting, Meghan appeared to realise she was still holding her coat and moved towards an aide to take it as a member of the crowd shouted Ill look after it!  As Cameron Kerr, director of the Taronga Conservation Socety, gave the couple the platypus pins, which are the logo of the zoo, he spoke of how zoologists originally thought the mammal was a joke when it was first brought to the UK. He said: When the first people from England came to Australia and sent one back to a British museum, they rejected it and said they are making fun of us. Theyve sown a couple of dferent animals together.  The Duke and Duchess of Sussex took to the water to see spectacular Sydney by boat. Prince Harry and Meghan climbed aboard a water transfer - Admiral Hudson flying the White ensign of the Royal Australian Navy - after the visit to Taronga Zoo for a  minutes crossing of the harbour to the Sydney Opera house. The royal couple - wearing sun glasses on a glorious sunny day - disembarked at Man O’War Steps, the landing point for British and Australian fleets for  years.

Research has found that only . percent of drivers are claiming to have modications on their vehicle, suggesting drivers simply may not be declaring any added extras. GoCompare are warning motorists to double check what the factory standard is for your cars model, and let insurers know of any changes made.  Matt Oliver, spokesperson for GoCompare car insurance, said: “While modications may ring bells of the bygone boy racer, it’s worth remembering that insurers don’t just class body kits, exhaust systems or suspension changes as vehicle modications. “The average used car buyer could find there are modications they’re simply not aware of. Typically, modications are anything which isn’t standard on a car, which could include alloy wheels, a satellite navigation system or even tinted windows – so it’s always worth checking what the factory standard is for your model of car to avoid landing in hot water when it comes to making a claim. “Under two percent of drivers are claiming to have car modications, but we estimate this figure to be much greater, which leaves potentially millions of drivers open to invalidating their insurance and having their claims rejected.  Mr Oliver added: “Dferent insurers have dferent views on what constitutes a modication – so it’s always wise to tell your insurer of changes or additions you make to your vehicle at the time of making them. “Otherwise you could find yourself in the situation of having a claim rejected and possibly your car insurance declared void - that could affect your ability to be insured full stop, and not only for car insurance. “Shop around and look for the best deal that suits you and your car, andin doubt, check the service history for any modication and speak to your insurance provider.” "},{"url":null,"title":"sweet moment prince harry struggles","story":"NewsSweet moment Prince Harry struggles to say \"baby\" out loud as he gives royal tour speechThe Duke of Sussex couldnt quite get the word out as he addressed the big announcementShareCommentsByZoe ShentonUS Showbiz Editor :,  OCT Updated:,  OCT Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video huge-round-applause-harry-brings-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get Royal Family updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Prince Harry said he couldnt think of a better place to announce the royal baby news while giving a speech at a reception hosted by the Governor-General and Lady Cosgrove at Admiralty House on Tuesday.The Royal couple met with a host of people from a broad range of sectors including charity, sports, community and entertainment following a day of outdoor engagements.

He seemed to be missing twin brother Kalan, who lay  miles away in a hospital incubator with fluid forming on his brain. The tots were born severely premature, leaving them with a chronic lung condition which kept them in intensive care for the first six months of their lives. While Kian had developed into a healthy, happy boy, he was not content without his sibling. Remembering Kalan’s time at Great Ormond Street Hospital in London, the boys’ carer Paulette, , says they couldn’t wait to be reunited. “Kian missed his brother so much,” she smiles. “He would get up in the morning and look over at his cot. “He would start to wake up much earlier, searching around for his brother. It was obvious he really missed him.” Kalan is now out of hospital and the one-year-old twins are playing with their favourite matching toy crocodiles once again. But there is still something missing in their young lives. Kian and Kalan are two of thousands of children waiting to find their for ever home. The twins are living with a foster carer but authorities have taken the unusual step of calling for prospective families to come forward in the hope of finding someone to adopt them. Paulette is desperate for the pair to find a loving new family.  She says: “Children with health problems can find it dficult to find homes and it is harder for twins to find people willing to adopt them together. “But the last thing we would want to do is split Kian and Kalan up. They really are two peas in a pod. “I would say to whoever is considering adopting them, they have had a sad start to le but they really need a home and a family that will nurture and stimulate them. They are very clever, determined and lovable. “It’s important for them to have a home where they can stay for ever.” Kian and Kalan were born in January last year,  weeks premature and weighing just lb oz each. As a result, the non-identical twins developed chronic lung disease and had to spend six months in a London hospital.  While Kian has recovered, Kalan suffered a build-up of fluid on his brain known as post-haemorrhagic hydrocephalus with a subgaleal shunt. It can cause long-term complications, including learning disabilities and memory issues. He will have regular check-ups for the rest of his le. When Paulette, who has two grown-up children, met the boys in hospital, they were still on oxygen in intensive care and taking a lot of medication. “There are still some uncertainties about Kalan’s future due to their premature birth,” she says. “But he is a very gentle and contained character, and content to play by himself. “Although, of course, he loves reading and playing – and fighting – with his brother! “When I walked into the hospital and saw them I knew I had to look after them, they looked so helpless. I spent a week in hospital learning how to give them their medication and getting to know them.” But since they came out of hospital in June last year, Kalan has suffered health issues. Just before Christmas, he was in a hospital for a month after a seizure and developing hydrocephalus. He is now back home and getting better every day.  You can help more kids get a second chance Comment by Damian Hinds, Education Secretary If ever a week had the potential to change lives, it is this one. National Adoption Week is about giving children who have had a tough start in le a second chance. And I can’t think of anything more worthwhile than that. Being a dad to three wonderful children has brought me so much joy. But there are many children who don’t have a family to give them the love and care they need. Right now, there are more than , waiting to be adopted by families, hoping to find the loving and stable home so many of us sometimes take for granted. What we are looking for is a erse mix of prospective adopters from a range of backgrounds, who reflect our rich and vibrant society. It’s great that we have seen the number of children adopted by same-sex couples almost double since . But there is more to be done and I encourage as many people as possible to consider adopting. What kind of person makes a good adoptive parent  You need what any parent needs – to give the child unlimited love, time, patience, understanding and support. You also need to stand up for them, see their positive qualities, even when times may be hard, and support them to live happy, fulfilled childhoods. You don’t need to be rich, all you need is total commitment. There is extra help available for families who need it. Many of these kids will have had a traumatic start in le.

The -year-old, who lives in alone in a flat on the Mexican resort of Rosarito Beach, in the US, is believed to have been told the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were expecting only a short time before the rest of the world.Within a statement released by Kensington Palace yesterday morning, Doria Ragland said she was very happy about this lovely news and looks forward to welcoming her first grandchild.Hours later, Mr Markle pronounced himself overjoyed. But, according to reports, Meghan did not deliver the momentous news to her father. Instead, Doria is believed to have made the call.  It would seem by publishing scathing open letters to both Meghan and Prince Harry, staging pre-wedding paparazzi photographs and giving live interviews, Mr Markle has ostracised himself from his daughters le.According to the Daily Mail, he has written a letter to the happy couple regarding the pregnancy in which he told Meghan she would make a great mother because - despite their recent dficulties - he believed she remained a very loving and compassionate woman.He thinks she will be naturally maternal, the source added. He said he had been remembering when Doria found out she was pregnant with Meg, and how emotional he felt. He only hopes he can share some of the joy.  Royal aides have remained tight lipped over whether Meghan and Harry had told the Duchess’s father, Thomas Markle, of the news before the big announcement yesterday. Meghan has not spoken to her father since her May wedding to Harry after he admitted to a string of shameful secrets, including staging pictures with a paparazzi for cash and confessing to taking cocaine when she was a child. In a TV interview a month after the Duke and Duchess married, he revealed: She’s wanted children for a long time and when she met Harry and she spoke about how much she loves him, there’s got to be a child in the making, somewhere soon. As Meghans relationship with Prince Harry has developed since their first blind date, her relationship with Mr Markle has deteriortated.  Two years ago, she paid a touching tribute to him with a public post on Fathers Day. She wrote: Happy Fathers Day, daddy. Im still your buckaroo and to this day your hugs are still the very best in the whole wide world. Thanks for my work ethic, my love of Busby Berkeley films  club sandwiches, for teaching me the importance of handwritten thank you notes and giving me the signature Markle nose. I love you. It would seem that closeness is no more. Mr Markle already has five grandchildren by his son, Thomas Junior, and daughter, Samantha Grant. But it remains unknown whether he will ever meet his sixth.

The hilarious mistake also contained a section of Latin and an RSVP button. Its not clear exactly how many recipients there were to the cat pyjama party event. Gavin Sundwall, the public affairs counselor at the US Mission to Australia, chalked the gaffe up to a training error. He said the mistake was made by a new staff member who was testing out our email newsletter .  “Sorry to disappoint those of you who were hoping to attend this cat pajama-jam party,” Sundwall wrote in a light-hearted follow-up email two days later, according to the AAP. But such an event falls well outside our area of expertise. People on social media have found the mistake hilarious. One person tweeted a picture of their cat reading the news story on an Ipad, captioned: Joeys upset that the cat pajama-jam wont be happening.  Some people are adamant that an apology for the gaffe wasnt necessary, with one person writing: Never apologize for a Cat Pajama Jam! Others are simply keen to attend the fake event, with one person writing: I would like to rsvp yes to the cat pajama-jam.

story of three decades in the jute world","story":"In her -year career in the jute industry she has produced everything from shrouds to hotpants.Today, Sandra Thompson-McGregor is the managing director of McGregor Balfour Textiles Ltd and her Dundee-based business has travelled across the globe.Sandra , from Broughty Ferry, was born in Kolkata, India, where her father James Davidson ran a thriving company which provided spare parts for jute factory machinery.She said: “I was sent to Beacon School for Girls in Stirling when I was very young and my family were living in India.“I used to go from Edinburgh to London, London to Amsterdam and Amsterdam to Kolkata – not bad for an eight-year-old.”The family moved to Dundee when Sandra was .She went to school at Grove Academy and later worked for the Education Department in Perth. But her le would change forever in  when her father died suddenly at his desk at the age of .Sandra, who spoke about her experiences during a recent talk at Stobsweell’s Boomerang Centre, said: “I went back to close the company with my mother – that was  years ago and I’m still trying to close McGregor Balfour.“My father worked with the company for  years and my grandfather was a jute mill manager out in India for  years. Maybe it was in my blood.”With no experience in the jute industry whatsoever, Sandra took the company over.She said: “At that time, a lot of companies had started to import jute and carpet yarn.“I thought, I can do that – I can speak the language out in India.“You just need to get them to send something on a boat and I’ll just have to sell it – it seemed simple to me until I started.”But le was to become more dficult.Many companies in the city stopped trading in jute and moved on to polypropylene in the mid s.Sandra said: “It was a very hard time in Dundee, a horrible time.”India’s jute workers later went on strike for six months and all work was put on hold.Sandra said: “I should have shut my doors too and made a run for it but my father would’ve been furious.”When the mills in India went back to work in the late s, Sandra was sent  massive containers of jute and it took her nearly two years to sell the lot.She said: “I was lying in my bed thinking, I have to shut now, I really have to shut.”One day Sandra came up with a plan – she decided to sell jute in a way no one ever had.Her many ventures included selling hats, bird boxes and shrouds made out of jute.She even sent a pair of tartan hotpants to Sean Connery.Her work eventually took her back to India.She said: “When my mother was out in India, all the millhouses were beautul.“Now they’re all rundown like The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.“I went off to see one of the oldest family-run jute mills in Kolkata. The noise was absolutely deafening and the machinery was so old it went on fire – people were beating it out.“None of the men working the machines had shoes on or wore hearing protectors.”McGregor Balfour Textiles Ltd now mainly sells bags made out of jute.Sandra plans to retire soon. She said: “I’m very lucky that I love what I do.“I’ve had a lot of ups and downs in my le, but it’s all made me a stronger person.”"},{"url":null,"title":"have you seen gordon","story":"Police have issued an appeal to trace a missing man last seen in Dundee.Gordon Gerrard, , was last seen at around .pm on Sunday in the Mill o# Mains area.He is described as being approximately ft ins in height, of stocky build, with blue eyes, grey short hair and wears glasses.The -year-old was last seen wearing a green waterproof jacket, brown and white checked shirt, brown jumper, brown cord trousers and brown shoes.The police statement said: #Gordon#s family and police are growing increasingly concerned for his welfare and would therefore urge anyone with information to contact Police Scotland on  or provide information anonymously via Crime Stoppers on    quoting incident number PS--.#"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/15507960-763x564.jpg ","title":"kilmarnock star jordan jones faces two match ban over alleged dive against dundee","story":"Kilmarnock winger Jordan Jones has been charged with ing by the Scottish Football Association.Jones has been hit with a notice of complaint over the penalty incident which led to his team’s winner at Dundee on Saturday and faces a two-match banthe case is proven.Dundee manager Neil McCann insisted there was no contact after Jones went down under the attention of Cammy Kerr before Eamonn Brophy netted from the spot to earn KIllie a - win.The SFA charge said: “No player shall cause a match official to make an incorrect decision and or support an error of judgement on the part of a match official by an act of simulation which results in that player’s team obtaining a substantial advantage.”Jones will face a hearing tomorrow.He will miss Ladbrokes Premiership games against St Mirren and Hamiltonthe charge is upheld.Dundee fans# group writes to top officials over referee Steven McLean#s links to Kilmarnock\" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-fans-group-writes-to-top-officials-over-referee-steven-mcleans-links-to-kilmarnock embed # secretBSNUfzww\" data-secret\"BSNUfzww\" width\"\" \"\" title\"#Dundee fans# group writes to top officials over referee Steven McLean#s links to Kilmarnock# # Evening \" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\""},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/10/Cow-stock-image.jpg ","title":"major traffic disruption on key dundee road to last another four weeks","story":"Dundee motorists are set to face major traffic disruption on the A for the next four weeks.The project got under way on Sunday and is involving surfacing works across three locations between Claypotts junction and Elliot roundabout at Arbroath.Eddie Ross, operating company representative for BEAR Scotland, said the work was “essential to ensure the continued safe use of this stretch of the A”.Project bosses have tried to ensure there will be minimum disruption to road users with work taking place overnight between pm-am, Sunday-Friday.No work will take place on Friday and Saturday nights.During the operation sections of the A will be closed overnight with traffic erted locally.The majority of the project will take place using a mph convoy system to keep road users as well as motorists safe.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute. It is our country’s most pressing public health issue – one we must address now, collectively.Scotland has made a lot of progress over the past  years, including a guarantee of a year’s post-diagnostic support, better education and training for staff in health and social care and better standards of care for people with dementia in hospitals.There is still, however, an unacceptable gap between national policy and dementia care and support in our communities.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

Torrential rain did not dampen spirits or performances and once again the organisers upheld their reputation as a sporting event that promotes local community participation balanced with fierce and friendly sporting competition to attract some of the best triathletes from across Scotland. Affiliated to Tri-Scotland, the national body for triathlon in Scotland, the event is now a regular fixture on the national event calendar.It was not a day for personal bests being set, but all athletes exceeded their expectations spurred on by tremendous support from friends, families and club mates adding to the atmosphere.The winners of the inidual event were:MMale Senior st male # Craig Ross of the Glasgow Tri Club: ::Female Senior st female –Lucy Fraser ::Female Veteran – Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Veteran – Mike Donaldson of Glasgow Tri Club :..Male Super Vet – Alasdair Ireland – ::Female Super Vet – Maggie Darroch of Glasgow Tri Club ::Male Vintage – Alan Duff of Glasgow Tri Club – ::Female Vintage– Sue Allen of Mid Argyll Tri Club ::Male Super Vintage– Douglas Wood of Stirling Tri Club ::st Mid Argyll Female Finisher – Kirsty Duff, Bridgend ::st Mid Argyll Male Finisher – John Anderson, Kilmartin ::The winner of the adult team category was Glasgow University Dream Team with a time of  hour  minutes and  seconds and or the junior teams the winner was BFG Lochgilphead made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith.In the inidual race categories there were some great performances. Mid Argyll Triathlon Club’s Sue Allen in the vintage categoryput in superb performances to dominate this category. This was a complete performance by Sue which saw her retain her title for the third year in succession. In second place was Gillian Kennedy of Perth Triathlon Club and in third place was Marjorie Leighton of the Mid Argyll Tri Club.Doug Wood in the super vintage + age group and won by over  minutes from his nearest rival with his cycle over the -mile course being very impressive.In the male vintage raceAlan Duffs performance particularly in the bike and run was very strong rewarding his impressive consistency with the win.The accolade for being the fastest male and female triathlete in the race was also clearly going to be very tightly fought contest.The stand out performance on the day was from Lucy Fraser, the fastest lady and first senior. Lucy had the third fastest swim at  minutes and  seconds, she then pulled away on the bike from Kathryn Grfin in second place by a powerful display of cycling, which gave her a lead of four minutes heading into the run. In fact she only lost one minute to Kathryn on the run to win by nearly three minutes.The fastest male triathlete on the day was Mike Donaldson in the + veteran category, holding off the youngsters to be the overall winner in the male race by  seconds. His faster swim and bike and very solid run over the four-mile distance saw him hold off Craig Ross who recorded the fastest run of the day of  minutes  seconds to take the overall title.The remaining age group category competition between the clubs was spiced up with lots of banter and friendly, fierce rivalry.In the Super Veteran Male Category , Alasdair Ireland had a very impressive performance across all three disciplines of the triathlon, recording the fastest swim, bike and run to win. There was a closer battle for second and third place with John Anderson, Phil Dye and Sandy Ross swapping positions in the swim, bike and run. However, Mid Argyll Tri club John managed to get a lead at the end of the bike and a fast transition saw him record a  minute  second run being  seconds quicker then Phil Dye and  seconds than Sandy to claim second place.The female Super Veteranfemale category was similar to the men with Maggie Darroch from Glasgow Tri Club being fastest in the swim, bike and run to win by an impressive margin of just over nine minutes, improving her position of second place from last year. Melanie Peacock-Chimelewska of Mid Argyll Tri Club was second with her excellent swim proving the dference over Elaine Crichton in third.The female veterancategory saw Sarah Grfin of Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle club fastest in the swim and out on the bike, but a very strong bike and a phenomenal run of Louise Ross of Glasgow Tri meant she took the win for the second year running, pushing Sarah into second place and Jenner Reid of Campbeltown running club to third.The first place local male and female categories is always a bit of fun with local Mid Argyll Tri and Cycle Club members battling for bragging rights.The first local male triathlete home was John Anderson from Kilmartin with a time of ::, with Colin MacFarlane in second place at :: and Iain MacNicol in third place ::. All three are members of the Mid Argyll Triathlon and Cycle club.The first local female triathlete home was Kirsty Duff at ::, in second place was Sarah Grfin at :: and Louise Gibson at :: in third place.Team EventThe team race is always the first heat away and this year there were  teams battling for the podium and hearing the starting air horn and whistles from the pool the excitement soon built for the team cyclists. There was some great rivalry banter between the relay team members as they eagerly looked forward to the relay change.This was the year of the youngsters as Glasgow University Triathlon club came with two teams and had clearly come with intent of winning the race. First out of the water with the fastest swim of the day was Glasgow Uni Dream Team with a blisteringly quick time of  minutes  seconds, followed only  seconds back by Glasgow Uni Freshers Team and only one second behind Team BFG .Well there was certainly nothing separating the top three teams at the end of the bike as they all came in virtually together with only  seconds separating them. It was all down to the run and the Glasgow Uni Dream Team pulled out the second quickest run of the day to win the by three minutes, from the Glasgow Uni Freshers team with the BFG our local junior team in third.The BFG team made up of Felix Maddox, Gregor McGeachy and Ben Smith took the junior trophy and can be rightfully proud of their overall performance in the competition.The team’s competition always provides a great balance between the spice of competition and the balance of having great fun and allowing everyone to participate across the three disciplines. This is best epitomised in the team names, reflecting not only who they were representing but also good humour. Teams included: ‘No Direction ., ‘Splash Flash and Dash’, ‘Ormsary Orbits’, ‘ Years On’, ‘Coia and Associates’, ‘HIE Tri-ers’, ‘Yes Lube’, ‘Team Try-Athletes’ and ‘Sepa Mums’.Thanks, and FeedbackMid Argyll Triathlon club once again appreciated all the many words of thanks and praise from competitors to the organisers, marshals and volunteers for the event, its organisation and smooth running, the great goodie bags, medals and sports performance T-shirt provided by our sponsors, without which the triathlon could not happen.Karen Graham said: ‘Love it!

But where the cash goes will be decided by South Ayrshire council officials depending on the needs of dferent areas. The move was approved at the full council meeting last week after a heated clash between rival councillors. Councillor Hugh Hunter put forward a motion for pound, cash to be distributed with a maximum of pound going to each town and pound for villages. He said communities faced a major challenge to raise money for lights. He said the council’s “huge” underspend should be used to pay for the festive displays. But his seasonal gesture was snubbed by ruling councillors who backed an amendment from Councillor Alec Clark to make pound, available instead. Independent Councillor Clark said: “We will try and bring some joy into people’s lives.” His amendment said: “With this fund it is important that the funding does not supplant or compete with the work that has been taking place over a number of years.” Conservative Councillor Hunter questioned how communities were supposed to apply for the cash but was told there wouldn’t be an application process. Labour Councillor Brian McGinley said: “There has been an issue with Christmas lights over a number of years.” He added: “We don’t want to undo the good work already going on in the community.” Responding to probes from the conservative opposition, he said: “We will talk to people about the current arrangements and do what we can.” Councillor Hunter said: “I can’t support the amendment. I ask councillors to support the clear motion.” Speaking after the meeting, Councillor Hunter said: “It wasn’t clear how communities could access it. It is really foggy and disappointing that we couldn’t get to the bottom of it.” Councillor Bob Pollock said he is concerned “some areas may miss out.” He said there was “no coherent explanation” on how the money would be “decided or managed” with only six weeks left until switch on. In a press release Councillor McGinley said: “We obviously have a finite amount of resources, so we know that we won’t be able to do everything that communities want right away, but it’s a terric starting point that will support people and places right across South Ayrshire at this special time of year.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilChristmasAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"ayrshire student launches campaign against","story":"NewsAyrshire student launches campaign against spikingCara’s drive to keep young women safer when they’re out on the town.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsCara Taven has launched a Facebook page named Girls Against Spiking. \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA campaign has been set up to raise awareness of people having their drinks spiked. Cara Taven, from Coylton, set up a Facebook page called ‘Girls Against Spiking’to bring to light the effects of spiking on nights out and to, hopefully, eradicate it. The Facebook page, which has gained a following of over  people in one week, hopes to attract the attention of nightclubs and bars and is aiming for lids to be put on all drinks served at their bars as part of a drive to stop people having their drinks spiked.  Cara, , told the Post about her campaign. She said: “I have heard a lot about people getting spiked recently, in my local area and in the Glasgow region, and I know that a lot of people in Ayr do go out in Glasgow. “It tends to be younger girls about my age that get affected by spiking and that was something I have really started to think about. “This is something that could happen to anyone. “I’m a law student and the reason why I wanted to study law was to represent people who maybe don’t have the confidence to represent themselves and to make a dference that way and I think that is where getting the idea to make the page has come from. “I honestly thought it would be a page where the girls at my work could like – I am surprised by the response. “I remember saying to someone at work ‘If you like the page it’ll take me to  likes’ – then when I woke up in the morning and it was . “I haven’t been affected by spiking – it’s not really about me or anyone that I know. It is about the community of girls my age. “ I just felt like the answer was there and no one has done anything about it until now.” The Post reported how Cleo Smillie, , from Ayr, was on a night out in Madrid with her friend, Marc Davies, when she blacked out after one sip of her pink gin and lemonade.

An astute, respected and independent body, its remit would be to act for the long term greater good of the Ayrshire coast and its stakeholders - and issue unorm guidelines to prevent North, East and South Ayrshire councils peppering our seascapes with all kinds of piecemeal shoreline developments. Sadly, such a badly-needed supervisory power is still only a figment of my imagination. But had it existed – it would have poured over builder McCarthy and Stone’s ‘Legoland’ plans for the former Malcolm Sargent House site at Prestwick . . . before hobbing them into the nearest bin! As it is, neighbouring Prestwick Golf Club have taken the legal ‘ last resort’ and petitioned for a judicial review of South Ayrshire Council’s decision to grant planning approval. Successfully overturning SAC’s November  decision is the legal equivalent of holing a  footer on Prestwick’s th green. Only six per cent of inidual judicial reviews succeed. But they can take comfort in the classic  judicial review when planning permission for wind turbines was challenged because they were in the flight path of ospreys nesting hundreds of miles away! Lord Hope ruled that while no inidual with land interests had objected to the turbines, the “natural environment” is everyone’s interest. He memorably pronounced: “The osprey has no means of protecting itself. If its interests are to be protected, someone needs speak on its behalf”. Prestwick’s Golf Club’s members are scattered across the county, the country and the world. Not a single one of them has inidual land interests affected by the proposed development. But the  Tom Morris designed links - its fairways, dunes, greens, unique location, backcloth, traditions and history - cannot protect itself. In the spirit of Lord Hope’s ruling, its members are “speaking on its behalf”. And I say good luck to them. As I also said, their chances on paper are slim. Butit hits the Court of Session, and the man in the big seat has a Royal and Ancient tie under his robe – or bits of Muirfield on the golf shoes in the boot of his Jag - well . . . you just never know! Prestwick’s members are no fools either – they hope their legal move will get everyone back around the table for complete rethink on the scale of McCarthy and Stone’s plans. The builder will no doubt deny any adverse reflection on Prestwick – but you can bet the proximity of the historic links will be in the first paragraph in any of their sales brochures! McCarthy and Stone made a pound million profit in . Their average UK apartment price is almost pound, - and they’re planning  of them at Prestwick . . . that’s pound. million. With those numbers at stake – McCarthy and Stone will be putting all kinds of pressure on South Ayrshire Council not to cave in. Prestwick Golf Club doesn’t have a problem with the site being developed – but rightly ask that any development be appropriate in design and scale to its noble and historic surroundings. And that’s something McCarthy and Stone can easily afford. Prestwick Golf Club is a legendary place for winners. And there will be legendary amounts of Kummel quaffed in the clubhousethey win this one!Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilEnvironmentPrestwickAirAsiaAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"chief inspector makes return south","story":"NewsChief inspector makes ato South AyrshireChief Inspector Derek Frew takes over the reigns from Gary I’Anson.ShareByPippa Smith:,  OCT NewsChief Inspector Derek Frew \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe new chief inspector in South Ayrshire has vowed to put the community at the heart of policing.

Arnold Clark took the decision to shut the twin showrooms and workshops in the town’s Lochside. The big transporters moved in to clear the stock and the famous yellow signage was quickly taken down. The old premises in Galloway Avenue sold cars for generations and was probably best known as the home of Robert McCall Fiat and Alfa Romeo. But being stuck in the middle of housing, the old showroom has now outlived its time.. Arnold bought the dealership from Robert McCall and latterly operated a Fiat franchise. It also had the Jeep franchise for Ayr before it moved to Border Cars. The McCall family ran it for decades and built a reputation for fine service. Bob McCall began selling cars in  and had a series of franchises including Jaguar. His son Robert then took over the running of the business and was very successful selling Fiats and Alfas. Robert’s cousin Peter McCall was actually born in the house on the site that was converted into part of the garage. Customers in Galloway Avenue have been told all servicing work is going to the Ford workshop in Prestwick Road. Arnold Clark also runs separate Toyota, Vauxhall and Peugeot franchises in the town as well as a car and van hire centre. A long-time customer in Galloway Avenue said: “It is a real shame, but I guess dealerships want to be on busy roads in more modern buildings. Sadly Galloway Avenue would have needed a lot of investment and a member of staff said it simply was not in the right location any more. “Staff think the site could be flattened or put to another vehicle use.” Arnold Clark was unavailable for comment as we reached our deadline.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsMotoring NewsAlfa RomeoFiatJaguarJeepPeugeotFishingPrestwickGalloway"},{"url":null,"title":"gymnastics club tries takeover council","story":"NewsGymnastics club tries to takeover council activity centre in TroonMuirhead Activity Centre is the target of Dundonald Gymnastics ClubShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA plan by a gymnastics club to take over Muirhead Activity Centre has met hostility. Secret talks have been taking place since the summer but have only just surfaced. Dundonald Gymnastics Club is ready to take control and turn the popular sports hall into a specialist centre. It would mean no more sports lets of the main hall for football, badminton and handball, the squash court would shut and the property would be shted from South Ayrshire Council ownership. Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association fired the first warning shot over the takeover. Chairman Frances Carson said: “The answer is no. If the council have pulled a fly one over this then they will never hear the end of it from this community.” Scott Telford, head coach of the gymnastics club, promised this week he will speak to the community about his ambitious plans. But Tory councillor Peter Convery slammed the secrecy, saying: “This came out of the blue to all the councillors and community and is an utter disgrace. “People at a meeting on Friday night were flabbergasted the hall could be taken out of council ownership. “The acid on the cake is the council has been speaking to the group without anyone knowing. “The council should not be treating its citizens this way.” Scott Telford said he has a full business plan for the centre and believes it can work. The club has  members and a waiting list of  more. He said the club have restricted facilities at their present base Dundonald Activity Centre, where five adults spend hours setting out and dismantling equipment. As a result they cannot develop youngsters to elite performance level and lose talented performers at an early age. Former top gymnast Scott, who lives in Muirhead, said: “The community will still get use of the centre for things like meetings and birthday parties and we would look to develop that. “There will also be the chance for the community to take part in gymnastics. “I appreciate people don’t like change but we can make this work. We could even look at parkour gymnastic sessions with teenagers on Friday night. “There is also a lot of outdoor space which we could change for other activities, depending on what the community want.” The dad first started helping at Dundonald when there were only  kids and ten mats. He added: “At the moment we get about  inquiries a week and just cannot cope. “I want to work with the Muirhead Residents and Tenants Association and want to hear all views. “We will be running a seven-day-a-week facility but it has to be financially sustainable and work with the community.” Councillor Craig Mackay said he wants full transparency when consultation starts. He said: “The onus will be on the gymnastics club to demonstrate the wider support of the community. “I am relaxed about the process and will very much wish to take on board the community’s views on this once we know the details of what is proposed. “I am concerned about how any potential transfer would impact on the use of the centre by the wide range of groups who currently use it. “The centre currently runs at a small but manageable loss and in my view any decision must be made on what is best for the community and not on the very minimal cost savings.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr NewsGymnasticsSouth Ayrshire CouncilBadmintonTroonDundonald"},{"url":null,"title":"new eaterie chip 25 new","story":"NewsNew eaterie will chip in with  new jobs in PerthInvestment for the cityShareByDouglas Dickie:,  OCT NewsAlessandra Vareseat the Blue Lagoon in Ayr - this will soon be a familiar sight in Perth\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe opening of an iconic fish and chip restaurant in Perth city centre could create around  jobs for the city, the PA can reveal. Alessandro Varese, owner of the Blue Lagoon chippy, believes a proposed outlet on High Street will open up a number of job opportunities for residents. Planning permission for the shop was granted last month, with the new -seat restaurant set to open sometime in the spring. The project represents a pound, investment for the city centre. Mr Varese told the PA: “Trespass is due to move out in February and that’s when we will get the keys. “It will take six weeks to fit the shop out so we are looking at an opening date of April . That’s what we are aiming for. “Between the property and the cost of the fit, we are talking about an investment or three-quarters of a million pounds, so it is a big project for us. “This is the furthest north we have been and we are looking at employing around - local people.” The Blue Lagoon already has both takeaways and restaurants in Glasgow, as well as in places like Ayr, Largs and Stirling. The business was set up by Mr Varese’s grandfather over  years ago. In recent years, their Glasgow chip shops have become a favourite with celebrities, with the likes of Justin Bieber and Nigella Lawson enjoying its food. Mr Varese said the Perth restaurant, which will cover  square feet, will promise something dferent. He said: “It will be similar in size to out Stirling restaurant but the shop itself will be a bit dferent.

Proposals also include the High Street being coated with a new easy clean surface and bins being kept out of site. A great shop clearance has been proposed to regenerate the ailing shopping strip. South Ayrshire Council wants empty retail units to become homes at the bottom of the town. Council leader Douglas Campbell said: “Internet shopping has signicantly altered the landscape in the town. “We need people back staying in the towns.” SNP Councillor Campbell took to his feet at week’s full council meeting to talk through the complete overhaul of the town centre. Conservative Councillor Ian Davis askedshop owners would be consultedthey are forced to move. He said: “This could mean some businesses will have to move. I want reassurances for businesses thatan area is to be reused for a dferent purpose that they are well consulted.” The meeting heard businesses would be consulted. The cleared Riverside block, which included Woolworths, would become a public square. The original proposal for a huge office block has been shelved. Commenting on the cleared site, Councillor Campbell said: “None of us expected the vista.” But he conceded how homes of some description could be erected on the site. He said: “Some sort of building on the site will be necessary.” A report submitted to council said: “There will also be the potential for a small number of residential units on the Riverside sitethis proves desirable through the public consultation exercise.” Council staff from soon-to-be demolished Burns House are likely to move into the Clydesdale Bank Building, the Town Hall and County Buildings instead. The Citadel is to be replaced with a brand new state-of-the art leisure centre on the High Street. A new streetscape surface could also be on the way. Councillor Campbell said: “If we are going to revamp the High Street we need to do it in a signicant way to keep it tidy. “During the main shopping times all the bins should be off the street. We need to present the High Street well. “We need to move the bus stops away from the Clydesdale Bank building.” Conservative opposition councillor Hugh Hunter got to his feet to “welcome” the report. He said: “It would be spectacular for the administrationthey could pull it off.” He called for a park like Belleisle to be built at the Riverside. SNP councillor Siobhian Brown said she welcomed the report but said morale of the community was “on its knees.” All plans will be issued for public consultation.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnClydesdale BankScottish National PartySouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"slow progress new troon mega","story":"NewsSlow progress for new Troon mega surgeryBut work on Templehill expansion should start next yearShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT News\"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailNational Health top brass have been summoned to Troon to explain what is happening to expansion plans at the town’s mega surgery. Members of the public spoke at last week’s Troon Community Council –asking why there has been no obvious progress at the Templehill Surgery in nearly six month. The surgery swallowed most of the collapsed  Medical Practice, re-opening with , patients at the end of April. The Community Council has asked an NHS representative to attend their meeting next month. When Templehill took over they were to be handed around pound, by NHS Ayrshire  Arran for an extension. And partner Robbie Cumming said then it was still to be agreed wether to use a ready-made modular building or a traditional build at the back. At the time he said: “We intend to expand and develop our current premises with the addition of two or three consulting rooms, disabled access doors and a larger reception area.” A planning application has been lodged but it has not even been “validated” yet by South Ayrshire Council. Councillor Craig Mckay has quizzed Pamela Milliken, head of primary care, on the extension which had been a central plank of the transfer. Councillor Mckay said: “I welcome the Health Board’s comments which suggest that there have been no major issues following the transfers. “This is consistent with my own experience as I’ve received no recent complaints from patients. “It is also reassuring that both recipient practices have been reviewing patient records and inviting patients to attend for review appointments. “I hope this will ensure that those who were moved will continue to receive the level of care they deserve. “On the extension to the Templehill surgery, the planning application has recently been submitted but not yet validated. ““Clearly it is in the interests of all patients of that practice that the required expansion takes place, and I note that subject to there being no planning issues, work is expected to begin on site in the new year. “The extension was central to the arguments made when  Medical Practice closed, and the ball is now firmly in the Surgery’s court to deliver on this commitment.” Councillor Bob Pollock agreed the actual transition process seemed to have gone well and said: “None of the Troon Councillors have received any complaints following the merger of the surgeries, butthere are any, they should get in touch.” Ms Milliken said: “Planning permission for the work was submitted to South Ayrshire Council on Friday September . The practice is optimistic that works will commence in early Januaryplanning permission is granted.” In other NHS news, it is understood community midwives have had to change their base from the Barassie Street clinic to Prestwick. One source said: “All that is left at Barassie Street seems to be podiatry. “The community nurses have to start their sht in Prestwick before coming to Troon for their first appointment.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnTroonNHS ScotlandAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13420214.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/1_asr_ayp_031018gin1.jpg","title":"world wonder through looking glass","story":"NewsWorld of wonder through the looking glass at Hendricks GinIt’s the tipple sought after and enjoyed by millions across the globe but made closer to home than you think – in the heart of Girvan.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  OCT Updated:,  OCT NewsWhere the magic happens Hendricks Gin Palace \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email“A gin made oddly”– put simply by the gin gods themselves – Hendrick’s. It’s the tipple sought after and enjoyed by millions across the globe but made closer to home than you think – in the heart of Girvan. And it’s at the newly developed multi-million pound Hendrick’s Gin Palace where the magic and wonder begins. The most signicant development since launch in , Hendrick’s Gin has been impressively expanded to meet the global demand for the ever popular drink. William Grant  Sons, the family owned independent global spirts company, has invested pound million in the glorious expansion, adding six new distillers to work under Hendrick’s Master Distiller, Lesley Gracie’s watchful eye. Innovation has always been in the brand’s DNA, echoing the ethos of Lewis Carroll who cried “curiouser and curiouser”. And it’s this spirit of invention and Alice in Wonderland-esque manner that carries through to the custom-designed complex which is encased in an enchanted walled garden, leading to a magnicent “Victorian inspired” palm house.  Surrounded by two botanical hot houses, the palm house is used to “cultivate unusual botanicals and flora from around the world”. An inner sanctum that is Lesley’s laboratory features a “curious flavour library, a lecture theatre that encourages scholarly learnings and a suitably stylish bar”. And, of course, there are two stunning new still houses. The Hendrick’s family of stills now stands at a proud six – four Bennett stills including the original antique copper pot from  and three precise replicas. The Bennett stills were handcrafted by local manufacturers Carrick Engineering and construction of the distillery was all done by local contractors and builders helping to capture the home of Hendrick’s gin right down to the foundations. The three replica stills are guarded and overlooked by a stunning stained glass ceiling – perhaps spied by Alice herself as she keeked through the looking glass. Master distiller Lesley continues that sense of wonder with every drop she makes.  Lesley said: “I’ve been distilling Hendrick’s for almost  years and during that time, my team and I have had the opportunity to explore and experiment on a small scale. “However, I’m thrilled and excited to take full advantage of our wonderful new distillery and begin working on a line of experimental liquids, some of which will hopefully blossom into future releases and potential new expressions of Hendrick’s.” Pamela Selby, the Global Brand Director for Hendrick’s added: “The Hendrick’s Gin Palace in its design and experience, is intended to inspire curiosity, open minds and serve as a  for invention. “It pulls back the curtain on the wondrous production method and showcases the many layers of Hendrick’s that it has become celebrated for, some humorous, others curiously intellectual, detailed and deeply meaningful. “It represents the confidence we have in the brand that helped to kick-start the ginaissance and leading role it has played ever since.” And with no end in sight for the beloved ginaissance – long may it live. At Alice in Wonderland’s top table it’s time for tea, but at the glorious Hendrick’s Palace it’s always gin o’clock.

reason for the increase to the construction programme.Since the introduction of a one-way system for west-bound traffic across the bridge with east-bound vehicles having to use the winding B near Abbotsford, there have been many reports of drivers ignoring temporary road signs.And many other drivers are using Melrose Road and Lowood Bridge, which causes tailbacks at rush hour.Rather than continue with repairs to Galafoot over the festive period and into the new year, Amey has opted to finish on November  andthree months later.Mr Wallace added: ldquoThe local community has shown incredible patience and understanding with the repair programme to date.\"Having listened to their concerns, we consider it prudent to avoid further disruption over the busy holiday season.\"This strategy will also mitigate against the possible impact that winter weather might have on this workldquoOnce again, we want to thank road users, businesses and residents for their goodwill, and we will continue to consult with local stakeholders and provide updates on this scheme .Exact dates for the  works will be announced in the coming weeks."},{"url":null,"title":"the-best-of-buble-in-galashiels","story":"THE magic of Michael Bubleacute is coming to Galashiels.This weekend the Volunteer Hall will play host to Mark Daniels as

And so he obliged.It was a great story, and we tracked the lion to the ancient Mercat Cross, where the unicorn sits on top of the pole ldquolooking for the lion.Then he spotted the lion on the  bus coming from Tranent.ldquoWill it eat the people  I asked.ldquoNo, he said asIrsquod asked an inappropriate question, ldquoitrsquos a nice lion.And so with the lion having left town, we headed for the Infant School to pick up his sister, but still keeping a look out for the T Rex.On the surface this may all seem a bit unusual, wandering about telling random stories that often didnrsquot make huge sense.But I value this time with my son, and as a storyteller I know the importance of it.Storytelling in this way when our kids are young helps develop what is called oral narrative ability, which gives a child the skills to explain and describe things, and develop their understanding of words and language.It fires their imagination and research shows that this can help with the enjoyment of reading and writing later on, and of telling and hearing stories.That night my son unexpectedly ed to the story of Johnny Moat.I had earlier told him it had fallen down and is lying face down in the sand and itrsquos too heavy to put back, but hopefully one day there will be a way.Like all kids his age, he took a while to process his thoughts on this. And these thoughts came out at bedtime.ldquoThe T Rex can put the big stone back, he said. I admired his total faith in the abilities of the T Rex.ldquoYes, maybe, I said. He fell asleep holding his T Rex which, for him, symbolises so much more than just an extinct dinosaur.As I headed downstairs, I thought about the connection between this day and the day over six years ago when I unexpectedly told the story of Johnny Moat to some teenage lads.Stories weave through us and bind us in a shared identity. But it made me sad that Johnny Moat still lies forgotten with his face in the sand.So Irsquom going to start looking for the T Rex of the Pans, whoever that may be, who can help. He or she must be out there somewhere. Or perhaps there is a crowd of them.The hope is that once my son is a teenage lad himself, he will be able to sit on the Girdle Rocks with Johnny Moat and tell the legend."},{"url":null,"title":"group-objects-to-750-new-homes-at-windygoul-south","story":"A planning application for the site was submitted last month by Walker Group Ltd.The site plan extends Windygoul South to the Charles River Research Institute and Carlaverock Farm.But at a TECC meeting, members voiced their concerns over the proposals.Robert McNeill, community councillor, told the meeting: ldquoIn all my years on the community council, I canrsquot recall us making a formal objection about any developments in Tranent.ldquoWe try to be very proactive to any problems and find a solution.

Enough is enough.

My wee daughter wanted to have an ldquoapple shower and so we stood under the trees. The mere touch of a branch resulted in a cascade of fruit. It was a wonderful ritual of autumn and I loved my kidsrsquo joy in it all, but within me there was a nagging feeling. As Irsquove got older, the oncoming of winter has had a depressive effect on me.Is it a process that affects us more as we get older, with each autumn marking the slow closing of yet another year To be sure, autumn is a beautul time of year and many people tell me it is their favourite season. I can understand that. The woods are magical, the sunsets seem more spectacular than at other times and itrsquos a time of harvest and forage. Our house is full of conkers, apples and colourful leaves collected on walks.Another part of the magic is the migrating birds. I heard the geese above me the other day, honking and flying in formation as they headed for Aberlady. They arrive at this time of year with winter on their tails. The assembly of pink-footed geese there at this time of year is a truly spectacular sight and sound. Tens of thousands of them gather at Aberlady Bay during their migration south.It almost has the atmosphere of an airport countless numbers of honking birds arriving from Iceland and Greenland, joining an already crowded bay. There are thousands of excited geese mingling together, sharing flight stories and looking forward to the next stage of their journey. Many feed in nearby fields before taking off once again to venture further south.As they fly over us their honking sounds like cackling witches. I often hear them when in the woods, as I did the other day. I looked up to see them through the branches of balding autumn trees, flying in their characteristic V flight formations. It seemed their honking was warning me of something: ldquoWinter is cominghellipwinter is coming.Some people of course follow the example of the geese and head for a kinder climate as winter approaches. But for most of us itrsquos a case of ritual and preparation. Hallowersquoen, really a later development of the Celtic Samhain festival, is one such ritual.But for me now, despite my love of autumnrsquos display, it cloaks my senses with a sense of melancholy which I find increasingly dficult to throw off.I spend as much time outdoors as possible in the other seasons but the darkness of winter forces me to retreat into my home. Hence we will soon be decorating our wee house with cosy and colourful lights to ward off winterrsquos dark blanket. But this dark blanket can cover our emotions as well, not so easily warded off.Many people I know likewise dread winter because of its depressive effect on their mental health. They wish that, like the geese, they could find a way of escaping the worst of it. I have often wished I was a bear who could hibernate away the winter months.But we are not bears or geese, and in my own battles with the oncoming of winter I have come to understand more than ever the importance of social connections and preparing for them. The truth is winter can be a time of flowering and rebirth, just like spring but in a dferent way ndash the flowering of friendship and rebirth of social connections perhaps lost or waned in the flurry of summer activities.In the past it was so self-evident. People huddled in each otherrsquos homes around the fire, keeping each other company. Like so many things these traditions have now been commercialised, yet the simple antidote of social connection in the approaching dark times remains as powerful as it ever was for us.It should be a time for visiting and getting together making time for friends and coming together in defiance of the darkness. And thinking especially of those for whom the cold and dark becomes an enforcer of confinement because of age or vulnerability.Winter should be a time of visiting and welcoming.

Then he exposed himself and began masturbating.His victim, deeply distressed, escaped. So ndash at least for now ndash has he.That is because, weeks after his crime, the man remains at large. Police Scotland say they have ldquono positive line of inquiry, their way of saying they are not pursuing any specic leads. Their investigation, carried out by specialist public protection detectives, ldquoremains open.Officers do not doubt, insiders stress, the credibility and good faith of the victim and their only witness, a then -year-old student. She, however, does doubt them. So much so that in last weekrsquos Herald on Sunday the woman, Caitie Mackay, waived her anonymity to express her hurt and frustration about both the crime and the way she felt it was handled by the police. Her story was powerfully told by her father, The Herald and Herald on Sunday writer-at-large Neil Mackay. Very few victims of sexual offences are able to share their perspective. Fewer still have the courage to do so under their own name.Caitie said she had identied a suspect to the police but that this man had never been interviewed. Why  Because, she was told, he would be unfit to understand the process. Last week, we suggested the man had mental health issues. In fact, we can now report, he has serious learning dficulties.She said the man was stalking her, turning up at her work, one of Glasgowrsquos biggest shopping malls. She did not feel safe. ldquoTrying to get any form of justice or protection is pointless, Caitie said. ldquoI feel aswhat happened to me simply does not matter. My faith in the police is destroyed.Last week, Mackay, profoundly worried about his daughter ndash and about the public interest issues he raised about the investigation of sex crimes ndash put a series of questions to the police. This week we can report how they responded.Officers spoken to by The Herald have great sympathy and respect for Mackay and his daughter. Their perspective on the investigation, is, however, in some details, is at odds with that of the Mackay family.So much so that some of their dferences may have to be resolved by a complaints process already under way thanks to formal interest from a politician following our story last week.Police, specically, say they carried out an extensive investigation in to Caitiersquos complaint ndash which is one of public indecency rather than ldquoa sexual assault, as we termed the offence in a headline last week.They also say there is ldquoinsufficient evidence to link the man with learning dficulties to the case.And they say they have no record of any report of stalking against the man. The Mackays dispute this and are understood to be considering their own formal complaint against the police.The officer in charge of investigating this case is Detective Superintendent Alwyn Bell. He leads Glasgow isionrsquos team of public protection detectives, specialists in sex crimes. It was his unit, he explained, which took over the case shortly after Caitie reported it.Bell said: ldquoFollowing a report of a man having indecently exposed himself near to Darnley train station on July , officers spoke to the victim and carried out a number of inquiries including a full search of the area.ldquoThe inquiry was then allocated to the dedicated Public Protection Unit within the ision, and following a CCTV check and other inquiries, there was no further information available at that time to identy a suspect. However, the inquiry remained open.Bell said that efforts had been made to keep the victim updated on this investigation by phone but added that ldquoofficers were unsuccessful. The detective, who has occupied senior public protection roles in both Glasgow and Edinburgh, also addressed ndash within serious legal limitations on what he can say ndash the concerns the Mackays had over the man identied by Caitie as her attacker.He said: ldquoOn July , the victim made a further call to police reporting that she had seen the suspect within her workplace. Officers attended to speak to her and the suspect was identied by the victim as being the inidual who had carried out the public indecency. ldquoInquiries were undertaken and, due to his behaviour, he was ed home to his parents. Officers then obtained medical advice regarding the suspectrsquos condition and it was made clear by a medical professional that he has signicant learning dficulties, and therefore lacks the capacity to understand a police interview or the ramications of his actions or conduct.The man is on Police Scotlandrsquos vulnerable persons database or VPD. He has been the subject of some inquiries. However, the force, in a formal statement to The Herald on Sunday, said they currently do not have a positive line of inquiry in the case.Bell added: ldquoThe inquiry into this incident remains open and we would ask anyone who has any information which may assist, to contact us.The story centres on some of the trickiest and most sensitive areas of police work: updating victims on live investigations and handling inquiries which touch on vulnerable people.There can be legal, ethical and practical reasons why officers cannot share the full story of any live inquiry to complex, messy, human crimes with journalists, the relatives of adult victims and victims themselves. There can also be miscommunications and misunderstandings between police and those whose lives are affected by crime and its investigation.The circumstances of this case now look likely to be settled by a formal independent process of complaints.Police Scotland has faced complaints about such issues before, including those which have been upheld and those which have not been. Each such complaint, say insiders, offers a chance to learn lessons or get to the bottom of a dispute.The force in recent years has also increasingly secured the trust of organisations which support victims of sex crimes. Whatever the outcome of formal concerns about the Mackay case, the force will be eager to rebuild trust among victims and their families. Dfering perspectives on the course of the investigation aside, insiders stress they see Caitie as a good faith witness.Senior officers in recent years have put huge public emphasis on a message that they want to hear reports of sexual offences. Last financial year they recorded nearly , such crimes, more than double the historic norm. Numbers continue to rise this year, early reports suggest. In -, there were  cases of public indecency, the kind of offence experienced by Caitie.Somebody, police are sure, put Caitie through a terrying ordeal on July . That somebody has not been caught. There have not been any reports of similar crimes in the area. However, the man who tormented Caitie may well have exposed himself to others.

A major report from the UN intergovernmental  on climate change concluded that by  temperatures are on course to rise . degrees above pre-industrial levels, the maximum increase before catastrophic consequences ndash extreme floods and heat, mass displacement and poverty ndash are unleashed upon the planet.Wow. Twelve years.

In other words, our tiny minds doom us to failure.And I include politicians in this ldquoour.

In doing so, he discovers new insights into how decisions were made about land far from Edinburgh and London.HIGHER LEARNINGMore than  years ago, the last Conservative Secretary of State to rule Scotland before devolution made one of the most important announcements about the future of the Highlands and Islands. The region, Michael Forsyth, said would get its own university. No longer would all students have to go south to learn after school.Mr Forsyth was speaking at a  meeting of the Scottish Grand Committee of MPs in Inverness. But he was not,- Mr Ross has discovered, saying things that Scotlandrsquos senior civil servants and all its established universities wanted to hear.Mr Ross wrote: ldquoI received a phone call from a Scottish Office civil servant after the meeting askingI had notes of what exactly Mr Forsyth had said onthe subject, as he and his colleagueshad no detail.ldquoWe later learnt Mr Forsyth had asked an opposition MP to ask a question about the university.For his book, Mr Ross went back to Mr Forsyth, now Lord Forsyth of Drumlean. ldquoOn the University of the Highlands and Islands, I just couldnrsquot get anywhere. The universities were all lobbying against it, the officials were against it. I could just see the whole thing disappearing into a three-year review. I thought we will just announce we are doing it, then they will have to get on with it. So thatrsquos what I did.David Ross on his Herald beatNow the institution has  colleges, with more than  local learning centres and thousands of students. The old Scottish Office as recently as  had described a campaign for a Highland university as ldquopremature and prejudicial.BRAVEHEART, CULLODEN AND THE TORIESHe was the Scottish secretary who ed the Stone of Destiny to Edinburgh. But, Mr Ross reveals, Lord Forsyth had another huge fight with civil servants over how to remember the last great battle on British soil and one of events which defined the Highlands of today: Culloden.In Highland Herald, Mr Ross describes how the then Mr Forsyth wanted to commemorate the battlersquos th anniversary in  as part of a civil war. But, the politician told Mr Ross, officials were ldquodesperate to keep it as low key as possible, because they thought it was sensitive.Lord Forsyth added: ldquoAnd I had to cope with the film Braveheart as well. It became apparent that people confused the Wars of Scottish Independence in the th Century with Culloden in the th Century, and had no understanding as to what this was all about.Mel GibsonThis was the era of high polling for Scottish independence and even higher support for a new parliament in Edinburgh, a body that was to materialise three years later.THE LAND QUESTIONConservatives may have been seen as the party of the lairds but Lord Forsyth told Mr Ross a dferent story. ldquoWe have had some horrendous examples of horrible landlords, he said, ldquomainly from outside Scotland.Community buy-outs became one of the biggest stories Mr Ross told about the Highlands over  years. In his book, he hears from a senior official that development agency Highlands and Islands Enterprisehad been initially dubious about supporting the Assynt Croftersrsquo historic and ultimately successful campaign to win their land  years ago.Andrew Thin, who was Chief Executive of Caithness and Sutherland Enterprise and today is Chairman of the Scottish Land Commission, recalls the early HIE approach was: ldquoQuiet moral support behind the scenes perhaps, but not a suitable use of public funds.However, an article in The Daily , he had been told, heralded an instruction from a high level in Whitehall that Assynt was exactly the sort of demonstration of local initiative and enterprise that should be supported. HIErsquos attitude changed thereafter and the agency in the end contributed pound,, as well as giving the Assynt Crofters advice and encouragement.Other communities, such as Eigg, Knoydart, Gigha followed. Now well over , acres are under community ownershipTHE CLEARANCES CONTROVERSIESThe Assynt crofters drive to take back their land reflected generations of hurt over who owns Scotland - and the Clearances of the poor, often Gaelic-speaking, from the Highlands in the centuries after Culloden.This year the historian Sir Tom Devine has revisited the issue and claried that the Clearances were far from just a Highland issue, taking issue with the traditional take of popular historian John Prebble, who Mr Ross knew.John PrebbleIn Highland Herald, Mr Ross looks at the legacy of Mr Prebble, whose work was once dismissed by a late historiographer royal as ldquoutter rubbish.Mr Ross said: ldquoWhether or not the Highlands and Islands suffered worse depopulation numerically compared to other parts of Scotland, I have never felt was the most important issue. Rather it was the impact on the people, which Sorley MacLean described as the ldquophenomenon of phenomena.Mr MacLean was Mr Rossrsquos father-in-law and his book includes praise to the late bard which Mr Ross says he would have found ldquoexcruciating.TONGUE LASHINGMr Ross back in  came in for a not always gentle Fleet Street ribbing when he was covering the manhunt for a -year-old girl and her -year-old boyfriend. He spotted the pair near Tongue but called the police rather than try to get a scoop and speak to them.In his book, the reporter explains that ethical rules of his trade meant he could not interview a child without a responsible adult present.

Indeed, I would argue that no self-respecting Parliament would fall for it, she declared.In a speech to the Royal Society of Arts, the social change think-tank, in London, Ms Sturgeon complained that the Conservative Government had shown ldquolittle inclination to pay heed to Scotland during the Brexit process.ldquoOne of the lessons from our experience of the last two years, which I suspect has not been lost on the Scottish people and which will be remembered in Scotland for a long time to come, is the stark contrast between the EUrsquos treatment of independent nations and the UKrsquos treatment of devolved nations.Claiming the UK had ldquodismissed and ignored Scotlandrsquos concerns, the FM noted: ldquoLooking at the UK and the EU, it is fair to say that only one has looked like a genuine partnership of equals and that has not been the UK.Ms Sturgeon stressed how her Government had made a ldquobig compromise by dropping its demand that Scotland remain in the EU and pledged it to exhausting all the ldquoopportunities for compromise, holding out hope that a sensible outcome could be achieved. However, she made clear Scotland staying in the customs union and single market was Edinburghrsquos ldquobottom line.She pointed out thatthere were a special carve-out on the single market for Northern Ireland, then Scotland should be next in line for a ldquodferentiated approach.The FM only fleetingly mentioned the option of a second independence referendum, saying howno compromise could be reached, then Scotland ldquomust have the option to choose a dferent course ie independence.In a question and answer session following her speech, she claimed the ldquocase for democratic independence since  has strengthened immeasurably, noting how in the referendum campaign it was argued a Yes vote would result in Scotland leaving the EU.ldquoThat brings into sharp focus the democratic deficit Scotland has experienced on many occasions, which on this issue it has felt particularly harshly, she said.The Nationalist leader dismissed the Prime Ministerrsquos compromise blueprint as ldquoimpracticable, undesirable and undeliverable, stressing that whatever proposalMPs might finally vote on, it would not be the Chequers Plan.She noted how the EU was bitterly opposed to Chequers becauseit would undermine the unity of the single market, dealing only with goods and not services. Plus, there was no Westminstermajority for it.Ms Sturgeon rebuffed Mrs Mayrsquos claim that it was the only option on the table this was so, the FM pointed out, because the PM refused to countenance any other.ldquoLetrsquos be clear, she declared, ldquoa head-in-the-sand approach wonrsquot make the Chequers ostrich fly.The SNP leaderinsisted that neither a fudged Brexit deal not a ldquoblindfold Brexit ie a vague political statement of intent about the UKrsquos future relationship with the EU, would do. A blindfold Brexit would ldquoreplace a no-deal Brexit with a no-detail Brexit, she said.ldquoVoting against a bad or a blindfold Brexit deal isnrsquot a vote for no-deal it would be a vote for a better deal, insisted Ms Sturgeon.The FM accused the Conservative Government of taking an ldquoextreme interpretation of the  referendum result, which, she argued, was not a mandate for a hard Brexit and that the ldquoobvious democratic compromise was for the UK to stay in the single market and customs union.Indeed, Ms Sturgeon went on to say that her preferred option ldquomight well be the only option which is not completely impossible.She explained: ldquoIt should be acceptable to the EU. It avoids the worst economic damage that Brexit will wreak. It resolves the Irish border issue and it comes closest to reconciling the dfering views of Leavers and Remainers.

I continue to believe that such a deal is achievable.Mrs May was addressing the House of Commons just two days before she travels to Brussels for a summit at which it had initially been hoped to finalise the UKs withdrawal agreement as well as a political declaration on future trade and security relations.Following the failure to achieve a breakthrough when Dominic Raab, the Brexit Secretary, met Michel Barnier, the EU chief negotiator, on Sunday, the European Commission confirmed that no further negotiations would be held ahead of Thursdays summit.It was still unclear when the PM would make her Brexit presentation to her fellow leaders as it is expected that she will not attend the pre-summit EU dinner on Wednesday evening.Last night, the PM was due to talk to Emmanuel Macron, the French President, and is likely to talk to more EU counterparts before she heads off to the Belgian capital tomorrow.Donald Tusk, the European Council President, tweeted: ldquoIt always seems impossible until its done.

As well as offering a home for nature, bogs play a key role in water quality and flow and in a healthy state, peat is an essential weapon in the fight against climate change, acting as a massive sink for greenhouse gases.But when damaged they can release huge quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.Now a further , hectares of damaged peatlands are starting on the road to recovery after the pound million in extra funding from the Scottish Government for the national Peatland Action scheme.It will be spent on conservation measures including landscaping to reduce exposed peat and the installation of peat dams to restore water levels in blanket bogs, which are vital to carbon capture and provide habitats for many important Scottish species.Work will involve blocking gullies to prevent the earth from drying out and releasing carbon into the atmosphere.Eroded areas of bare peat will also be re-planted to stabilise the surface.These measures will improve mountain vegetation, which will in turn benefit native wildle and birds such as the snipe, skylark and greenshank.Andrew McBride, Project Manager of the Peatland ACTION project said: ldquoPeat covers over % of Scotlandrsquos land area and it is estimated that over % of this is in a degraded condition.\"The SNH Peatland ACTION team works with land managers across Scotland and in partnership with other organisations to restore degraded peatlands ndash to date we have started the process of restoration on nearly ,ha of peatlands.\"Most of our work involves advising on ditch blocking, stabilising eroded areas, and re-establishing vegetation ndash most notably by the bog building plant sphagnum moss.ldquoNot only are peatlands part of our landscape and cultural heritage, providing a unique habitat for species such as large heath butterflies and sundew plants, they are important for our environment. Peat stores carbon, reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.\"Peatbogs retain and filter water, reducing the impact of drought or flooding and keeping our burns clean for fishing and drinking.Across the world, large-scale degradation is causing serious environmental and social impact, with annual emissions estimated at around two gigatonnes of carbon dioxide -  per cent of all global emissions.Rewetting damaged peatlands can bring them back to good condition.Scots are being urged to avoid using peat-based compost in their gardens to help preserve resources.Conservationists say the current reliance on the ancient material for growing certain plants is \"totally unacceptable and unsustainable\", and people should turn to alternatives that are just as effective and readily available.Nearly a quarter of Scotlands entire land area - around two million hectares - is made up of peat bogs, which are estimated to contain around , million tonnes of carbon.The habitat also plays a crucial role in helping guard against flooding, purying water and supporting rare native wildle such as adders, golden plovers, dragonflies and carnivorous sundew plants.Extraction of peat destroys peatlands, which take thousands of years to form - laying down just mm per year. Some of Scotlands mires began forming in the Bronze age.The UK government has committed to abolishing the use of peat in amateur gardening by  and ending extraction of peat for the horticulture industry by .However, despite a signicant rise in uptake of alternative composts, peat use by gardeners has also been increasing.Industry figures show more than half of material used in bagged composts is peat, amounting to two million cubic metres every year.Around a third of all peat used for gardening in the UK comes from bogs in this country, while the remainder comes from Ireland and where in Europe.Conservation charity Plantle, which owns Munsary nature reserve in the internationally recognised Flow Country in Caithness - one of Europes most extensive areas of peatland - is working with organisations such as the Royal Horticultural Society, the Scottish Wildle Trust and the National Trust for Scotland to end use of peat in gardening and revitalise peatlands.Plantles Dr Trevor Dines said: \"For the love of peat, the time to wean ourselves off this precious, threatened natural resource is now.\"Our use of peat is simply unsustainable, hugely damaging to our peatlands - some of our best natural treasures - and simply not relevant in todays climate.\"We all have the opportunity to do the right thing by our gardens and countryside and demand a peat-free future.\""},{"url":null,"title":"bennachie saved from a96 dual plans","story":"The option to create a dual carriageway through the Bennachie area has been scrapped by the Scottish Government.It has been removed following initial design and assessment work, and also feedback from the public.Initial options removed include the existing A Inverurie Bypass and the offline southern route between east of Huntly and Blackburn, which passes through the Bennachie Special Landscape Area.Local communities and road users in the Inverurie area have the chance to see and comment on the options being taken forward for further design as the Scottish government looks to identy a preferred route option next year.Public exhibitions will be held at Inverurie Town Hall todayand tomorrow , and residents in Huntly will get to have their say on Wednesdayat Stewarts Hall.

Sands helpline operates from .am to .pm Monday to Friday and pm to pm Tuesday and Thursday evenings. Sands is leading a coalition of more than  charities working to prevent baby deaths and pregnancy loss. Jointly, they are urging all NHS Trusts and Boards to improve bereavement care for parents across the UK.The call comes during Baby Loss Awareness Week, which runs from October  to October .The week also marks the roll-out of the National Bereavement Care Pathway , a partnership between the charities, governments and the NHS.The pathway sets out standards for providing excellent care to anyone affected by pregnancy and baby loss.This year is also Sands’ th anniversary, providing support to parents who have suffered a bereavement.While there have been many improvements since , unfortunately, inconsistencies still remain across the UK.Marc Harder, the NBCP project lead for Sands, said: “Standards of care across the country right now are very much inconsistent.“We want those in power to ensure that bereaved parents get the best possible care, wherever they live and wherever they present themselves – whether that be AE, a maternity unit or early pregnancy unit.“Sadly, health care professionals don’t always have the training they need to speak to bereaved parents.“In an audit we carried out last year, only  per cent of Trusts with maternity units provided mandatory bereavement training.“And of those  per cent,  per cent of them only provided their staff with one hour or less of bereavement training each year.data-src\"https:res. jpress image fetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.fetoday webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Local politicians have responded to Kirkcaldy Foodbanks urgent plea for help.

Marc added: “In the next  months, we have the opportunity to really make a dference in Scotland.“We have come a long, long way since  but we’ve still got a way to go.“We long for a world in which there is no baby loss. “Until then we’ll continue to work to ensure parents receive the best possible care they can during their bereavement journey.”Scottish Government funding lays pathway to improvementsIn April this year, the National Bereavement Care Pathwayfor pregnancy and baby loss was extended to Scotland, thanks to £, in funding from the Scottish Government. Sands is working with the Scottish Government, a number of baby loss charities and other health care partners in Scotland to develop the approach over the next two years, with the plan to pilot, implement and embed the NBCP across Scotland by March .Five experiences of pregnancy or baby loss are included in the NBCP including miscarriage, termination of pregnancy for foetal anomaly, stillbirth, neonatal death and the sudden unexpected death of an infant up to the age of  months.Health Secretary Shona Robison said: “The funding will allow implementation of the National Bereavement Care Pathway in pilot sites across Scotland and ensure all bereaved parents are offered high quality, sensitive bereavement care.”The development of the NBCP in Scotland is being overseen by a Scottish steering group.Kate Mulley, director of research, education and policy at Sands, said: “We are extremely grateful for the support of the Scottish Government and Sands support groups in Scotland who have contributed to the funding of this vital project which will make such a dference to so many families.” Forty years ago, two bereaved mothers, Bel Mooney and Hazelanne Lewis, found there was no support available. So they founded Sands in .At that time, most parents were not allowed to see, hold or bury their babies and they could not put their babies’ names on the stillbirth certicate.Sands is now the leading stillbirth and neonatal death charity in the UK.

I am grateful to Andy Moir once again for making himself available and to all those we met in Stronsay, who engaged constructively and put forward a number of issues for further consideration.“The key issue raised at the public meeting was undoubtedly the decision by NHS Orkney not to include a helipad on the site of the new Balfour hospital. Concerns were expressed about apparent delays in transferring Isles patients, brought in by air ambulance, from Kirkwall airport to the current Balfour due to a lack of land ambulance capacity.“While it is unlikely that NHS Orkney will reopen the decision on a helipad, ious suggestions were made about how delays in transfer to the hospital might be avoided in future.

The new strategy will shape the country’s transport priorities for the next  years.Age Scotland and Transport Scotland have said they have been working closely with older people in communities across island, rural and urban Scotland since spring to understand how transport affects older peoples’ daily lives.Gillian Skuse, Charity Director of Age Scotland Orkney, stressed how important it is that local older people get involved in these discussions.“We’ve heard from older people around the islands that transport can impact their mobility, running their errands, enjoying activities and being part of their local communities. This consultation is a great opportunity for older Orcadians’ comments and experiences to help shape future planning for more inclusive, affordable and accessible transport on our islands.”Speaking about the workshop, Age Scotland’s Policy Engagement  Campaigns Officer Simon Ritchie said: “We know that a lack of transport options can be a huge barrier for many older people in the Highlands and Islands living the le they want to live. Around , older people in Scotland don’t see anyone  for at least half a week so easy access to good transport options is vital to older people allowing them to run errands, meet friends and family, make medical appointments and improve their quality of le.#This is a brilliant opportunity for older people in Orkney to share their views on transport and shape the new National Transport Strategy.  Age Scotland and Transport Scotland want to hear how transport works for older Orcadians so that decision-makers can ensure older Orcadians can access the services they need in order to enjoy later le.#“We invite any and all older people in Orkney to come along and share their views with us.”The transport workshop will take place in Finstown on Thursday October  at the Orkney Men#s Shed.

Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.The building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.The centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this pointand is much needed.I wonder what,any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building  If you do have some proof to justy your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion George DicksonI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisationof a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in dferent buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep itfor the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.I also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last  years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.Some parents and staff have had a look through the new building at dferent stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed. I like many other parents and carers look forward to the day its complete and our daughters and sons can enjoy the help and encouragement from staff to live their lives to the best of their ability..."},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"Marc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August. It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le.

To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the th anniversary of the Milne Cup.Sadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.Many supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.While it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.But despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The - scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.Molloy’s introduction  minutes into the second half obviously made a dference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubtanyone  in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.But the damage had been done in the first half – at - down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.Some have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.I felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.Two years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a - defeat in Kirkwall.There is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s th birthday.It’s just a pity we have to wait a whole  months until a chance of revenge.: : : : : : : :A couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.There are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.A score of - was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.The Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.A few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.I would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.: : : : : : : :Orkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening#s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John CouttsThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over  guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.Unfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.The speeches which followed,anyone could hear what was being said, were on the y side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.It was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.Sinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous  game when he hit the back of the net five times in the - victory.: : : : : : : :And finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.On Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.Helped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.Robert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did -odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.The others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.The final score was a - win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate - football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"big turnout to welcome the eighth serene to whalsay ","story":"The latest Serene arrives at the pier at Symbister.

Given these turbines will be placed on high ground, to suggest they will dominate the landscape is an understatement # just what the tourists come to Shetland to see.As long as they#re not in Bressay or Sandness.Only one and a half times the size of big ben# just little things# pfffffff.Absolutely ridiculous!I’ve seen wind turbines with these extra large blades between Stirling and Edinburgh. They are enormous and look awful.Worth recalling that the perceived size of the blade sweepincreases as the square of the radiuse.g. increasing the bladeby . times doubles the perceived size of the blade sweep, or, increasing bladeby % increases perceived size by %John, the longer blades will increase the electrical power that each turbine can generate, giving VE more revenue.That’s as may be, but revenue does not equal profit, and by the time the unsustainable level of subsidy has been removed, the SCT have been suckered in to paying for the export cable, and SSE have ensured their pound of flesh is as great as they can get away with,Shetland will never see its money back.More of nothing is still only nothing.If they are increasing the height of the turbines,does this mean that they would need to increase the size and depth of the anchor points at what extra cost and who will pay Presumably, these are the latest models with towers and foundations redesigned, accordingly The changes should improve cost-effectiveness and presumably, VE’s intention is to improve competitiveness for the auction, which requires cutting costs to the bone and squeezing every last drop of revenue from the project to keep it viable.Given that the last round of auctions produced winning ‘strike prices’ of £. MWh, exactly half what VE insisted they needed for viability , it makes you wonder, would winning an auction capture their fabled “pot of gold at Rainbow’s End” or would it be merely a poisoned chalice that provides little or no# or worse# William, the size and cost of the foundations must be increased to accommodate more powerful wind turbines.Larger Turbines require loads more concrete poured into the blanket bog all previous calculations EIA are out the window.If turbine technology has #advanced considerably# why can#t they make them smaller, considerably The “technology advance” is to produce turbines with increased electrical capacity, requiring longer blades and larger fondations. The thought is that one MW turbine will cost less to install, own, and maintain than two MW turbines.Mr Innes, Project Director for Viking Energy, is quoted where as saying #Viking is now competing against a new generation of wind farms, including those offshore, where tip heights of m or more are now available.#In that case why doesn#t he just put these turbines offshore as well.Kay. Just a thought.Aircraft technology has advanced too and ‘planes get bigger and bigger. I suspect that miniaturisation , so beloved of the Japanese, whose watches, cameras , radios and a host of other products lead one to believe that for items to improve in performance , they need to get smaller. True in many instances but not all. That said, Japanese wind driven turbines might solve a few problems.A point of interest regarding Japan andCO free energy . Japan is planning on using nuclear, not wind power, as a major source of electricity production. One may understand that Japan has greater first-hand knowledge of nuclear atomic contamination than any other country on Earth having being subjected two atomic bombs and the Fukushima accident. Using that real information on real nuclear contamination, not the Green lunacy crank disinformation, so prevalent in Scotland. Japan has a knowledge-led, intelligent energy policy. As ofMay , there are  operable reactors in Japan. Of these, nine reactors in  power plants Additionally, five reactors have been approved for a start, and further  have start applications under review. It never ceases to amaze me how ignorance and fear shape energy policy. Japan is fully aware of the risks of nuclear I reference “the Liberal Democratic Party cabinet in April , calls nuclear power #the country#s most important power source#.[Japan is now aiming for #a realistic and balanced energy structure#. The Japanese Government targets for wind power deployment are set at only .% of electricity production by  . That is a total figure, onshore and offshore.What a huge shame The Scottish Government is unwilling to do the same, it would save our countryside from so much uglly devastation. Why #..Well you don`t need a rocket scientist to figure that one out.Ifthis horrendous project does go ahead it`ll be past its sell by the time it is finished and will be made obsolete by newer, more efficient and cleaner technology.When is the plug going to be pulled on this nonsense before any more money is lost to it If Viking want to increase the turbine size, it is not unreasonable to anticipate that the other windfarm developers will do the same.The floodgates are being opened and, instead of being a world-class destination for wildle  scenery, Shetland will become a world-class example of crass development without regard to the obvious damage to environment, health and wellbeing, not to mention income from tourism.Renewable energy should be pursued, but in Shetland’s case the cost of the VE project has already been far higher – in every sense – than the imagined benefits.I maybe wrong, but wind farm technology appears to be the cheapest form of producing electricityin regard to other alternative sources of producing electricity.I am pretty sure wave and tidal energy could also be tapped into within Shetland, but economics seem to be based on the cheapest alternative compared to wave or tidal resources being the better, possibly, and signicantly less intrusive than the massive wind turbines scaring the Shetland landscape and more than likely tourists remembering the islands not for its beauty but#.well, it is self explanatory.The potential economic damage caused by the wind turbines I am pretty sure would outweigh any positive contribution the islands may have in regard to tourism or other positive attributes the islands may have.Time, no doubt, will be the final answer#.. watch this space, as they say.David. Just to be a bit more optimistic about wind farms , there is every likelihood that visitors to Shetland will already be familiar with rotating blades .It is a fast growing energy generation procedure so would not come as a shock.The other thing is ,such equipment would almost certainly not be visible from all corners of Shetland.People would get used to them just as they are used to the island hopping planes.It’s a bit unfortunate that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions.I take onboard your points, Haydn, but I think what is putting people off the VEP, is the shear cost of what it could possibly be. I have heard a figure not far short of kicking on the door of £. Billion, and possibly more, and how many decades would this take to bring VEP into the black in terms of revenue One should also look into the potential running and maintenance costs per year for such a project  Would the revenue created be enough to off-set such costs or would VE require more funding from the SCT, to balance its books It seems very evident, the more information people in Shetland know about VEP, the more people are put off the whole idea in terms of economics and what little benefit the islands may reap from it  I have heard a figure of around £ million a year###.poor investmentthe projected costs are to be believed. Aof around. of % does not bode well.I have to take issue with you here Haydn, The proposed VE turbines will now be meres high and constructed on hills. The high point some meters plus above sea level. That would be the line of sight from sea level of about  miles. Precious little of Shetland would not see the VE turbines!! I note you claim #that severe condemnation is a reactionto newish ideas and inventions#. I would respectfully point out wind turbines are hardly a new idea! Many consider them at the point of being an obsolete technologyNow for cutting-edge ideas, look to tidal generation and modular nuclear reactors. The latter , I believe you are openly condemning, something about us all glowing in the dark was your comment!!! Now that was Scaremongering nonsense. Rosatom,Russias vehicle for nuclear expansion,has about % of new nuclear plant contracts in the bag,mainly in emerging and third world countries .If Chernobyl is anything to go by and what Russia the culprit did in rectyingthe mess,novichok is going to be a piddle in the ocean in comparison.Read an article this morning.Wish I could remember which paper that said Germany#s  year old wind turbines are coming to the end of their usefulness and no longer qualy for subsidies. No recycling as the blades are made from fibre glass.Their plan is to dump them on third world nations so creating more waste rather than cleaning the mess up themselves. Viking energy should sit up and take not it but will have cloth ears when it comes to profit. Remember, as you sow,so shall ye reap.Germany, by nature of its fragmented political system with government by weak coalitions only resulted in the Green Partyexercising much influence beyond their electoral mandate. Nuclear power was cut back as a political gesture to the Greens, that had nothing to do with the science of the matter. The result was a massive increase in coal-fired electrical generation and also the importation of Natural Gas. Germany is now the worlds largest importer of Natural Gas! and the German motor industries disingenuous diesel emission data is almost legendary!!!.Deaths from atmospheric pollution in Germany are massive and this year the EU is taking Germany to court for breaking all EU guidelines. It is indeed very ironic that the Scotish Government does so much to praise the use of Wind power and exploit all its rural communities to that end while it does all in its ability to expandGas Exportation from the North Sea,. It likewise imports Gasto Grangemouth and at all times try and use North Sea oil revenue to promote Nationalist agendas. The logic escapes me, perhaps you could explain Grahm,!!!Billy , I understand where you are coming from when stating that  year old turbines in Germany are coming to the end of their lives , but is this surprising   Since technological advances in vast areas of activity are so rapid it would be most unlikely for things to suddenly stand still.Try selling a  year old car , TV. washing machine ,vacuum cleaner , racing bike etc etc. Virtually worthless . Fighter ‘planes cost £millions EACH so should we have stuck with the Tiger Moth to save money   Times change continuously.No doubt some would like the world to stop to enable them to get off so that they could abandon their mortgage and live in a cave in a cosy corner of the Moon. All very whimsical but I’m sure you get the drt.Interesting comment Haydn. I am unable to find any substantive advance in Wind Turbines as technology over the last  years. They are larger yes, but no less polluting and even more damaging to the environment. The most recent research would indicate that disturbance in airflow patterns and friction around the rotating blades not only creates more noise pollution but results in substantive heat creation. That heat creation in itself would and does contribute to global warming new research has shown. Reference #Hard University’s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences# would indicate wind power in theU.S. with wind alone would warm the planet a quarter-degree Celsius! If this research is proved correct, we will be decommissioning and scrapping wind turbines far sooner than the protagonist advocate. There are already far better ways of generating clean electricity than  meter high turbines, sadly too many have staked their reputations on the wind myth and will resist accepting they have been wrongFair enough Ian. I must confess that I was unaware of the likely height of the proposed turbine blades.I’m not so sure about Japan and others having a reducing intention to set up more turbines though. As for the comment I made about nuclear radiation causing people to glow in the dark —— you surely cannot be serious !!!!That was no more than a figure of speech.I hope you are merely poking fun at such a prospect.I know that glow worms emit light as do other creatures in the sea but it’s silly to think that the effects on iniduals who have been subjected to radiation for medical reasons would then walk about looking like Beacons.Give me a break Ian!Ian.—- Your comments on October th at -.Plenty of food for thought in your missive .Thanks.It is a balance between providing energy safely and economically, but our conventional methods of using fossil fuels has brought to the fore due to the impact such energy has had on the environment.However, whilst we are being side-tracked about the impact of fossil fuels, nobody has every mentioned the impact on the planet caused by agriculture. Agriculture, I believe, causes  times more green house gases than all of transportation put together Not only does agriculture produce more green houses gases than transportation, it is the greatest cause of environmental destruction than any other industry. As our population grows, this will become more evident, as we see species upon species being put on the # endangered species list # or # become extinct #. This man-made catastrophe will impact on other species and it will eventually impact the very existence of humans on the planet as nature takes revenge through disease, drought and other natural impacts.Progress in providing alternative energy may be a positive start, but at what price will this be to the planet and le,this progress is purely based on the man-made concept of monetary value and this of profit David Spence, the single most signicant threats to humanity are overpopulation and our leaders, scientic, religious and political leader#s, utter cowardice to dare to mention such an undeniable fact. World population is set to double in  years. Energy needs, food supply, pollution are all driven by human population density. It makes no odds how many windmills we build whatever their size! Atmospheric pollution, global warming or starvation awaits and will kill all our children#s children as long as human overbreeding continues. It is hard to take the Greens cranks, politicians and doom-mongers of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change seriously when their reports fail to state, or take into account the blindingly obvious.David. Your warning shots make me feel that I should grabfew bottles of whisky 🥃 go back to bed and snooze my way through the day even though there’s a hot Indian summer outside.!!Seriously , weare facing a dire situation which will impact on my grandsons far more than on me —— or you. When you say ‘Agriculture’ I’m assuming that you are including livestock.The greenhouse gas emissions from the planet’s animal le must be enormous and that’s whether or not they are raised for their meat .Also, to take your point, such vast amounts of money are tied into food production , it’s hard to seeany measures at all, however well intentioned, , will enable us to eradicate the decline of le in its widest sense.Time to grab that whisky bottle I think 🤔.

How about you John  Sadly my sense of humour is a little lacking here! £ million plus SCT funds gone.  meter high windmills on s of tons of concrete bases all over Shetland. All of this for what  The delusional idea that such a project will save the planet. VE is and always has been a money making project under the guise of the #Green Idyle#.

I do believe we are rapidly destroying our planet bitthe findings of# The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change# are valid, windmills on Shetland are an irrelevancy, which will only increase our problems. Their construction will release vast quantities of CO their verywill warm the air around them. It goes a bit beyond Dad,s Army humour, about as funny as Donald Trump#s program of clean coal, Scotland importing fracked gas from the USA and Shetland shipping in wood for burning by deforesting Canada and Eastern Europe!!! It is long past a laughing matter. It is just Green idiocy at its most typical. Given the limited cerebral ability of most politicians this obviously did not prove too dficult LOL!Humour is a coping mechanism.If you can laugh 😆 in the face of adversity you become bullet proof. Only the brave and stoical can achieve that. Dwelling on negatives perpetuates negativity. Goodness knows, there are ample supplies of that in these columns.£ million plus SCT funds have not “gone” Ian. Money does not simply disappear. Whatever the total sum, a decent chunk will of course have found its way into the pay packet pockets of some of those with most to gain from the project. However, so long as the cash gets into the hands of the worthist members of the local community, deserving entrepreneurs intent on bettering their community, who could possibly disagree  Try to be more charitable Ian.If there was anything whfy about all this Tavish Scott would have long since ensured it was properly addressed.

The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League.

However, despite having been beaten from the spot earlier in the match, Mark Johnston ed to his left to thwart Ben Yoxon#s effort and with it seal his side#s playoff berth.After succumbing to a - defeat at the hands of their rivals the week before in the Ross Cup, Kyleakin came storming back with a confidence-boosting - win which brought them right back into contention, while also ending the hosts# unbeaten run in the league in the process. Gordy Mccarroll opened the scoring with a well-taken effort from a freekick, with Cameron Thompson scoring the second from close range.In stark contrast to his display in the cup game the week before # which saw him earn a red card # Mccarroll put in a man of the match performance with a tireless showing and a goal to boot.The south Skye side churned out an important win as they overcame a tough nut in Northwest.Kyleakin were far from their best in the first period but a Stewart Johnston goal before the break gave them a  to build on. Clinical second-half strikes from Innis Thompson and Gordy Mccarroll sealed a victory which had looked far from certain for large periods of the game.With Mallaig having finished the season on  points, and Juniors holding a one-point advantage over the Reds going into the match, David Butcher#s side knew it was win or bust in terms of their title defence.What followed was a fine team performance by the  winners with goals from Cameron Thompson, Stuart Gillies, and a brace from Gordy Mccarroll. Their victory was punctuated by some outstanding goalkeeping by Craig Wilson # including an incredible stop to deny Juniors as they threatened to turn the tide early in the second half. #I feel our team have performed very well this year and are still learning in every game we play in this league. I’ve been impressed with the dedication shown by everyone to make sure this season went as smoothly as possible.##The team has certainly had its ups and downs this year, we have been caught napping in a couple of games that most people would expect us to win, but on the flip side we have stepped up in all the big games and have onlyone defeat in the league so far, so I can’t be too critical.# #It was great to see a four-way battle for the title but our lads needed no motivation. To be in that position was fantastic and we knew how hard the task would be against a Sleat team who themselves have had a great season this year. I have to say, it’s the most focused I’ve seen the lads and that’s including the two finals we’ve missed out on this year.#I don’t really think it gave me the extra motivation as I don’t really look at what other teams are doing, I knew after we beat Sleat that we were in pretty good shape to at least get a playoff but I didn’t think it would be against Mallaig # so credit to them for a great run-in. Whoever comes out on top on Saturday will be worthy winners.# #This might sound silly, but no, I was fully confident with the boys at the start of the season. Our aim was the title, although we liked keeping it too ourselves, so we could get our heads down and show what we can do on the pitch. I’ve been surprised by the ersity of the league. Every club has a completely dferent style and it’s not a case of setting up the same each week. We#re still learning and hopefully improving.# #It’s definitely a dferent challenge trying to defend the title as you are the team everyone wants to beat, so teams probably lt their game a wee bit against you and you have the added pressure of people#s expectations of you.# #I have always used the same approach to every game since I’ve started managing Kyleakin and I don’t see why that should change. Doing anything dferent could just add pressure to the boys and you’re disrupting what they are used to.# #No dferent than usual for us, everyone is happy to have had a weekend to prepare for the game.

He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.The correct decision by British Secretary of State Karen Bradley to reduce MLA wages cannot be allowed to mask the true nature of the undemocratic and politically damaging measures she announced in recent days.By her own staggering admission, Karen Bradley did not understand the voting motivations of the electorate here when she first took up the post.Clearly that is no longer the case. But unfortunately for anyone in this society who is interested in the rights of citizens, equality or the implementation of previous agreements, there is only one set of votes that Karen Bradley is interested in – and that is the DUP’s.Her government is reliant on the DUP for its own survival and is clearly determined not to upset that applecart, no matter how rotten its contents may be.She had an opportunity this week to take tangible measures that would have helped pave the way for a restoration of the power-sharing institutions by confronting the ongoing denial of rights by the DUP.But despite championing rights and equality in her own constituency and country, she failed to do so on behalf of citizens here.Instead what she announced was a suite of measures which subvert the democratic process and previous agreements.Faced with the prospect of a court-ordered Assembly poll, she moved to suspend her powers to call an election as set out in the legislation. That is a hugely retrograde step and a move away from the Good Friday Agreement.It also begs the question, what kind of self-declared democratic government, suspends the right of the people to have their say at the polls And while we all accept that officials require clarity on their roles in the current climate, any move to replace democratic accountability with greater authority for unelected civil servants or Direct Rule Ministers is entirely unacceptable.The aim of Karen Bradley’s intervention this week, setting aside the convenient timing of distracting from explosive evidence at the RHI Inquiry, was to buy time. To announce a flurry of supposed activity but, in reality, doing nothing but continuing to facilitate the denial of rights which is preventing a restoration of the power-sharing institutions.Her government is prepared to allow the political process to continue to drt with no strategy and no plan for a resolution rather than challenge their confidence and supply partners.This reliance on the DUP remains the central problem andany process around restoring the institutions is to be credible, Karen Bradley must begin prioritising the rights of citizens over Tory party self-interest.The Dublin Government must also assert its full role as a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement.The Taoiseach has pledged not to abandon northern citizens in the context of Brexit. He also has responsibilities to them in terms of rights and his government and must now show leader-ship in securing and defending rights which are routinely delivered everywhere  on this is-land.Leo Varadkar would not tolerate discrimination against the LGBT community, women, victims and Irish speakers in Dublin. He should not tolerate it in Belfast either.There can be no ambivalence or equivocation on rights, equality and integrity in government.These are basic building blocks of any democratic society. They are not republican demands and it is long past that the British Government stopped prioritising its own selfish interests over what should be birth-rights of people they claim to represent.What is certain is that Direct Rule failed in the past and is not and never will be acceptable again.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27474  ","story":" Mark MoloneyMartin said that while a decision on a merger with the SDLP or contesting elections in the North has not yet been reached, there were no circumstances under which Fianna Fáil candidates would not take their seats.FIANNA Fáil leader Mícheál Martin TD has confirmed that successful Fianna Fáil candidates standing in the North would take their seats in Westminster.

We are elected as MPs who vote for Sinn Féin not to take seats at Westminster.”Meanwhile, a poll by LucidTalk in June  showed that % of Sinn Féin voters backed their abstentionist stance, with only % opposed.  When supporters were asked how they would reactSinn Féin judged that it strategically suited the party to take seats in Westminster, more than half of their supporterssaid they would oppose such a move.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27475  ","story":" Michael McMonagleWe believe there is now an urgent need for an inclusive, constructive debate on the future, including how a united Ireland might be brought about and what it might look like.- Matt Carthy MEPSinn Féin will host a United Ireland conference in Letterkenny tomorrow featuring a range of speakers discussing what Irish unity would look like and how it can be achieved. The Towards A United Ireland conference will be hosted by Matt Carthy MEP and will be held in the An Grianan Theatre in Letterkenny from am tomorrow. It will feature two  discussions with contributors discussing whether an agreed Ireland is possible anda unity referendum could be won. Panellists will include journalist and unionist commentator, Alex Kane, economist Paul Gosling, founder of Equate, Michael Barron, Jonathan Shafi from the Scottish independence movement, commentator Patricia MacBride and Gillian Hamill, journalist and homelessness campaigner. The  discussions will be chaired by Damien Dowds, editor of the Inishowen Independent. Speakers from Sinn Féin will include Elisha McCallion MP, Martina Anderson MEP, Pearse Doherty TD, Matt Carthy MEP and Senator Padraig MacLochlainn. It is the fth in a series of Towards A United Ireland conferences to be held recently. Speaking ahead of the event, Matt Carthy encouraged as many people as possible to attend. \"We believe there is now an urgent need for an inclusive, constructive debate on the future, including how a united Ireland might be brought about and what it might look like. \"As part of this process Sinn Féin has organised a series of successful conferences on this theme in Dublin, Belfast, Cork and London. \"The event will give a range of perspectives on whether a new Ireland is possible and whether or not we can win a referendum on Irish unity. \"This is an important discussion and there is a place for everyone in it so I would encourage as many people as possible to come along and join us in Letterkenny,\" he said. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27476  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonBrexit means that change in the political relations between Britain and Ireland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democratic legitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.- Declan KearneyTheannual British-Irish Associationconference convened last weekend inOxford, England.At thesame time the British government was taking its latest step away from the Good FridayAgreement by changing legislation on calling elections in the north, the DUPleader pulled out from attending the BIA conference at the last minute to hostthe Tory defence minister at another DUP gala dinner in Fermanagh.OnWednesday, speaking after meeting the British Prime Minister in London sheprovided the latest evidence that the DUP has no commitment to restoring thepolitical institutions.  TheBrexit catastrophe is unfolding relentlessly.TheTory party civil war has become even more visceral since the Chequersannouncement.The RHIinquiry continues to reveal a DUP party which was clearly dysal ingovernment, providing insights which make a mockery of that partys purportedadherence to good governance’.IanPaisleys misconduct  discredited behaviour arising from the Sri Lankaepisode is yet another reminder of the recurring financial scandals associatedwith the DUP.The DUPjust does not get it!Thatparty has been in turmoil since it walked away from the draft agreement andaccommodation with Sinn Féin on th February which would have restoreding political institutions by the following week.Yet inall these circumstances the DUP feels no pressure to change its position.Andeventhe British government was so inclined, the Tories have no incentive todo so in the midst of their own governmental and party crises.Inreality some within the DUP have turned away from the political institutions.They have already decided the party should notcontest the  local council elections against the back ground of anagreement on Acht Gaeilge and Irish language rights. Its increasingly obviousthat continued political impasse is a DUP default position in the absence ofgiving political leadership and making political progress.LastMonday in a new destabilising development the Boundary Commission reaffirmedrecommendations which resemble an electoral and political gerrymander of thenorth as a counter to irreversible demographic changes.Thefact is that the Good Friday Agreement and political process are now being heldto ransom by the political self interests and unionist priorities of the DUPand the Tories.TheBritish government and DUP alliance has become a mutually reinforcing wrecker’scharter. Democratic norms are being thrown to the side and violated.In myown speech to the BIA conference I said there is now a real risk that years of progress could be squandered.Irepeated that the absence of ing political institutions is bad forsociety.Thefailure to fully implement and defend the Good Friday Agreement damagesboth the peace and political processes.And thecatastrophe of Brexit has been torpedoed into the midst of these dficulties.Thereis an imperative for us all to look beyond the scale of existing crises and to provide hope and positive vision.Sinn Féin is absolutely dedicated and authenticin our commitment to opening a new phase of the peace process whichsecures a permanent reconciliation and healing process throughout theisland of Ireland.Partitionis the central fault line at the heart of Irish politics and society.It hasbeen an abject failure from its imposition. Thesectarian structure of the northern state post partition ensured thata substantial minority were destined never to be treated asequals.TheCivil Rights Movement  years ago highlighted graphically the inability of theunionist state to treat the minority as equals.This belligerent opposition from powerful sections within politicalunionism against reform of the northern statepersists today in the form of political unionist hostility towards implementation of theGood Friday Agreement since . Therefusal of political unionism to embrace a rights-based society and equalityhas culminated in the collapse of the political institutionsand associated crisis in the north for thelast  months.Thegreater majority of citizens in the north are committed to the Good FridayAgreement.They wantrights to be guaranteed which are already enjoyed by others inDublin, London, Edinburgh and Cardf.The politicalearthquake of Brexit has again exposed the negative rolethat partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentallyanti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.Over  years into the Irish peace process, Irish citizens inthe north now face the very real and frightening potential of partition,as the main source of ision and conflict in Ireland, being reinforced.Verysignicantly, a seismic sht has also occurred in the ambitionand expectation of republicans, nationalists and other citizens inthe north.A newgeneration is questioning partition.Therepublican and nationalist constituency is now looking beyondBrexit and towards the prospect of accelerated Irish reunication.Brexithas become a defining moment for these islands.Ithas introduced a new political discourse about the future ofIreland north and south, and the relationship with Britain and Europe.Thedebate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have now movedcentre stage.Thesenew unprecedented realities in turn present new strategic challenges for all ofus in political leadership.Theydemand that we act as pioneers of the future not prisoners of the past.Thereforeit is time for a paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.Negativemismanagement of the Irish peace process and the Good FridayAgreement by successive British governments, and the particular pro-unionist bias of the Conservative governmentsince , must be replaced with a recognition that the transitiontowards Irish unity should begin.Initially thatshould take the form of preparing for a unity referendumand by engaging in a new political discussion with the Irishgovernment and all political parties on the island of Ireland in relation toreunication.Formany in the British establishment this will be an anathema.Forthose in the Tory party leadership who have tied their electoral survival to analliance with the DUP this prospect will be unthinkable.However, Brexitmeans that change in the political relations between Britain andIreland is now unavoidable, and, while partition never had any democraticlegitimacy, its continued imposition is no longer sustainable.It istime for historic, decisive and brave leadership to be shown by the Britishstate.In parallel, the Irish government needs to begin to prepare for theconstitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish unity. Itshould facilitate an open and inclusive national conversation on Irish unityinvolving all citizens, political parties, social partners and civicsociety.A GreenPaper on Irish unity should be published detailing the constitutional,political, fiscal and economic measures for a successful transition to a unitedIreland.TheIrish government should commence a discussion with the EU commission andinstitutions to explore their practical role and support in facilitating anefficient process of reunication.Politicalunionism must also open itself up to the new reality that Ireland has changeddramatically. Toomany within the leadership of the DUP, and other unionist parties, seek refugein the past, preferring to refight old battles, instead of looking forward tonew opportunities.Societalchange brought about through referenda on marriage equalityand women’s reproductive health rights means that political unionism can nolonger conjure up the spectre of ‘Rome Rule’.Demographicshts in the north are irreversible.It isimportant to note that political unionism and indeed the DUP are notmonolithic.Somevoices within unionism – few in number, but notable – have recognisedthese realities and urge fellow unionists to join the debate and tobecome pioneers of our collective future.However,republicans and nationalists need to recognise the existence of realapprehensions and fears within the unionist constituency.Unionistcitizens need to be convinced that the failures andinjustices of the past will never be repeated and that the newtransformational challenges to be faced will be managed withgenerosity and magnanimity.No onewill have any reason to leave their home in an agreed united Ireland.The %which would make up a new Ireland, who would not identy as Irish, must neverfeel the exclusion from society that was experienced by Irish citizens in thenorth under unionist rule.Aminority should be cherished because it enriches society.Diversityshould be celebrated and respected.Thispresents a strategic challenge for republicans and nationalists.Politicaland civic unionism needs to be persuaded that it can own asignicant stake within a new, pluralist, constitutional, national democracy.Republicanshave a responsibility to develop a sense of belonging for all of thosewho should be welcomed, and cherished equally as childrenof a new Ireland.Thiswill require compromises and accommodation to guarantee religious, politicaland constitutional rights.Theopportunity is emerging to reimagine Ireland to reshaperelationships and create a unity of belonging for those who definethemselves as British as well as Irish and, who share the unionist political identityand orange cultural traditions.Sinn Féin will act as a guarantor for the Britishidentity and the unionist tradition within a new and agreed united Ireland.Butfundamental change can not be left to happenstance. It must be planned andresourced.Whocould have imagined  years ago that Germany would be reunited sosuccessfully, or that the edice of South African apartheid would fallfive years later.Themodern precedents exist for successful political and economictransformation and transition.Mandelawas right: “It only seems impossible until it is done.”Irishunity is both reasonable and achievable.Irelandtoday is a multi-cultural society, north and south.We arestronger as a people for that.Sinn Féin’s vision is of a new inclusive,constitutional, rights-based democracy on the island of Ireland.Thereis so much to be excited about the rainbow ersity of modern Ireland.This isa time for us all to become pioneers for the future to be visionary with ourpolitics and to make the decisions now about planning for a new Ireland.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27477  ","story":" Michael McMonagleUachtarán na hÉireann must be a beacon of hope for all our people – North, South, East, and West.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home.

However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27486  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National Chairperson“The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8667856.1539430479!/image/image.jpg","title":"too often the dedication of those working on frontline services goes unnoticed","story":"The unsung heroes of frontline service provision in communities across Northern Ireland have been celebrated at a gala event in Armagh.Councils throughout the province were represented as the nine award category winners of the  Local Government Awards were announced.

Council simply said they are now being stored at a Council yard.Meanwhile people have also been concerned as to the whereabouts of the original town centre bandstand.The plan for this was for it to be re-established in the Peoples Park, however this has not yet happened.When thecontacted Council for a statement, they said: “We are delighted with the success to date of Harmony Hub – our borough’s newest and state-of-the-art outdoor entertainment venue.“Harmony Hub has showcased a wide range of talented local artists since it opened earlier this year and we look forward to welcoming more great performances and attractions.Speaking about the original bandstand, the Council confirmed they have plans for it.“The old bandstand was carefully dismantled so it can be preserved and relocated to the People’s Park.“We are currently working on plans for this installation and more information will be made available in due course.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1065046.jpg--.jpg?1538637007000\n","title":"tension in chamber over gaa dinner","story":"AN INVITE for councillors to a GAA gala dinner stoked up tensions in the Council chamber last week.A request from St Ergnats GAC to invite members of Mid and East Antrim to the Tullyglass on November  was read to members.It followed an item on the agenda with members being invited to a gala dinner in support of NI Childrens Hospice.Members had agreedthey were to attend the hospice dinner that they would purchase their own tickets.When the GAA dinner was raised Councillor Carson proposed to mark it as read as the club was not located in the Mid and East Antrim boundary lines.However Councillor Declan OLoan said the club was located in Moneyglass which fell very close to the border and that a lot of players at the club lived within the Mid and East Antrim Borough.He added: This is an outstanding club like many others in the area who raise a lot of money and doesnt depend on its council for support.I would propose we do the same for this as we are doing for the hospice.Councillor Gaston seconded Councillor Carsons proposal to mark the invitation as read.If anyone wishes to attend this they should go in their own capacity.Councillor Maguire added that the issue of location of the club should not come into the decision.He added: If I remember correctly some members of this Council attended a dinner in Lurgan or Portadown for the British Legion so that set a precedent.I would second what Councillor OLoan has said and treat this invite similar to that of the hospice dinner.Councillor Gaston added that both invitations were completely dferent.The Northern Ireland Hospice does sterling work and is for the benefit of people all over Northern Ireland. It is not just for a section of the community.Councillor Carsons proposal to mark the invite as read was carried with a vote of  in favour.The event is to mark the clubs th anniversary with special guests including champion jockey Tony McCoy.It will be held in the Tullyglass Hotel on November .

I was booked into try their Interstellar Relaxation Experience with the package tailored to leave the senses ‘other worldly’.A warm welcome was extended at the spa entrance as my battered Converse were taken away to be swtly replaced with a cosy pair of slippers. After changing I met with my therapist for the afternoon, Leanne, who explained that the experience would entail a pressure point foot massage, hot stone back, neck and shoulder massage, regenerating jasmine infused facial with warming Space Mask and to finish a chance to sip over a glass of flora jasmine tea.Having an almost -month- year-old son, bag, baggage, pram, and the everyday ‘essentials’ to cover that role, my back and shoulders were in dire need of a serious overhaul and I was more than happy to let Leanne knead, massage and crack away at the numerous knots accumulated over the past two years.Having chose a detoxying body oil for the duration of the treatment, Leanne explained that the ingredients would still be working their magic  hours after, so Monday could be faced head on. Combining the very finest in the Spa’s renowned ESPA range, Leanne used the Optimal Skin Procleanser which acts as a cleaner, exfoliator and mask for visibly radiant skin, hydrating cleansing milk and from their age-defying range – which I was all for – the Tri-Active Advanced Instant Facial with the Regenerating Face Treatment Oil and Lt and Firm Mask. The treatment was further complimented with a pressure point foot massage and application of the very latest in beauty utopia, the self heating Spacemask, which works to relieve tiredness, eye strain and many other ‘earthly tensions’.ESPA’s Pink Hair and Scalp Mask was then applied to enhance the Tibetan scalp massage. By this stage I was wondering how I was going to get off the bed such was my relaxed state and as Leanne handed me a glass of flora jasmine and rose tea I felt completely chilled.The chance to enjoy the spa facilities – not too mention the spectacular scenery – is another added bonus of the treatment and helps to suspend the fact you have toto reality before the end of the day.We are all guilty of not making enough time for ourselves in modern society with many of us trying and in many cases failing to find the right mix of work le balance. The Spa at Slieve Donard’s staff, therapists and especially their autumn Interstellar package ensure that those who partake, their minds and bodies are transported to a better place – for a few hours at least. The Interstellar Relaxation autumn day spa experience runs until November . The treatment is priced at £ Monday-Friday at the Culloden Spa or £ at the Slieve Donard Spa. A £ supplement applies for Saturday and Sundays at both Spas.

Mrs May called for \"cool, calm heads to prevail\" after talks last weekend failed to bridge dferences between the UK and EU over the future status of the border in Ireland. And she warned of the danger that failure to reach agreement over the border could result in the UK leaving the EU without a deal in March next year. Mrs May said progress had been made on Northern Ireland but two problems remain - the EUs demands over the Northern Ireland backstop and the need for a time limit.Mrs Mays backstop proposal features a temporary arrangement keeping the whole of the UK in a customs union, which she expects to be lted by the end of . But she refused to give a firm guarantee the backstop would definitely expire by December .Ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was heckled by Opposition MPs before asking Mrs May to confirm the UK would \"take back control\" in December .\"If that isnt the deadline, could she say when it is,\" he said.The PM said: \"I continue to believe what we should all be doing is working to ensure the backstop never comes into place and that actually its not December  were talking about but January , .\" Mrs May confirmed that was her \"expectation\", adding one of the issues still under discussion was \"how we can ensure we do reflect the temporary nature of the backstop\", which she went on to add should not be necessary.DUP Westminster leader Nigel Dodds pressed the PM to reiterate that the UK will leave the EU \"together with no part hived off either in the single market or customs union dferences\". Mrs May replied: \"We will be leaving the European Union together.\" Shortly afterwards, Mr Tusk said that while there was good will on both sides, the negotiations have been more complicated than expected. A group of Cabinet ministers met last night to discuss the developments, with Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Environment Secretary Michael Gove among those who attended. Mrs May will address the leaders of the remaining  EU nations tomorrow before they discuss over dinner without her how to proceed in the talks. In a letter to EU leaders ahead of the summit, Mr Tusk said: \"As things stand today, it has proven to be more complicated than some may have expected. We should nevertheless remain hopeful and determined, as there is good will to continue these talks on both sides. \"But at the same time, responsible as we are, we must prepare the EU for a no-deal scenario, which is more likely than ever before. Like the UK, the Commission has started such preparations, and will give us an update during the meeting.\""},{"url":null,"title":"a 150k family home up for grabs for price of","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

Ms Foster told reporters it was important to engage, that there was no point in standing back and shouting at each other, that understanding should be developed between unionists and the Irish government. She added: \"There have to be cool heads in what is a very febrile atmosphere.\" Mrs Foster said the EUs backstop suggestion whereby Northern Ireland would continue to follow the blocs rulesno trade deal is struck would create barriers with Great Britain. \"Great Britain is our largest market by far and we cannot have barriers,\" she said. The DUP leader said Northern Ireland sent three-and-a-half times more goods to Great Britain than to the Republic. Mrs Foster with curator Louis Parminter, Archbishop of Dublin Michael Jackson, and Dean William Morton inside the cathedral\"So it is very important that we dont have barriers between ourselves and the rest of Great Britain,\" she added. Speaking to reporters before a visit to St Patricks Cathedral in Dublin earlier, Mrs Foster said: \"When I spoke in Killarney a few months ago, I described our two countries as two semi-detached houses with dferent interiors but in the same community. \"Sometimes dficulties arise between neighbours when we dont understand each others positions. I am a unionist. I want to maintain and improve Northern Irelands place within the United Kingdom. I will oppose any proposal which would damage the Union in the long-term. \"Unionism is united in opposing any backstop which places an international style border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom.\"A deal which leads to Northern Ireland slavishly following EU rules whilst all the time erging away from the rest of the United Kingdom undermines the constitution and the single market of the United Kingdom - our main market.\"Mr Varadkar suggested a deal may be delayed as late as December. He said Dublin was making preparations for a \"potentially catastrophic\" no-deal withdrawal, but did not believe this was the most likely outcome. Mr Martin said he used his meeting with Mrs Foster to emphasis the importance of the so-called Irish backstop. \"I dont think all is lost yet,\" he said when askedthe UK and EU were moving closer to a no-deal scenario. However, he added that the politics of Westminster \"is very challenging\". \"Everybody you talk to wants to avoid a no-deal scenario, that includes Arlene,\" Mr Martin said. However, DUP Brexit spokesman Sammy Wilson MP said a no-deal outcome was now \"probably inevitable\" due to the \"intransigence\" of EU negotiators. Talks at the weekend foundered over the EUs demand for a \"backstop to the backstop\" designed to ensure the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic remains open under any circumstances. Mrs May has offered to keep the whole of the UK temporarily in a customs union with the EU until a broader trade deal is in place avoiding the need for customs and regulatory checks at the Irish border, with the expectation this will not be later than the end of . But Dublin has already ruled out her time limit proposal, and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier insisted a carve-out, keeping Northern Ireland alone in the EUs customs area, should remain available in case the UK-wide arrangement lapses before the trade deal is finalised. Mrs May told MPs this was not acceptable as it risked undermining the integrity of the UK. The PM warned the Irish issue must not be allowed to \"derail\" progress towards a deal which she said was in the interests of both the UK and EU. She told MPs she would take steps to ensure that \"we cannot be kept in this backstop arrangement indefinitely\". And she warned: \"We are entering the final stages of these negotiations. This is the time for cool, calm heads to prevail. \"And it is the time for a clear-eyed focus on the few remaining but critical issues that are still to be agreed.\" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn dismissed Mrs Mays comments as \"another nothing has changed moment from this shambles of a Government\".Meanwhile, Tanaiste Simon Coveney will hold a private meeting today in Luxembourg with Mr Barnier for Brexit talks at the General Affairs Council. They will discuss the current state of play in negotiations, and in particular talks on the draft Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, including the backstop.Mr Coveney said he was disappointed further progress had not been made. \"It is obviously disappointing that it has not yet been possible to make the decisive progress that we urgently need in the negotiations, despite the intensive efforts of both EU and UK negotiators,\" he said. \"TheGovernments position is clear - we want the negotiations to succeed but this will only be possible with agreement on a legally robust backstop to avoid a hard border in the withdrawal agreement, which must apply in all circumstances. \"Todays meeting offers another opportunity to thank our EU partners for their solid support and solidarity, which has been unwavering, and to reiterate our total support for Michel Barnier and his Task Force.\""},{"url":null,"title":"belfast traders working in a ghost town since primark blaze","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

However, in real terms, taking inflation into account, there was a .% reduction in this five-year period.Controlled and maintained schools are permitted to have surpluses or deficits of % of their budget share, or up to £, - whichever is the lesser.In the five years to March  the number of schools in deficit increased from  to  - a rise of just under %.The largest deficit at a post-primary school by March  was at Drumcree College in Portadown . The college closed in August  with a Key Stage  school, St John the Baptist College, opening on the site.The six other schools with deficits of £m or more at March  were Strabane AcademyCrumlin Integrated CollegeCity of Armagh High SchoolColeraine CollegeSt Eugenes College, Enniskillen, which has since closed , and St Columbans College, Kilkeel . The largest deficit at a primary school was £, . For a pre-school it was £, .Auditors found the largest deficits were more likely to be at smaller schools. Only one of the seven with a £m-plus debt had more than  pupils - the minimum post-primary enrolment threshold set out in previous reports.Between  and  the number of controlled and maintained schools with a surplus fell from  to .The largest inidual school surplus at March  was at a post-primary school - £m at St Louises Comprehensive College in Belfast.Provisional figures for the  months to March this year show  schools had surpluses totalling just over £m. Some  schools were in a deficit, totalling around £m. As a result,   is the first year that schools deficits outstrip surpluses. A  Audit Office report and a subsequent report by the Public Accounts Committee on the sustainability of schools included a series of recommendations aimed at addressing unsustainable schools. Todays report notes that many of these recommendations are still being progressed by the Department of Education. In   nearly a thirdof primary schools had fewer than  pupils, while % of post-primary schools had fewer than  pupils. Mr Donnelly said widespread reform of the system is needed. He added: \"The Department of Education and the Education Authority need to undertake a fundamental review of how schools are funded as well as ensuring the implementation of recommendations made by the Public Accounts Committee in its report on the Sustainability of Schools.\"The Department of Education and the Education Authority also need to ensure appropriate and effective interventions are developed and applied to reduce the risk of mismanagement of delegated budgets as well as ensuring mechanisms are in place to strengthen financial management in schools.\"The Department of Education said: \"We note the content of the report and are conscious of the need not to pre-empt any potential Public Accounts Committee consideration.\"We are considering the issues identied and will work closely with the Education Authority and other relevant stakeholders to consider the recommendations in the report.\"The Education Authority, as funding authority for all grant-funded schools, continues to engage with schools to strengthen and enhance their financial management. \"However, the department also recognises the need for signicant and radical transformation of the education sector.\""},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic updates latest disruption and delays on the roads","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsGood Friday AgreementSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupSchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotorcyclingMotor SportOther SportsBelfast GiantsBoxingTennisCricketCyclingHorse RacingHockeyRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitTechJobsAgriBalmoral ShowAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentHoroscopesNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeSeptember June CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoArchiveEventsSpirit of N.

Casey referred to Mr Gallagher’s previous membership of Fianna Fail despite being an independent candidate, saying: “I’m disappointed the Fianna Fail candidate could not be here.”He added that he was not surprised Mr Higgins did not attend and claimed the president could not defend his expenses at a debate on Saturday.Mr Casey then claimed Mr Higgins had extensive dog grooming bills, to which Byrne read out a statement sent in by the president that the claim was inaccurate.After the statement was read out, Mr Duffy accused RTE of favouring the president and acting as his “spokesperson”.During the debate, it was noted that inauguration day would fall on Armistice Day this year and Byrne asked the candidatesthey would be willing to wear a poppy.Ms Ni Riada said that although she would be conflicted, she would wear the poppy as a symbolic gesture.“It would be a sign of maturity, extending peace and friendship in a modern and progressive Ireland,” she said.It was

candidates agreed they would meet any head of state who invited Ireland, despite personal feelings, referencing US President Donald Trump.A key point discussed was transparency in the presidency, and the recent Public Accounts Committee which uncovered an unaudited allowance of around , euro to the president.“I do wonder what the agenda was behind the timing of the committee, but we should have

It got an awful lot worse for a wasteful Ballycran when Hughes drilled the sliotar to the back of the net after a defence-splitting run from Matt McAreavey.Costelloand Hughes rubbed salt into Ballycranrsquos wounds as gave Bredagh a commanding - to - lead by the nd minute.Ballycran were then thrown a leline when Stuart Martin ended a piercing run with a clinical finish to leave seven points in it with seven minutes of the half remaining.Alas, Ballycran were unable to push on from here and Bredagh punished them on the break with points from Costelloand Hughes to take a - to - lead as the break approached.Martin and McFarland swapped points before Ballycranrsquos task got even harder when star midfielder Phelim Savage, who was part of the clubrsquos senior team who lted the SHC title in Ballygalet last Sunday, was harshly red-carded leaving his side to play the entire second half with only  men.It all could have been so dferent for Ballycran at the end of the first half. They shot seven wides, had a strong penalty appeal turned down and arasping shot from Gerard Quinn rattled against the crossbar and flew to safety.An early point at the start of the second half from Ballycranrsquos Francis Caldwell was cancelled out by Hughes before Martin and P J Lavery did likewise. Costello edged Bredagh into a - to - lead after  minutes, but a battling Ballycran took the next three points from Francis Caldwelland Liam McCarthy.Bredagh halted Ballycranrsquos momentum with a point from Hughes before McCarthy cancelled his score out with another free.Costello and Joe Blaney extended Bredaghrsquos lead to  points before Caldwell kept Ballycran ticking over with a point from play as his team-mates went for goal.Three Costello points in quick succession had Bredagh in wonderland before Caldwell converted a free in the th minute to make it a - to - game. Naturally, Ballycran continued to go for goals, but Bredagh were not for conceding anything and late points from Costello and Jacob McDonnell gave then a resounding win.Bredagh: Odhran Davies, Aaron Patterson, Tiarnan Sheehan, Evin Maguire, Aodhan OrsquoKeefe, Niall McFarland , Liam Hogan, Matt McAreavey, Joe Hanrahan , Dara Curran, Sean Hughes , Joe Blaney , Ciaran McMullan, Ronan Costello , Enda Gargan.

It is for this reason I am delighted with the recent decision of Newry, Mourne and Down Council to endorse and back my call for a peoplersquos vote on Brexit.Across the UK, more and more people are asking for this vote to have the opportunity to pass their final judgement on what will define us for generations to come. Brexit will affect everyone and we should be looking at the detail and allowing everyone the right to have their say.This is not only a moment for those of us who voted to remain, but also the growing number of people who voted to leave and now see the ramications of Brexit will be so widespread.Northern Ireland only works when based on sharing and interdependence, yet Brexit entails new isions, barriers and friction. We can stop those isions by supporting political stability and protecting the Good Friday Agreement, maintaining open borders throughout these islands and protecting our economy and enabling future opportunities.This is not about overturning democracy. Indeed, nothing is more democratic than allowing people to have their say. Democracy cannot be overturned by applying more democracy.Rather than answering a question, more questions can often emerge at the result of an election. This is the case with the EU Referendum of . Since the end of the Second World War, we have had four sets of general elections which have occurred within two years of each other. I doubt anyone would argue these elections occurring in any way subverted the democratic process.We are witnessing almost daily the complexities of interdependence, which we benefit from, that have developed between member nations of the EU. These complexities were brushed aside by many of the leave side as unnecessary and easy to re-establish on better terms. Yet, with six months to go, these same leavers have not managed to propose anything which has come close to a pragmatic workable solution. For these leavers to now claim to speak on behalf of the lsquowill of the peoplersquo is a hood.This leads to bad politics and bad democracy through containing the lsquowill of the peoplersquo to a one-time snapshot within history. This precludes the people from quite simply changing their mind. Just as a healthy democracy requires constant checks and restraints placed upon the government of the day, departure from the EU should require the continuing consent of the people.We are without an Executive, and thus without a voice, in what is the most tumultuous constitutional period in generations. Our preparation for leaving the EU is based upon a two-page letter written over two years ago and being carried out by civil servants.This is a complete abdication of responsibility and the duty of governance by those elected to lead this society. Instead, our politicians have retreated into the safe confines of their own ideology, rather than search for a consensus which is best for the country.It is time for the people to take back control. What we have seen is an abject failure of politicians to lead in the face of this crisis. Instead, they have retreated into the confines of their own ideology rather than search for a consensus within the country. That extends not only from Westminster, but also closer to home.Only a peoplersquos vote can begin the untying of this Gordian knot.bull The South Down Alliance Party is organising a Brexit  discussion in the Newcastle Centre on Thursday, October , between pm and pm..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Response times not what we wish%2C says ambulance chief  ","story":"NORTHERN Irelandrsquos most senior ambulance official has conceded that the local community has not been receiving the emergency response that it deserves.The admission from Ambulance Service chief executive Michael Bloomfield came during a public meeting in Downpatrick on Monday night organised by the Down Community Health Committee.However, Mr Bloomfield hopes the service will improve when proposed changes to how the organisation responds to calls are implemented.A review of current despatch procedures has resulted in the development of proposals mdash currently out to public consultation ndash which aim to provide the most immediate and appropriate clinical response to the most seriously ill or injured.Mr Bloomfield insisted the proposed changes to the way all calls are categorised were not a cost cutting exercise and nothing to do with achieving targets.

Mr Bloomfield said the huge increase was ldquoway above what was typical in any other service and while the number of calls had increased, the organisationrsquos resources had remained relatively static.Turning to ambulance response times, Mr Bloomfield said a government target required the organisation to respond to .% of le threatening calls within eight minutes. He explained that while this was achieved in   when the rate was actually .%, that has reduced over the years.In the last financial year, the Ambulance Service responded to % of le threatening calls within eight minutes, with the figures for East Down just % with patients waiting up to  minutes for an emergency ambulance. Mr Bloomfield conceded this was ldquoclearly much more than the eight minute target.The chief executive said the organisation was proposing a new way of categorising and prioritising calls.Currently, calls that come through are categorised as immediately le threatening that require an eight minute response, based on a model which has been in place since , he excplained.ldquoThere have been no changes since and we are trying to respond to % of all the calls we receive in eight minutes. What staff tell us is that when they go to many of those calls that have been categorised as immediately le threatening, they discover they are not and many may not even be urgent, Mr Bloomfield continued.ldquoResearch also suggests that closer to seven per cent of all calls are truly le threatening where time is so important that we need to get there quickly.The chief executive said the organisation wanted to introduce a more sophisticated way of answering calls by talking a little bit longer to ask more questions about the patientrsquos condition to be able to more accurately determine what is their real need.Mr Bloomfield said this will allow the organisation to make sure people who require a response within eight minutes are dealt with appropriately.He said the proposed changes were about assessing a patientrsquos needs more accurately, based on their clinical indication and despatching the right vehicle.The chief executive also pointed to frustration at turnaround times for ambulance crews when they transfer patients to hospitals outside the district, particularly to the Ulster in Dundonald. He said crews ldquodid not want to be standing around AE departments waiting they want to be out providing care to patients.He added: ldquoI can understand there may be a view that the proposals are about changing the way calls are categorised in order to change targets or, even worse, that this may be seen as some sort of cost cutting measure. Neither could be further from the truth..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Rockmount golfers rule in Rafferty Cup  ","story":"ROCKMOUNT Golf Club were crowned Ronan Rafferty champions for the second time in  years at the weekend.The local lads faced formidable opposition in the form of Killymoon Golf Club, and the standard of golf during both legs of the final was outstanding.Rockmountrsquos classy juniors held their nerve to get their hands on the trophy and team captains Stuart Thompson and Gareth Poole were more than delighted at the clubrsquos success.ldquoWe were impressed by the standard of golf and professionalism shown by the squad throughout the tournament, and especially in the final where the team were pushed to the very end to get the win over the line, Stuart said.This win came on the back of a successful season for the young men and women of Rockmount, which included the semi-finals of the Fred Daly Plate and the Norman Drew competitions.They also reached the final of the Johnny Dickson, and a young and inexperienced team finished second in the Eddie Harper Cup.With a strategy in place at Rockmount to bring the young blood through the ranks of the club, the future is looking bright..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Try fest as ‘Hinch oust Randalstown  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH U-s continued their fine early season form with an eight-try performance at home to an understrength Randalstown outfit.Despite being without some front line backs, the boys put on an excellent display on a great day for running rugby.They were a little flat early in the match, but settled down after ten minutes and began producing some of the patterns they have been working hard on in training.Winger Mark McAleenan opened the scoring after great work from number  Morgan Croskery and as the lsquoHinch pack began to dominate further scores from Croskery and hooker Kai Shields stretched the lead.The game was effectively over when lsquoHinch scored an excellent team try just before half-time.Prop Shaun Lin made  metres from inside his own half and from a quick ruck blindside flanker Matthew Torney carried hard from first receiver to punch another hole in the Randalstown defence. Out half Caleb Maguire then spread the ball wide and the flying McAleenan scorched in for the score.lsquoHinch emptied the bench at half-time and Randalstown had much more of the play in the second half, but further scores from the impressive centre Cameron Lyons, lock Matthew Reynolds and the hard-working Torney put the result beyond doubt.Randalstown mounted a sustained late assault on the lsquoHinch line late in the second half as they searched for a consolation score, but to their credit, the home side dug in to protect their line and drove upfield to earn a succession of close range scrums.Lyons brought up the half century with his second try after an excellent angled run and flat pass from Croskery, who also kicked six conversions in a fine display.Ballynahinch will be pleased to follow up their victory over Instonians with another strong leagueperformance and there is a great spirit in the squad with plenty of competition for places.They will need to be on their game for the next League match away to Carrickfergus on October .Ballynahinch U- Randalstown U- U- LEAGUE EAST.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/8807607.jpg","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be ing to her Upper StrattonTHE.

A bomb had damaged Enniskillen Townhall, and for a while the Council moved out to the Ardhowen.Pardon the pun, but there were times when Council meetings were ldquoas good as a play, as my granny used to say. Reporting the meetings for the paper was enjoyable, and I remember on one occasion two Councillors had a, er, lively exchange of views and we all held our breath as John Joe McCusker marched down the chamber to confront Jim Lunny.Of course it all ended amicably. The two men, both Nationalists and both with a mischievous sense of humour, were very dferent characters ndash genuine characters and not the fictional types which would tread the boards later at the same venue. I got to know them both and enjoyed their company.Jim Lunny was a great campaigner for retaining townland names, and John Joe fought his corner for his area. I recall them both having a sense of community, and not only would they do their best for Fermanagh in their day, both were also conscious of the need to pass things on to future generations.So they were very supportive of the then Chief Executive, Gerry Burns, a public servant with real vision, when he was the driving force to transform the Ardhowen into the beautul ldquoTheatre by the Lakes. And the architecture-award winning building became the envy of many places at home and abroad.Pardon the clicheacute, but the ldquojewel in the crown was an apt description, but more than just being a beautul building in a beautul setting, the Ardhowen under the dedicated and expert guidance of people like Eamonn Bradley and others, gave a real boost to the arts and entertainment.Enniskillen, and indeed Fermanagh generally, has a fine tradition in amateur drama and itrsquos gratying to see the likes of Adrian Dunbar and Ciaran McMenamin go on to have distinguished careers. About four years ago, I had the pleasure of chairing the Xchange summer school at the Ardhowen when Adrian spoke of his passion for the arts and as a regular visitor to his home town he still boosts the arts here. As does Ciaran, who engaged locals at such events as the film club. The range of activities at the Ardhowen is ied and we are, indeed, fortunate to have such a venue.Itrsquos starting to show its age, though. Even so, I cannot imagine that the people who got the theatre project up and running  years ago would have expected that already the Council is undertaking an exercise to look at the future of the theatre. Some of the options include an upgrade or extension, but worryingly another option is to build another theatre on another site.All this has been well reported by Colm Bradley in this newspaper.The situation has led to a number of people expressing doubts about the future of the Ardhowen, and Fermanagh Film Clubrsquos Jules Caithness wrote about ldquograve concern at the fog of uncertainty over the theatre which he said had been ldquohorribly neglected.The Council attempted to downplay this by saying they have ldquono plans to sell the Ardhowen site.No plans  Whatthey go for the option of a new theatre on a new site  What happens to the Ardhowen site then  Irsquod have preferred a straightforward, no wersquore not selling it. Itrsquos a uniquely beautul site and wersquod be mad to sell it.Irsquom told a meeting was held in August of ldquostakeholders which unsettled some of those present, and that no Councillors were present.Irsquom wondering how the succeeding Councils over the years allowed the building to get into such a state of repair, to the point where they now need to spend a large sum of money.So much money, in fact, that it exceeds the threshold that an ldquoeconomic appraisal is required.Irsquom sure some bean counter will weigh it all up but how do you place on a balance sheet the richness of cultural experience which the Ardhowen has brought to Fermanagh over three decades, and the reputation our centre of excellence has across Ireland In the current climate, I think the way we are governed isnrsquot as ldquoopen and accountable as it should be. There is certainly a massive disconnect between the people and those in authority at Stormont, though one would expect thatany public body would have the ear of the public it would be the local Council.Some decisions have implications for years to come. I still get annoyed when I walk past the old ldquostreets area opposite the police station in Enniskillen and see a lot of public sector buildingswhere once stood a thriving community of people living in homes on the island.OK, housing conditions were awful, but homes should have been built there instead of what the planners did with the area.So, please members of Fermanagh and Omagh District Council, consider carefully what you do with the Ardhowen. Itrsquos not really yours, and itrsquos not totally a matter of money.Part of the problem, apparently, is a lack of car parking. Aside from the fact that this would suggest itrsquos a popular venue, surely itrsquos not beyond the Council to sort that one out There are other problems, of course, and I fully accept that these are stringent times.Butyoursquore looking for feedback, Councillors, mine is that you should recognise what a magnicent asset you have on your hands. Pluck the jewel out of the crown and abandon it at your peril. In fact, find the money, go the whole hog and turn the ldquotheatre by the lakes into an even greater asset which will build on what has already been achieved and be lauded for years to come.Your predecessors, McCusker, Lunny and Burns among other, had the foresight to do that.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Theresa May has insisted that a Brexit deal is still “achievable” despite deadlock in negotiations just days ahead of a crunch European Council summit.   Theresa May during questions about Brexit in the House of Commons Mrs May called for “cool, calm heads to prevail” after talks at the weekend failed to bridge dferences between the UK and EU over the future status of the border on the island of Ireland.The PM was addressing the Commons just two days before she travels to Brussels for a summit at which it had initially been hoped to finalise the UK’s withdrawal agreement as well as a political declaration on future trade and security relations.Following the failure to achieve a breakthrough when Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab met EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier on Sunday, the European Commission confirmed that no further negotiations will be held ahead of Wednesday’s summit.In a question to the PM after her statement to MPs on Monday, DUP Westminster leader Mr Dodds said it “could never be right” for a border to be placed in the Irish Sea.   Nigel Dodds called on the PM to confirm NI will not be hived off from the rest of the UK post-Brexit The North Belfast MP quoted the Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson, who said she could not support any deal which creates a border between NI and GB.And he asked for PM to confirm any deal which separated from the UK’s own internal market “could never be accepted by her”.Mr Dodds added: “She has said that today. Will she confirm it is single market and customs union, the UK leaving the EU together with no part hived off either in the single market or customs dferences ”Mrs May vowed that the UK would leave the EU together, but said a deal which allowed Northern Ireland to export freely to both GB and the EU would be beneficial to business.“I am very clear there should be no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland but as we put forward proposals we can deliver on that and maintain the integrity of our Union,” she said.“And we have made that very clear when the EU made their proposal which would have effectively carved Northern Ireland away from the rest of the UK in their backstop proposal.“It is precisely why we can not accept their backstop to the backstop because they continue to want to see that. In fact what we want to see in a backstop is a situation where Northern Ireland businesses can both export freely to Great Britain and the EU. Actually that would be a good position for the Northern Ireland businesses.”Arlene Foster: We need Brexit deal that works for UK and Ireland Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Mr Dodds did not appear to be particularly convinced by her answer.South Belfast DUP MP Emma Little Pengelly later asked Mrs May for a firm commitment that “nothing would be agreed with the EU that would exclude Northern Ireland from any future trade deals”.The PM said any future trade deals would be on behalf of the whole UK, including Northern Ireland.In a statement released on Monday evening, Mr Dodds said it was not just the DUP who did not support a border down the Irish Sea, again referring to Ms Davidson’s comments.He added: “The prime minister must hold to her statement today and with her previous clear statements that there can be nothing which interferes with the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom.“It is clear there are voices from all parts of the United Kingdom, from those on dferent sides of the referendum argument, and from dferent political parties who all realise that placing a border down the Irish Sea would gradually push the United Kingdom apart.”Meanwhile, DUP MLA Christopher Stalford pointed out on Twitter that the PM had been asked four times about publishing a date when the proposed backstop would end, and described her refusal to answer the question as “slippery”.It was also reported that eight MPs asked for a reassurance on a time-limit – something the EU has resisted, and none “got a clear answer”.Ulster Unionist MEP Jim Nicholson said the PM “must deliver on her commitments to the Union” in negotiations, and insisted that “words alone are not enough especially at this late stage”.try catch     .               ..

Prime Minister Theresa May European Council president Donald Tusk said that while there was goodwill on both sides, the negotiations have been more complicated than expected.A group of Cabinet ministers met on Monday evening to discuss the developments, with Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab and Environment Secretary Michael Gove among those who attended, the Press Association understands.Lord Hague, meanwhile, told the PM there was “no disgrace in doing some fresh thinking” on how to resolve the stalemate.Mrs May will address the leaders of the remaining  EU nations on Wednesday before they discuss over dinner without her how to proceed in the talks.In a letter to EU leaders ahead of the summit, Mr Tusk said: “As things stand today, it has proven to be more complicated than some may have expected.“We should nevertheless remain hopeful and determined, as there is good will to continue these talks on both sides.“But at the same time, responsible as we are, we must prepare the EU for a no-deal scenario, which is more likely than ever before.“Like the UK, the Commission has started such preparations, and will give us an update during the meeting.”He added: “But let me be absolutely clear. The fact that we are preparing for a no-deal scenario must not, under any circumstances, lead us away from making every effort to reach the best agreement possible, for all sides.“This is what our state of mind should be at this stage.“As someone rightly said: ‘It always seems impossible until it’s done’. Let us not give up.”Brexit: Nigel Dodds presses Theresa May on ‘no Irish Sea border’ pledgeNorthern Ireland schools ‘close to financial tipping point’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Former Brexit minister Steve Baker told BBC Two’s Newsnight the Cabinet needs to “change the Prime Minister’s mind” on her plans or they will be rejected.Mrs May called for “cool, calm heads to prevail” after talks last weekend failed to bridge dferences between the UK and EU over the future status of the border in Ireland.And she warned of the danger that failure to reach agreement over the border could result in the UK leaving the EU without a deal in March next year.The European Council meeting this week had initially been pencilled in as the summit where the UK’s withdrawal agreement and political declaration on future trade and security relations would be finalised.Lord Hague said Mrs May was entitled to make clear to EU leaders that she has “moved heaven and earth to reach a deal” but can only clinch it and have any hope of getting it through Parliament with concessions from them that are “wholly reasonable”.“There is no humiliation in trying again,” he wrote in The Daily .Lord Hague went on to say there is “no disgrace in doing some fresh thinking”.The peer said a proposal floated by Tory MP Nick Boles that the UK takes up temporary membership of the European Free Trade Association after withdrawal to allow time for a free trade agreement to be negotiated was worth thinking about.He said: “As an alternative to chaos it could command wide support.”German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Berlin wants the UK’s withdrawal next March to be orderly “but not at any price”.Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar suggested a deal may be delayed as late as December.But Sammy Wilson, Brexit spokesman for the DUP, which props up Mrs May’s minority administration in the Commons, said a no-deal outcome was now “probably inevitable” due to the “intransigence” of EU negotiators.Talks at the weekend foundered over the EU’s demand for a “backstop to the backstop” designed to ensure the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic remains open under any circumstances.The PM met with Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald and vice president Michelle O’Neill and “reaffirmed her commitment to there being no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland and no border in the Irish Sea”, Downing Street said.The PM told MPs the Irish issue must not be allowed to “derail” progress towards a deal, which she said was in the interests of both the UK and EU.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn dismissed Mrs May’s comments as “another ‘nothing has changed’ moment from this shambles of a Government”.try catch     .               ..

DUP leader Arlene Foster is given a tour ofSt Patricks Cathedral in Dublin by Church of Ireland Archbishop of Dublin and Bishop of Glendalough, Michael Jackson. Pic by Niall Carson PA Wire But Mrs Foster stressed that she would oppose any proposal which leads to Northern Ireland “slavishly following EU rules whilst all the time erging away from the rest of the United Kingdom”.She said it was not just unionists in NI who were determined to fend off the EU’s mooted backstop plan, highlighting Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson’s opposition to any move that would place a border in the Irish Sea.Mrs Foster’s comments came as Theresa May insisted that a Brexit deal is still “achievable”, despite deadlock in negotiations over the thorny issue of the backstop.But hours after the prime minister’s statement to the Commons, European Council President Donald Tusk warned that the UK is “more likely than ever before” to crash out of the EU without a deal.While he felt there was good will on both sides, Mr Tusk said the negotiations have been more complicated than expected.DUP deputy leader Nigel Dodds called on Mrs May to hold to her pledge that NI will not be “carved off” from the rest of the UK by a customs or regulatory border post-Brexit.The PM vowed that the UK would leave the EU together, but said a deal which allowed NI to export freely to both Great Britain and the EU would be beneficial to business.Meanwhile, Leave campaigner Nigel Farage said the issue of the NI border has been used by Brussels chief negotiator Michel Barnier to “trap” the PM into keeping the UK in a customs union.Brexit: Nigel Dodds presses Theresa May on ‘no Irish Sea border’ pledge Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch     .               ..

Many moons ago I did diddle off and leave a dining room wall a third painted and the job to someone  to finish because I got bored and this has turned in to, ldquoWell, you see, Alison, you donrsquot do DIY. Well, fasten my tool belt and hand me a power drill because I now do do DIY.I unscrewed and moved a shelf just yesterday as it needed doing and no one  was doing it anytime soon.

I agonised about whether I would do a good job and whether I would do the brilliant project idea, justice.

I am immeasurably proud and it is turning in to something that I am beyond giddy to be involved with.With lsquoback to schoolrsquo upon us and that feeling in September forever associated with change, next steps and new challenges, it got me thinking about all the children set to start St. Cyres and Stanwell, primary schools, Universities, colleges and the like and how many times we are all guilty of telling ourselves that we canrsquot, we shouldnrsquot andwe do, we wonrsquot be any good.This is my appeal to all students, be they tiny tots taking first steps in to Reception, tweenagers embarking on lsquobig schoolrsquo or those with a bit more experience, but often no fewer anxieties heading to further and higher education - go for it, try it take advantage of the chance to learn and the opportunities it opens up.Le is short and it is certainly too short to listen to voices that limit you or put you down. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A petition has also been sent in to the National Assembly.Many local residents from Penarth, Barry, Cardf and further afield have shared their frustrations over the sediment being dumped off the coast.Penarth man Anthony Slaughter, who is the Cardf and the Vale Green Partyrsquos campaigns officer and also the chairman of Gwyrddio Penarth Greening, said: ldquoWe understand and share local residentsrsquo concerns over the dumping of this potentially hazardous mud in the Severn estuary.ldquoIn addition to any possible risks associated with this waste we are opposed to any action that enables the development of the Hinkley C nuclear power station.ldquoAs the only political party in Wales that is completely and unambiguously opposed to all nuclear power we do not support the plans for either Hinkley C or Wylfa B power stations.Even rock musician and anti-nuclear campaigner Cian Ciaran, who is the keyboard player for the band Super Furry Animals, has come out against the matter.The musician lodged papers at the High Court seeking an injunction to stop the dumping and said that the ldquonuclear establishment cannot be trusted.ldquoAbsence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, and therefore the precautionary principle should dictate a rethink, said Mr Ciaran. ldquoA rethink by our politicians and policy makers to do the right think by its people.ldquoThe implications and consequences of this dredging could be far reaching.South Wales Central AM Neil McEvoy has set up a CrowdFunder page to raise pound, for the protest as he believes there may be a judicial review.He said: ldquoOur initial target of pound, was so that we could carry out an interim injunction in order to temporarily halt the dumping of the Hinkley nuclear reactor mud.ldquoHowever, in order to stop the mud dump for good we will need toto court, which could lead to a judicial review.

A petition has also been sent in to the National Assembly.Many local residents from Penarth, Barry, Cardf and further afield have shared their frustrations over the sediment being dumped off the coast.Penarth man Anthony Slaughter, who is the Cardf and the Vale Green Partyrsquos campaigns officer and also the chairman of Gwyrddio Penarth Greening, said: ldquoWe understand and share local residentsrsquo concerns over the dumping of this potentially hazardous mud in the Severn estuary.ldquoIn addition to any possible risks associated with this waste we are opposed to any action that enables the development of the Hinkley C nuclear power station.ldquoAs the only political party in Wales that is completely and unambiguously opposed to all nuclear power we do not support the plans for either Hinkley C or Wylfa B power stations.Even rock musician and anti-nuclear campaigner Cian Ciaran, who is the keyboard player for the band Super Furry Animals, has come out against the matter.The musician lodged papers at the High Court seeking an injunction to stop the dumping and said that the ldquonuclear establishment cannot be trusted.ldquoAbsence of evidence is not the evidence of absence, and therefore the precautionary principle should dictate a rethink, said Mr Ciaran. ldquoA rethink by our politicians and policy makers to do the right think by its people.ldquoThe implications and consequences of this dredging could be far reaching.South Wales Central AM Neil McEvoy has set up a CrowdFunder page to raise pound, for the protest as he believes there may be a judicial review.He said: ldquoOur initial target of pound, was so that we could carry out an interim injunction in order to temporarily halt the dumping of the Hinkley nuclear reactor mud.ldquoHowever, in order to stop the mud dump for good we will need toto court, which could lead to a judicial review.

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community.

It consists of three workshops: Creating a Winning Mind Winning in Communication and Winning in Business.It also includes a practical component participants must organise and produce a fundraiser event in their pub for a charity of their choice. To date the  Accelerators have raised more than pound, for UK charities between them.The guests were given a tour of the House of Commons before the main event, hosted by Luton MP Gavin Shuker. Stonegate chief executive, Simon Longbottom, commended the graduates and the Stonegate development team.He said: ldquoPeople are at the heart of what we do. Wersquore delighted to able to recognise the achievements of our incredibly hard-working Accelerators here at the House of Commons. The course is a shining example of how commitment in personal development can change peoplersquos lives, as they fast become the companyrsquos most promising managers and future industry leaders.\"Reaching our th milestone is a really proud moment for Stonegate and the House of Commons is a fitting place to celebrate. As well as being a memorable occasion for the Accelerators, we believe it is important to help MPs understand the vital role that our company and the wider pub and bar industry play in offering, not just jobs, but worthwhile progressive careers, with arguably the best opportunity out of any industry to go from the bottom rung right to the very top. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops.

Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Ulster Business speaks to Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI and some of those burgeoning firms it has developed strong relationships with over the decades Long-term support is very much at the heart of the decades of partnership between Bank of Ireland and its business customers.And whether it’s offering a wide range of financial assistance, growth support or general advice, the bank has formed le-long partnerships with companies from right across the sectors, and from the large to the very small.It’s been there for three of its longest-running customers – with a combined almost -year history – from the start, and played a key role as a partner in each of their own growth stories.Gavin Kennedy, head of business banking NI at Bank of Ireland UK, told Ulster Business:“We base our business on a relationship management model – we spend a lot of time with the businesses, we know the owners and their management teams, their growth objectives and ambitions and understand the businesses.“That enables us to provide the right suite of products – challenging business plans, providing funding and help. There’s also the chance to introduce them to potential customers, signpost to expert advice, and become a partner to that customer, rather than just be a funder. It’s very much a partnership approach.“We provide lending facilities to business from the very small micro firm, right through their le-cycle, their growth phase, and scaling up to small and medium-sized businesses.”And for Gavin, it’s all about offering a range of services and assistance “under one roof”.“We have the ability to lend up to £m for business customers. There is the consistency to our approach, and that’s really important in the Northern Ireland market.”Partnership is a phrase that continues to raise its head in Bank of Ireland, regarding both its relationships with business customers, and the longevity and generational nature of the companies it’s developed long-term relationships with.“We would have many instances where a mother and father have built a business, and now the second generation is taking on the management,” Gavin said. “We are involved across both generations, and we are very privileged to be part of that family and business development.”“It’s in our interest that the company continues to grow and thrive and we have been very important in that role.”Nowhere is that more evident than with the hugely successful family-owned McKeever Hotel Group.What started out as a family restaurant business in Randalstown, Co Antrim back in , has blossomed into a burgeoning food and hospitality business boasting five hotels across Northern Ireland and Donegal.And the McKeever Hotel Group is still very much a family affair. In the last  years, the breadth of the business has grown to include Corrs Corner in Newtownabbey, the Dunsilly Hotel in Antrim, Ballymena’s the Adair Arms, Dillons in Letterkenny, and its latest hotel, the Dunadry in Antrim.Today, Eugene McKeever, along with his we Catherine, daughter Bridgene and son Eddie, run the thriving hotel empire which employs around  part-time and full-time staff.“The family business started in  when my parents opened the first restaurant in Randalstown – my dad was a chef and mum was teaching,” Bridgene, who is marketing director, said.“They then bought Corrs Corner. That’s when Bank of Ireland really become involved in the company and helped us out.“We have been supported by Bank of Ireland in a number of ways.”That includes the multi-million pound funding for the refurbishment of the Dunadry Hotel, in addition to funding support provided for the acquisition in .“Bank of Ireland has been with the company during its entire history. In , with the Adair Arms, we were one of the few people back then who were buying, due to the recession,” she said.“There has always been trust and the faith with the bank. My dad has always said – speak to your bank manager, and be honest with them.”The McKeever Hotel Group’s single biggest investment has been with the -bedroom Dunadry.Gavin says that one of Bank of Ireland’s core objectives is to help “customers to thrive”.“In doing that, it covers a lot of dferent things, and it’s not just about being profitable,” he said.“We specically tailor our packages to the customer needs. Their success, is our success and we are very privileged to be part of that growth story.”Eamon McCay started his cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff, boasting a turnover of £m.And he’s been helped along the way by Bank of Ireland amid ongoing expansion and growth. It’s a relationship which has so far lasted more than  years, and shows no signs of slowing down.“I started Frylite in , delivering fresh oil and collecting used oil. I combined all of the areas in one,” Eamon says.And that initial  sq ft building has grown to five depots across Ireland, with a further site on the cards for yet more expansion. “We supply our vegetable oils to hotels, fast food outlets, commercial businesses, bakeries, industrial food service sector… it’s been gradual growth.”A depot in Galway in  was followed by another two years later in Dublin, with Coleraine and Cork following a short time later. And its Strabane base is now a , sq ft building on a four-acre site.Since , Bank of Ireland has provided facilities to the business including invoice discounting, asset finance and term and cash flow ending, and also previously used stockline facility.Speaking about his strong relationship with Bank of Ireland, Eamon says a commercial finance package ensured the businesses growth.“The bank have gotten to know the business. I felt like I have had a partner, which is invested in the business. Building good relationships is one of the values,” he said.But it’s not just about providing help and finance to customers. Bank of Ireland is sponsor of Catalyst Inc’s Invent competition and is also working with organisations such as the NI Chamber and CBI to showcase and help companies improve skills, digital prowess and scale exports.Another business with a more than two-decade relationship with Bank of Ireland is Pinnacle.And just some of the Sage Platinum Reseller’s top customers include everyone from the Irish Football Associationand Ulster Rugby to Titanic Belfast and Mash Direct.The software partner, which was set up in Belfast in , now boasts a team of more than  experienced providers of Sage business management software solutions, IT services and support.“Going from humble beginnings, the company has grown into a £m business,” Fran McKee, Pinnacle’s marketing director said.The firm, which is headed by founder Ken Montgomery, has been supported by Bank of Ireland through its stages of growth, which has included organic expansion and acquisition. “We have a solid partnership with Bank of Ireland, which has nurtured our business since its inception in .”The firm offers businesses solutions from simple to more complex business needs with Sage. It now has  offices across the UK and Ireland, but according to Fran, there is “massive growth on the agenda”.“We want to be a £m business within the next few years and as well as growing our Sage ision we want to also grow our IT services offering and with the bank’s support we’ll achieve our growth ambitions.  You can come to us as a one-stop-shop for IT and software requirements.“Customers today are very focused on providing a good service as well as achieving their growth ambitions, so they want to have the software in place to help them make decisions and run their businesses effectively.”And Gavin says the key message is that Bank of Ireland is a “proven and consistent funding partner for businesses over a long period of time.”“We work hard to build a great rapport and great trust with our clients and these long term relationships are testament to that. It is exciting to share the journey of young and small businesses to growth and expansion and we’re keen to help the next generation seize new opportunities for their businesses.” ■View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Premier.jpg","title":"premier inn looking at two new ni hotels","story":"Posted on Wednesday October  by John Mulgrew Premier Inn is eyeing up opening new hotels in Newry and Enniskillen as it seeks to expand across Northern Ireland, Ulster Business can reveal.The hotel chain, which has seven hotels here, is seeking developer opportunities in the two new locations, alongside growth in Dublin.The company, owned by Whitbread, has said it secured  new hotels in the UK during the last financial year, and has the same aspirations this year.It also says it is looking for “property partners and freehold development sites in Dublin and other major cities” as it seeks to grow Premier Inn across Ireland.Meanwhile, a new report from PwC says hotel prices in Belfast are rising five times faster than the UK average.In June , the average cost of an overnight stay in Belfast was £. but has now grown to £..Belfast is now the fourth most expensive city to stay in the UK, outside London.PwC Northern Ireland partner, Martin Cowie, said: “The influx of high-quality rooms to the market have driven and continue to support improved RevPAR and ADR for the city. “Though the full impact hasn’t been realised with easyHotel and the George Best Hotel yet to open as well as Signature Living’s new hotel at the Crumlin Road courthouse which just received planning permission, demand continues to be driven by inbound tourism, domestic holidays and events.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/Pete-2.jpg","title":"in focus peter hannan on beef brexit and business","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Peter Hannan tells John Mulgrew about turning away the big retailers, growing trade by % and that he doesn’t believe Brexit will happen once people see what’s at the edge of the clf Like many in his industry, Peter Hannan is no fan of Brexit.But the top-end beef and red meat supplier also doesn’t think it’s going to happen, given how disastrous the post-Brexit landscape is painted, now that it’s been starkly laid out in front of everyone.The Kildare-born businessman runs Hannan Meats, based in Moira. He’s become something of a star of the Northern Ireland food scene in the last decade – buoyed on by dry-aged beef and an array of the UK’s best and brightest using his produce.He’s aged beef for , days – yes, more than three years – although purely experimental, boosted turnover by around % in the last two or three years, picked up more three-star awards from the Great Taste Awards than almost any other food firm, and now plans to expand into Dublin as his next venture, by the end of the year. Anyone who’s met the Meat Merchant – the moniker given to his retail business in Moira – will know that the -year-old is a personable, larger-than-le character, whose own personality contributes as much to his business and brand, as does his meat.“Our main areas of growth in the last three years have been into the UK, Republic of Ireland and the continent. We haven’t been looking at doing more at home here, because we have a presence, and we think it’s very adequate. We don’t push that, or cold call. We think the clients that we have in Northern Ireland are the best, and we aren’t looking to expand on that.”France is also becoming a growing market for the company, and Pete says business there is growing “very rapidly”.He’s also recently signed a deal to supply all of the Hastings Hotels’ spots.“We have approaches from all sortsover the years,” Pete says. “We are primarily a food service company, so dealing with any of the multiples – doing it a lot more, or not doing it as well has never been on our radar. We’ve had them drive in to the yard here – four suits getting out of a black-windowed car. You are watching on the camera and say ‘oh, that’s somebody’.“Everyone has dferent ideas. We just don’t believe they are the type of partner that we would want. We don’t want to do  tonnes a week of commercial product.”But a few years ago, he did the highest-profile grocer of its kind in the UK – arguably the world.“Five years ago we started to deal with Fortnum  Mason, and they are truly magnicent to deal with,” he said. “That was a turning point because, regardless of what anybody says, the best front window for food in the world is Fortnum  Mason.”According to Pete, business in the five years since the relationship began has increased by ,% – or around  times.What started as a meat wholesale business, blossomed thanks to the success of Hannan Meats’ Himalayan salt-aged Glenarm beef, and has grown into a business with a wide-iety of products – many of which have been done for the first time in NI.Aside from selling lesser-known cuts of beef, such as hanger and rump cap, Pete’s business has ersied into dry-aging lamb, and curing both pork and beef in a sugar-pit – producing hugely flavoured bacon and cured-beef.It doesn’t take long for Pete to start naming some of the greatest chefs which call Hannan Meats their beef supplier. That includes Angela Harrnett and Mark Hix. He was one of the first UK restaurateurs to exclusively use Peter’s dry-aged beef across all of his restaurants – it all started when Pete met Mark outside one of his eateries and gave him an honest retort to whether he had enjoyed his meal. The beef wasn’t up to scratch.But it’s not all just awards, top chefs, suppliers, restaurants and celebrity-backing. Pete says turnover is up around % in the last two to three years – sitting at around £m.“We have lots of other things going on in the background. Taking our next step forward is something we have been considering. We are at a crossroads as to where we take the business next. We are now at a point, do we go forward with the likes of our Meat Merchant , do we take that to a city  Dublin would be next on the radar.”On Brexit, he doesn’t think it’s going to happen – given a clearer image of what le outside the EU could look like.“No doubt, all of us in business have been reluctant to make decisions because there is no clarity,” he said. “Personally, I don’t think we will Brexit. We need to go and apologise, and say ‘as we were’ and just get on. It was a hell of a bad idea. It was sold based on rubbish information, and that’s why people made a rubbish decision.“Now that we have a bit of clarity – Theresa May is bringing us to the clf edge, and saying ‘that’s how far down it is – have a look,you tell me to jump, I’ll jump… but we don’t have to’.“This whole thing about immigration. The thing about bringing , people into this country every year needed to be explained to take that issue off the table. If you want your fruit picked,you want doctors and nurses in the NHS, for example...you want any of those things, then let’s put up the barriers. Unless we take those people in, we don’t have have those things done.“… we shouldn’t be in this position, and I don’t think we will be for much longer. Once Theresa May brings these things to the clf, no one will say that they want to jump.“I think there is a huge head of steam. People will say ‘we won’t take that deal’.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"pinnacle marks  years with huge bash in portugal","story":"Posted on Thursday October  by Ulster Business Belfast firm Pinnacle – a leading provider of Sage software and IT solutions – has celebrated  years in business by taking more than  of its staff to Portugal for an an all-expenses paid trip.The company, which has branches throughout the UK and Republic of Ireland, flew its workers to a five-star resort in Vilamoura, to mark the occasion.The five-star celebrations included welcome lunch overlooking the Vilamoura Marina, followed by spa treatments and water sports.

Common sense used to prevail and adults were able to admonish children as part of their development process. Today the world is dferent, everyone’s opinion matters evenit is illogical, ill-conceived and does not stand the scrutiny of even the most cursory of cross examinations. Politicians have always manipulated the message to try and persuade the electorate that the policy they are peddling today is for our benefit. Once elected they then change tack, claim they never supported the policy that they were elected for and blame the opposition. One of my clients’ recently told me to stop wasting my time writing about Brexit because nobody cares and the subject is now boring. I tend to agree that the subject has been over discussed but sadly it appears to have been under considered by almost all associated with our path to European exit. Local, national and European politicians have patently no clue as to how to deliver a workable and practical orce with both sides predicting a range of dire consequences for the UK economy whether we stay or go. As ever the true position will never be visible to the vast majority of voters and, therefore, we will probably never have the chance to understand our exit deal, whether or not we get the chance to vote on it. Never has the duplicitous nature of politicians been more evident than this shambles we are now watching. Businesses do not have the luxury of endlessly debating a myriad of options, we need to make decisions and act upon them. If we don’t then jobs are lost and families suffer. Locally we are pathetically represented by a group of politicians who appear not to want to undertake the jobs they were elected to do. Maybe I am just cynical but it appears to me that they are hiding in the shadows hoping that someone comes up with a plan for which they have no actual responsibility. That way,it works they can quietly move forward asthey were a part of it,it fails then it was not their fault. Do we not deserve better than this  I read an article in another publication recently, penned by one of my competitors, in which he invoked property professionals to be more optimistic and sell the positives of the NI market. I have spent my entire  year career trying to sell the positives of investing in NI. I have stayed here, built a business, paid taxes, employed many people and hopefully delivered pleasing results for our clients. It would be really nicefor once our politicians could simply deliver us a viable business oriented solution that made le easier rather than the constant uncertainty we face. Imagine business owners delightthe punchline to the gag was “went to the pub and agreed a workable plan”. Now that would make me smile.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
