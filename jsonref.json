More VAT could be charged on parcels coming into Britain from EU firms.An extra six weeks of medicines will be stockpiled on top of the current level of three months to avoid any disruption. Batch testing and EU certifications will also be recognised to reduce bureaucracy. New picture warnings could be introduced on cigarette packs \u0027as the copyright for the existing picture library is owned by the European Commission\u0027. British firms are being urged to \u0027consider whether you will need advice from the Irish government about preparations you need to make\u0027 in case of no deal. Organic food producers face a “cliff edge” of exporting to the EU only if certified by a body approved by the European Commission, with certification taking up to nine months after Brexit. The government will commit to underwrite EU funding for aid and other projects that could be withdrawn.In his speech, Mr Raab said the Government would not risk triggering a tit-for-tat battle with Brussels by imposing new border checks or travel restrictions.He said: \u0027I remain confident a good deal is within our sights, and that remains our top, and overriding, priority. If the EU responds with the level of ambition and pragmatism, we will strike a strong deal that benefits both sides.\u0027But, we must be ready to consider the alternative. We have a duty, as a responsible government, to plan for every eventuality.\u0027These technical notices - and the ones that will follow - are a sensible, measured,and proportionate approach to minimising the impact of no deal on British firms, citizens,charities and public bodies.\u0027He added: \u0027They will provide information and guidance. Our overarching aim is to facilitate the smooth, continued, functioning of business, transport, infrastructure, research, aid programmes and funding streams.\u0027In some cases, it means taking unilateral action to maintain as much continuity as possible in the short term, in the event of no deal - irrespective of whether the EU reciprocates.\u0027Mr Raab said the UK, in the event of a no-deal, would \u0027erge when we are ready, on our terms\u0027 from the European Union.The Brexit Secretary stressed there was already planning talks between the Bank of England and the European Central Bank for a no-deal scenario and called for talks to begin on data protection and between port authorities.Credit card charges and online shopping  One document released today considers the risks facing UK banking and payments customers if the Government fails to clinch a trade agreement that covers financial services.In the case of a no-deal Brexit, UK-based payment service providers would lose direct access to the EU\u0027s payment infrastructure. Customers, including businesses using providers to process payments in euros, could also \u0027face increased costs and slower processing times for euro transactions\u0027, the Government paper warned. \u0027The cost of card payments between the UK and EU will likely increase, and these cross-border payments will no longer be covered by the surcharging ban,\u0027 it added. The ban prevents businesses from charging customers for paying by the likes of PayPal or debit or credit cards, which Treasury earlier this year characterised as \u0027rip-off fees\u0027. Consumers shopping in the EU or buying online from an EU company with a UK card, could be hit with surprise charges on their purchases, with some retailers charging more than the cost of processing payments.           Consumers shopping in the EU or buying online from an EU company with a UK card, could be hit with surprise charges on their purchases, with some retailers charging more than the cost of processing paymentsThe Treasury estimated that surcharging cost Britons around £166million in 2015. The EU surcharge ban came into force in January. The Government said it is looking to align domestic law around payments with rules already set up in the EU in hopes of remaining a member of the Single Euro Payments Area. However, that would only ensure that \u0027lower value euro transactions are processed in the same amount of time as they are today\u0027, meaning larger payments may still face delays. Consumers would face another potential cost increase when online shopping, with parcels arriving in the UK no longer liable for Low Value Consignment Relief (LVCR) on VAT. Medical supplies face checks and delays  The pharmaceutical industry should ensure they have an additional six-week supply of drugs in the event of disruption caused by a no-deal Brexit, the Health Secretary has said.Matt Hancock has told drug companies that supply chains for products could be affected by changes to border processes and stockpiles would be needed to cope with potential delays.Hospitals, GPs and community pharmacies in the UK do not need to stockpile additional medicines and doctors should not write longer prescriptions, he said.Patients should also be advised that they do not need to store additional medicines at home.Steve Bates, chief executive of the UK Bioindustry Association (BIA), said the request would be \u0027a massive challenge\u0027 for the industry.In a letter to pharmaceutical companies, Mr Hancock said: \u0027In the unlikely event we leave the EU without a deal in March 2019, based on the current cross-Government planning scenario we will ensure the UK has an additional six weeks\u0027 supply of medicines in case imports from the EU through certain routes are affected.\u0027This is the current planning assumption but will of course be subject to revision in light of future developments.\u0027He asked companies \u0027to ensure they have a minimum of six weeks\u0027 additional supply in the UK, over and above their business as usual operational buffer stocks\u0027 by March 29.Mr Hancock said the \u0027same risk exists in the EU\u0027 and countries such as France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands will also need to prepare for disruption.In an open letter to NHS staff, Mr Hancock said hospitals, GPs and community pharmacies in the UK \u0027do not need to take any steps to stockpile additional medicines, beyond their business as usual stock levels\u0027.He added: \u0027Local stockpiling is not necessary and any incidences involving the over-ordering of medicines will be investigated and followed up with the relevant chief or responsible pharmacist directly.\u0027Clinicians should advise patients that the Government has plans in place to ensure a continued supply of medicines to patients from the moment we leave the EU.          Matt Hancock has told drug companies that supply chains for products could be affected by changes to border processes and stockpiles would be needed to cope with potential delays\u0027Patients will not need to and should not seek to store additional medicines at home.\u0027Mr Bates said: \u0027We have stressed and recognise that endeavouring to deliver on this in less than 200 days will be a massive challenge for industry and the MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) alike.\u0027Given that over 150 BIA members are actively involved in clinical development in the UK we will pay particular attention to the implications of this work with regard to ongoing clinical trials.\u0027A \u0027no-deal\u0027 Brexit would mean the biggest dis-integration of the complex regulated medicines market in Europe in terms of regulation, cross-border movement of goods, comparative pricing and intellectual property.\u0027On behalf of patients we encourage all participants to be as prepared as possible for a scenario industry really does not want, but we should be under no illusions that this will be easy or smooth.\u0027The papers also raised the alarm about a potential sperm donor shortage and restrictions on transferring other biomaterials.One points out that the UK imported 3,000 sperm samples from Denmark last year, along with smaller quantities from other countries in the bloc. \u0027UK licensed establishments working in this area, such as hospitals, stem cell laboratories, tissue banks and fertility clinics would continue to work to the same quality and safety standards as they did before exit but some would need new written agreements with relevant EU establishments,\u0027 the paper said. Expats could lose access to pensions UK citizens living in Europe face the possibility of losing access to their pension income and other financial services, according to technical papers on no-deal Brexit preparations. Lending and deposit services, insurance and annuities - which people rely on for a regular pension income - are among the financial products which expats could struggle to access, according to the documents.One said that \u0027in the absence of action from the EU, EEA-based customers of UK firms currently passporting into the EEA, including UK citizens living in the EEA, may lose the ability to access existing lending and deposit services, insurance contracts (such as life insurance contracts and annuities) due to UK firms losing their rights to passport into the EEA\u0027.Insurers said millions of customers, including pensioners overseas, could be affected. The papers said the Government has committed to putting unilateralaction in place if necessary to resolve issues as far as possible on the UK side.For UK-based customers who access banking, insurance, investment funds and other financial services with EEA firms currently passporting into the UK, temporary permissions will enable these firms to continue to provide these services to UK customers for up to three years after exit - allowing firms time to apply for authorisation to continue operating in the UK, the documents said.           British expats in Europe face losing access to their pension income and other financial services, according to technical papers on no-deal Brexit preparationsBanking red tape could mean EU clients lose UK-based services  The technical papers also echoed warnings from the Bank of England which earlier this summer said the EU needed to do more to prevent Brexit causing havoc in financial markets.The Government said clients across the European Economic Area would no longer be able to use the services of UK-based investment banks, while cross-border contracts may no longer be valid.It puts a key industry at risk, with financial services having contributed more than a quarter of the UK\u0027s services exports to the EU, accounting for £27 billion out of £90 billion in 2016.A number of banks have made efforts to secure licences and offices in EU financial hubs to continue serving clients on the continent.Lending and deposit services, insurance and annuities - which people rely on for a regular pension income - are among the financial products which expats could struggle to access, according to the documents.One said that \u0027in the absence of action from the EU, EEA-based customers of UK firms currently passporting into the EEA, including UK citizens living in the EEA, may lose the ability to access existing lending and deposit services, insurance contracts (such as life insurance contracts and annuities) due to UK firms losing their rights to passport into the EEA\u0027.Insurers said millions of customers, including pensioners overseas, could be affected. The papers said the Government has committed to putting unilateral action in place if necessary to resolve issues as far as possible on the UK side.For UK-based customers who access banking, insurance, investment funds and other financial services with EEA firms currently passporting into the UK, temporary permissions will enable these firms to continue to provide these services to UK customers for up to three years after exit - allowing firms time to apply for authorisation to continue operating in the UK, the documents said.This means these firms will be able to continue as before if they receive authorisation covering the full scope of services they currently provide.The UK\u0027s savings safety net, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), protects money held by customers of UK-authorised firms when firms go bust, including some products with EEA firms.Regulators will consult this autumn on arrangements for coverage to continue, the documents said.           Mr Raab (pictured with Michel Barnier in Brussels this week) said he was still \u0027confident\u0027 there would be an agreement - but the government was taking steps to \u0027protect the UK\u0027Farming subsidies guaranteed but \u0027cliff edge\u0027 for organic produce Government moved to reassure landowners they would continue to get farming subsidies, currently controlled by the EU, in the case of no-deal, until new agriculture legislation is brought in.The funding will remain at existing levels until the end of this parliament, expected in 2022, for the whole of the UK, a technical notice on payments reiterates.People receiving subsidies will have to conform to the same standards and rules, including on-site farm inspections, in order to receive the payments.But organic food producers will face a “cliff edge” over exporting to the European Union in the event of a no-deal Brexit, farming leaders warned.According to technical guidance published by the Government, UK businesses would only be allowed to export to the EU if they were certified by an organic certification body approved by the European Commission.But UK organic bodies will not be able to apply for recognition until after Brexit - and approval could take up to nine months to secure.The National Farmers’ Union (NFU) said the situation for organic produce served as a warning on future trade in all food and agricultural products between the UK and the EU.On organic produce, the Government said it was exploring “alternative approaches” to speed up the process.The Government expects to negotiate an arrangement which would allow free movement of organic produce between the UK and EU, because European regulations will remain in UK law.Logos on packaging would also need to change, with the EU organic label in the shape of a green leaf of stars stripped off, though UK labels would remain.Graphic cigarette warnings could disappear  Stark images of blackened lungs and dead bodies on cigarette packets would disappear under a no-deal Brexit.Copyright for the current images is owned by the European Commission so the UK could no longer legally use them and new images would need to be created.A no-deal Brexit would also mean new systems to register tobacco and e-cigarette products, according to a technical paper on labelling tobacco products.The paper states: “If there’s no deal we would introduce new picture warnings for tobacco products as the copyright for the existing picture library is owned by the European Commission.“Manufacturers will need to ensure that tobacco products which include picture warnings produced from Exit Day onwards will be labelled with new picture warnings.”New regulations would be needed to give the Government power to update domestic legislation in response to emerging threats, changing safety and quality standards and technological advances.A consultation will be held in September on labelling and notification.The paper adds: “Inevitably under a no-deal scenario, the close working relationships that exist with our European partners would not be the same.“The UK will, of course, continue to play an active role in the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.”          Cabinet Office minister David Lidington (pictured in Edinburgh today) said he was not surprised by Michel Barnier playing down the prospects of agreement before NovemberThere is unlikely to be a Brexit deal until the end of the year, a Cabinet minister suggested today.Cabinet Office minister David Lidington said he was not surprised by Michel Barnier playing down the prospects of agreement before November. He said: \u0027I was Europe minister for six years, I have seen enough of these negotiations to know that these deadlines slip.\u0027I think there definitely will need to be an agreement by the end of 2018.\u0027However, speaking during a briefing with reporters in Edinburgh, Mr Lidington added that he did not believe the March date for Britain\u0027s exit from Europe would be pushed back.\u0027Article 50 is a matter of EU law, it is not a matter of political judgment,\u0027 he said.\u0027I think there is a real pressure from the end of the year because, with the European Parliament going into election mode it will just become more difficult to get enough MEPs in a plenary from January onwards to have the numbers to pass the super majority that is needed.\u0027And you\u0027ve got to get legislation through Westminster as well to implement a withdrawal agreement.\u0027He added: \u0027I just don\u0027t think that seeking to extend Article 50 is going to help... the Treaty is absolutely clear that it is two years or when a withdrawal agreement is reached or ratified if that is earlier.\u0027                                                    Earlier, Mr Raab told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme he wanted to move on from the \u0027latest incarnation of Project Fear\u0027.\u0027Some of those promoting the worst scare stories around no deal... are assuming that the EU will act in a vindictive way,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m still confident a good deal is within our sights,\u0027 Mr Raab said. \u0027We have got agreement on about 80 per cent of the issues. \u0027We have made clear that if negotiations don\u0027t achieve the optimum outcome we will continue to be a responsible European neighbour and partner.\u0027Playing down the threat of shortages in hospitals, Mr Raab said a stockpile of 200 medicines already exists, thanks to longstanding arrangements with pharmaceutical companies to cope with disruptions at the border, such as strikes by French lorry drivers.\u0027There are potential issues around the border in the worst case scenario,\u0027 he said. \u0027So it\u0027s right, too, we will be working with industry around stockpiling of medicines for a working assumption of six weeks.\u0027Mr Raab admitted that talks remain deadlocked over the Northern Irish border, with the UK continuing to press for a bespoke customs agreement on goods and services.\u0027They\u0027re still asking questions and probing the proposals, but that\u0027s good,\u0027 he said.\u0027They are not knocking them away in principle - they are asking questions on the practical detail.\u0027They understand very clearly that we will not allow a customs border or any other form of border to be drawn down the Irish Sea.\u0027 Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer dismissed the documents as a distraction, saying a no deal would be \u0027catastrophic\u0027.He said: \u0027A no deal Brexit would be a complete failure by the Government to negotiate for Britain. These documents should not distract us from that.\u0027No deal would be catastrophic for people\u0027s jobs, the economy and for the border in Northern Ireland. It is irresponsible for anyone to casualise no deal.\u0027Simon Lewis, chief executive of the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME), said: \u0027The consequences of a no-deal Brexit scenario could mean prolonged disruption to the smooth functioning of Europe\u0027s capital markets, which would affect investors, borrowers and savers across Europe and beyond.\u0027The financial services industry is keen to see both negotiating parties agree on a deal which locks in an agreement on a transition period and the future trading relationship in order to minimise the risks to financial stability.\u0027  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/23/10/4F52C4E700000578-6089943-image-a-16_1535015581465.jpg","title":"Black Americans Victorian Britain book Jeffrey Green shows fled slave trade slavery","story":"The incredible stories of black Americans who escaped the slave trade to make a life for themselves in Victorian Britain have emerged after more than 180 years.

The UK roads set for the WORST traffic...Share this articleThe plans will cause chaos for truckers, with the usual ten minute stretch of road taking them almost two hours to get around on the alternate route.Cllr Woodward, of Fareham, Hants, said: \u0027In short, two bridges over the M27 need to be replaced.\u0027This will necessitate the total closure of the M27 in both directions between junction three and junction five from 8pm on the Friday until 6am on the Monday.\u0027The main ersion route for this closure is around 58 miles and takes you through Salisbury and onto the A34.\u0027From what I understand, this is for HGVs. It is a route for the absolute biggest, widest vehicles that use the M27. I am sure locals will know shorter routes.\u0027But smaller roads aren\u0027t always suitable for the larger vehicles and so this is a ersion for them.\u0027He added: \u0027It is inevitable that long queues of traffic will occur in all directions.\u0027          Policy director for the Road Haulage Association Duncan Buchanan said the closed section of motorway is a \u0027major link\u0027 for trucks getting to ports on the south coast. He said: \u0027I am stunned by the suggested alternative route\u0027          The closed section of the M27 would normally take truckers less than 10 minutes to drive - but the \u0027monster\u0027 ersion will add almost two hours to their journey times (stock traffic picture)The large ersion has been put in place after plans were made to replace a bridge, which was built in the 1970s, over the M27, after cracks in the concrete were found.Thousands of vehicles use the bridge over the busy motorway each day, but after \u0027wear and tear\u0027 led to a 26 tonne weight restriction being put in place, it will now be demolished and replaced.After the first weekend of work this year, lorry drivers will face chaos on two further weekends - from April 26 to 29 and then again between October 18 and 21, both 2019.Highways England project manager Merwin Mann, said: \u0027The existing bridge is in need of replacement and this is what we\u0027ll be doing over the next 18 months.\u0027We will replace the bridge in stages - each section will be built in the site compound nearby and lifted into place.\u0027Policy director for the Road Haulage Association, which represents lorry drivers and freight firms, Duncan Buchanan said the closed section of motorway is a \u0027major link\u0027 for trucks getting to ports on the south coast.He said: \u0027I am stunned by the suggested alternative route for HGVs, it is truly an enormous distance.\u0027There are a couple of questions you need to ask when looking at a ersion. The first is whether the closure is necessary - is there an alternative to a full closure?\u0027Then, is the ersion safe or is it over cautious is the next question.\u0027It has been more difficult getting information about this planned ersion from Highways England than it really should have been.          The stretch of road will be closed for three weekends over the next year. The first closure is on September 28 and October 1 and the road will also be shut on April 26 to 29 and then again between October 18 and 21, both 2019 starting from 8pm on Friday until 6am on the Monday\u0027We are really disappointed that they have failed to give any serious notification of this closure to us and we are concerned about the planned ersion route through Salisbury and Andover.\u0027For the hauliers and freight companies going into the port this ersion is unrealistic and we do not understand why they have done this, quite frankly.\u0027We think of Highways England as having one job to do and that is to run the road network correctly for key users.\u0027It\u0027s a debacle and they are not focused on this and key road users. Even the people who supply us with information at Highways England have been blindsided.\u0027This is a breakdown in the process and it is not good enough. It is a monster ersion, taking lorries a zillion miles out of their way, and it worries me whether people will actually follow the route.\u0027We should not have to be waiting for tip offs or information from the press about a 60 mile ersion.\u0027This will have a huge cost for freight companies and we will now be notifying our members of this problem - but this has been a surprise to us.\u0027The managing director of Hampshire-based international freight company Steve Porter Transport, Malcolm Gibson, said the closed stretch of the M27 is an \u0027integral part\u0027 of the motorway.He said: \u0027I was not aware of these plans, no one has told us about it.\u0027It will likely affect the bigger firms more than us as we generally stick to weekday working, but it will certainly affect some of our customers who are travelling to us.\u0027The section between junctions three and five is an integral part of the M27 for hauliers.\u0027 Highways England route sponsor John Henderson said: \u0027Our work to replace the Romsey Road bridge over the M27 is a vital part of our work to ensure that the bridges on England\u0027s major roads remain operating safely and reliably for the millions of people who depend on them every day.\u0027We announced the project in July 2016 and held public information events in February this year and again in July to explain how we are taking forward the work. \u0027Completing these key phases of work at the weekend means that restrictions can be kept to a minimum at other, busier, times and we have chosen ersions that are the most suitable for the type and volume of traffic that usually uses the M27. The first weekend closure is scheduled for the end of September.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/23/15/4F55924900000578-0-image-a-23_1535033326974.jpg","title":"British boy 12 blasted 30 feet air turbines Airbus plane Greece","story":"    Visitors stand close to the island\u0027s airport to watch planes landing just above them (file photo)The incident happened early yesterday  afternoon when the father and son, as well as dozens of other tourists, were standing by the fence in order to see a TUI Airbus 320 that was departing for London.The force of the blast from the plane\u0027s turbines then hit the young boy and sent him flying through the air.He was taken by ambulance to the Skiathos Health Centre where a full checkup was carried out. Medics have confirmed that the boy was given emergency first aid before being transferred to the Achilopouleio Hospital of Volos for further treatment.Thomas Cook evacuates all 300 customers from Egyptian hotel...Spanish police hunt British tourist, 45, after he \u0027killed a...Share this articleAccording to medical staff, the boy is expected to survive.Footage shot in 2017 went viral after showing how visitors were even hit by the jet turbines as planes touch down on the island in the Aegean sea.Spectators have known for years that they run the risk of being hit by sand and even stones whipped up by the plane\u0027s jet engines but the latest injury has highlighted the severe dangers of standing too close.

This was a six-fold increase on the 3,403 children born to Polish mothers in 2005.It was followed by Pakistan (17,099), while Romania (13,717) moved into third place for the first time, fuelled by a surge in adults from the Eastern European arriving in the UK after the employment restrictions were lifted in 2014. It overtook India, which was on 13,476.Some 71,472 babies were born to mothers from the EU in 2017 - up from 44,022 in 2008, or 62 per cent.Including foreign-born fathers, around 1 in 3 babies had at least one parent from overseas. Pakistan was the most common country of birth for fathers born outside the UK with 18,513, followed by Poland (15,610) and India (13,715).Alp Mehmet, vice-chairman of think-tank MigrationWatch, which campaigns for tighter controls on migration, said: ‘This is another factor indicating how migration is contributing huge numbers to the population.‘The sound another warning bell about the impact of mass immigration. The consequences of this are increased pressure housing, schools and the NHS and the changing nature of our society.‘This is indicative of the scale and speed that it is all happening and it can’t be in the interests of this country and it is certainly not what the majority of people in this country want.‘The Government must honour its manifesto commitment to reduce net migration to sustainable levels.’Nicola Haines, a statistician for the ONS, said: ‘Just over a third of the babies born in England and Wales in 2017 had at least one parent who had been born outside the UK.          Office for National Statistics numbers for foreign mother births in the UK in 2017 ‘This will include parents who moved to the UK as children and have lived here most of their lives as well as those who have recently migrated. The proportion of live births to non-UK-born parents has been growing since 1990 and is now the highest on record.’The bulletin said: ‘The increases in births to Polish and Romanian-born mothers are driven mainly by the increasing size of the Polish and Romanian-born populations living in the UK.’The ONS said the figures showed that fertility levels were higher among foreign-born women and such women were more likely to be of childbearing age than the rest of the population.In some parts of the UK, 75 per cent of children were born to foreign mothers in 2017. In Brent, North-West London, it was 75.7 per cent while in the East London borough of Newham, the proportion was 74.1 per cent.Slough in Berkshire had the highest percentage outside London at 62.8 per cent followed by Luton with 59.3 per cent.However, the ONS paper also revealed that the Total Fertility Rate - which predicts how many children a typical woman would have in their lifetime on current patterns - fell to 1.71 children per foreign-born woman, the lowest level since 2005.Yesterday  the Mail told how a new report claimed that babies born to foreign-born migrants had contributed to the unprecedented surge in Britain’s population this century.Some 82 per cent of the huge rise from 2001 to 2016 could be attributed to the arrival of immigrants and, subsequently, their UK-born children, according to an analysis of ONS data by MigrationWatch.It claimed that of the 6.6million extra people added to the population during those 15 years, 5.4million were the result of mass immigration - the biggest ever wave of incomers.Because the ONS failed to count 2.3million children born to foreign parents as migrants - giving a lower total of 3.1million, or 47 per cent of the rise - the effect of migration policy was not calculated correctly, it said.The ONS said that in accordance with internationally recognised definitions, children born in the UK were not counted as migrants.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/13/18/2AEC8F0B00000578-0-image-m-5_1534180540964.jpg","title":"Half Britains bank branches closed five years","story":"    Up to half of all bank branches will close in the next five to ten years in a blow to millions of customers, a senior banker warned yesterdayHis comments come after consumer group Which? revealed banks had closed almost 3,000 branches in the past three years – around 60 every month.At the same time, free-to-use cash machines are being scrapped across the country. Critics say the closures have left shopkeepers and vulnerable people in towns and villages abandoned. Three years ago, Mr Jenkins warned technological changes in Britain would cause an ‘Uber moment’ –like the shake-up in the cab industry – that would see widespread bank branch closures.But yesterday he admitted he had underestimated the pace of change. Hackers ‘to steal MILLIONS from cash machines within days’:...Britain\u0027s top five banks are set to pay shareholders £12.7bn...Share this articleAt the moment there are around 7,000 branches operated by the country’s biggest retail banks, including Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC, Barclays, TSB, Santander, and the Nationwide building society – meaning 3,500 could be at risk.Mr Jenkins, who ran Barclays from 2012 to 2015, said: ‘I predicted that somewhere between 20 and 50 per cent of the jobs would go away in financial services and about the same number of branches would be closed.          Antony Jenkins, ex-boss of Barclays, said 3,500 of the UK’s 7,000 branches are at risk‘I think, actually, I under-estimated on the branch closure side. We’ve already seen something like 25 per cent of branches close between 2011 and 2015.‘My expectation is that at least another 50 per cent of branches will close over the next five to ten years.’ He said an even greater proportion of jobs could also go in the banking industry, including customer service, middle managers and administrative roles.He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘These things get automated and the jobs will go away. Of course, new jobs may be created, but my expectation is there will be many fewer than the ones that are eliminated.’ Yesterday the ‘Big Four’ banks – Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds and RBS – said they currently operated about 4,500 branches in total across the UK. They have axed nearly 4,000 in the past decade.RBS, which runs NatWest, has closed around 1,380. The figure for Lloyds is 1,200, HSBC 800 and Barclays nearly 500.           But there are growing concerns that shutting branches could trigger a rise in fraud, as customers not used to the internet are forced online where they are easy prey for criminals.Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said: ‘Closing branches cuts costs for the banks, but it’s at best an inconvenience and at worst a serious blow for the millions of older people who are not online or au fait with mobile banking.‘Older people have the right to make and receive payments in a way that is safe, convenient and affordable and our banks need to live up to their responsibilities.’UK Finance, which represents banks, insisted that branches were only closed as a last resort.A spokesman said: ‘Bank branch visits have fallen by a quarter since 2012 with the development of new technology. All major banks offer day-to-day banking services through 11,500 Post Office branches.’"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/24/00/4F56009D00000578-6092771-image-a-8_1535065239869.jpg","title":"Harry Meghans wedding day Jaguar E Type goes sale 350 000","story":"    Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding day Jaguar E-type will go on sale for £350,000           Harry drove Meghan to Frogmore house for their reception in the battery powered carIt turned almost as many heads at the royal couple themselves when screened across the world on TV.Share this articleThe metallic powder blue car created such a stir that now Jaguar Land Rover is to sell the hand-built zero-emissions sports models for around £350,000 each, it announced today, with first deliveries in 2020.A production version in a bespoke bronze paint finish will make its US debut at a motorsports gathering in California today.

Our overarching aim is to facilitate the smooth, continued, functioning of business, transport, infrastructure, research, aid programmes and funding streams.\u0027In some cases, it means taking unilateral action to maintain as much continuity as possible in the short term, in the event of no deal - irrespective of whether the EU reciprocates.\u0027Mr Raab said the UK, in the event of a no-deal, would \u0027erge when we are ready, on our terms\u0027 from the European Union.The Brexit Secretary stressed there was already planning talks between the Bank of England and the European Central Bank for a no-deal scenario and called for talks to begin on data protection and between port authorities.Credit card charges and online shopping  One document released today considers the risks facing UK banking and payments customers if the Government fails to clinch a trade agreement that covers financial services.In the case of a no-deal Brexit, UK-based payment service providers would lose direct access to the EU\u0027s payment infrastructure. Customers, including businesses using providers to process payments in euros, could also \u0027face increased costs and slower processing times for euro transactions\u0027, the Government paper warned. \u0027The cost of card payments between the UK and EU will likely increase, and these cross-border payments will no longer be covered by the surcharging ban,\u0027 it added. The ban prevents businesses from charging customers for paying by the likes of PayPal or debit or credit cards, which Treasury earlier this year characterised as \u0027rip-off fees\u0027. Consumers shopping in the EU or buying online from an EU company with a UK card, could be hit with surprise charges on their purchases, with some retailers charging more than the cost of processing payments.           Consumers shopping in the EU or buying online from an EU company with a UK card, could be hit with surprise charges on their purchases, with some retailers charging more than the cost of processing paymentsThe Treasury estimated that surcharging cost Britons around £166million in 2015. The EU surcharge ban came into force in January. The Government said it is looking to align domestic law around payments with rules already set up in the EU in hopes of remaining a member of the Single Euro Payments Area. However, that would only ensure that \u0027lower value euro transactions are processed in the same amount of time as they are today\u0027, meaning larger payments may still face delays. Consumers would face another potential cost increase when online shopping, with parcels arriving in the UK no longer liable for Low Value Consignment Relief (LVCR) on VAT. Medical supplies face checks and delays  The pharmaceutical industry should ensure they have an additional six-week supply of drugs in the event of disruption caused by a no-deal Brexit, the Health Secretary has said.Matt Hancock has told drug companies that supply chains for products could be affected by changes to border processes and stockpiles would be needed to cope with potential delays.Hospitals, GPs and community pharmacies in the UK do not need to stockpile additional medicines and doctors should not write longer prescriptions, he said.Patients should also be advised that they do not need to store additional medicines at home.Steve Bates, chief executive of the UK Bioindustry Association (BIA), said the request would be \u0027a massive challenge\u0027 for the industry.In a letter to pharmaceutical companies, Mr Hancock said: \u0027In the unlikely event we leave the EU without a deal in March 2019, based on the current cross-Government planning scenario we will ensure the UK has an additional six weeks\u0027 supply of medicines in case imports from the EU through certain routes are affected.\u0027This is the current planning assumption but will of course be subject to revision in light of future developments.\u0027He asked companies \u0027to ensure they have a minimum of six weeks\u0027 additional supply in the UK, over and above their business as usual operational buffer stocks\u0027 by March 29.Mr Hancock said the \u0027same risk exists in the EU\u0027 and countries such as France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands will also need to prepare for disruption.In an open letter to NHS staff, Mr Hancock said hospitals, GPs and community pharmacies in the UK \u0027do not need to take any steps to stockpile additional medicines, beyond their business as usual stock levels\u0027.He added: \u0027Local stockpiling is not necessary and any incidences involving the over-ordering of medicines will be investigated and followed up with the relevant chief or responsible pharmacist directly.\u0027Clinicians should advise patients that the Government has plans in place to ensure a continued supply of medicines to patients from the moment we leave the EU.          Matt Hancock has told drug companies that supply chains for products could be affected by changes to border processes and stockpiles would be needed to cope with potential delays\u0027Patients will not need to and should not seek to store additional medicines at home.\u0027Mr Bates said: \u0027We have stressed and recognise that endeavouring to deliver on this in less than 200 days will be a massive challenge for industry and the MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency) alike.\u0027Given that over 150 BIA members are actively involved in clinical development in the UK we will pay particular attention to the implications of this work with regard to ongoing clinical trials.\u0027A \u0027no-deal\u0027 Brexit would mean the biggest dis-integration of the complex regulated medicines market in Europe in terms of regulation, cross-border movement of goods, comparative pricing and intellectual property.\u0027On behalf of patients we encourage all participants to be as prepared as possible for a scenario industry really does not want, but we should be under no illusions that this will be easy or smooth.\u0027The papers also raised the alarm about a potential sperm donor shortage and restrictions on transferring other biomaterials.One points out that the UK imported 3,000 sperm samples from Denmark last year, along with smaller quantities from other countries in the bloc. \u0027UK licensed establishments working in this area, such as hospitals, stem cell laboratories, tissue banks and fertility clinics would continue to work to the same quality and safety standards as they did before exit but some would need new written agreements with relevant EU establishments,\u0027 the paper said. Expats could lose access to pensions UK citizens living in Europe face the possibility of losing access to their pension income and other financial services, according to technical papers on no-deal Brexit preparations. Lending and deposit services, insurance and annuities - which people rely on for a regular pension income - are among the financial products which expats could struggle to access, according to the documents.One said that \u0027in the absence of action from the EU, EEA-based customers of UK firms currently passporting into the EEA, including UK citizens living in the EEA, may lose the ability to access existing lending and deposit services, insurance contracts (such as life insurance contracts and annuities) due to UK firms losing their rights to passport into the EEA\u0027.Insurers said millions of customers, including pensioners overseas, could be affected. The papers said the Government has committed to putting unilateralaction in place if necessary to resolve issues as far as possible on the UK side.For UK-based customers who access banking, insurance, investment funds and other financial services with EEA firms currently passporting into the UK, temporary permissions will enable these firms to continue to provide these services to UK customers for up to three years after exit - allowing firms time to apply for authorisation to continue operating in the UK, the documents said.           British expats in Europe face losing access to their pension income and other financial services, according to technical papers on no-deal Brexit preparationsBanking red tape could mean EU clients lose UK-based services  The technical papers also echoed warnings from the Bank of England which earlier this summer said the EU needed to do more to prevent Brexit causing havoc in financial markets.The Government said clients across the European Economic Area would no longer be able to use the services of UK-based investment banks, while cross-border contracts may no longer be valid.It puts a key industry at risk, with financial services having contributed more than a quarter of the UK\u0027s services exports to the EU, accounting for £27 billion out of £90 billion in 2016.A number of banks have made efforts to secure licences and offices in EU financial hubs to continue serving clients on the continent.Lending and deposit services, insurance and annuities - which people rely on for a regular pension income - are among the financial products which expats could struggle to access, according to the documents.One said that \u0027in the absence of action from the EU, EEA-based customers of UK firms currently passporting into the EEA, including UK citizens living in the EEA, may lose the ability to access existing lending and deposit services, insurance contracts (such as life insurance contracts and annuities) due to UK firms losing their rights to passport into the EEA\u0027.Insurers said millions of customers, including pensioners overseas, could be affected. The papers said the Government has committed to putting unilateral action in place if necessary to resolve issues as far as possible on the UK side.For UK-based customers who access banking, insurance, investment funds and other financial services with EEA firms currently passporting into the UK, temporary permissions will enable these firms to continue to provide these services to UK customers for up to three years after exit - allowing firms time to apply for authorisation to continue operating in the UK, the documents said.This means these firms will be able to continue as before if they receive authorisation covering the full scope of services they currently provide.The UK\u0027s savings safety net, the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS), protects money held by customers of UK-authorised firms when firms go bust, including some products with EEA firms.Regulators will consult this autumn on arrangements for coverage to continue, the documents said.           Mr Raab (pictured with Michel Barnier in Brussels this week) said he was still \u0027confident\u0027 there would be an agreement - but the government was taking steps to \u0027protect the UK\u0027Farming subsidies guaranteed but \u0027cliff edge\u0027 for organic produce Government moved to reassure landowners they would continue to get farming subsidies, currently controlled by the EU, in the case of no-deal, until new agriculture legislation is brought in.The funding will remain at existing levels until the end of this parliament, expected in 2022, for the whole of the UK, a technical notice on payments reiterates.People receiving subsidies will have to conform to the same standards and rules, including on-site farm inspections, in order to receive the payments.But organic food producers will face a “cliff edge” over exporting to the European Union in the event of a no-deal Brexit, farming leaders warned.According to technical guidance published by the Government, UK businesses would only be allowed to export to the EU if they were certified by an organic certification body approved by the European Commission.But UK organic bodies will not be able to apply for recognition until after Brexit - and approval could take up to nine months to secure.The National Farmers’ Union (NFU) said the situation for organic produce served as a warning on future trade in all food and agricultural products between the UK and the EU.On organic produce, the Government said it was exploring “alternative approaches” to speed up the process.The Government expects to negotiate an arrangement which would allow free movement of organic produce between the UK and EU, because European regulations will remain in UK law.Logos on packaging would also need to change, with the EU organic label in the shape of a green leaf of stars stripped off, though UK labels would remain.Graphic cigarette warnings could disappear  Stark images of blackened lungs and dead bodies on cigarette packets would disappear under a no-deal Brexit.Copyright for the current images is owned by the European Commission so the UK could no longer legally use them and new images would need to be created.A no-deal Brexit would also mean new systems to register tobacco and e-cigarette products, according to a technical paper on labelling tobacco products.The paper states: “If there’s no deal we would introduce new picture warnings for tobacco products as the copyright for the existing picture library is owned by the European Commission.“Manufacturers will need to ensure that tobacco products which include picture warnings produced from Exit Day onwards will be labelled with new picture warnings.”New regulations would be needed to give the Government power to update domestic legislation in response to emerging threats, changing safety and quality standards and technological advances.A consultation will be held in September on labelling and notification.The paper adds: “Inevitably under a no-deal scenario, the close working relationships that exist with our European partners would not be the same.“The UK will, of course, continue to play an active role in the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control.”          Cabinet Office minister David Lidington (pictured in Edinburgh today) said he was not surprised by Michel Barnier playing down the prospects of agreement before NovemberThere is unlikely to be a Brexit deal until the end of the year, a Cabinet minister suggested today.Cabinet Office minister David Lidington said he was not surprised by Michel Barnier playing down the prospects of agreement before November. He said: \u0027I was Europe minister for six years, I have seen enough of these negotiations to know that these deadlines slip.\u0027I think there definitely will need to be an agreement by the end of 2018.\u0027However, speaking during a briefing with reporters in Edinburgh, Mr Lidington added that he did not believe the March date for Britain\u0027s exit from Europe would be pushed back.\u0027Article 50 is a matter of EU law, it is not a matter of political judgment,\u0027 he said.\u0027I think there is a real pressure from the end of the year because, with the European Parliament going into election mode it will just become more difficult to get enough MEPs in a plenary from January onwards to have the numbers to pass the super majority that is needed.\u0027And you\u0027ve got to get legislation through Westminster as well to implement a withdrawal agreement.\u0027He added: \u0027I just don\u0027t think that seeking to extend Article 50 is going to help... the Treaty is absolutely clear that it is two years or when a withdrawal agreement is reached or ratified if that is earlier.\u0027                                                    Earlier, Mr Raab told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme he wanted to move on from the \u0027latest incarnation of Project Fear\u0027.\u0027Some of those promoting the worst scare stories around no deal... are assuming that the EU will act in a vindictive way,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027m still confident a good deal is within our sights,\u0027 Mr Raab said. \u0027We have got agreement on about 80 per cent of the issues. \u0027We have made clear that if negotiations don\u0027t achieve the optimum outcome we will continue to be a responsible European neighbour and partner.\u0027Playing down the threat of shortages in hospitals, Mr Raab said a stockpile of 200 medicines already exists, thanks to longstanding arrangements with pharmaceutical companies to cope with disruptions at the border, such as strikes by French lorry drivers.\u0027There are potential issues around the border in the worst case scenario,\u0027 he said. \u0027So it\u0027s right, too, we will be working with industry around stockpiling of medicines for a working assumption of six weeks.\u0027Mr Raab admitted that talks remain deadlocked over the Northern Irish border, with the UK continuing to press for a bespoke customs agreement on goods and services.\u0027They\u0027re still asking questions and probing the proposals, but that\u0027s good,\u0027 he said.\u0027They are not knocking them away in principle - they are asking questions on the practical detail.\u0027They understand very clearly that we will not allow a customs border or any other form of border to be drawn down the Irish Sea.\u0027 Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer dismissed the documents as a distraction, saying a no deal would be \u0027catastrophic\u0027.He said: \u0027A no deal Brexit would be a complete failure by the Government to negotiate for Britain. These documents should not distract us from that.\u0027No deal would be catastrophic for people\u0027s jobs, the economy and for the border in Northern Ireland. It is irresponsible for anyone to casualise no deal.\u0027Simon Lewis, chief executive of the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME), said: \u0027The consequences of a no-deal Brexit scenario could mean prolonged disruption to the smooth functioning of Europe\u0027s capital markets, which would affect investors, borrowers and savers across Europe and beyond.\u0027The financial services industry is keen to see both negotiating parties agree on a deal which locks in an agreement on a transition period and the future trading relationship in order to minimise the risks to financial stability.\u0027  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/23/09/4F52E21100000578-6089819-image-a-2_1535014423457.jpg","title":"Fly tippers confronted dumping old mattress garden","story":"    Craig Hardwick, 37, filmed the moment he caught two men dumping a mattress  in his garden in Walsall, West Midlands          The father tells the two men to \u0027get rid of it\u0027 and threatens to send the video he is capturing the the police\u0027I\u0027m recording you and I\u0027m sending it to the police.\u0027 He filmed the moment he interrogated the two men and repeatedly told them to take the bedding back to their house.Jogger confronts \u0027courier\u0027 hurling parcels into the bushes...Outrage as flytipper caught red handed while dumping rubble...Share this articleMr Hardwick said: \u0027I don’t want people dumping rubbing in f***ing street.

The planned ersion route is shown in blue          The planned road closure will allow two bridges, which are side-by-side over the M27, that have cracks in the concrete beams to be replacedTruckers driving from London to Southampton would usually use the M3 through Hampshire, before joining the M27.However, the planned ersion will force them to drive as far out as Salisbury, Wilts, to avoid the works, taking the A303 past Andover, Hants, and round to Salisbury, Wilts.The closed section of road would normally take truckers less than 10 minutes to drive - but the \u0027monster\u0027 ersion will now add almost two hours to their journey times.The planned closure will allow two bridges, which are side-by-side over the M27 and have cracks in the concrete beams, to be replaced by Highways England, with the first demolition work coming between September 28 and October 1.Hampshire county councillor Sean Woodward has revealed the highways agency is suggesting the 58-mile ersion for the \u0027biggest and widest\u0027 vehicles.Bank holiday travellers are told to expect \u0027perfect storm\u0027...Highways to hell! The UK roads set for the WORST traffic...Share this articleThe plans will cause chaos for truckers, with the usual ten minute stretch of road taking them almost two hours to get around on the alternate route.Cllr Woodward, of Fareham, Hants, said: \u0027In short, two bridges over the M27 need to be replaced.\u0027This will necessitate the total closure of the M27 in both directions between junction three and junction five from 8pm on the Friday until 6am on the Monday.\u0027The main ersion route for this closure is around 58 miles and takes you through Salisbury and onto the A34.\u0027From what I understand, this is for HGVs. It is a route for the absolute biggest, widest vehicles that use the M27. I am sure locals will know shorter routes.\u0027But smaller roads aren\u0027t always suitable for the larger vehicles and so this is a ersion for them.\u0027He added: \u0027It is inevitable that long queues of traffic will occur in all directions.\u0027          Policy director for the Road Haulage Association Duncan Buchanan said the closed section of motorway is a \u0027major link\u0027 for trucks getting to ports on the south coast. He said: \u0027I am stunned by the suggested alternative route\u0027          The closed section of the M27 would normally take truckers less than 10 minutes to drive - but the \u0027monster\u0027 ersion will add almost two hours to their journey times (stock traffic picture)The large ersion has been put in place after plans were made to replace a bridge, which was built in the 1970s, over the M27, after cracks in the concrete were found.Thousands of vehicles use the bridge over the busy motorway each day, but after \u0027wear and tear\u0027 led to a 26 tonne weight restriction being put in place, it will now be demolished and replaced.After the first weekend of work this year, lorry drivers will face chaos on two further weekends - from April 26 to 29 and then again between October 18 and 21, both 2019.Highways England project manager Merwin Mann, said: \u0027The existing bridge is in need of replacement and this is what we\u0027ll be doing over the next 18 months.\u0027We will replace the bridge in stages - each section will be built in the site compound nearby and lifted into place.\u0027Policy director for the Road Haulage Association, which represents lorry drivers and freight firms, Duncan Buchanan said the closed section of motorway is a \u0027major link\u0027 for trucks getting to ports on the south coast.He said: \u0027I am stunned by the suggested alternative route for HGVs, it is truly an enormous distance.\u0027There are a couple of questions you need to ask when looking at a ersion. The first is whether the closure is necessary - is there an alternative to a full closure?\u0027Then, is the ersion safe or is it over cautious is the next question.\u0027It has been more difficult getting information about this planned ersion from Highways England than it really should have been.          The stretch of road will be closed for three weekends over the next year. The first closure is on September 28 and October 1 and the road will also be shut on April 26 to 29 and then again between October 18 and 21, both 2019 starting from 8pm on Friday until 6am on the Monday\u0027We are really disappointed that they have failed to give any serious notification of this closure to us and we are concerned about the planned ersion route through Salisbury and Andover.\u0027For the hauliers and freight companies going into the port this ersion is unrealistic and we do not understand why they have done this, quite frankly.\u0027We think of Highways England as having one job to do and that is to run the road network correctly for key users.\u0027It\u0027s a debacle and they are not focused on this and key road users.

It was something to do with filling that loss. She was my  angel’My grandmother, who raised me, was a stern woman of very few words. She believed in strong discipline. But she was also a devoted caregiver. Growing up, she would dress me in Baby Jane ruffled dresses and braid my hair into two twists with ribbons and hair ballies. On the morning of this photo, which I took in 2005, she did my hair again, just like she did when I was a child.Every Saturday afternoon, around the same time each week, she would tend to her porcelain dolls. She must have had hundreds, all in different sizes, different outfits, different nationalities. It was like the UN of porcelain dolls in her living room.She began collecting them when my aunt – her daughter – was murdered. It was something to do with filling that loss. But it was also about pride. Despite growing up in a hard, industrial town like the one I grew up in, I never felt poor. The care she expended on them taught me that, no matter what the circumstances outside were like, we should always take care of ourselves. She taught me that we had value.I set up the camera and the moment she came into the frame, I moved in, sat next to her and asked her to look at the lens. I had no idea what her expression was, I just turned and pressed the shutter release – you can see it in my right hand. In 14 years of documenting my family and my home town, this was one of thefew times my grandmother cooperated. For that alone, this shot is immensely special to me.To this day, I’m profoundly grateful to her. She was a  and an angel to me. She had the foresight and knowledge of how to keep me alive and safe during a very tumultuous, difficult time.Braddock is an industrial town in Pennsylvania, nine miles outside of Pittsburgh. By the time I was born in 1982, most of the steel mills had already closed. The unions were broken up, most companies had gone overseas and the town was abandoned, on every level: local, state and federal. Yet the land bore the marks of what had gone before: it had been poisoned by industry, and the men and women of Braddock were paying the price. They still are.My grandmother died of cancer, my mother has battled cancer and I have lupus. Much of my childhood and my grandmother’s later years were spent looking after my step-great-grandfather who worked in the factories. It ruined his body, it ruined his health, and the only healthcare he received was from the women of my family.It’s a story that rings true across America. Women create the very possibility of a workforce, not only by giving birth to the men who work in heavy industry, but by caring for them when that industry destroys them. Their story gets written out of history, doubly so when they are black.Today the working class is, once again, being spoken about as if it were exclusively white. And yet African Americans have always worked in these industries. They have never been deemed deserving of representation by most of the photographers whose work has lasted.If you want to talk about America or US politics, you’ve just got to look at this little town. Despite the hardship, people from Braddock, including my grandmother, are proud of where they come from. It’s the belly of the beast, it’s the backbone of this country. It’s home to Andrew Carnegie’s first factory and his first library. People in these small towns are always much further ahead than people in the cities – or the media – assume. For the first time in Braddock, an African-American democratic socialist woman in her 30s has been elected to the state legislature of the 34th district. Her name is Summer Lee. She unseated a white man from a political dynasty which had been dominant since we were born, and she won by a landslide. By the end of my life’s work, I hope to have created an archive that shows just how erse the working class is and who the workers are. I want to show how their lives have been impacted by the fact that corporations have more rights than human beings in this country. I want to show the fullness of the working class, because it’s not just synonymous with whiteness.Studied: “Master of fine arts, Syracuse University.”Influences: “Allan Sekula, Martha Rosler, Carrie Mae Weems and Dawoud Bey.”High point: “Receiving the MacArthur fellowship in 2015.”Low point: “When my mentor Kathe Kowalski passed away in 2006.”Top tip: “Let your photographs be your compass, always follow where your photographs lead you.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6ffcb0202f84f60709d228dfa5e9c4e24e6ec7d8/0_1850_3877_2326/master/3877.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=669e57f600381eb7fa5edb21da5e38be","title":"benjamin hardman photographer omur arctic exhibition theprintspace gallery","story":"Benjamin Hardman, an Australian photographer based in Iceland, found his admiration for the north five years ago as he embarked on his first photographic mission in the Arctic winter.

Overhead locker space has failed to match demand, with an increasing number of passengers adapting their packing habits to escape baggage charges on budget carriers. Passengers will still be allowed to carry on one small bag that can fit under a seat in front, free of charge. A limited number of passengers who book priority boarding – which costs £6 or €6 per flight – will be able to take on a small case as hand luggage.However, Ryanair is introducing a lower rate for smaller, checked-in baggage. Passengers will pay £8 – rather than £25 – for any case weighing less than 10kg.Ryanair said the change would be revenue neutral, as many people would switch to checking in a cheaper, smaller suitcase, and was aimed purely at reducing delays to flights caused by too much luggage at the boarding gate. The overhead lockers on Ryanair’s Boeing 737 fleet can accommodate about 100 suitcases, while the number of priority tickets sold will be capped at 95 – roughly half the maximum passengers per flight. The size limit of the small, free bag has also been slightly increased, but anyone who fails to fit that bag in the sizer at the airport will be charged £25 or €25 and have the bag put in the hold. Ryanair has long grappled to find the best solution to its baggage issues. Its chief executive, Michael O’Leary, imposed high checked-in baggage fees for many years in an effort to keep down handling costs, claiming to be doing customers and the environment a favour by encouraging passengers to travel light. The first change imposed in January saw small carry-on cases taken at the gate and put in the aircraft hold for free, with only passengers who had booked priority boarding, then £5, allowed to put cases in the cabin’s overhead lockers. The move was accepted with equanimity by passengers but did not solve the gate delays."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ac7db4aee122c3a61c104293c7f8255272ad493/0_106_1972_1183/master/1972.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e8b00ad0e0e6bc35efe2b4671b1fb3ca","title":"saudi modernisation drive is reflected in aramcos faltering sale","story":"The oil-rich nation is aware of an urgent need to ersify, but it still has a long way to goOn 2 March 1938, Saudi Arabia was a largely nomadic society with a sideline in the tourism generated by pilgrimages to Mecca. The following day, oil was discovered at Dharam and the country’s prospects were transformed for ever.It took time for the full extent of Saudi Arabia’s crude reserves to become known, not least because in early 1938 the world had other things on its mind. But by the time the second world war was over, it was clear that beneath the desert sands there was an abundance of oil that could be easily brought out of the ground. Cheap Saudi oil was a vital component of the world economy’s long post-war boom and the revenues from petroleum exports paid for roads, bridges, apartment blocks and western-style living standards.For the Saudi economy to work, the oil fields had to keep pumping and the global price of crude needed to stay high. When the cost of crude was more than $100 a barrel, Saudi’s rulers could keep taxes low and welfare spending high, while investing more in infrastructure spending. They could spend heavily on defence and compete with Iran to be a regional superpower. The go-ahead for the kilometre-high Jeddah tower, which will be the world’s tallest building when it is opened next year, was given when oil prices hit $120 a barrel.But then two things happened. The first was that the price of oil fell below $100 a barrel in 2014 and has not recovered since. By early 2016, a barrel of crude was changing hands for less than $30 a barrel – a price crash that resulted in a recession and a ballooning budget deficit.The second was that the world started to get more serious about cutting greenhouse gas emissions. At the Paris climate change conference in 2015, an agreement was signed committing the international community to steps that would limit the increase in global temperature to well below 2C above pre-industrial levelsFor the Saudis, the implications of the Paris agreement were obvious: the drive to decarbonise the world economy would mean that a considerable part of their oil reserves would have to stay in the ground. This made a warning at the turn of the millennium by the former Saudi energy minister Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani, seem suddenly urgent.“Thirty years from now, there will be a huge amount of oil – and no buyers”, Yamani said. “Oil will be left in the ground. The stone age came to an end, not because we had a lack of stones, and the oil age will come to an end not because we have a lack of oil.”It was not long before Saudi’s rulers responded to this twin challenge. In the short term, they sought to persuade fellow oil producing nations to agree production curbs that would limit supply, drive up crude prices and so ease the pressures on the public finances. At the current oil price of around $70 a barrel, the Saudis can make their budget arithmetic stack up.In the longer term, there was a plan to ersify the economy away from oil. Saudi Vision 2030 was announced by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in April 2016, shortly after the oil price reached its trough. The idea was to make Saudi Arabia a global investment giant, to turn the country into a hub linking the three continents of Europe, Asia and Africa and to be the heart of the Arab and Islamic worlds.The proposed sale of part of the state-owned oil company - Saudi Aramco - was a key part of this attempt to transform and modernise the economy. Proceeds were earmarked for the country’s sovereign wealth fund so it could continue investing in companies such as the electric car company Tesla and the ride-hailing app Uber.Vision 2030 is strongly supported by the International Monetary Fund, which has praised the plan for its boldness. Yet there is far to go. The economy is dependent on 6 million foreign workers and female participation in the labour market is weak, despite the recent lifting of the ban on women driving. Riyadh is under pressure over its crackdown on dissent and the civilian casualties in Yemen, where it is fighting a proxy war with Iran.The postponement of the Saudi Aramco float – although the government said it remained committed to an IPO at some point – may have less to do with the state of financial markets than the unwillingness of the Saudis to come clean about the state of the company and the extent of oil reserves. Saudi Arabia remains a deeply conservative country. Just as with an oil supertanker, changing course will take time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0dbbfa9de16b7b87cd353748d0de976b083e0f84/32_207_3356_2014/master/3356.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d4acdfaa124d72cd19ab7c8d7854a02","title":"volkswagen and seat accused of selling cars with rear seat belt fault","story":"Thousands of vehicles recalled but Which? says company is still selling models with fault Volkswagen and Seat have been accused by consumer group Which? of selling thousands of vehicles with a known dangerous and unsolved rear seatbelt fault.In May, independent tests by Finnish magazine Tekniikan Maailma found that when all three rear seatbelts were used in VW Polos and Seat models driven at speed, the back-left seatbelt could come undone, leaving a passenger at risk of serious injury in the event of a crash.Since the test, Volkswagen Group has recalled about 12,000 new VW Polos and thousands more Seat Ibizas and Aronas to install a temporary fix. This involves securing the central and back-left seatbelt buckles together.Which? said the company has continued selling new cars with the same known fault – a fault that it has confirmed it will not be able to resolve until November. The problem affects more than 68,000 Polo and Seat cars in the UK.The company told Which? that it will “in due course” be issuing affected owners with a sticker warning them not to use the rear middle seat.Alex Neill, a managing director at Which?, said: “It’s shocking that VW and Seat are selling thousands of cars that they know have a serious safety issue but don’t yet have a proper fix for. They should not be selling these potentially dangerous vehicles at all. Supplying a warning sticker is a startlingly inadequate response.”He said this case, as well as a BMW recall earlier this year, had exposed crucial failings in the way cars were recalled in the UK.Which? has called for the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency to be given enforcement powers to hold car manufacturers to account.It is the latest setback for VW, which this week saw protesters blockade its Milton Keynes UK headquarters in protest over diesel emissions. On Monday, it was reported the company has had to recall about 700,000 Tiguan and Touran cars worldwide due to a possible lighting defect that could set the vehicle on fire.A VW spokesman said the affected the cars remain safe to drive. “There is the possibility that in extremely rare situations (eg sudden, abrupt lane changes with five occupants on board) the left seatbelt lock could be unintentionally released. At Volkswagen and Seat safety remains a top priority and the brands have already identified a technical solution: a redesigned belt lock fixture, which will prevent this happening. A permanent solution is scheduled to be available in November.“We have asked retailers to ensure that all prospective purchasers of affected new or used vehicles are made aware of the current guidance not to use the middle rear seat.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2a9073dd5e5a2e3f8fbaac451d321d8159526719/0_0_1733_1040/master/1733.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1b868a946f8b25eebe5c9f942e69ca5","title":"how to pollution proof your skin","story":"Polluted air is a problem whether you live in or out of town. Author and beauty expert Lindsey Kelk shares the latest intel on keeping your skin protected from its harmful effects  According to Dr Doris Day, “urban dust” has been shown to contain a cocktail of 224 toxic chemicals, making it possibly the only cocktail I have never been tempted to try, and all those chemicals can lead to a whole host of skin problems dryness, loss of collagen, acne and there has even been research linking air pollution to dark spots. Because getting those from too much sun wasn’t already enough of a problem … Start at the sourceAs we all know, prevention is always better than the cure – and while topical products designed to fight the effects of polluted air are a must, preventing damage before it takes place starts with your diet. A diet rich in antioxidants is the first way to help neutralise free radicals (those are the particles floating around in the air that attach themselves to your skin and damage it at a cellular level – find out more about these epidermal vampires here). Dr Andrew Weil recommends loading up on fruits and vegetables such as tomatoes, watermelon, blueberries, carrots and leafy greens. On top of your fruits and veggies, protein is also key to rebuilding cells – your best bets are tofu, lean meat, fish, eggs, beans and nuts. As well as eating a healthy diet, drinking plenty of water is an essential factor in the fight against damage caused by pollution. Hydrated skin is healthy skin and ensures your epidermis – the top layer of skin and our barrier against all the chemicals and particles in the air – stays plump and in tact. For extra hydration and antioxidant protection, try adding green tea to your diet. It’s packed with catechins, which not only help your skin repair itself, they have also been proven to improve heart health and help combat hypertension and cardiovascular disease. Also, red wine is a great source of resveratrol, which is amazing for skin (and yes, I know the alcohol dehydrates my skin but the wine gods giveth and they taketh away). Get city-readyEven though people living in densely populated, urban areas are generally found to have better skincare regimens than those living in more rural areas, thanks to all the pollution we face – and the free radicals that accompany that pollution – our skin usually shows signs of ageing more quickly than our country-dwelling counterparts. This is where your choice of products really comes into play. Look out for formulas targeted specifically at protecting your face from pollution, then follow up with with the same considerations as with your diet. Every skincare expert you can name, from Caroline Hirons to Nadine Baggott, has extolled the wonders of vitamin C, the collagen-building wonder ingredient that brightens and evens tone, protects from free radicals and, some studies have shown, may even help protect against sun damage. It works well in conjunction with vitamin E, so look out for products that contain both.While it’s important to protect against free radicals, it is essential to protect against the effects of the sun. UV rays and pollution work in tandem to destroy skin cells and cause lasting damage so always make sure you have protection, all year round. Remember, if there is daylight, there are UV rays. Sunscreen is for life, not just bikini weather. And, yes, I know it sounds dull, but long sleeves and covered legs will help protect your skin even more. Physical barriers against the sun and polluted air are one of the reasons your body ages so much more slowly than your weather-battered face, so maybe try one of those surfer-chic long-sleeved swimsuits next time you’re at the lido.After exposureAt the end of the day, your skin will need serious cleansing, even if it doesn’t look dirty. Double cleansing is a must, for city and country dwellers alike. Over the course of a day, your face has had to deal with pollution, sunscreen and makeup and they’re just the best case scenarios. Thorough cleansing should never strip skin, you definitely don’t want to compromise your natural barriers. Try a cleansing balm for your first cleanse, to dislodge the daily grime then move on to a soothing cream or refreshing wash-off cleanser for the second cleanse, whatever feels best for your skin type. Post cleansing, your skin should feel soft and clean but never tight. Apply your treatment serums and moisturising creams immediately after cleansing. Leaving skin to “breathe” isn’t a real thing, as soon as you’ve rinsed away your cleanser, it starts losing moisture – skin doesn’t need to breath, it needs to be cared for so be a pal and give it what it wants: proper hydration.While the effects of pollution on the skin do sound really rather frightening, they don’t have to be. I’m probably not going to give up going outside for the sake of a smoother complexion, but with the right diet and skincare tips, I don’t have to. Gentle cleansing, a hardworking hydrating cream, daily SPF and lots of red wine, I mean, lots of water, should ensure glowing skin, wherever you may be.Aimed at shielding skin from environmental assaults like pollution, Clinique’s Dramatically Different Hydrating Jelly works to hydrate, strengthen and protect skin for 24 hours.

Brexit secretary Dominic Raab launched the first of the government’s “technical notices” on Thursday, explaining how to prepare for Brexit in the event of no-deal with the EU, but was greeted with a renewed chorus of panic from the CBI, the TUC, farmers, NHS, financiers – all but those blinded by Brexitmania.Raab was eager to pretend these 24 documents would have little effect on ordinary people. “These are for business,” he said, sounding like Harold Wilson making his notorious reassurance that “the pound in your pocket has not been devalued”. But the notices make clear that if no deal is reached by the time we leave on 29 March 2019, the UK faces a mountain of crisis, wrapped in burgeoning blankets of new bureaucracy. Look what businesses need to do: as well as customs declarations for goods from the EU, they must employ customs brokers, freight forwarders and logistics providers with all necessary software and authorisations. Each must register for a UK Economic Operator Registration and Identification number, with higher costs and slower processing times for euro transactions. And yes, there will be new tariffs.This hardly encourages all those businesses Liam Fox urges to start exporting. Nor will it “only” affect business when lorries are backed halfway up Britain. Add in 1,000 extra border staff and 9,000 extra civil servants, and where is that bonfire of red tape the Brexiters promised?However carefully Raab tries to cotton-wool these warnings, today brought an avalanche of reminders of the dire Brexit effects we have already been told about. Supermarket CEOs say shelves will be emptied as a third of food is imported from the EU. Health secretary Matt Hancock tells drug companies to stockpile an extra six weeks’ worth of drugs – but warns hospitals and patients not to panic-buy, for fear of running short. The City is rumbling with Brexit warnings amid movements to other EU capitals. The 300,000 expat pensioners living in Europe are warned that no deal may threaten their pensions and healthcare. Even small parcels from the EU will incur VAT, and credit card charges will rise for visitors to the EU. Police warn of the risk of losing data exchanges on EU crime. Who knew until these notices that no deal means a stoppage of Danish sperm bank donations? Jacob Rees-Mogg calls all this “absurdly overstated”, yet Raab has admitted that even “no deal” needs basic agreement on ports, banking, data – or disaster follows. Naturally, Northern Ireland’s border remains unresolved. Traders must consult Dublin. “We will provide more information in due course.” Ah! We are still full steam ahead for the Irish iceberg on which Boris Johnson’s “titanic success of Brexit” will founder.Raab is treading a wobbling tightrope. Believe it or not, he like Jeremy Hunt is a Tory leadership supplicant, he an original leaver, Hunt an erstwhile remainer, both now zigzagging. All they say is refracted through the distorting mirror of pleasing the tiny band of decrepit Tory party members. So zigzag Raab promises no change to worker rights, yet hastens to add that regulations will “erge over time”, “when it’s right for the British people”. On the one hand they both want to sound prime ministerially pragmatic, unlike the irresponsible madcap fanatic Johnson. They want to bring home the Brexit bacon – even if Danish is off the menu – with a deal to satisfy the mouth-foamers, without causing economic cataclysm. This, as Theresa May now knows, is impossible.That impossibilism is now becoming clearer to most voters. The more ministers parrot May’s nonsensical claim that “no deal is better than a bad deal”, the more obvious it becomes that every brand of Brexit deal is far worse than no Brexit.Why this change of mind? The Brexit threat has been hammered home by the misjudgment of the Brexiters themselves. It was they who demanded the government publish plans for “no deal” damage limitation, as proof to the enemy across the Channel that Britain can go it alone. But as soon as the government started laying plans out, Brexiters cried foul: the mandarins are launching Project Fear again! There’s no pleasing these insatiables – and there never will be. Because every Brexit outcome will be bad, they will always need to blame the betrayers, the appeasers and she who the ranters call Treason May.As a tactic, Brexiters have reprised the cold war dilemma. When nuclear policy depends on the principle of mutually assured destruction, it has to be unthinkable to both sides that anyone would ever press the button. Yet at the same time, the other side must believe you just might. In 1980, as Russia was invading Afghanistan, the government sabre-rattled by publishing civil defence leaflets telling citizens how to prepare for a nuclear war: what to do when the warnings sound, how to construct a fallout shelter or a fallout room, what food and water you need for 14 days and what makeshift toilet arrangements. It didn’t frighten the Russians but it terrified enough citizens here into a great CND revival.No one suggests the cataclysm of Brexit compares to nuclear annihilation – but the tactical thinking is the same. In trying to frighten the enemy, all the Brexiters have done is terrify their own side. People are at last hearing the news of what no deal – and indeed almost any kind of Brexit – will really mean for everyday life, rather than the sunlit promised land of Brexlandia. Even Rees-Mogg has admitted we may not reach that place for half a century."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4bc62860df50402133dac176c89c93ad67902fe/0_205_5059_3036/master/5059.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ef3a09164fa65e8651a3164b9d19602f","title":"labour tories no deal brexit brexiters cliff edge vote","story":"A year ago Liam Fox told us that a deal between the UK and the EU would be “one of the easiest in human history”. A few weeks ago he changed his tune, warning the chances of a no-deal Brexit are at “60-40”. Now the government has published its doomsday advice to businesses on how to cope with the impending crash.With the deadline fast approaching, Fox and his Brexiteer buddies must be laughing as Theresa May and Jeremy Hunt scramble across the continent trying to convince European leaders of the merits of the Chequers compromise – with a spectacular lack of success.Fox and the hardliners were happy to accept May’s Chequers fudge because they knew that the EU would not permit the UK to become its tariff collector, and every day spent trying to negotiate such nonsense would bring them another day closer to the no-deal many of them have always wanted.So why would they want a no-deal? A group of hard-right Brexit economists has proposed the unilateral abolition of UK tariffs, which they openly admit would see the loss of our manufacturing base. They think this would be a good thing, and propel us into a new, service-based economy. That is why Fox and Dominic Raab and Boris Johnson and Michael Gove are not concerned about crashing out on to WTO rules – they believe it would enable them to turn Britain into a deregulated free-market economy like Singapore.Labour must and does oppose this dystopia. And it must do so by charting a way of leaving the EU that can unite the ided people of our country. Respecting the result of the referendum but determined not to let that decision impose new border controls that stop our just-in-time supply chains, close down our factories and lose British jobs.A no-deal scenario would leave the UK facing a host of non-tariff barriers. Currently our standards, regulation and protections – ranging from health and safety to financial services – are harmonised with those of the EU. With no-deal, we would not have mutual recognition agreements that would ensure British goods and services can enter the European market.At first, it sounds plausible to say that no-deal is better than a bad deal that is until you realise that no-deal is, in fact, a very, very bad deal itself. Businesses across the UK have warned time and again that a no-deal would have catastrophic consequences. Airbus, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover have warned it could lead to thousands of job losses and the closure of plants. It is extraordinary that government is refusing to listen to them and, albeit more politely, is echoing Boris Johnson’s Anglo-Saxon outburst.The Tories must stop focusing on their ideological obsession with a hard Brexit and their internal party isions and start focusing on what is best for our country and our economy. Their absurd proposal that the UK should become the EU’s tariff collector is neither practical nor palatable across the Channel.The only way to ensure friction-free trade in goods between the UK and the EU is through Labour’s proposed new comprehensive customs union. This must be accompanied by a new, strong, single market deal with the EU which establishes common institutions and guarantees access for our products and services.Crucially, we need a transition period to put this into effect. Instead of re-running the debates from two years ago, Labour must unite in our opposition to the cliff edge of no-deal that this government is currently driving us towards. This Tory nightmare is simply not an option for businesses, workers and families in this country. Labour’s alternative is. It respects the vote to leave and protects our economy at the same time.• Barry Gardiner MP is shadow secretary of state for international trade, energy and climate change"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e9c78dfdb0c6781e6f7fee336f974a33f053cf4/0_47_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94176cd1988f7d981552e9678f4b20b7","title":"tory party ageing membership theresa may jeremy corbyn","story":"They don’t want Jeremy Corbyn to be prime minister. On that they can agree, but precious little elseThe news this week that the Conservative party received twice as much money from dead supporters than living members last year was a gift to both Theresa May’s critics and headline writers everywhere. As soon as the Electoral Commission data landed showing the party’s £1.7 million from legacy payments, it was widely proclaimed to be proof – had anyone needed it – that the Tories were a zombie party.Tory high command was quick put a gloss on the data and set a few facts straight – or as deputy Tory chairman James Cleverly put it: call out the “bollocks”. The Conservative MP said that the figures were skewed. He pointed to the way fees are distributed between the national party and local branches – something not clearly reflected in the data – as a better explanation for why membership income dropped from £1.5 million pounds to £835,000 in a year.However, even if the headlines can be questioned, the data hints at a worrying trend for the party. Its membership is ageing – in some cases dying – while the opposite is happening in Labour. As of March 2018, there were 124,000 Conservative members while Labour boasted 552,000 members. That’s before you even take into account the support that the party received from the pro-Corbyn grassroots organisation Momentum.Behind the scenes, the Conservatives admit that they have a challenge when it comes to attracting new supporters – particularly younger age groups. In the snap election, Labour were ahead in every voting-age category from 40-year-olds down. It follows that getting these groups to not only vote blue but pay money for the pleasure is no small feat.But the bigger problem is that this issue goes beyond age. Tory MPs returning to their constituencies over the summer complain it’s enough of a struggle keeping the activists they already have on side. Theresa May’s Chequers Brexit compromise has seen a Eurosceptic backlash in the grassroots – and even those who don’t get het up over Europe are growing tired of the rolling shambles.There have been efforts by a recently rejuvenated CCHQ to reconnect with the grassroots – efforts met by varying degrees of success. Activists report more positive energy since Brandon Lewis took over as chairman, a new Conservative youth organisation has been launched and paid campaign managers have also been introduced in marginal seats. Talk of offering members incentives has been met with less enthusiasm. After reports leaked that the Tories were considering offering Nando’s discounts to those who joined, the restaurant chain was quick to rule the idea out as a nonstarters.But perhaps it was a blessing in disguise, given that a round of peri peri chicken was never going to fix the problem. What attracted tens of thousands of new supporters to Labour under Jeremy Corbyn wasn’t a giveaway, gimmick or even a smart marketing campaign – although the latter can help. It was a leader who inspired, along with a clear message that chimed with a lot of people’s core values.Where the Tories once looked at Momentum and Corbyn and laughed, now they look at them with a mix of envy and fear. On the one hand, the party would love to have the energy of a mass movement behind it. But with that comes risk – as we saw this week when William Hague touched on fears that the Tory party could be vulnerable to a sudden influx of new recruits – “the very thing that happened to Labour in 2015” – at the Ukip end of the spectrum, recruits who would try to change the party’s direction of travel.If the Tories want to keep their membership flourishing in the decades to come on their terms, they need to work out what their message is. Is their party the party of Brexit? Are they the party of personal freedom? Do they want to be the party of fiscal responsibility or the party of home ownership? Right now, no one seems sure what they’re about. “We barely mention the economy these days and the burning-injustices agenda has gone off the radar,” says one down-hearted Tory activist. “I think the only thing we can agree on is that we don’t want Jeremy Corbyn to be prime minister.”Perhaps that’s why CCHQ’s latest stunt is something they can all get behind: a website – Jeremy’s Promises – launched to highlight Corbyn’s apparent policy U-turns. But if they want to attract anything near the level of enthusiasm of Corbyn’s own supporters, they need to come up with a positive reason to vote Tory – rather than simply a reason not to vote for the other side.• Katy Balls is the Spectator’s political correspondent"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5753580dfa62ea36174120ec62efbe934ec207ce/60_54_3316_1989/master/3316.jpg?w=1200\u0026amp;h=630\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=crop\u0026amp;crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026amp;bm=normal\u0026amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvNTM4OGZjODViNTQ0N2E4M2NmMWNlMTg5YTVhMjE1NzMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026amp;s=6174c05ac750a225655aa677fbb1ef3b","title":"bronze head from emperor augustus statue to go on display at british museum","story":"Remarkably preserved sculpture will feature in the museum’s exhibition on dissent from SeptemberFor the second time in just over 2,000 years, the bronze head of the Roman emperor Augustus has been toppled, to serve once again as an emblem of power mocked and laid low.The last time his statue was captured by enemies, decapitated, and the head buried under the steps of a temple built to celebrate victory over mighty Rome, so that it was symbolically trampled into the dust by all those entering.This time a team of curators and conservationists at the British Museum tenderly lifted its 17kg weight and gently laid it on its side, one ear protected by a specially made circlet of foam and foil. His extraordinary glaring eyes, unique survivors among the many bronze Roman emperors, made of white stone delicately inlaid with coloured glass and shell, still seemed to flash in outrage.“It’s a strange thought that he has spent far longer buried under the earth than above ground,” said Tom Hockenhull, joint curator with Ian Hislop, the editor of Private Eye, of an exhibition on dissent opening at the museum in September.Augustus became emperor in 27BC, in the wake of the bitter faction fights that followed the assassination of Julius Caesar. The bigger than life-size bronze statue was one of many official portraits sent across the empire, and probably originally stood in a barracks compound. It was only a few years old when it was among three imperial statues captured by a Kushite army which was harrying the southern border of Roman Egypt. They carried it off in triumph to their capital, Meroë – in Roman Nubia, modern Sudan.There are several versions of what happened next: Roman sources say the Kushites were defeated and Rome demanded back their statues, but the Greek-born historian Strabo said the Romans were forced humiliatingly to plead for their return.The head of Augustus was never seen again until 1910 when the temple site was excavated, and it was found face down in the sand. Its beauty and remarkable preservation – as well as the drama of its rediscovery – made it instantly famous and within two years the Art Fund helped raise the money to buy it for the British Museum.Hislop and Hockenhull have spent three years trawling the museum’s galleries and stores, ferreting out the objects which express subtly or in a bellow of outrage opposition to tyranny, political oppression, or just any form of authority.The objects they found range from a 3,300-year-old sculpture from ancient Mesopotamia, to a pink pussyhat, worn at the Women’s March in Washington DC in January 2017 to convey revulsion at Donald Trump’s attitude to women.Hockenhull’s original idea was to dig a hole in the gallery floor and sink the head of Augustus into it, but unaccountably the idea of smashing up the concrete and marble floor was rejected by the museum authorities. After much discussion with the conservation experts, he has had to settle for bringing it down a peg or two to display it for the first time at shin height – but it will be protected by a glass case in case Augustus’s imperious gaze still has the power to provoke dissent."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34e906e0c4f301a92a0ea4edd72552e58decc293/0_34_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35cb76817a2312938b7fe9b80c139e0f","title":"kalashnikov takes on tesla with retro look electric supercar","story":"Russian arms maker says cutting edge elements will ensure it can take on Elon Musk’s brandThe Russian arms maker Kalashnikov has unveiled its new electric car, inspired by a rare 1970s model, saying the technology will rival Elon Musk’s Tesla.The brand, best known for the AK-47 machine gun, on Thursday presented the retro-looking pale blue prototype, the CV-1, at a defence expo outside Moscow.The look was inspired by a Soviet hatchback model developed in the 1970s called “Izh-Kombi”, according to a statement on the Kalashnikov website.Its holding company, Kalashnikov Concern, said it had developed cutting-edge elements for the “electric supercar”, including a “revolutionary” inverter.

None of the candidates expressed any interest in these problems of vast importance.”Aridjis defies categorization. After the death of his friend Octavio Paz, Aridjis, now 78, became Mexico’s most important poet – of verse at once mystical, personally intimate and romantic. The author of 49 books of poetry and prose, he was the country’s ambassador to Switzerland, the Netherlands and Unesco. And Aridjis founded the “Group of 100” artists and intellectuals in 1985 to lead and coordinate what has since been an unrelenting fight for nature and indigenous peoples, a battle during which he has “almost lost count”, he says, of the death threats against himself and his family.Now, as Mexico’s political violence spirals and narco-bloodletting hurls the country into an abyss apparently without bottom, a visit to Aridjis at home in Mexico City is like a corrective to the madness, a reminder of what matters on a higher level – that of his higher causes.Not that Aridjis’ struggles for imperiled flora and fauna put him “above all that” – on the contrary. His foremost message to the incoming president is: “What will happen to the thousands of unresolved justice cases – crimes committed by the cartels, daily murders, femicides, acts of corruption – that the Peña Nieto government has accumulated during these six years? Since his inauguration in 2012, there were some 107,000 homicides, among them 42 journalists whose murders are unresolved. Will there be honest justice, or will the victims be buried by the opportunistic gravestone of forgetfulness in that electoral circus?”To enter Aridjis’ house is like stepping into a wonderland past. The walls are lined with masks Aridjis has found on travels around his native land, ensnared “before the New York art dealers get their hands on them!” he says, eyes wide. They come from Oaxaca, Michoacán, Chiapas, used in dances of the Catrines, the Viejitos, Moors and Christians, Cora and Yaqui – so that all we discuss has the stare of ancients upon us. Aridjis exudes a mixture of sagacity, strength and charm his energy for a man two years short of 80 is infectious.Aridjis’ odyssey (an analogy he enjoys, given his name and Greek ancestry) began in childhood, with a near-fatal accident when 10-year-old Homero injured himself with a shotgun lent to an older brother. The convalescent boy felt his own survival “connected” to that of birds the gun was intended to shoot.But Aridjis’ collateral, his gravitas, rests upon decades of work for the natural backdrop against which these horrors unfold.Aridjis hails from Contepec, a town nestled against the Cerro Altamirano in Michoacán, in central Mexico, where – for millennia before the region became infamous as terrain over which drug cartels battle – millions of monarch butterflies converged from south-eastern Canada and the northern United States to overwinter. This wonder infused young Aridjis’ poetry he described the monarch as a “winged tiger”.In 1975, this miracle was “discovered” by Canadian scientists: a use of the word which Aridjis likens to the “misnomer” of Cristoforo Colombo discovering, in 1492, an entire hemisphere that had been civilised for millennia. Aridjis and his Mexican forebears knew of the “millions of butterflies, layered like tarnished gold on the trunks and branches”. Because it occurs in early November, Indian lore connects their arrival to the return of departed souls on the Day of the Dead.The Group of 100 had been initially formed to combat lethal pollution in Mexico City, but later focused on the menaced future of the butterflies, facing a new threat: logging, both sanctioned and illegal. A battle began to save “the landscape of our childhood and the backdrop of our dreams, from the depredation of our fellow men”, as Aridjis told a joint symposium of Unesco and Pen International (of which Aridjis was international president for six years), in the hope that “perhaps other human beings can save their hill and their butterfly, and all of us together can protect Earth from the biological holocaust that threatens it”.In 1986, Aridjis convinced then president Miguel de la Madrid to create the Monarch Butterfly Special Biosphere Reserve. However, fires and unchecked cutting proceeded apace in the reserve and in 1989, “the butterflies came to Altamirano, but did not stay”. The reserve challenged “political interests, local and national”, explains Aridjis, “with congressmen, mayors and ejidatarios – co-owners of common land – logging on sanctuary land”. Throughout the 1990s “the government continued to allow logging in both unprotected and protected areas – illegal and commercial cutting were rampant”.But in 2000, the protected area was tripled, and in 2008, with Aridjis now Mexico’s ambassador to Unesco, the Monarch Butterfly Biosphere Reserve was listed as a world heritage site. Even so, with narco-trafficking cartels now controlling the power players in Michoacán, “illegal cutting, illegal fires continue”, says Aridjis. “Often the cartels and the logging interests overlap, joining hands, becoming one and the same.”By the 2013-2014 season, the monarch population had plummeted from 1.1 billion butterflies overwintering in central Mexico in 1996 to 33 million. Aridjis and monarch scientists Lincoln Brower and Ernest Williams penned a letter, signed by more than 200 writers and scientists from 18 countries, to the US president, Barack Obama, Peña Nieto and the Canadian prime minister, Stephen Harper, identifying a further cause for the decline as “genetically modified herbicide resistant soybean and corn crops in the US corn belt. Relentless spraying of glyphosate herbicides on the fields has destroyed the once abundant milkweed plants, the only plants that monarch caterpillars can eat.” The letter urged action to preserve the migratory phenomenon, pleading that “the monarch butterfly is literally being starved to death”.“I wonder whether Donald Trump will take any interest in the monarchs,” wonders Aridjis now, “or will his scorn for migrants extend to migratory species as well? For now, the butterflies come – but for how much longer?”“It all happens inside of me the turtles lay eggs on the beachthe turtles shed tears of sandthe nest robbers are thieving eggs as old as life itself”A Seri person told him that when a member of the community dies, he or she turns into a leatherback turtle, and Seri elders are said to be able to talk to them. “Obviously,” says Aridjis, “the Seri don’t eat leatherbacks, but both may become extinct.”During the 1970s, while Aridjis was Mexico’s ambassador to the Netherlands, he forwarded letters to the president protesting against the cruel mass slaughter of sea turtles, who are facing extinction, on the coasts of Mexico. “I only provoked his anger,” says Aridjis. “He thought it frivolous of me to be defending turtles when there were more important matters in hand, such as selling Mexico’s oil, uranium and natural gas.“What kind of economic progress,” he adds, “cripples ecosystems and makes the land barren and unlivable?”The narrative unearthed by Aridjis and his movement was one of shocking cruelty against species which Aridjis calls “living receptacles of the earth’s natural history”. They survived the extinction of dinosaurs but are threatened by the banalities of greed for turtle “products” – their skins, shells and supposedly aphrodisiac eggs.In articles for the newspaper La Jornada, Aridjis revealed that pirates, unheeded by navy patrols, severed the front and rear flippers of captured turtles before throwing the still living creatures back into the sea. At Mazunte, Oaxaca, olive ridley turtles “piled up like boulders” were killed with bullets or machetes. “Often the womb would be slit open to extract eggs and the turtle left to die a slow death on the sand.” Mutilated females whose wombs were ripped open at sea “frequently crawled up on the beach to die … Near one beach was a mountain of carapaces 80ft high … Every restaurant had turtle eggs on the menu.”Although the sale of turtle eggs was forbidden, a collection and distribution network continued to operate. Poachers crammed up to 1,000 eggs into a single sack, often “accompanied by the same marines charged with guarding the nests”.In 2004, two veterinary students studying olive ridley turtles disappeared – the body of one later washed ashore the death certificate registered death by beating, not drowning. No one – certainly not Aridjis - would suggest that Mexico’s wars are not interconnected.“And there in San Ignacio Lagoon God created the great whalesand each creature that moveson the shadowy thighs of the waters”An excerpt from one of Aridjis’ poemsA wonder of the natural world occurs in this lagoon on the coast of Baja California. After completing one of the world’s longest migrations undertaken by any mammal - between 5,000 and 6,800 miles – magnificent grey whales spawn their young, returning each March with their calves to the Bering, Chukchi and Beaufort seas. The warm lagoon waters were officially protected by legislation in 1954, 1972 and 1979. Mexico established a grey whale sanctuary in Laguna San Ignacio in 1954 and banned whaling. That same year Exportadora de Sal, SA was founded, to mine salt in Baja California Sur. In 1972 the lagoon was decreed a reserve and refuge area for migratory birds and wildlife, and in 1979 a refuge for pregnant whales and calves and a tourist attraction area.Aridjis and the Group of 100 took the offensive, denouncing the company’s 465-page environmental impact assessment that contained only 23 lines on whales and “denies the existence of any body of water that would be adversely affected by the saltworks’ operations”. “Protected areas,” said the group, in a full-page advertisement in the New York Times signed by Octavio Paz, Allen Ginsberg, Margaret Atwood and Günter Grass among others, “would become evaporation ponds, pumping stations, conveyor belts, stockpiles, new service roads and new human settlements …”The now international campaign – coined the biggest environmental battle ever in Mexico – paralleled those seeking to ban Japanese and Norwegian whaling.In March 2000, five years after the campaign was launched, then president Ernesto Zedillo annulled the saltworks project, citing harm to the landscape, although the real reason was financial. In conversation, it is one of the few victories Aridjis allows himself to savour without qualification: “It is one of my great joys to go there, to watch and touch the whales, meet local people I came to know, who are bringing up their children to love the whales.”Aridjis’ articles and speeches were recently collected and translated into a book, News of the Earth. The Nobel laureate JMG Le Clézio writes of the volume that “the great strength of Aridjis’ work is the faith it transmits in a creative virtue of the world, pessimism notwithstanding, and in the possibility of saving it”.In his preface, Aridjis writes that he “often felt like Sisyphus, confronting the same problems over and over again, or Cassandra, prophesying disaster, or Don Quixote, because we sometimes seem like madmen tilting at windmills”.Relevant to last month’s election result: the book records how the party of the favourite to win, Andres López Obrador, was as obstructive towards Aridjis’ campaigns over butterflies and whales as either of the two establishment parties Obrador claims to usurp.Aridjis is darkly, disdainfully hilarious about the banal vulgarity at play in the encounters his campaigns have led him to. He recalls a president’s relative offering him a car and a chauffeur to stop campaigning against a chemical waste plant. And that at the 1994 International Whaling Commission meeting in Puerto Vallarta, the undersecretary of fisheries offered him a $50,000 bribe to stop opposing Mexico’s support for Japanese whaling.Then there was a meeting with the owner of the influential Televisa stations who, to Aridjis’ amazement, offered his support for the campaign against Norway and Japan: “I don’t give a damn about environmentalism,” he said, “but I love going out in my yacht and watching the whales swim around.”Phone numbers for the Japanese and Norwegian embassies were duly broadcast on Televisa’s channels and viewers asked to call demanding an end to whaling. Salinas de Gortari took note and instructed the undersecretary to get the new Mexican position from me.“A corrupt journalist once said to me: ‘I don’t understand you, Homero. You have access to all these powerful people, and could really get yourself a good deal – money, a position. And all you talk to them about is stupid animalitos and arbolitos. I told him I don’t think of my work as being for stupid little animals or little trees. I think of it as being a battle for who we are, and the existence of what we have inherited from nature”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dab656cc0722c76e993806bca9d1730075ada0dd/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc20f127521da9b9e7a74db7c11a6d09","title":"fit for the king elvis presleys fashion legacy in pictures","story":"As a new film, The King, explores Elvis’s cultural impact on the US, we take a look at his style highlights, and continued influenceThe King review – Trump’s America through the windows of Elvis’s Rolls"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7d308fb09568e4f8201847ffaa4fac51acdb6f26/0_113_4263_2557/master/4263.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e146e06cd7545e13261a667cbce02f27","title":"pay a living wage bernie sanders accuses disney of dodging fair pay","story":"The senator and other critics say the company is forgoing government subsidies and tax breaks to avoid wage hikesThe Walt Disney Company came under heavy fire on Thursday for a decision to walk away from hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies and tax breaks for its southern California theme parks, a move critics are characterizing as an extraordinary last-ditch effort to avoid paying a living wage to thousands of workers.Leading the charge, Senator Bernie Sanders accused the company of acting out of fear that voters in Anaheim, Disney’s host city, will pass a living wage ordinance in November. The ordinance, applicable to any large company receiving municipal tax breaks, would require Disneyland and the neighboring Disney California Adventure to pay all 30,000 employees at least $15 an hour, rising to $18 an hour by 2022 and keeping pace with inflation thereafter.Sanders, a champion for low-wage workers nationwide, told the  it was time for Disney to “get off of welfare and pay all of its workers a living wage”.“Disney is so nervous that the living wage ballot initiative in Anaheim is going to pass,” he charged, “it would rather end some of the corporate welfare it receives from local taxpayers than pay all 30,000 of its workers decent wages.” Facing heavy pressure from unions, local politicians and public opinion, Disney agreed to a $15 wage for about a third of its workers last month and is continuing to negotiate with unions representing roughly another third. It has also promised to pay minimum-wage nonunion workers, estimated to number in the low thousands, $15.75 an hour starting in January. The company has vigorously opposed the ballot ordinance, however, despite a barrage of negative publicity following a survey that found that thousands of Disney workers are subsisting on food stamps and living out of their cars.Sanders, who held a rally at Disneyland in June, noted that the company made about $9bn in net profit last year and that Robert Iger, its chief executive, has been offered a compensation package that could earn him as much as $423m over the next four years.Disney made no mention of the living wage ordinance in a letter it wrote to the Anaheim city council on Tuesday, alluding only to an “adversarial climate” and a “difficult working relationship with the city”. The company’s immediate complaint was about a threat by Anaheim not to go through with a $267m rebate package on a new luxury hotel at Disneyland.Media commentators across the country, however, saw the wage issue as far more significant. Ray Baker, a television and radio host from Baltimore tweeted: “Shorter version of this story. When faced with the possibility of paying a living wage, Disney would rather pay taxes.”Disney’s decision to tear up its existing agreements may be a risky move not just because of the immediate loss in subsidies but also because it could expose the company to a city ticket tax that it has worked strenuously to avoid.The company, by far the biggest employer and taxpayer in Anaheim, has wielded tremendous clout with a generally pro-business city council since the theme park was first built in 1955. Recently, however, Anaheim’s population has become more erse and more liberal, leading to a shift in the local balance of power and a much more skeptical approach to Disney’s corporate benefits. The story of a night janitor found dead in her car was particularly damaging to the company.It was not clear from the letter, written by the Disneyland resort president, Josh D’Amaro, whether the company wanted to negotiate a new deal with the city, indicating only its desire for “cooperation and goodwill”.Christopher Duarte, the local president of the Workers United union that represents the resort’s 7,000 food service workers, the largest single group of employees, told the  it wasn’t clear to him what exactly Disney was relinquishing or why. “Can they even exit the agreement that they have with the city?” he asked. “We don’t know what the point of this is. But it does feel like a dodge for the workers.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/055cb1b05ce60b9789e336d71684e6e9c0785c87/129_0_3284_1971/master/3284.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c376dd080b94ff9e3e9b346e9fabd33","title":"burnley olympiakos europa league play off first leg match report","story":"Burnley need a big comeback at Turf Moor after a defeat by Olympiakos that was compounded by Ben Gibson’s sending off.Chris Wood’s 33rd-minute penalty pulled the visitors level in the first leg of their Europa League qualifying play-off after Kostas Fortounis had scored with a free-kick in the 19th minute. Olympiakos regained the lead through Andreas Bouchalakis’s header three minutes after half-time and Fortounis then converted a penalty on the hour to extend the Greek side’s advantage.The spot-kick had been given for handball by Gibson, who was shown a second yellow card, having also been booked for giving away the free-kick that led to Bouchalakis’ goal.It has been reported that one Burnley supporter was stabbed outside the stadium before the match and required stitches while 23 other visiting spectators were arrested for being drunk and disorderly.Burnley, wearing black armbands as a mark of respect to their former player Jimmy McIlroy, who died on Monday aged 86, had a starting lineup featuring six changes from Sunday’s 3-1 Premier League home defeat to Watford. Tom Heaton was among them, the goalkeeper making his first appearance in just under a year, as Joe Hart dropped to the bench.The visitors encountered a poor playing surface and a hostile atmosphere at the 32,000-capacity Karaiskakis Stadium. They fell behind when play was allowed to continue after a collision between Jeff Hendrick and Lazaros Christodoulopoulos. Phil Bardsley brought down Daniel Podence just outside the area and Fortounis curled the free-kick past Heaton in fine style.The equaliser came after Wood went down when challenged by Mohamed Camara. The striker got to his feet and kept his nerve to score from the spot.There were calls from Olympiakos for a penalty just before the interval when Fortounis’ cross struck Stephen Ward’s arm but it was not given and Christodoulopoulos was booked for protesting.The referee produced another yellow card shortly after the interval after Gibson gave away a free-kick with a foul on Fortounis, whose delivery was headed in by Bouchalakis, the former Nottingham Forest midfielder. And a nightmare few minutes for Gibson continued when he was judged to have handled the ball in the box and booked again. Gibson trudged off and Fortounis slotted the penalty past Heaton.Asked about the importance of having a strong referee in front of a partisan crowd, Dyche said: “I’ve got to be careful what I say. But for the life of me I don’t understand why he’s booked Ben Gibson again. He’s gone to block a shot and it’s hit his hip, it’s hit his hand. How can that be deemed deliberate handball? It’s just an impossibility.”Dyche responded to the dismissal by bringing on James Tarkowski for Wood, before Miguel Guerrero shot just wide of Heaton’s goal.Sam Vokes, who had come on for Johnann Berg Gudmudsson, thought he had scored another away goal when he bundled the ball over the line in the closing stages but he was ruled offside.The second leg is at Turf Moor on Thursday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf607eaa436ed753623d565c74a9b53958f841f8/55_8_4396_2638/master/4396.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e7b3e0d0f7cf311f140a2107c041e74a","title":"football fans pay more eleven sports amazon tv rights sky bt","story":"If you had the time or indeed the inclination to watch every screened football match from the top tier of all the major European leagues this season, you would need to cough up more money than ever. It is no longer as simple as lazily switching on Sky Sports and seeing what matches might be on.With the arrival of Eleven Sports in the market, the avid fan is faced with the conundrum of paying more subscriptions or missing out on watching the likes of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.Spain’s top league sprang back into action last weekend, providing the first major test for Eleven Sports, the online streaming service which has exclusive rights to La\u0026nbspLiga and Serie\u0026nbspA. The channel, founded and owned by Leeds United’s majority shareholder,\u0026nbspAndrea Radrizzani, offers subscriptions for £5.99 a month or £49.99 a year, and a free seven-day trial.The company’s chief executive, Marc Watson, who won the Champions League rights for BT, has remained coy about subscription figures since it launched on 9\u0026nbspAugust but did say that the “vast\u0026nbspmajority” who take up the free\u0026nbsptrial are staying.Watson was also keen to impress that while the demographic of the customer base for the streaming service is younger than he remembers from his time at BT, it was very simple and easy to use, with increasing provisions being made for those who prefer to watch on the TV than on their laptop.Non-subscribers can get access to Sky Sports with a £33.99 monthly pass which renews automatically unless cancelled by the customer. Access includes the 126 live Premier League matches to which Sky has rights this season. Sky, though, has opted not to shell out the £18m required to retain the La Liga rights it held for two decades. As a new season offer, Sky Premier League and Sky Football are available for £18 a month for 18 months, on top of Sky’s basic monthly subscription.BT Sport is set to increase its basic subscription price from September to £12 a month for broadband customers, for output including 42 Premier League games, despite losing the Serie A rights. Whichever way you cut it, watching all the top matches from Europe just got that bit more expensive.“If I was a customer I’d be asking why I’m still paying the same and getting less European football,” Watson said, “but that’s for those companies to answer. It’s not up to us to aggregate our channels but I’d be open to the idea of working with Sky and BT in the future.”Sky Sports and BT Sport would possibly argue that they offer more in the way of other sports. But pure football for the dedicated fan is how Eleven, which has 17m subscribers worldwide, sells itself. It is hungry for even more content and acquired the rights to the Netherlands’ Ereisie, the Chinese Super League and Sweden’s\u0026nbspAllsvenskan, and to Burnley’s Europa League qualifying game at Olympiakos on Thursday night.Eleven’s launch event to the UK market was exclusive coverage of the US PGA Championship, which it streamed free on Facebook for the first two days as part of a push to lure custom. Like most new ventures there were teething problems. A “small minority” of golf fans, as Eleven termed them, missed Brooks Koepka sinking his winning putt when the feed went down at the crucial moment. The audience, particularly those not accustomed to watching sport online, were\u0026nbspunforgiving.“It affected a small number of customers but it was very frustrating,” Watson told the . “But with live TV inevitably you do get some issues. Since then nothing has gone wrong and we’ve shown a lot of live games. We had 18 live games over four days last weekend from Friday to Monday, which is more than any other broadcaster.”Eleven might be breaking the longstanding duopoly Sky Sports and BT\u0026nbspSport have held over top‑level European football but Amazon entering the Premier League fray from 2019 is likely to be the real gamechanger.For a long time the industry has been bracing itself for the entry into the market of the tech giants, known as the FAANG’s – Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google. But it was\u0026nbspAmazon which made the first move, albeit a modest one, by securing one of the lesser Premier League rights packages from the most recent tender process.The Premier League had set aside two three-year slots of 20 matches a season for purchase by online companies but neither reached its reserve price. They went back out to tender and Amazon decided to dip a toe in the water, acquiring rights for 10 games in December and a further 10 on Boxing Day.“I think the big tech giants were nervous to overstretch themselves,” Simon Leaf, a sports lawyer for Mishcon de Reya, said. “We saw several years ago that BT were very acquisitive and now they seem to be in retreat with the loss of Italian football and NBA basketball. They’re on a bit of a losing streak and the tech giants have seen that.”There are much-trumpeted reasons why increased competition in any marketplace is a good thing but in the immediate term it has led to more expense for the armchair football fan. “In the short term it’s bad news for the customer,” Leaf said. “Particularly with Amazon, if they want to watch Premier League football they’ll need a subscription. But if Amazon can make the model work and stream for free, in the long\u0026nbsprun it will work out better for the customer.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a106f6a9d929064e54b8c8d8a8e5e6ef4faad49/0_323_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e524b6db6e4c97b1396222e339be11a5","title":"mourinho vs the world and a book writers special football weekly extra","story":"Max is joined by Barry Glendenning, Jonathan Wilson and Michael Calvin to discuss Liverpool’s perfect start, José Mourinho’s issues with everyone, books, plane banner protests and the joy of chancing across a game in the parkRate, review, share on Apple Podcasts, Soundcloud, Audioboom, Mixcloud, Acast and Stitcher, and join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter and email.

If they start to move, I’ll know something’s up. Like rats deserting a sinking ship.”Same for the British media and the health of the nation. Except, instead of certain people, it’s three things. Three things that get studied and obsessed about far more than they might superficially deserve, to the point where it’s so obviously ludicrous that it must be about something far bigger and more portentous. Mustn’t it? The three things are: Marks \u0026amp Spencer sales figures (ladieswear and lingerie, not the food) the porosity or otherwise of Man United’s back four and the James Bond sexy spy movie franchise.Do you ever read about these things? Of course you do. (And not just in this column, where I believe we were on Bond only last week.) You can’t not read about them, or at least see the headlines. They get way more coverage than stuff like utilities. The smallest fluctuation in their fortunes can get easily half a page near the front of any paper or the top of a news bulletin. And each time you see these stories, you may find yourself struck by one question: is this thing fricking nationalised? Because otherwise I just read an entire article about the ailing Autograph bra range like it properly\u0026nbspmattered.So if you have found yourself living with an undefined but increasing sense of dread over the\u0026nbsppast few years, maybe start thinking of these three things as your markers. If I returned after a year from an Indiana Jones-type expedition to the back of beyond, or perhaps after faking my own death, and I needed a briefing that brought me right up to speed with the real UK\u0026nbspthreat level, this is where I would turn. I’m sorry, I’d say to my faithful retainer, but I don’t want to hear about comings-and-goings in the world of politics, or wild movements on the stock exchange, or red alerts from climate scientists. My questions would be simple and direct. What happened at centre-back last weekend? Is M\u0026ampS still doing\u0026nbspthat Per Una line and has anyone worked out what it is yet? And where in the name of turbo-bellwethers are we with the latest James Bond film?So … My nearest M\u0026ampS closed down last week. Like me, you may have watched Manchester United’s performance against Brighton at the\u0026nbspAmex on Sunday. And Danny Boyle just walked off the next Bond\u0026nbspmovie.Survival kit, party of 65 million? Your table is ready. I don’t want to go\u0026nbspfull Baker Street here, but it’s all starting to look very “no deal” to me.Or maybe it’s an alternative disaster scenario that’s in the post. There is, obviously, no better to place to discuss in precisely what form the S might HTF than in earth’s least glittering showbiz column. But first, a recap. Danny Boyle – much-loved maestro of Britain’s last moment* of national pride and togetherness in the form of the 2012 Olympics opening ceremony – has relinquished directing duties on the as-yet-untitled 25th iteration of the Bond franchise, with Bond producers and star Daniel Craig citing “creative differences”. What does that mean? No one seems to know, any more than they do about where to find the knitwear section these days, or why you’d buy Victor Lindelöf for 30 million quid.What we can say is that Craig and\u0026nbspBoyle have worked together before. You may recall that the aforementioned 2012 opening ceremony was kicked off with a film\u0026nbspof Craig, as Bond, arriving at Buckingham Palace to escort the Queen to the Olympic Stadium. It\u0026nbspwas never revealed what they chatted about on the way, though both are rewarded with unimaginable riches for sacrificing their professional lives to these two roles. Still, you never hear the Queen, 92, complain.It is, after all, what movie people call a tentpole. Except instead of supporting merely a studio, the James Bond franchise is inextricably – and inexplicably – bound up with our biggest state institutions. For the\u0026nbsprelease of Spectre, the last Bond movie, GCHQ effectively did a promotional tie-in with the Times. The splash headline was: “For Your Eyes Only – The Times goes inside GCHQ.” “GCHQ has to be out there,” one official told the paper. “We can’t operate behind veils of secrecy any more.” I believe the cover story was that the draft investigatory powers bill was to be published the following week, but both the intelligence services and the government appeared palpably grateful for the ride on Bond’s coattails.As for where we are now, the answer seems to be: rudderless. In\u0026nbspmany and varied ways. The director’s chair for Bond 25 is more vacant than Chris Grayling. The biggest name to be linked with the job is Christopher Nolan, whose Dunkirk was 106 minutes, but who consistently appeared unable to tell the Batman story in much less than 165. His Bond could therefore be expected to be clock in as a four-hour world cinema slog.But will he get it? Well, as you probably already guessed, you don’t want to waste your time with the high-street bookies on all this. It’s a closely guarded secret that there is, in fact, an only-for-the-initiated bookmaker who offers you the real odds on things. They’ll tell you the actual chances of a JohnsonRees-Mogg leadership pact, or that Jeremy\u0026nbspCorbyn didn’t know what was going on in that Tunis cemetery,\u0026nbspor that Vince Cable is still somehow – and somewhere – leader of the Liberal Democrats.So gather round. Here are the odds for the next James Bond director. At 2-1 it’s some European guy you’ve never heard of, but the big mover is the governor of HMP Birmingham, who’s right in at 3-1. Tied at 9-2 are Christopher Nolan and Tommy Robinson, with José Mourinho behind those at 8-1. Clive\u0026nbspLewis and Dominic Raab are pegged at 10-1. At 16s, it’s World Bank special\u0026nbspmeasures, with Nigel Farage drifting to 18-1. It’s 25-1 bar those, and you are advised to adjust\u0026nbspyour emergency preparations\u0026nbspaccordingly.* Gareth Southgate’s World Cup campaign - in the summer of the year 2018 - was England-specific, and therefore does not qualify."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e920555161136968b77275b432fa3ced1f207fe2/0_148_3264_1958/master/3264.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4adb213314325c265c26f27282f6dcf6","title":"the big squeeze what to pack for an overnight trail run","story":"Packing light for an endurance event can seem like an insurmountable challenge. From fluids to food and kit, here’s how to get it rightI felt well prepped. My first serious trail run lay a week away. Madeira’s mountainous tracks and cliff-top coastline beckoned. Our route: the classic MIUT ultra ning the Portuguese island in the north Atlantic. But we weren’t crazy. We would do it in two stages rather than in one, crazy-goat go. And we would hack off the first 35km. So that left around 80km over two days. Sure, the gradient chart for the first day looked like a heart attack victim’s cardiograph (3,600m of ascent). But, as I say, I felt good. I had trained hard. I wasn’t carrying any niggles. Then, with a simple email, everything changed. The message was from Charlie, one of our Madeira trail-running trio. Of the three of us, he was the only one with any experience of serious long-distance running. He owns a high-end travel company in Morocco and talks casually of jogging in the Atlas mountains. He had already won our ear. Then I learned he had done the Marathon des Sables, a seriously gruelling six-day race in the Sahara, and our respect rose inordinately. So when he sent an email with the subject heading, “Everything weighs something”, I was primed to listen.It’s obvious, of course. Except for air, nothing is weightless. Everything else had to fit into a backpack (a 12-litre rucksack, in my case). I had been excitedly purchasing bits and pieces over the past fortnight or so: some new sunglasses (with sporty reflective tint), a running visor (to look the part), a buff (to look like a Spanish biker). Anyone who has prepared for an endurance-type event will know that buying the kit is half the fun. Gradually, however, a hefty pile of stuff had begun to collect beside my bed.The question of how to squeeze all this into my (much smaller) bag had, in a vague sort of way, been turning over at the back of my mind. Charlie’s email sent such thoughts scurrying to the front. To save weight, he was recommending that we portion out the essentials between us. So Jon, our mutual friend, was assigned toothpaste and sun cream (“small tubes”), plus a phone charger and, weirdly, a knife. Channelling his inner nurse, Charlie put himself down for kinesiology tape, first-aid kit and anti-inflammatories. I got the leftovers: toilet roll, wet-wipes, water purification tablets. The email ended in the cavalier style of a Victorian-era Arctic explorer: “The rest is each-to-his-own.”I look again at my pile. Forget 1-in-4 gradients: packing light suddenly seemed the insurmountable challenge ahead. Start with the non-negotiables, I resolved. So into my bag went my passport, my inhaler, my survival “space blanket” and my phone. The remainder vied up into three broad categories: fluids, foodstuffs and comfort-offering accoutrements. But what to take?For fluids, I decided to keep it old-school: a modest-sized bottle in a side pocket, plus a 1.5l hydration. I’m prone to cramps, so I allowed myself some electrolyte tablets as well. What I didn’t pack were purification tablets: I’d searched high and low in Porto, where I live, but couldn’t find them anywhere. We would just have to bet on Madeira’s watercourses being free of cow muck and chemicals.Subsequent events taught me two key lessons. First, water is seriously heavy. Second, I wish I had known to fill up whenever and wherever I got the chance. While streams and irrigation channels were two-a-penny on Madeira’s lower slopes, the story was altogether different above the treeline. Climbing to a lengthy 1,500m ridgeline, I found myself out of water. My legs turned heavy, my head hurt. If we hadn’t eventually stumbled on a mountain spring, my adventure would have been over almost before it began. So, to food. Into the bag went two 250g bags of nuts, and some energy bars. At the last minute, I also snuck in a cheese sandwich and banana, both of which emerged from my bag totally squished but no less edible. Our general game plan was to keep nibbling through the day, then carb up in the evening. In the end, we arrived at our night-stop after dark and discovered the hamlet’s two eateries long shut. In the days after the run, I barely left the fridge. Finally to kit: painkillers, salt tablets, plasters, head-torch, bank card, toothbrush. Most of the rest related to staying warm. My dilemma wasn’t the daylight hours. The forecast was saying around 25C, even at altitude. It was packing for the night that threw me. I spent hours lusting over one-man tents online, but all fell far outside my price range. I opted instead for just a sleeping bag, plus lots of layers. I figured I could sleep in my fleece and rain jacket, plus the spare clothes I had earmarked for the journey home. Assigned by lack of space to the “leave” pile was a roll mat, an inner lining for the sleeping bag, and a thin puffer coat. Did I sleep well? No, not especially, but I felt emboldened for roughing it.In retrospect, if I were to have shelled out on anything, a top-notch sleeping bag would probably have topped the list: it would have taken up less room and, being warmer, saved on me packing extra clothes. But, in general, I felt I had whittled everything down as much as possible. Only my weight of expectation remained alarmingly high – and Madeira, runners’ heaven that it is, did not disappoint.

They used data from 694 studies to work out how common drinking was and from 592 studies including 28 million people worldwide to work out the health risks.Moderate drinking has been condoned for years on the assumption that there are some health benefits. A glass of red wine a day has long been said to be good for the heart. But although the researchers did find low levels of drinking offered some protection from heart disease, and possibly from diabetes and stroke, the benefits were far outweighed by alcohol’s harmful effects, they said.In the UK, the chief medical officer Sally Davies has said there is no safe level of drinking, but the guidance suggests that drinkers consume no more than 14 units a week to keep the risks low. Half a pint of average-strength lager contains one unit and a 125ml glass of wine contains around 1.5 units.“Alcohol poses dire ramifications for future population health in the absence of policy action today. Our results indicate that alcohol use and its harmful effects on health could become a growing challenge as countries become more developed, and enacting or maintaining strong alcohol control policies will be vital,” said the report’s senior author, Prof Emmanuela Gakidou.“Worldwide we need to revisit alcohol control policies and health programmes, and to consider recommendations for abstaining from alcohol. These include excise taxes on alcohol, controlling the physical availability of alcohol and the hours of sale, and controlling alcohol advertising. Any of these policy actions would contribute to reductions in population-level consumption, a vital step toward decreasing the health loss associated with alcohol use.”Dr Robyn Burton, of King’s College London, said in a commentary in the Lancet that the conclusions of the study were clear and unambiguous. “Alcohol is a colossal global health issue and small reductions in health-related harms at low levels of alcohol intake are outweighed by the increased risk of other health-related harms, including cancer,” she wrote.“There is strong support here for the guideline published by the Chief Medical Officer of the UK who found that there is ‘no safe level of alcohol consumption’.”Public health policy should be to prioritise measures to reduce the numbers who drink through price increases, taxation, or setting the price according to the strength of the drink (minimum unit pricing), followed by curbs on marketing and restricting the places where people can buy alcohol.“These approaches should come as no surprise because these are also the most effective measures for curbing tobacco-related harms, another commercially mediated disease, with an increasing body of evidence showing that controlling obesity will require the same measures,” she wrote.Ben Butler, a Drinkaware spokesperson, said: “This new study supports existing evidence about the harms associated with alcohol. Our research shows that over a quarter of UK adults typically exceed the low risk drinking guidelines and are running the risk of serious long term illnesses.”But David Spiegelhalter, Winton professor for the public understanding of risk at the University of Cambridge, said the data showed only a very low level of harm in moderate drinkers and suggested UK guidelines were very low risk.“Given the pleasure presumably associated with moderate drinking, claiming there is no ‘safe’ level does not seem an argument for abstention,” he said. “There is no safe level of driving, but government do not recommend that people avoid driving. Come to think of it, there is no safe level of living, but nobody would recommend abstention.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b2d30fa621ea0013539395efaf3d5d0976b9925e/0_69_4498_2700/master/4498.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ce69e1e6fb4e840079122f756a66b34b","title":"russian trolls spread vaccine misinformation on twitter","story":"Study discovered several accounts, now known to belong to the same Russian trolls who interfered in the US election, tweeting about vaccinesBots and Russian trolls spread misinformation about vaccines on Twitter to sow ision and distribute malicious content before and during the American presidential election, according to a new study.Scientists at George Washington University, in Washington DC, made the discovery while trying to improve social media communications for public health workers, researchers said. Instead, they found trolls and bots skewing online debate and upending consensus about vaccine safety.The study discovered several accounts, now known to belong to the same Russian trolls who interfered in the US election, as well as marketing and malware bots, tweeting about vaccines. Russian trolls played both sides, the researchers said, tweeting pro- and anti-vaccine content in a politically charged context.“These trolls seem to be using vaccination as a wedge issue, promoting discord in American society,” Mark Dredze, a team member and professor of computer science at Johns Hopkins, which was also involved in the study, said.“By playing both sides, they erode public trust in vaccination, exposing us all to the risk of infectious diseases. Viruses don’t respect national boundaries.”The study, published in the American Journal of Public Health, comes as Europe faces one of the largest measles outbreaks in decades, one which has been partly attributed to falling vaccination rates. In the first six months of 2018, there were 41,000 cases of measles across the continent, more than in the entirety of 2017. Meanwhile, the rate of children not receiving vaccines for non-medical reasons is climbing in the US.“The vast majority of Americans believe vaccines are safe and effective, but looking at Twitter gives the impression that there is a lot of debate,” said David Broniatowski, an assistant professor in George Washington’s School of Engineering and Applied Science.“It turns out that many anti-vaccine tweets come from accounts whose provenance is unclear. These might be bots, human users or ‘cyborgs’ – hacked accounts that are sometimes taken over by bots. Although it’s impossible to know exactly how many tweets were generated by bots and trolls, our findings suggest that a significant portion of the online discourse about vaccines may be generated by malicious actors with a range of hidden agendas.”Russian trolls appeared to link vaccination to controversial issues in the US. Their vaccine-related content made appeals to God, or argued about race, class and animal welfare, researchers said. Often, the tweets targeted the legitimacy of the US government.“Did you know there was secret government database of #Vaccine-damaged child? #VaccinateUS,” read one Russian troll tweet. Another said: “#VaccinateUS You can’t fix stupidity. Let them die from measles, and I’m for #vaccination!”“Whereas bots that spread malware and unsolicited content disseminated anti-vaccine messages, Russian trolls promoted discord,” researchers concluded. “Accounts masquerading as legitimate users create false equivalency, eroding public consensus on vaccination.”Researchers examined a random sample of 1.7m tweets collected between July 2014 and September 2017 – the height of the American presidential campaign that led to Donald Trump’s victory. To identify bots, researchers compared the rate at which normal users tweeted about vaccines with the rate at which bots and trolls did so.“We started looking at the Russian trolls, because that data set became available in January,” said Broniatowski. “One of the first things that came out was they tweet about vaccines way more often than the average Twitter user.”Broniatowski said trolls tweeted about vaccines about 22 times more often than regular Twitter users, or about once every 550 tweets, versus every 12,000 tweets for human accounts.Researchers found different kinds of bots spread different kinds of misinformation. So-called “content polluters” used anti-vaccine messages as bait to entice their followers to click on advertisements and links to malicious websites. The study comes as social media companies struggle to clean their houses of misinformation. In February, Twitter deleted 3,800 accounts linked to the Russian government-backed Internet Research Agency, the same group researchers at George Washington examined. In April, Facebook removed 135 accounts linked to the same organization.This week, Facebook removed another 650 fake accounts linked to Russia and Iran meant to spread misinformation. Researchers did not study Facebook, though it remains a hub of anti-vaccination activity.“To me it’s actually impressive how well-organized and sophisticated the anti-vax movement has become,” said Dr Peter Hotez, the director of the Texas children’s hospital center for vaccine development at Baylor College of Medicine, and the father of an autistic child. Hotez, who maintains an active Twitter presence, said he struggled to identify whether Twitter accounts were human or bots.“There are clearly some well-known anti-vax activists that I know to look out for and I know to block or to mute, but that’s a minority,” said Hotez. “A lot of it just seems to come out of nowhere, and I’m always surprised by that.”Net neutrality is the idea that internet service providers (ISPs) treat everyone’s data equally – whether that’s an email from your mother, a bank transfer or a streamed episode of The Handmaid’s Tale. It means that ISPs don’t get to choose which data is sent more quickly, and which sites get blocked or throttled (for example, slowing the delivery of a TV show because it is streamed by a video company that competes with a subsidiary of the ISP) and who has to pay extra. For this reason, some have described net neutrality as the\u0026nbsp“first amendment of the internet”.One of the most striking findings, Broniatowski said, was an apparent attempt by Russian trolls to Astroturf a vaccine debate using the hashtag #VaccinateUS. Accounts identified as controlled by the Internet Research Agency, a troll farm backed by the Russian government, were almost exclusively responsible for content emerging under #VaccinateUS.Some of the Russian trolls even specifically used a hashtag associated with Andrew Wakefield, the discredited former physician who published fraudulent papers linking vaccines with autism, such as #Vaxxed and #CDCWhistleblower. requested comment from Twitter and was referred to a blogpost in which the company said its “focus is increasingly on proactively identifying problematic accounts”, and that its system “identified and challenged” more than 9.9m potential spam accounts a week in May 2018."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/33cc3d8ae89e8616b4ea5a6b9f722731101fe46d/227_287_2024_1214/master/2024.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5c34687f6c2ab3608fc34cd54ee756a5","title":"chris ashton england doubt seven week ban tip tackle sale","story":"Chris Ashton’s hopes of winning an England recall this autumn have been dealt a hammer blow after he was hit on Thursday night with a seven-week ban for a tip-tackle during a pre-season friendly\u0026nbspwith Sale.Ashton will have just one match to prove his worth before Eddie Jones names his autumn squad in October after the player was found guilty at a Rugby Football Union disciplinary hearing. It is a major setback for Ashton in his pursuit of a first England cap since 2014, having moved to Sale in the summer from Toulon to press his World Cup claims.It is also the worst possible start to Ashton’s Premiership return – he will miss Sale’s first six league matches – having enjoyed a record-breaking season at Toulon last term, and a horrible sense of deja vu for Sale’s marquee summer signing. In January 2016 he was suspended for 10 weeks for making contact with the eye area of Ulster’s Luke Marshall and in September that year he was banned for 13 weeks for biting Northampton’s Alex Waller.Both bans are fundamental reasons as to why Ashton has not played for England under Jones but he had earned an immediate return to the squad for a pre-season training camp in August, upon his return to the Premiership.Ashton is now almost certain to miss the September camp, and has only Sale’s European Challenge Cup fixture away against Perpignan on 12\u0026nbspOctober to demonstrate his form before Jones names his autumn squad six days later.The player contested the charge, having been sent off last Friday in an ill-tempered win against Castres in which three players were shown the red card, and Sale believe he was the subject of intense provocation from Rory Kockott, who was also sent off and subsequently received a one-week ban. It is understood Sale believe contact was made with Ashton’s eye area in the fracas.Sale’s director of rugby, Steve Diamond, said: “If you’re defending yourself on a rugby pitch when things go on that are over and above what we\u0026nbspexpect then red mist doesn’t come into it. It was self-defence. Chris Ashton defended himself as any of you lot would defend yourself.“I’m pissed\u0026nbspoff that he got sent off but in extreme circumstances where he defended himself. I’d take a red\u0026nbspcard for\u0026nbspany other Sale player if they defended themselves the way Chris\u0026nbspAshton did.”The disciplinary panel insisted that “provocation is not a defence to foul play”. Once Ashton had been found guilty six weeks was the minimum ban he could have received and that was extended to seven when taking into account his previous record.“It is an important principle of rugby regulation to prevent injury to others,” Richard Whittam, who chaired the panel, said. “Provocation is not a defence to foul play and lifting a player and dropping that player such that his head makes contact with the ground has the potential to cause serious injury. While in this case the panel accepts no injury was caused, it still amounted to foul play that clearly met the red card threshold.“The absence of injury and that the action was as a result of a level of provocation meant that the panel found this was a low-end entry point. Mr Ashton’s poor disciplinary record was an aggravating feature and the panel added one week to reflect that. The panel considered at length the prescriptive list of factors in relation to mitigation, but none were sufficient to reduce the length of the sanction.”Diamond hopes Ashton will hit the ground running when he does become available. “He is a world-class finisher, apart from his indiscretions on the field now, and then he is a top-class pro, he’s a northern lad – he ticks a lot of boxes,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6b42c2475ec011cbc3fcb67bf3c77fe874bc2a9/92_57_3064_1839/master/3064.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7cba1c5d18d987aadd589f43c68496d","title":"frankie dettori victory mark johnston history books most wins","story":"“This horse epitomises what we’re all about,” Mark Johnston said after Poet’s Society, a 20-1 shot ridden by Frankie Dettori, finally secured his place as the trainer with most wins in British racing history here on Thursday.“It’s his sixth win this year, and his 26th run,” Johnston said. “I called him ‘old fella’ in the saddling boxes before the race, and he’s only a four-year-old.”A Stakhanovite appetite for the unabating labour of racing has characterised both the trainer and his horses since he opened a stable in Lincolnshire in 1987, but even by Johnston’s standards Poet’s Society is a grafter. His efforts in 2018 equate to a race every nine days, and his average winning margin in his six victories has been just over half a length.The success on Thursday was the narrowest yet, by just a neck in a driving finish, but it was the one that mattered most for Johnston, who had saddled 18 consecutive losers in Britain since drawing alongside Richard Hannon Sr at the top of the all-time list on Saturday. Poet’s Society, one of two relative outsiders he saddled in the race, finally took him to 4,194 British winners and he can now concentrate on extending his lead in the seasons ahead.“It was getting very frustrating with all the attention on it,” Johnston said. “It wasn’t as if we had loads of odds‑on shots beaten or anything like that and we had plenty of horses running well. It was just sod’s law that it took a long time to get from four to one, and then from one to now.Johnston spent two years in a veterinary practice before setting up as a trainer in 1987, an experience that he once said helped him to “cut out the bullshit” and gave him “the confidence to push on and not be swayed by extraneous factors”. He sent out just a single winner in his first season with a licence, and only five the following year, but his momentum started to build when he moved to his current base at Kingsley House stables in Middleham.Johnston stated at an early stage of his career that his primary ambition was to train Classic winners, and the first arrived in 1994 when Mister Baileys took the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket. That was the first of 13 Group One winners in Britain to date, which is arguably quite a modest haul for such a prolific trainer and three fewer than Aidan O’Brien saddled in 2017 alone.For sheer productivity in terms of winners, however, British racing has never seen anything to match Johnston’s training operation and his position at the top of the all-time list is unlikely to be challenged for many years to come. Deirdre, his wife, has also played an indispensable role in their training operation while more recently their son Charlie has emerged as heir-apparent at Kingsley House.“I nearly wasn’t here,” Johnston said after the decisive win at York. “Deirdre’s not here and nor is Charlie. We didn’t expect it to be this race, we had two runners today and they were both in this race and they were 20-1 and 33-1. People keep saying: ‘What does it mean?’ And I don’t think anyone is trying to belittle it in any way but sometimes you have to think: ‘Well, how important is it?’ At the same time I have got to pinch myself and say: ‘How can you get to 4,194 winners from where we started.’ It was unimaginable. It’s a relief to get it out of the way. Now we can get on with the next one and back to business as usual.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec8a6a4e0ac431bf81d9709239003ae608d633de/0_0_3146_1887/master/3146.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=77a55faf6ad289c7945b60516601bc07","title":"us open draw andy murray serena venus","story":"Serena and Venus Williams could be headed toward their earliest grand slam meeting in 20 years, facing a potential third-round matchup at the US Open.If the sisters do play each other, the winner might face No 1-ranked Simona Halep in the fourth round.That is certainly the most intriguing section of the women’s and men’s brackets revealed at Thursday’s draw for the last major of the year.This marks Serena’s return to Flushing Meadows after missing the hard-court tournament in 2017 she gave birth to her daughter last 1 September.The 36-year-old American has won six of her 23 grand slam titles at the US Open and was given the No 17 seed by the US Tennis Association nine places above her current ranking.Venus, who won two of her seven grand slam singles trophies in New York, is ranked and seeded 16th. She faces a tricky first-round match against Svetlana Kuznetsova, whose two major championships include the 2004 US Open.Kuznetsova was given a wild-card entry for the tournament, where main-draw play begins Monday.Serena’s opener comes against 60th-ranked Magda Linette of Poland. Should the Williams siblings both make it to the third round, they would play each other at a grand slam tournament sooner than they have since Venus beat Serena in the second round at the 1998 Australian Open their very first head-to-head match on tour.They’ve gone on to play a total of 29 times Serena leads 17-12 and that includes nine all-in-the-family grand slam finals, most recently at the 2017 Australian Open.In the men’s field, No 1-ranked and defending champion Rafael Nadal opens against David Ferrer in an all-Spanish rematch of their 2013 French Open final. No 2 Roger Federer plays Japan’s Yoshihito Nishioka in the first round.Federer faces a potential quarterfinal against No 6 seed Novak Djokovic, the Wimbledon champion who beat him two weeks ago in a tuneup and is considered the tournament favorite. No 4 seed Alexander Zverev and seventh-seeded Marin Cilic, the 2014 US Open champion, are also in Federer’s half of the draw along with No 30 seed Nick Kyrgios, the Australian whom Federer could meet in the third round.Stan Wawrinka, the 2016 US Open champion who missed last year’s tournament because of injury and was given a wild card into this year’s field, faces No 8 seed Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria in one of the headline matches of the first round. Wawrinka, a three-time major titlist, eliminated Dimitrov in the first round at Wimbledon in June.Nadal’s half of the draw includes No 3 seed and 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro who could face another former US Open champion in Andy Murray in the third round and fifth-seeded Kevin Anderson, the Wimbledon and US Open runner-up.Besides Federer-Djokovic, the other possible men’s quarterfinals are Nadal-Anderson, Del Potro-Dimitrov and Zverev-Cilic.Women’s No 2 seed Caroline Wozniacki faces 2011 US Open champion Sam Stosur in the first round. Sloane Stephens, the defending champion, is the No 3 seed and could face former No 1 Victoria Azarenka in the third round.Potential women’s quarterfinals include Halep v No 8 Karolina Pliskova, Wozniacki v No 5 Petra Kvitova, Stephens v No 7 Elina Svitolina, and No 4 Angelique Kerber v No 6 Carolina Garcia."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4189792ec70077361fbcf295e934764a2d79af58/0_263_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=57c49aa15ca86be594a619585b789933","title":"basil doliveira 158 england south africa 50 years on apartheid","story":"Fifty years ago a seemingly unignorable knock from ‘Dolly’ fell by the wayside – but had consequences for apartheidThere have been many strange decisions by England cricket selectors over the years. Only one of them changed the world. And it happened exactly 50 years ago.On 23 August 1968 Basil D’Oliveira scored 158 at the Oval against Australia, an innings that won the Test, drew the series and made him, so we thought, a certainty for the South Africa tour that winter. Four days later the panel met to choose the touring party. The names were announced on the radio next day. The alphabetical list went straight from Cowdrey to Edrich. It\u0026nbsptook D’Oliveira a moment to grasp what that meant.It was the lowest point of an astonishing journey. D’Oliveira was born in South Africa, in the mixed-race “Cape Coloured” community, confined under the apartheid system of racial segregation to playing only on the rutted tracks of the ghettoes. In 1958, he wrote poignantly to the British broadcaster John Arlott asking if he might get a chance in England. It took three years and many travails but it happened. He progressed from the Lancashire League to Worcestershire to the England team.“Dolly” became beloved, for his hard hitting, his golden-arm seam bowling, his geniality, his bearing. He was also a symbol. Britain was a far more homogeneous country then: the England cricket team was a hierarchical alliance between the classes, not different races. But his arrival was not a problem – he was a testament to our inclusivity – until, two years after his debut, South Africa loomed.To the apartheid regime, he was a problem. If D’Oliveira toured, he would be an instant hero to the entire non‑white population, and for the white minority government under John Vorster, that would never do. To South Africa’s cricket authorities he exposed the lie behind their all-whiteness: “Aagh man, you know the non-whites never play and, hey, when they do, they’re hopeless.” Since the South Africans faced only white opposition, they never faced the brilliant 1960s\u0026nbspWest\u0026nbspIndians.At Lord’s opinion was ambivalent. Cricket was still run by men with the old English virtues, and vices. They believed in fair play. But they also loved South Africa as the place to tour: amazing hospitality, without Australia’s combative edge. To generalise, they hated the brutality of apartheid but empathised with their friends out there. It is surprising how few seemed to notice that, in the packed pens where black spectators were confined, the cheers were for the away team.There was an obvious risk that, if chosen, D’Oliveira would be barred. In which case the tour would have to be cancelled – no question – and England would lose an important opponent. So through the summer of 1968 there was manoeuvring, anguished meetings, furtive discussions, crackpot ideas: “Basil, couldn’t you play for South Africa instead?” A mysterious businessman tried and failed to bribe Dolly to rule himself out.The problem, it seemed, might resolve itself: D’Oliveira was out of the team. Then Roger Prideaux got ill before the Oval Test. Dolly replaced him. Then came the 158. It is impossible to know what happened in that selection meeting everyone in the room is now dead. Was the chairman, Doug Insole, being honest when he said tortuously: “I think we have got better players”? Some cricket writers thought so. But Arlott, by now the  correspondent, snorted: “No one of open mind will believe that he was left out for valid cricket reasons.”Was it then all a massive conspiracy involving the MCC, Afrikaaner fanatics and maybe the Bilderberg Group, the Masons and the pope? No, there is another explanation, rarely spoken out loud. The clue lay in another omission from that squad: the rumbustious opening bat, Colin “Ollie” Milburn. In the fallout that followed D’Oliveira’s omission, hardly anyone noticed that Milburn had been displaced by the far less gifted Prideaux.Only a few months earlier, England had been in West Indies, another alcoholic tour. Ollie was master of the revels. Dolly – a teetotaller until he came to England – was a regular accomplice. This was noted in managerial reports. Perhaps the selectors feared him being sloshed in South Africa, where government agents would have lurked, offering not\u0026nbsphoney-traps but beer-traps. A\u0026nbspdrunken Dolly in the cells would have made Vorster’s year.I am confident events in the Caribbean were at the heart of the secret. One selector confirmed this to me many years later. He may have been lying, to cover up something worse, but I don’t think so. Lord’s could and should have responded differently. But I believe they sort-of meant well.They certainly never foresaw the extent of the furore. Or what would happen next. Two weeks later Tom Cartwright withdrew from the tour. And guess who was chosen instead. Insole’s explanation was again tortured: Cartwright, a bowler who batted, being replaced by D’Oliveira, a batter who bowled? Hmmm. (Cartwright’s “injury” may have been diplomatic: he was unusually radical for a cricketer and hated South Africa.)The politics would have been much harder for Vorster had D’Oliveira been in the original squad. But now he seized the ball, making a vicious speech banning him from entry (he was reputedly rat-arsed himself at the time). The MCC cancelled the tour. In the short run Vorster won. In the very long run he sealed South Africa’s fate. England did not play them again until 1994 and in the meantime the sporting boycott proved a major factor in throttling white rule.Next month, seven years after his death, D’Oliveira will be made a Freeman of Worcester. Vorster is a posthumous pariah. Justice is done."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f2e24d8f170d5bf719abbcaac7e48467b513da94/0_0_3226_1937/master/3226.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1bed6eb76c050ced6339cfed69205a7e","title":"amazon fc ambassadors twitter working conditions","story":"Army of fulfillment center employees jump to company’s defense online when it faces a barrage of bad pressAnxious consumers worried about the welfare of Amazon’s thousands of warehouse employees will be relieved to discover that they do in fact get to occasionally use the toilet. They’re also allowed to drink water on the job, work in well-lit spaces with really big fans, and don’t need food stamps to make ends meet.And, for at least one of them, “Olive Garden is life”.We know all this thanks to Amazon’s “FC ambassadors” – employees at the e-tailer’s fulfillment centers who spring to the company’s defense on Twitter when it’s being dragged for poor working conditions.Over the last two weeks, 16 such accounts have sprouted up on Twitter in response to negative comments about Jeff Bezos’ wealth by Bernie Sanders, an alleged rise in health and safety complaints at Amazon facilities following Prime Day, and an April 2018 UK report that claimed Amazon employees skip bathroom breaks and urinate into bottles to ensure they make their quotas.The accounts are remarkably uniform in look and tone. All feature the familiar burnt-umber Amazon smile logo as their Twitter cover. All sport a photo of the account’s owner posed inside a warehouse, though many of their faces are not visible, and a first name but not a last one. All are relentlessly upbeat and articulate. And – surprise – they’re all quite happy about how Amazon is treating them.They’re mostly stowers, pickers, or packers, and they claim to work in warehouses ranging from Kent, Washington, to Jacksonville, Florida.Carol, a picker in Kent, tweets that with base salary, bonuses, and stock she makes around $15 an hour, not counting any overtime.Adam, a stower based in San Marcos, Texas, says Amazon warehouse workers get healthcare coverage starting on day one and that the company will help pay employees’ college tuition.Thomas, a picker from Jacksonville, loves narwhals and thinks sporks are underrated.Beyond that, though, we don’t know much about them. ( reached out to a half dozen of the more active accounts on Twitter but had not received a response by press time.)An Amazon spokesperson, Ty Rogers, assured the  via email that these ambassadors were real employees who work in fulfillment centers, not Twitter bots. He declined to answer questions about how the accounts were created or if employees were compensated for defending the company on social media.“FC ambassadors are employees who understand what it’s actually like to work in our FCs,” says Rogers. “The most important thing is that they’ve been here long enough to honestly share the facts based on personal experience. It’s important that we do a good job of educating people about the actual environment inside our fulfillment centers, and the FC ambassador program is a big part of that, along with the FC tours we provide.”Phil, a stower also based in Kent, is perhaps the most active ambassador on Twitter. He says he gets to use a bathroom whenever he wants, and that if Amazon was using Twitter bots to defend itself they’d be more entertaining.He also says employees are rewarded for doing a good job with “Swag Bucks”, in-house currency that can only spent at the Amazon store, and that they typically spend it on things like sweatshirts and water bottles.But just for drinking.

Now the wheels are flying offLast week, an emotional Elon Musk described how he was working so hard to keep production of the Tesla Model 3 on track that he missed his own birthday. “All night – no friends, nothing,” he told the New York Times, apparently “struggling to get the words out”. Musk had, he said, been working 120-hour weeks, often not leaving the factory for three or four days. When he did get home, he said, the choice was between no sleep or taking an Ambien, an insomnia drug intended for short-term use (and blamed by some of Tesla’s board members for his erratic night-time tweeting).Musk has long been celebrated by the business press for his work ethic. His extraordinary schedule – a long working day broken into five-minute increments, so that every second is accounted for (lunch is usually wolfed down in a meeting) – has been reported, approvingly, for some years now. And certainly, Musk has more on his plate than many chief executives. As well as running Tesla, the first mass-market car company to be founded in the US in decades, he is the head of SpaceX, which aims to fly people to Mars, and Neuralink, a company attempting to build a brain-computer interface.The only reason he is not even more busy is because he resigned from the board of OpenAI, a non-profit founded to create “safe artificial general intelligence”, when he decided there was a conflict of interest with Tesla’s own AI projects and because he is no longer the chairman of his cousins’ solar panel company, Solar City, since Tesla bought it wholesale in 2016.He also has five children.Historically, the boss who dedicates his life – every second of it – to corporate success has been an icon of the US boardroom, nowhere more so than in Silicon Valley. Tech bosses have typically combined the pressure of being an executive managing millions with the optimise-everything mentality of a typical engineer, while the straight-out-of-college age of many first-time entrepreneurs is a perfect storm for a level of dedication to workplace productivity that verges on the dangerous. Not just dinners at the office and a sleeping bag under the desk, but 5am starts after an hour at the gym, breakfast replaced by “bulletproof coffee” (coffee with butter in it, but apparently healthy) and interspersed with spells of “intermittent fasting”. Then there is the tendency to take client calls while in the check-in queue for your third international flight in as many days. Could Musk’s tearful disclosure be the moment all that changes?Arianna Huffington, another multimillionaire with her fingers in multiple pies, led the reaction to his interview, with an open letter on her Thrive Global website imploring Musk to “give yourself time to reconnect not just with those you love but also with yourself and your wisdom”.“This is not about working hard,” Huffington wrote. “It’s about working in a way that allows you to make your best decisions. Working 120-hour weeks doesn’t leverage your unique qualities, it wastes them. You can’t simply power through – that’s just not how our bodies and our brains work. Nobody knows better than you that we can’t get to Mars by ignoring the laws of physics. Nor can we get where we want to go by ignoring scientific laws in our daily lives.”Musk was having none of it. In a tweet sent at 2:30am, he told her “Ford \u0026amp Tesla are the only 2 American car companies to avoid bankruptcy. I just got home from the factory. You think this is an option. It is not.”On Monday, Huffington responded, telling CNN that “This is not about sleep, or about slowing down, or about asking Elon to chill out under a mango tree … It’s about how we can unlock and sustain our peak performance, and see solutions and opportunities where others can’t.”Everything we know about a healthy working life supports Huffington, says André Spicer, professor of organisational behaviour at the Cass Business School in London. “There’s lots of evidence that having no boundaries between work and life, and allowing work to infest your whole life, can be very damaging for productivity.”Forthcoming research from Spicer’s colleague Hans Frankort, for example, shows that greater work effort – measured in both time and intensity – not only leads to reduced wellbeing (as even Musk may agree), but also worse career outcomes. In fact, intensity, measured by whether people described their job as requiring working at “very high speed” or to “tight deadlines”, was an even stronger predictor of bad outcomes than whether or not employees had to work overtime.Frankort and his co-author Argyro Avgoustaki call for “genuine consideration” of initiatives to reduce exposure to intensive work, but acknowledge that it will “take time to unfold and may encounter resistance”.Silicon Valley has long been one of the leading exporters of the unending work day. The technology sector is, of course, responsible for the tools that people have used, firstly to bring work home, then on holiday and, eventually, everywhere: the networks, laptops and smartphones that mean that leaving the workplace no longer means leaving work.It has also been pioneering an approach to workplace design that encourages a round-the-clock schedule. With free breakfasts, lunches and dinners, on-campus gyms and running tracks and rec rooms filled with games and toys, it is easy to see why some tech workers spend every waking hour somewhere in the office.And, increasingly, their sleeping hours, too. Google and Facebook have both proposed building “self-contained towns” near their main campuses in the Bay Area, slotting hundreds of apartments into the companies’ already sprawling complexes. It is not a huge stretch, really, when you consider the employees who are already taking their home to work, including the Google employee, Brandon, who was revealed, in 2015, to be living in a van in the office’s car park.Other typical Silicon Valley perks take on a similarly dark tinge when they are considered more closely. Policies that allow employees to take unlimited holidays, for instance, sound great. But, according to Sage Business Review, “instead of taking too many days, most committed employees don’t take enough”. The problem is so bad that some places that offer unlimited holidays have had to introduce a second minimum-vacation policy to prevent employee burnout, as staff, unsure of how much time off was the “right” amount, opted to just take none at all. (The prospect of unlimited holidays is one of the more isive offers among British workers, with broadly equal numbers of supporters on each side, according to the intelligence platform Streetbees.)The recent, highly accelerated commitment to work and efficiency can reach levels that even some Silicon Valley types see is A Bit Much. In 2013, for instance, the meal-replacement kit Soylent was launched by software engineer Rob Rhinehart, after he “began to resent the fact that he had to eat food at all”. Rhinehart – with no previous nutritional experience – mixed together a bunch of off-the-shelf nutrients ordered online, and created a 400-calorie slurry that, he hoped, would provide everything he needed to live.Five years on, Soylent no longer advertises itself as a complete replacement for food (“Keep in mind that, while Soylent can replace any meal, it is not intended to replace every meal,” the company tells customers), but it has been popular enough to raise almost $75m (£58m) in funding from venture capitalists and attract competitors in the market such as UK-based Huel).Rhinehart’s dedication to efficiency in other areas of his life hasn’t achieved quite as much take-up, however. In 2015, he wrote about how he gave up a mains connection, instead trying to live entirely from solar cells. A noble goal, achieved through some unconventional methods: “I enjoy doing laundry about as much as doing dishes,” he wrote. “I get my clothing custom-made in China for prices you would not believe and have new ones regularly shipped to me. Shipping is a problem. I wish container ships had nuclear engines but it’s still much more efficient and convenient than retail. Thanks to synthetic fabrics, it takes less water to make my clothes than it would to wash them, and I donate my used garments.”But while they still have their fans, Rhinehart and Musk’s unflinching dedication to work is increasingly viewed as an unhealthy reflection of a past Silicon Valley would rather forget. As a generation of dotcom founders have grown up, and looked back at their careers, they have realised that maybe they didn’t quite get the balance right – and are determined that the next generation doesn’t repeat their mistakes.“When my children were young, I thought what I was doing at work was far more important and urgent than what was going on at home,” Scott Weiss, a serial entrepreneur and early partner at influential venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, wrote in 2015. Later, he said: “I realised that committing to my family required disconnecting from work (eg turning off the computer and phone), and focusing all of my attention on the details of the home. Cooking a great meal. Helping with a science project. Discussing the future with my partner.“I’ve observed that CEOs in their 20s may be fully equipped and knowledgeable enough to handle leading a company, but when their family life begins to expand and demand for their attention increases, they are at a loss as to why things aren’t just falling into place … Still, I’m hopeful.”Driving down Sand Hill Road, the centre of Silicon Valley’s venture capital industry, last weekend, a friend who moved to the area recently remarked on the emptiness of the parking lots. “I thought they were supposed to be at work 247,” he said, “but the cars are all gone by 5pm, and at the weekends.”Spicer agrees that change is afoot. “If you look at the TED talk universe, and what you find in the Harvard Business Review – the kind of things that managers read – there’s a lot of talk now about how to get sleep, how to protect worklife balance, how to make sure that you have some boundaries around work, how to be mindful,” he says. “And all these things are about saying there’s a boundary between work and life. Work shouldn’t be everything for you, and sleeping in the factory isn’t the best thing to do.”But while you can take the engineer out of the workplace, you can’t stop them being an engineer, and there is a risk that worklife balance becomes just another thing to optimise for peak performance.“If you look in the Silicon Valley culture – and this also extends to many corporations,” says Spicer, “executives there are not just obsessed with making their work more productive, but with making their whole life more productive. So they spend a huge amount of time thinking and talking and engaging with these questions about how do you eat in the most efficient way, how do you exercise in the most efficient way, how do you take all these little parts of your life and make them more efficient?”Nonetheless, even that would be an improvement on the status quo. Spicer argues for a few key changes that would help society, and companies, restore a healthy balance (and, yes, improve productivity). One way would be to ensure enforced time off by mandating holidays and banning out-of-hours email use. Another would be the separation of the core intensive, creative work that many office workers struggle to find time for from the more rote administrative tasks that balloon to fill the rest of the working day.For Musk, all the advice being proffered his way may still be too late. As he struggles to bring Tesla’s finances into shape – and fulfil a claim that he had “secured funding” to take the company private at $420 a share – he told the New York Times that, “from a personal pain standpoint, the worst is yet to come”. • This article was amended on 23 August 2018.

Is it worth it?I’ve used Hotmail from the late 90s. All my friends and family use Gmail and I feel like a dinosaur with clunky old Hotmail. Apart from looking like I’ve finally entered the 21st century, what are the benefits of switching from Hotmail to Gmail? And, given everyone I’ve ever known has my Hotmail address, and I have so many old emails in my Hotmail inbox, how on earth could I switch? TI was one of Gmail’s first public users in 2004 and spent a decade recommending Hotmail users to switch. I almost switched back in 2013, but both services have changed a lot since then. I now think you should have both services, with one acting as a backup, though you could also back up to Yahoo.Ideally, you should use your own domain name for your main address. Unfortunately, neither Hotmail nor Gmail provides that feature free, though to some extent you can fake it with an alias. See below ….Today, I can at least guarantee that you are not using Hotmail. Microsoft closed that service years ago, and all Hotmail users are using its current service at Outlook. Technically, Outlook is newer than Gmail, though both services are updated all too frequently.You are, of course, still using a Hotmail address. However, if you switched to using a new Outlook address, you would still be using exactly the same email service. In fact, the simplest way to remove the Hotmail “stigma” would be to add an Outlook address and use both from the same mailbox.To do this, log into Hotmail and then paste https:account.liveAddAssocId into the address bar. (You can get to it via the full Settings page, Email, Sync email etc but it’s complicated.) Create an alias in the form myname@outlook, and set this as your primary email address.You can now use the same inbox to send emails from both your old Hotmail and your new Outlook addresses, and switch between them.If you email everyone from your Outlook address, most people will start using it eventually. However, anything sent to your Hotmail address will still arrive in the same inbox, so it doesn’t really matter. Microsoft has supported Hotmail addresses since it bought the service in 1997, and I don’t expect it will ever stop supporting them.Note that you can also add aliases for any of your old email addresses. This might be handy if you have one you rarely use. Set it to forward all incoming emails to your HotmailOutlook inbox and reply from there.In the beginning, Gmail had several significant advantages over Hotmail. The main one was that it offered 500 times as much storage: 1GB! Gmail also had much better search and spam blocking, and it worked like an app rather than an HTML web page. (HoTMaiL got its name from HTML.) This made Gmail faster and more responsive.Many iterations later, the two services are much closer. I like the fact that you can set up Outlook to work much like Outlook, the email program from Microsoft Office. Outlook still has folders instead of Gmail’s labels. Outlook even has the edge in offering more storage. Both services now provide 15GB. However, Outlook’s email storage is in addition to the free 5GB you get with OneDrive, whereas Gmail shares its 15GB with Google Drive.At the moment, I prefer Gmail. It’s still faster its search and spam-blocking still work better. Most importantly, Gmail still paginates emails, which means I can easily skip from the second page of search results to p500 (emails 24,951-25,000). This is useful when you have 250,000 or more emails . You’ll never scroll back to 2004.If you want to switch from Hotmail to Gmail, or vice versa, then you have to open a new account. The hardest part is finding a usable email address that has not already been taken, though it helps to have an unusual name. In your new Gmail account, go to Configure Inbox in Settings (the cogwheel icon) and click the tab for Accounts and Import. This lets you import all the emails from your old Yahoo, Hotmail, AOL or other address.Google uses an external service called ShuttleCloud to do this. It can take a few days or, in my case, more than a week.Once you have all your emails in Gmail, set the old address to forward incoming emails to your Gmail inbox.In Hotmail, go to the full Settings page, select Email and then Forwarding, and click the radio button next to “Start forwarding”. Next, go to “Forward my emails to:” and enter your new email address. Also tick the box that says “Keep a copy of forwarded messages” so that you can answer emails from either Gmail or Hotmail. In fact, you can add your Gmail address as a Hotmail alias, and add your Hotmail address as a Gmail alias.Now you have a backup of all your emails online, and if you get locked out of one mailbox, you can use the other.Although it’s easy to get Gmail to fetch all your email from another service, this is not without problems. The main one for me was deleting thousands of emails to get inside Gmail’s storage limit. This is also not very practical because you start with a full mailbox.Gmail makes a complete mess of tagging the incoming mail, and happily puts thousands of emails that you have filed away in folders – a good sign that you want to keep them – into the spam box. Not all of them, of course, just enough to be really annoying.You also end up with long labels. First, every email gets tagged with the full email address of the old mailbox, which might be quite long (eg WolfgangAmadeusMozart@Yahoo). Gmail doesn’t do folders or sub-folders, so it adds labels for the old folder names. That doesn’t leave much room for subject lines, so you may want to delete the email address label.If you want to open a new mailbox to provide an online backup, it would be better to use Yahoo Mail, which is now owned by Verizon’s Oath ision. Oath Inc also owns AOL, Tumblr, the Huffington Post, Weblogs and various other things.One solution to the email address problem is to register your own domain. That way you can keep the same address for ever, as long as you remember to keep paying for it. If you owned, for example, mydomain then you could use myname@mydomain as your email address with any email service that will host it. If you don’t like the service, or it shuts down, you can switch to a different service.There are three problems. First, domain names cost money. Second, it requires setting up. Third, Gmail and Outlook won’t host personal domain names as part of their free services. The only one that does, as far as I know, is Zoho. However, that only provides 5GB of storage and is web only: you can’t use a mail client such as Microsoft Outlook or Thunderbird.Microsoft only supports personal domain names with Office 365 business accounts, so your best bet would be to sign up for Google’s G Suite.

I love strolling out early in the morning along Huntington Beach Pier, when the marine layer mist lingers, making everything seem mystical. All you can see are the silhouettes of hundreds of surfers, sitting, waiting for a wave. Watch them as you stroll along the 1,850ft-long pier, then head to Ruby’s, a 1940s-style diner at the end of the pier. Head upstairs and sit by a window looking out to the Pacific, to watch the dolphins and the mist slowly lift, drinking bottomless coffee and eating delicious pancake stacks.Maddy Miller, LondonThe island of Usedom, shared between Germany and Poland in the Baltic Sea, is a fantastic place to cycle. One of our rides covered the five-mile promenade linking the three imperial spa villages of Bansin, Ahlbeck and Heringsdorf. The last of these has an impressive pier (a relatively modern structure of glass and steel, replacing the original wooden one constructed in 1891, which was then the longest in continental Europe). We enjoyed its shell and coral museum, and ate in the space age-looking restaurant at the far end. You can rent holiday apartments on the pier, and Heringsdorf has fine golden sands – a lovely resort.Kevin, Ilkley“The most beautiful pier in England” according to John Betjeman, and England’s only surviving Grade I-listed example, Clevedon pier is a gem. There’s a lovely tea shop at the end and a superb new restaurant that during the day offers delicious picnic-style food to eat on the pier, and at night becomes a classy food venue specialising in fish dishes. The Bristol Channel has the second-highest tidal range in the world, and watching the tide sweep in and out can be spectacular. You can spend a pleasant hour or so reading the moving and often funny memorial plaques. The paddle steamer Waverley is an occasional visitor.Russell Richards, ClevedonAfter two days’ walking around Gdansk in northern Poland weheaded towards the coast on a 15-minute train journey to Sopot. Sopot is home to Europe’s longest wooden pier. It is over 500 metres long and is dotted with classically trained buskers. As you walk out over the sea and turn to look back at the beautiful Polish coastline, you’ll see an art-deco hotel and cafes. Try it at sunset. too.Ollie, LisburnWhat Umhlanga Pier on South Africa’s east coast lacks in length, it more than makes up for in dramatic beauty. The whalebone archway makes for unforgettable photographs as you stroll along it, perhaps to watch sunset over the Indian Ocean. It hides a clever engineering project too: it’s an extension of an underground culvert that helps disperse storm water and has radically improved water quality in this tourist spot near Durban. There’s lots to do in Umhlanga, from watersports to fine dining, but the pier has to be the resort’s most iconic land-cum-water mark, especially when lit up at night.Moira, South WalesThe most unexpected part of my visit to the Netherlands. Extending 400m over a wide strip of golden sand and flanked by beach cafes, a wide promenade and great shopping, the pier is home to a zipline, a ferris wheel and a bungee jump. If you prefer things a little more sedate, there are cafes and shops to browse. Festivals, cultural events, markets, kids’ afternoons, educational activities and musical performances are offered throughout the year. And if you want to make a night of it, stay in one of the beautiful suites, at the end of the pier, where you’re guaranteed a sea view and a great night’s sleep listening to the waves whispering up the beach.Deborah Gilbody, RushdenThis newly refurbished pier is a gem. It looks like any other harbour pier on first inspection, well used by cyclists, strollers, sunbathers and people fishing. Recently it has undergone restoration so that you can now explore its tunnel, hidden within the pier itself, which runs to the lighthouse at the end. Where else do you get to go inside a pier structure? The views from the lighthouse are superb. And there is excellent fish and chips at the entrance to the pier.• Entry to pier is free, tours of tunnel and lighthouse £6pp, rokerpierAnya Chapman, BournemouthReaching 1.8km into Geographe Bay in the far south-west of WA, three hours from Perth and close to the Margaret River wine region, Busselton Jetty is over 150 years old. Built on wooden piles, it was a major trading point for European settlers, servicing over 5,000 vessels during its working life. Now you can walk, or ride the miniature railway, to the underwater observatory at its farthest point. A day ticket is $4, which allows you to walk the jetty, and e, fish or swim from it the miniature railway and observatory cost extra. Better still, the jetty is open 24 hours and is free in the evenings and early mornings.• busseltonjetty.auGraham Sheath, YorkAt weekends, Bangkokians drive 90 minutes south to Hua Hin, not just for the beach and sea but to eat freshly caught fish at what are known as the squid piers. These are wonderfully constructed long wooden jetties over the sea, lined with open-air restaurants serving reasonably priced dishes. I’d recommend La Terrasse, Chao Lay and Mee Karuna.Helen Jackson, LondonThis idyllic pier is freely accessible from the beach and was a favourite fishing spot of Ernest Hemingway.

The crane stopped 20 metres above the ground and the child was helped on to a metal seat on the side of a towering float topped with a crown and a cross. There she perched, a human decoration shining in the August heat, held in place just by a bar around her waist. The crane slowly descended to pick up another child.An hour-and-a-half later, the three-tier float was adorned with about 20 children. Smiling and squinting into the sun, they seemed to have the patience of the saints they were dressed to resemble. Well, most of them did. One of the youngest burst into tears midway up and was swiftly returned to his mother. Speeches and blessings followed, until at last the contraption was ready to be paraded around the town. A group of men grabbeda rope each, the tower lurched and swayed a little then began to move forward.Messina, at the north-eastern tip of Sicily, and Randazzo, just north of Etna, are the only two towns on the island to celebrate the Feast of the Assumption in this way: with a three-tier float covered in blue satin and mirrors, representing the stages of Mary’s ascent to heaven. The tower is the highlight for the children, for whom it is an honour to be chosen, but also for visitors who happen upon this summer spectacle. It is accompanied by marching bands and a carnival atmosphere, with great clouds of helium balloons on sale, throngs of mostly Italian tourists and local residents throwing sweets at the children from their balconies.We heard about the festival in Randazzo only because we were staying nearby and our guesthouse owner recommended it.This year the Randazzo procession – or La Vara as it’s known – was postponed because of storms and giant hailstones. It will take place instead on Saturday 25 August.There were no storms last year, just sunshine and blue skies. Once the Vara was under way, we ran ahead of it and ducked into Il Brillo Parlante on Via Umberto, a deli-bar whose owner let us stand on his doorstep to watch the parade pass by, making sure our son could see the action. With the pound floundering against the euro, Il Brillo’s €1 beers and €2 glasses of wine were a bonus.Our base on the island was Il Tanaceto, a 150-year-old farmhouse with a pool and simple white-washed rooms. Owner Mariolina serves meals cooked by her husband Saro and also dishes out tips on this little-visited corner of the island. After a road and ferry trip from Scilla on the mainland (a picturesque village where former fishermen’s houses sit on the edge of the gin-clear water), it was a treat to tuck into a typical Sicilian dinner of aubergines cooked with pine nuts, raisins and mint – much of the island’s cuisine combines local produce with Arabic influences.While Etna itself is touted as a must-see attraction, most of its visitors seem to be on day trips from resorts such as glitzy Taormina or the port city of Catania, just south of the volcano. The stark foothillsof Europe’s largest volcano remain largely empty. There was another British family at Il Tanaceto – with, luckily for us, children the same age as our son (7) – but otherwise we saw barely another Brit on our forays from the guesthouse.We headed first to the nearest town, the classic hilltop settlement of Castiglione di Sicilia, a 10-minute drive away with its red-roofed houses and medieval churches appearing to tumble down the slopes. There we discovered deli-cum-wine-shop Vitis Vineria Bottega and indulged in our staple holiday diet of meat and cheese platters – these ones beautifully presented with tiny cherry tomatoes and a drizzle of local honey. It’s a great little spot, so good we went twice, although the second visit was unplanned. On leaving the village we drove straight into a forest fire that was encroaching across the road. My partner was all for me driving through it like some sort of stunt woman, but I made an immediate U-turn and so we found ourselves back at Vitis, recovering from the drama.Another visit involved a ramble round a miniature extinct volcano– its crater full of almond trees, its giant neighbour smoking moodily to the south. In every direction were black slopes dotted with trees or vineyards. Thanks to the rich volcanic soil and the contrast in temperature from day to night, Etna wines are renowned not just in Italy, but globally, with winemakers such as Marco de Grazia of Tenuta delle Terre Nere and Giuseppe Russo of Girolamo Russo among the top 100 producers in the world.We paid an all-too-brief visit to Tenute Mannino di Plachi, an agriturismo and wine cellar with views down to the coast, but if I visit again I will book a place on the Etna Wine Train, which stops at Randazzo and includes bus trips to two vineyards (€47, including two tastings).After days of looking at Etna in the distance, we headed there with our son and the other family from the guesthouse. There are several ways to explore the barren, black, rocky landscape – on foot, by mountain bike, by train (see above) or, in winter, on skis – but we chose the most child-friendly: by donkey.Salvatore from Etna Donkey Trekking led our party – the three boys on donkeys, their parents on foot – on a short walk across the lower wooded slopes. Living in the shadow of an active volcano has to be nervewracking but, for all its activity, Salvatore emphasised the calming effects of the mountain, insisting that we close our eyes, turn off our phones and “listen to nature”. As a parent you hope these experiences might fill your child with wonder at the world, but my son was far more excited by the small creatures crafted from lava in the gift shop than he was by volcanology or the breeze in the trees.On our final evening we treated ourselves to dinner at Terra Mia, the best restaurant in the area according toMariolina. We sat on a terrace overlooking a country road where the only traffic was a man on a horse. As Mariolina had promised the food was fantastic: my ragu of Nebrodi black pig, sourced from the nearby Nebrodi national park, Sicily’s largest, was deliciously rich.Etna is often referred to as an island within an island. The people, the climate, the wine and the food all have a distinct character, influenced by the 3,329-metre volcano. It’s a spectacular backdrop for a holiday, but the smaller attractions we stumbled across, from wobbly towers of children to the flavours on our plates, made as much of an impression on us as the giant on the horizon.• Accommodation at Il Tanaceto was provided by Sawdays doubles from €70 B\u0026ampB.

I really do, and that is really it for me.”On Wednesday, Coel used the prestigious speech, which is delivered each year by a prominent TV industry figure, to speak about her experiences in the sector and the way she had been treated by peers and production companies.She explained she had be sexually assaulted after going for drinks the night before a writing deadline.“I had a flashback,” she said. “It turned out I’d been sexually assaulted by strangers. The first people I called after the police, before my own family, were the producers.”Coel said after doing so, the production company staff she had been working with began “teetering back and forth between the line of knowing what normal human empathy is and not knowing what empathy is at all”.The speech, which brought audible gasps from the audience, was Coel trying to create a “transparent space”, she said. “I’m seeking out people who are willing to be transparent and that comes with the risk of losing everything. But I don’t mind because I’d rather have transparency.”Coel also expanded on a story she told in the lecture about an American production company trying to acquire a show she had written for $1m, in a deal that would have seen Coel sign away all copyright.“I’ve no mortgage, no credit card, no real kids, no car, happy with my bicycle money’s nice, but I prefer transparency,” she explained. “My stories are my babies, I wanna look after them, so I asked to reserve a portion of my parental rights my copyright … I used the only power I had and declined.”When asked to explain why she turned down the offer, she said the company’s response to the question of why they would acquire all the copyright wasn’t satisfactory. “The first thing I asked was: ‘Why do you want to take all the copyright?’” she said. “And when the answer is ‘that’s just the way it is’, then I’m out because that doesn’t sound like a good answer to me. It sounds cloudy. I don’t trust that.”When asked if it was hard to turn down the $1m, Coel said: “I just don’t care.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/92b022f3daaa2b2e76e7dca8d94c588c1dd5b198/0_115_3772_2263/master/3772.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a886a2906edc955bf6c5fdb7bd2633e","title":"friday briefing australia gets new pm but hard right is foiled","story":"Scott Morrison replaces Malcolm Turnbull as leader … Alex Salmond sues Scottish government over sexual misconduct claims … and Bond films rankedHello, it’s Warren Murray bringing you another lively Briefing to end the week. The hard right of Australia’s ruling Liberal party has failed to seize the prime ministership, with their candidate, Peter Dutton, beaten by Scott Morrison in a ballot to replace Malcolm Turnbull as leader. We are covering the situation live at time of writing.Morrison is the fifth person to serve as Australia’s prime minister in just over five years. Four of those have been knifed by their own party between general elections. No Australian PM has served a full term since John Howard left office in 2007.Salmond sues Holyrood – Alex Salmond has denied allegations of sexual misconduct during his tenure as first minister of Scotland. The former SNP leader has issued a public rebuttal over a report in the Daily Record that claims made by two staff members relating to incidents in 2013 had been referred to the police. Salmond, 63, says he is taking the Scottish government to court arguing that he was denied the chance to properly challenge the accusations. A spokesman for the Scottish government said it would “defend its position vigorously”. Scotland’s police service had no comment.Another one flips – Donald Trump has a potential new target for his incendiary tweets. He is David Pecker, CEO of National Enquirer, the tabloid magazine involved in hush-money deals with Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal. Pecker, a friend and confidant of Trump, has been granted immunity by prosecutors who have already gotten Michael Cohen’s guilty plea on federal campaign finance violations stemming from the payments. The Enquirer has maintained a cosy relationship with Trump, running smear stories about his rivals while apparently killing off negative stories about him. Pecker talking to prosecutors could pose a serious problem for the president.Russia sows vaccination doubts – Bots and Russian trolls spread misinformation about vaccines online before and during the American presidential election, according to a new study. Scientists at George Washington University, in Washington DC, discovered Russian online campaigns to skew online debate and polarise views about vaccine safety. The findings come as Europe faces one of the largest measles outbreaks in decades, partly attributed to falling vaccination rates. In the first six months of 2018 there were 41,000 cases across the continent, more than in the entirety of 2017. The rate of non-vaccination is climbing in the US.Door slammed on Banks – The Conservatives say they have rejected an application by the Leave.EU co-founder Arron Banks to join the party. Banks was Ukip’s principal financial backer in the Farage era, providing millions in loans and donations in the run up to the 2016 referendum. His finances and his meetings with the Russian officials in the UK have come under scrutiny. The chancellor, Philip Hammond, has warned that leaving the EU without a deal would blow an £80bn hole in the public finances – just hours after the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, optimistically launched 24 “technical notices” advising businesses and consumers how to cope with a hard Brexit. Here, we break down some main points of Theresa May’s no-deal Brexit survival guide.Fears of another Grenfell – Survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire have widened their campaign to have combustible cladding fixed. Nicholas Burton, whose wife, Pily, died as a result of the fire and Edward Daffarn, who escaped from the 16th floor, are helping residents of council tower blocks in Salford that have similar cladding. Residents of the Pendleton estate in Greater Manchester understand the project to replace their cladding and install sprinklers could take up to two years to complete. People in Spruce Court have been told to keep their windows closed until further notice because of problems. There are thought to be 474 residential buildings more than 18 metres tall across England and Wales wrapped in combustible cladding, with only 17 known to have been completely fixed.Tesla killer? – The Russian arms maker Kalashnikov Concern has unveiled an electric car it is calling the CV-1. “This technology will let us stand in the ranks of global electric car producers such as Tesla and be their competitor,” RIA-Novosti said, quoting Kalashnikov.The look was inspired by a Soviet hatchback model developed in the 1970s called “Izh-Kombi”, according to Kalashnikov. The company said it had developed cutting-edge elements for the “electric supercar” including a “revolutionary” inverter and a range of 217 miles (350km) on one charge.With the news of Danny Boyle’s departure as director of the next 007 instalment, Peter Bradshaw ranks the big-screen outings of Britain’s finest, from 1962’s Dr No to 2015’s Spectre.Joe Root has secured the Twenty20 experience he has long been craving and will play for Sydney Thunder in Australia’s Big Bash League in between England’s winter tours to Sri Lanka and the Caribbean. Jonny Bairstow has been offered no guarantees he will resume as England’s Test wicketkeeper once his broken finger has healed after Trevor Bayliss said Jos Buttler, who will play alongside Root in Sydney, could now make a pitch for the job full-time.Poet’s Society, a 20-1 shot ridden by Frankie Dettori, finally secured Mark Johnston’s place as the trainer with most wins in British racing history. Eddie Jones has been urged to hold talks with Danny Cipriani, and judge the fly-half on form rather than his off‑field “mistake” in Jersey, when considering his England future. Serena and Venus Williams could be headed toward their earliest grand slam meeting in 20 years, while Andy Murray could face Juan Martín Del Potro in the third round of the US Open. And Lewis Hamilton intends to close out his attempt to win a fifth Formula One world championship without relinquishing the lead he has over Sebastian Vettel. The attention of world markets will be on Jackson Hole, Wyoming, this weekend as the world’s central bankers gather for the Federal Reserve’s annual symposium. Rising US interest rates and a higher dollar have tightened credit around the world this year so Fed chief Jerome Powell’s speech later today will be pored over for clues about what’s next for borrowing costs.

Photograph: Luke MacGregorBloombergChecks on goods travelling from the United Kingdom to Northern Ireland would be carried out at British ports under fresh ideas to make the so-called backstop easier to agree.The European Union’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said the EU and UK need to “de-dramatise” the backstop, which commits both to ensuring there is no hard Border even if Britain leaves the bloc without a deal.The  understands that, under new ideas, customs and regulatory checks would be located in Britain rather than Northern Ireland.Although scepticism still remains that such an approach could be acceptable to the UK, senior sources said agreement could be reached if there is “political will” in London.“Can we find a way of operating the backstop that is less incendiary politically?” asked one. “You don’t want EU customs officers in Larne and Belfast. Could you do it somewhere else?” It is also suggested that checks could be low-profile in nature and carried out by private contractors. “You could find a way to do it where you don’t have people wearing EU uniforms.” Although committing to the principle of the backstop, the UK has rejected the EU’s interpretation of it.The EU proposal means Northern Ireland remaining in the single market and customs union. British prime minister Theresa May and the DUP, on whose support she relies, say it would split Northern Ireland off from the rest of the UK. The backstop is one of the main stumbling blocks to a withdrawal agreement being reached later this year. There is an acceptance in Dublin that the October deadline for the agreement will now be missed, with November seen as more realistic.Efforts to make the backstop more palatable are currently being “tossed around”, but it is stressed that no specific proposals have been tabled in negotiations. The lack of alternatives coming from the UK has meant the EU is attempting to make its proposal more politically acceptable.“The North could have the best of both worlds,” a senior Government source said. “It could have access to the EU and UK markets. On freedom of travel, that is already there. We are going to maintain the Common Travel Area.”Checks would only be needed on goods travelling to Northern Ireland from the UK, and not the other way around, because of the prospect of them entering the EU single market through the Irish Republic.On Thursday, the British government said it will seek to negotiate a special arrangement for North-South trade to ensure that the Border remains open even in the event of a no-deal Brexit. But trade between the Republic and the rest of the UK could be subject to the same bureaucratic arrangements facing other member states.Brexit secretary Dominic Raab said the British government would maintain its commitment to keeping the Border open regardless of the outcome of Brexit negotiations, but he refused to rule out differentiated arrangements for Irish firms trading with the rest of the UK.“We’re saying very loud and clear that we will not allow anything to disrupt the terms of the Belfast agreement and that we wouldn’t return to any form of hard border,” he said. “I’m not quite sure what it would look like so I’m not going to hypothetically rule it in or out.”Mr Raab was speaking after the publication of 25 technical notices outlining the impact of a no-deal Brexit on different sectors and economic activities. A number of the notices, including those on trade, tariffs and the cross-border movement of medicines, medical devices, blood and human organs, suggest that special arrangements may be required for Northern Ireland.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Doug MillsAPThe proposal by Bill Clinton, US presidential candidate in 1992, to appoint a “peace envoy” for Northern Ireland caused deep concern in British government circles, according to the newly declassified files released today in Belfast under the 2030-year rule.The papers chart the determined efforts of British diplomats and the Northern Ireland secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew to influence leading Irish-American politicians and a key Clinton adviser to drop the idea. In his autobiography, My Life (2004), Clinton refers to a late-night meeting he had in 1992 with “about a hundred Irish activists” including Paul O’Dwyer (the veteran New York politician), Niall O’Dowd (editor of the Irish Voice) and Peter King (a Republican Congressman).“They wanted me to promise to appoint a special representative to push for an end to the violence in Northern Ireland on terms that were fair to the Catholic minority. I had also encouraged to do this by Boston mayor, Ray Flynn . . . I said I would do it and . . . push for an end to discrimination against Northern Ireland’s Catholics . . . Though I knew it would infuriate the British and strain our most important transatlantic alliance, I had become convinced that the US . . . might be able to facilitate a breakthrough.In a telegram to the British embassy in Washington, dated December 11th, 1992, following Clinton’s presidential victory, the British ambassador to Washington, Robin Renwick reported to the Northern secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew that he had raised the matter of president-elect Clinton’s letter to Congressman Bruce Morrison (organiser of Irish-Americans for Clinton) containing the “peace envoy” idea with Clinton’s foreign policy adviser, Sandy Berger. The ambassador informed Mayhew: “I told Berger that Governor Clinton’s letter to Congressman Morrison had caused a lot of concern and produced a very adverse press reaction in Britain”.The Northern Secretary would also have an opportunity to meet Senator Dodd who had engineered a Senate Foreign Relations hearing on Northern Ireland focusing on alleged human rights abuses by the security forces.However, he noted, “We have told him that the leading practitioners of such abuses are the IRA”. Among those who were “less helpful” towards the British case in Congress, he felt “were motivated by constituency groups”.Indeed, he noted, “The Irish-American community is more moderate over Northern Ireland than it was ten years ago. That is largely thanks to the Anglo-Irish Agreement”. Noraid was raising “less and less money” for the IRA cause. However, the FBI were dealing vigorously with weapon purchases. “The large majority of interested Irish-Americans are broadly-speaking Nationalists. John Hume has a lot of influence here,” Renwick wrote.Turning to Mayhew’s forthcoming US tour, the diplomat felt that the Secretary of State should stress (paraphrasing Peter Brooke’s landmark 1990 speech) “that the UK has no selfish interest in Northern Ireland and is prepared to accept any solution acceptable to both communities”.The issue of a Clinton envoy re-emerged during Mayhew’s visit to Boston to meet Irish-American representatives in May 1993. A report from the British embassy in Washington to the foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd records that while a meeting with the Boston mayor, Ray Flynn – a key supporter of Clinton – went well, the mayor informed Mayhew that “President Clinton was still considering the question of a peace envoy”.Clinton’s proactive interest in an Irish settlement continued. In January 1994, he incensed the Major government by granting Sinn Féin leader, Gerry Adams a visa to travel to the United States and that December, he appointed former Senator George Mitchell as an economic envoy to Northern Ireland. Mitchell – effectively Clinton’s envoy – would go on to chair the ground-breaking talks which led to the Belfast Agreement."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3605415.1535031314!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"martin mcguinness s contacts with leading tory politicians in 1992 revealed","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMartin McGuinness  expressed the hope Brooke would give “serious consideration” to his proposal. Photograph:  Ferran Paredes REUTERS On June 15th, 1992 McGuinness wrote to Peter Brooke, the recently replaced Northern Ireland secretary, from his home in Derry’s Bogside, suggesting they should meet. Following his departure from Northern Ireland, Brooke had admitted he would like to have met the Sinn Féin president, Gerry Adams as a matter of history and as a “human reaction” to his “significant role in events”. Later, in 1994, Brooke would describe Adams as “a brave and courageous man”. McGuinness wrote: “Dear Mr Brooke, I found it interesting that in a BBC interview shortly after you left office as Secretary of State you expressed your regret at never having met the Sinn Féin president, Gerry Adams during your time in Stormont.” He said said he appreciated that, even though Brooke had left the NIO, “difficulties may still exist to prevent you undertaking such an initiative. Accepting this, I would still like to explore the possibility that a meeting between yourself and other members of the Conservative Party with representatives of Sinn Féin could take place at some time in the future”. McGuinness’s letter in similar terms to Heath evoked a belated response from the ex-prime minister’s private secretary, Nick Edgar who rang Jonathan Rodell, Brooke’s private secretary, on August 21st, 1992. According to Rodell’s memo, he “rang . . . to ask what I could tell him about a certain Martin McGuinness. I explained that McGuinness was a leading figure in Sinn Féin and a close associate of Gerry Adams that it was widely believed that he was also a central figure in PIRA that he had previously been seen as one of the hard men of the Republican movement, but that recent reports had suggested that his position was softening slightly and that he was interested in recruiting either Mr Brooke or Sir Edward to act as some kind of mediator.’"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3605838.1535054816!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"firms urged to stockpile medicines to prepare for no deal brexit","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Dominic Raab, the British Brexit secretary, is still confident that a deal can be reached with the EU. Photograph: EPALuke MacGregor  POOLThe British government has told pharmaceutical companies to stockpile an extra six weeks supply of medicines to prepare for a no-deal Brexit and warned that businesses will face new bureaucratic hurdles when they import and export goods.Twenty-five technical notices published on Thursday outlined the impact of a no-deal Brexit on a number of sectors and economic activities but Brexit secretary Dominic Raab stressed that London remained confident of reaching an agreement with the EU.“I am still confident that getting a good deal is, by far, the most likely outcome. The vast majority, roughly 80 per cent, of the withdrawal agreement has now been agreed, and we are making further progress on those outstanding separation issues,” he said.The technical notices, the first batch of a total of 84, warned that failure to reach a deal with Brussels would make credit card transactions with the EU more expensive for British consumers. And British citizens living in the EU could be unable to access their UK bank accounts or pensions without an agreement on financial services.The notice on trade tells businesses importing goods from the EU that they will have to register as importers and decide the correct classification and value of their goods and enter it on a customs declaration for the revenue and customs service (HMRC).They should “consider how they will submit import declarations, including whether to engage a customs broker, freight forwarder or logistics provider (businesses that want to do this themselves will need to acquire the appropriate software and secure the necessary authorisations from HMRC). Engaging a customs broker or acquiring the appropriate software and authorisations form HMRC will come at a cost”.Britain would continue to accept medicines tested in EU member states and Mr Raab said he would expect the EU to act with similar “good faith” and flexibility even without a Brexit deal.“Most of the worst-case scenarios, being bandied around, imply that the EU would resist all and any mutual co-operation with the UK. In reality, I find it difficult to imagine that our EU partners would not want to co-operate with us even in that scenario in key areas like this, given the obvious mutual benefits involved,” he said.Labour’s shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer said the technical notices and Mr Raab’s speech showed that the government was not prepared for a no-deal Brexit.“We are eight weeks out from the deadline for reaching an agreement. Ministers should be getting on the job of negotiating a Brexit deal that works for Britain, not publishing vague documents that will convince no one. A no-deal Brexit has never been viable and would represent a complete failure of the Government’s negotiating strategy,” he said.The Confederation of British Industry said the notices exposed Brexiteers’ claims about the ease of leaving the EU on “World Trade Organisation terms” as a fantasy. Frances O’Grady, general secretary of the Trade Union Congress, said they confirmed that a no-deal Brexit was not a credible option.“It would be devastating for working people. Jobs and rights at work would be under threat, and price increases would hit already-struggling families hard. The government cannot allow us to crash out. The prime minister must throw out her red lines, face down the extremists in her party, and negotiate a deal that works for the whole of the UK,” she said.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: Jane BarlowPA Wire With MPs enjoying their recess until early September, the parliamentary estate at Westminster is almost deserted save for teams of construction workers around every corner, patching up the disintegrating palace. Parliament broke up last month in a fever of plotting, much of it focused on the fate of Theresa May after Conservative Brexiteers rejected her Chequers proposal for a soft Brexit.Conservative discontent has continued to simmer through the summer, fuelled by MPs’ contact with their constituency associations, many of which take a hard line on Brexit. But the chatter at Westminster has moved on to Labour in recent days amid speculation that MPs opposed to Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership are preparing to set up a new party.“It’s not imminent, it’s gestating,” one plotter told me this week.After a failed attempt to unseat Corbyn in 2016 and an unexpectedly good result in last year’s general election, many of the Labour leader’s internal critics have given up trying to defeat him. Corbyn’s supporters now control almost all the levers of power within the party and their grip is likely to tighten with elections to the National Executive Council next month.The annual conference in Liverpool in late September will debate rule changes that could make it easier for local activists to deselect sitting MPs who are critical of Corbyn. For many of the 550,000 Labour members, many of whom joined to support Corbyn, such changes are a necessary enhancement of internal party democracy.\u0026nbspBut for MPs unsympathetic to the leadership, the consolidation of the leadership’s power represents an existential threat as they fear they could be deselected before the next election.For the anti-Corbyn plotters who imagine a political future outside Labour, there are two alternative historical models: the Social Democratic Party (SDP) of the 1980s and Emmanuel Macron’s En Marche. Simon Franks, an entrepreneur and philanthropist, has promised to put tens of millions of pounds into United for Change, a Macronist movement with himself as its figurehead.Professional politicians are contemptuous of Franks, not least because of his anti-politics posture, and some Labour plotters dismiss his movement as a vanity project.Those tempted by the SDP model envisage a two-stage process, starting with a group of Labour MPs resigning the whip and sitting independently in the House of Commons. Under the Fixed Term Parliament Act, the next general election is due in 2022, giving the rebels plenty of time to set up a new party structure after resigning the whip.The SDP offers a precedent that is both auspicious and dispiriting, as it surged to above 50 per cent in the polls soon after it was founded and won more than 25 per cent in the 1983 general election, just three points behind Labour. Britain’s first-past-the-post electoral system meant, however, that the SDP-Liberal alliance returned only 23 MPs, compared to Labour’s 209.Roy Jenkins, Shirley Williams and David Owen were high-profile politicians with senior cabinet experience and Bill Rodgers, the last member of the so-called Gang of Four who led the split from Labour, was a formidable figure within Westminster. No comparable figures are among today’s likely rebels.The plotters expect Brexit to be the catalyst for a reshaping of British politics but they are unlikely to move before parliament determines how Britain should leave the EU, if at all. Most of the Labour rebels are enthusiastically pro-European and they hope to recruit some pro-EU Conservatives if Boris Johnson or Jacob Rees-Mogg succeeds May.A new centrist party, whether it is modelled on the SDP or En Marche, can be confident of generous financial support from business and enthusiastic cheer-leading from a media that is almost universally hostile to Corbyn. It may struggle to get off the ground, however, not only because of the unforgiving nature of the electoral system for new parties but because of its policies.Much of business and the media is pining for a revival of the social and economic liberalism that drove both Tony Blair and David Cameron and is shared by some of the most vociferous critics of Brexit. Voters are less enthusiastic, however, and Corbyn’s left social democracy is so popular that the Conservatives have all but given up on opposing it, instead offering their own, weaker version as they quietly abandon austerity and prepare to increase taxes and spending."},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

By keeping celebrities\u0027 embarrassing secrets, the company was able to ingratiate itself with them and ask for favours in return.Read more | Trump\u0026#039s legal woesBut after The Wall Street Journal initially published the first details of McDougal\u0027s catch-and-kill deal, those assets became a liability. Fearful that the documents might be used against American Media, Mr Pecker and the company\u0027s chief content officer, Dylan Howard, removed them from the safe in the weeks before Mr Trump\u0027s inauguration, according to one person directly familiar with the events.It was unclear whether the documents were destroyed or simply were moved to a location known to fewer people.American Media did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Former Enquirer employees who spoke to the AP said that negative stories about Trump were dead on arrival dating back more than a decade when he starred on NBC\u0027s reality show The Apprentice.British women now among top drinkers in the world Who\u0026#39s a pretty boy then?

Now - and for 72 hours only - she was being given that precious chance again. “The thought of brushing her hair, and giving her a bath. Of being able to take her to the park, and feed her, and sleep next to her – it just kills me. It is still so hard to believe,” said an emotional Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe in a statement released by her British husband Richard Ratcliffe.She told how it was “just awesome for Gabriella to have mummy home finally” and how they “can play with her dolls house, and she can show me her toys”. A smiling Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe re-united with her daughter Gabriella, four, as she is temporarily released from prisonPhotographs released by the family show the mother cuddling her daughter, both of smiling and laughing for the cameras while clutching brightly coloured flowers. The flowers had bene picked from the garden by Gabriella in anticipation of her mother’s arrival.Their joy in the photographs is overwhelming but in three days - unless lawyers can successfully argue her case - Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 40, will be back in prison, separated once more from Gabriella.The last time they were pictured together in public before her mother was jailed, Gabriella was a toddler, growing up in London. More than two years on, she’s a little girl now living with her grandparents in Tehran while her mother languishes in the local Evin jail on trumped up spying charges. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who works for the charity Thomson Reuters Foundation, was arrested at Tehran airport after visiting her family on holiday.The prospect of the temporary release, described as a furlough, was first raised by the Iranian authorities a fortnight ago but Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe kept it quiet from her daughter.Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe with her daughter Gabriella, after the charity worker was been given temporary release from prison in Iran for three days“I wasn’t expecting it at all when it was mentioned two weeks ago, “ she said. “I didn’t tell Gabriella or for a long time my mum – so if it didn’t happen I would be the only one to suffer.”“I was so emotional to see my grandmother today. I cried so much. I felt so overwhelmed. My dad’s home is not my home – but it is so much better than prison.“People in the ward were so excited – they sang songs and danced. It felt like this really could be the beginning of the end.”Mr Ratcliffe, an accountant who remains in London unable to visit his wife but who has worked tirelessly for her release, told how the furlough had given them renewed hope. He had been called at 6.45am yesterday by his wife from the car taking her from jail to Damavand, 50 miles to the east where Gabriella and her parents and grandmother were on holiday. When she arrived at Damavand they spoke on Skype.“She was full of joy and excitement. It was the first I’d seen of her in a long time and it was lovely to see her looking much happier,” said Mr Ratcliffe, “Gabriella was busy showing Nazanin her doll’s house. Gabriella said, ‘Mummy, you look older than in the photographs’. She looked thinner but in very good health.”Gabriella re-united with her mother Nazanin Zaghari-RatcliffeMr Ratcliffe, 43, pointedly thanked Jeremy Hunt, the new Foreign secretary, for “all his efforts”. His predecessor Boris Johnson had been forced to apologise for a gaffe last November in which he had suggested Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been in Iran for work, teaching journalism, rather than on a family holiday. The error had threatened to increase her five-year jail term.Mr Hunt tweeted yesterday: “Really good news that Nazanin has been released on furlough, credit to tireless campaigning by husband Richard and her friends. But being in prison AT ALL is gross injustice and she must be PERMANENTLY released for which every effort will continue @FreeNazanin”The run-up to her temporary release had been fraught and had remained in doubt up until the last minute. Prosecutors had visited the family home and inspected it with title deeds used in lieu of $100,000 surety.On Tuesday, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s family were told to go to the jail and await her release in time for Eid, being celebrated in Iran on Wednesday. But her brother waited in vain the promise an empty one.Then in the early hours of yesterday, Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was summoned by prison authorities and told she had ten minutes to pack.She was then searched, taken from her ward and released outside the main gates. She was told she was not allowed to wait outside the jail for her family, dashing from Damavand back to Tehran, and ordered to cross a bridge and remain there for her to be picked up. She borrowed a mobile phone from a stranger to inform her brother she had been set free.Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe’s release is conditional on her not giving any media interviews and not visiting any embassy, but especially the British embassy. She is due to return to jail on Sunday.Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested in April 2016 by members of Iran’s Revolutionary Guards as she and her daughter were due to board a plane back to London, accused of attempting to orchestrate the ‘soft’ overthrow of the regime.Iranian experts suggested the temporary release was useful to Iran at a time when it is facing mounting criticism although it won’t be clear if it paves the way for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe to be allowed back to London.Ali Fathollah-Nejad, an Iran expert and visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Centre, said: “The regime faces a lot of pressure from both inside and outside.

The IPO of a 5 per cent chunk of the company would be the biggest stock market float on record, with an estimated value of $2 trillion (£1.6 trillion), and would be expected to raise up to $100bn for Saudi Arabia. The move has been in the works for several years\u0026nbspbut no date or location has been set\u0026nbspand, on Wednesday, Reuters reported the flotation had been shelved. The news service said Saudi Arabia had pulled the domestic and international listings of Aramco and cited senior industry sources. It also reported advisers working on the deal had been disbanded. The news followed reports this year the chances of the kingdom continuing with plans for an international listing were “diminishing”. However on Thursday, Saudi Arabia’s energy minister\u0026nbspKhalid al-Falih said: “The government remains committed to the initial public offering of Saudi Aramco, in accordance with the appropriate circumstances and appropriate time chosen by the government.”The Saudi government also said, in preparation for the listing, it had “undertaken a number of major preparatory measures, including issuing a new income tax law as it relates to hydrocarbons activities reissuing a long term exclusive concession and appointing a new board of directors, amongst other measures to safeguard its interests and those of the company’s future private shareholders”.Chance of Aramco listing in London or New York ‘may be diminishing’Public listing of Saudi oil company may be delayed until 2019UK Government agrees $2bn loan guarantee for Saudi AramcoLondon, New York and Hong Kong are among potential hosts for the record breaking IPO.

According to reports, international banks JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and HSBC were appointed as global coordinators and boutique investment banks Moelis \u0026amp Co and Evercore were chosen as independent advisors.

She has adopted four Malawian children and was in the country to celebrate the first anniversary of the Mercy James Centre for Pediatric Surgery and Intensive Care, named after one of her adopted daughtersMadonna and Jean Paul Gaultier arrive for the 2018 Met Gala But there is one area where the older woman is suddenly and somewhat unexpectedly thriving – rock music. Madonna celebrates her 60th birthday on Saturday. Kate Bush has just celebrated hers. In fact, they are the spring chickens. Suzi Quatro, 68, and Patti Smith, 71, are not just still rocking, they are still snarling. Cher at 72 pops up with a delightful cameo in the Mamma Mia!\u0026nbspmovie. The queen of soul, Aretha Franklin, is still recording at 76.\u0026nbspWho’d have thought it? Look back to the 1960s and there were precious few women at all in pop music, let alone older ones. In the UK, Sandie Shaw, Dusty Springfield, Marianne Faithfull and a handful of others carried the fight to the mass of male groups (the word boyband had yet to be invented).No one thought then about whether the stars would still be recording and performing in old age. Indeed the concept was unthinkable – for men as well as women, for stars as well as fans. When I put it to Paul McCartney that he must be surprised to be still going, he replied: “I do rub my eyes. I didn’t foresee it. In The Beatles we always said 10 years. But it kept on and kept on and it kept being good and we seemed to be the people who could do it. Now there is a great young generation of people who can also do it, but it tends to be that the people packing them in are the people who have the material, have hits, songs people know, and I think that’s important. I think they have stagecraft, they have an ability with an audience.”There’s no doubting that the likes of Madonna and Kate Bush have stagecraft in spades. Even in an industry that ostensibly prizes youthfulness and a certain amount of athleticism on stage, the female superstars, like the male, are now gliding into pensionable age, with fan bases, voices, charisma and downright sexiness still intact.\u0026nbspThough, when it comes to longevity, the women themselves didn’t always think it would be the case. Joni Mitchell once remarked, all too despondently: “Record companies want the look. And if you’re over 50, however well preserved, you just don’t have the look.”Maybe the look, or audience perception of the look, has changed. No one remotely cared that Kate Bush looked older than they remembered her (quelle surprise) when she made her stage comeback after 35 years in 2014. And tickets were inevitably like gold dust. I was there to note that she sounded the same, and she still exuded charisma and stage presence.She did a staggering run of 22 performances. Two things perhaps attested to the more mature Kate. The show was only part rock concert, it was also part theatre with video and dance, and even the odd comedy sketch starring her son. Also, she gave all her audiences an instruction on her website, which bore witness to the fact that she comes from an earlier generation than today’s performers. She wrote: “I very much want to have contact with you as an audience, not with iPhones, iPads or cameras.”Suzi, 68,\u0026nbspsays she\u0027ll \u0027retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is\u0026nbspsilence\u0027 (Getty)\u0026nbspEarlier this year I witnessed the return to live performance of Annie Lennox, at the age of 63. To raise funds for her charity she did a one-off show which was largely a chat show, interspersed with the odd song at the piano, going through her life and career. The self-deprecating humour was erting: “When I was studying at the Royal Academy of Music, I lived on £3 a week.” Pause. “Scottish people can do that.” Pause. “And we like it.”Perhaps she had stumbled across the format for the older star, a chat show setting interspersed with the odd song. Except, at the end that she knocked everyone there for six with a breathtaking 30 minute performance of Eurythmics and solo hits that showed she retained all her talent. She was the epitome of soul as she belted out Eurythmics anthems, sometimes crawling sensuously across the floor as she did so. The only surprise was that she had (lamentably) eschewed live performance for 10 years.For some female legends, the routine can be tiring. I was at Marianne Faithfull’s most recent London appearance, an intimate show at Ronnie Scott’s jazz club. Plagued by a variety of physical problems over the years, she had a walking stick and performed most of the show sitting down. It was nevertheless a beguiling evening. But notably at one point she actually pleaded with her fans to allow her to retire. “Please let me go,” she said, “I can’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith,” referring to her long-time friend Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones, definitely not one of life’s quitters.Madonna, too, is not one of life’s quitters. Her fitness routine keeps her more than show-ready, even for a show as heavy on breathless choreography as hers. But I think there is another clue to her longevity in what she said to the audience at one of her shows that I attended 15 years ago. Just before her final encore, she said in idiosyncratic style: “When I was a girl I always thought ‘grown-ups can f**k off’. But now I’m 45 years old, I have children of my own, and you know what, grown-ups can still f**k off!”As I say, it was a piece of philosophy delivered in her personal style. But it perhaps partly explains her longevity and continuing appeal. She retains the anarchic spirit she had when she burst on the scene. Female rock stars, just like their male counterparts, and possibly more so, have no intention of growing old gracefully. They haven’t just retained their vocal prowess and stage presence, they have retained the hint of adolescent rebelliousness that has always been an intrinsic part of rock’s appeal. And having met both Madonna and Suzi Quatro, I can attest that in both cases the aggressive, in yer face attitude is not just a stage technique.But rock-star rebelliousness is not the only reason that rock and pop’s biggest female stars go on and on or come back after long absences. Kate Bush was never keen on playing live and before her comeback had only done one tour of the country. But she was persuaded to perform again by her teenage son. As she had a song on one album about watching his clothes go round and round in the washing machine, it was clear that a request from him would, fortunately, carry weight.Victoria Beckham is, of course, far from the vintage of Bush, Madonna and the other older stars. But when the Spice Girls had their reunion tour, it’s interesting that she said the key reason she wanted to do it was that her children had seen Dad play football and knew all about his skills. Now was a chance for them “to see what Mummy did” before they were born.Performing for a global audience is important. But performing for the family clearly also is a factor in keeping the career going.Jonathan Morrish, a long-time senior executive at Sony record company, and now a music industry PR consultant, says: “Women generally live longer than men, so it should come as no surprise that so many as they get older seem to flourish creatively with their music and on stage. None of this is easy. I know from the many artists that I have worked with you need tenacity. So perhaps it’s the staying power they had to show at the beginning of their careers, perhaps a savvy emotional intelligence –\u0026nbspwhatever it is, I admire and welcome it. And applaud them.”\u0026nbspAnd even for those female rock and pop stars who have decided to call it a day, a new avenue has opened up: the stage musical. Right now in London, audiences can see Tina Turner on stage at one theatre, and The Supremes and all the other Motown stars at another. Or at least, one can enjoy their music and life stories, delivered by lookalikes and sound-alikes. It’s possible not just to go on into old age, but literally forever.Faithfull pleaded with a crowd at Ronnie Scotts: \u0027Please let me go. I\u0026nbspcan’t go on for ever. I’m not Keith\u0027 (Alamy)Meanwhile, there is a core of\u0026nbsp 60- and 70- something female rock stars, who thankfully show no signs of even thinking about stopping and relying on musicals to seal their immortality.No one puts it better than Suzi Quatro, celebrating 54 years in the business, who states: “I will retire when I go on stage, shake my ass and there is silence.”David Lister is the former arts editor of The IndependentEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/10/16/south-africa-school.jpg","title":"south africa corruption president ramaphosa mabuza zuma anc","story":"Created with Sketch.The ruling African National Congress pledges education and opportunity\u0026nbspfor black people\u0026nbsp– but embezzlement in the\u0026nbspdeputy president’s province has left schools so decrepit that children plunge to their death in toiletsClick to followThe IndependentSchool at Orange Farm, near Soweto: one of the ANC’s policies is to improve education for black South African childrenZiyanda\u0026nbspNkosi hated going to the bathroom at school. The pit toilets were so dark, dirty and crumbling. Many children were so afraid of them that they simply relieved themselves in the schoolyard to avoid the ordeal.But as she played with her best friend during recess, the little girl, a six-year-old first-grader, really had to go. She stepped warily inside the closet-like latrine.Even with the gentle pressure of her tiny frame, the floor caved in. Ziyanda flailed wildly, clinging to the edges of the hole, frantically trying to keep herself from falling in and drowning in the fetid pool below.“Mommy! Mommy!” she screamed, managing to hold on long enough for an older boy to run in and save her.Hundreds of parents, enraged that their warnings about the dilapidated school had been ignored for years, burst into protest a couple of days later, upending their quiet rural town for two weeks last August. They burned tires, blocked roads and demanded justice from the provincial government led by David Mabuza, a former maths teacher who had become one of the most powerful figures in the African National Congress (ANC) and was positioning himself to become South Africa’s deputy president.One of the party’s historic promises had been to provide a good education for black people, who had been deliberately denied the opportunity under apartheid. ANC leaders like Nelson Mandela often spoke about freeing black South Africans through school\u0026nbspand Mabuza, whose first big post in the province was education minister, got his political start by promising just that.But under the ANC the education system has been a\u0026nbspshambles, so gutted by corruption that even party officials are dismayed at how little students are learning, in schools so decrepit that children have plunged to their deaths in pit toilets.The rage in Ziyanda’s town grew so intense that protesters hurled stones at a local ANC leader, who narrowly escaped by whipping out his handgun and shooting randomly into the crowd, wounding two children and roiling the community all the more.Mabuza never came to the school or met with the parents –\u0026nbspand for good reason, local officials contend. The dangerous conditions were a clear reflection of his control over the province, where millions of dollars for education have disappeared into a vortex of suspicious spending, shoddy public construction and brazen corruption to fuel his political ambitions, according to government records and officials in his party.But the uprising and allegations against Mabuza did not crimp his political rise. To the contrary, only a few months later, as the ANC tried to quash national outrage over misrule by its leaders, Mabuza scored his biggest triumph by far. He was picked to become second-in-command of the entire ANC, launching him into an even more prominent post\u0026nbspas South Africa’s deputy president, second only to the nation’s leader.Mabuza may seem an odd choice, especially at a time when the ANC is desperate to purge its reputation for graft and restore its image as the rightful heir to Mandela’s legacy. After all, Mabuza’s rural province, Mpumalanga, is fairly small, has little economic clout and is widely regarded as one of the country’s most corrupt.But that is the vexing secret behind Mabuza’s spectacular climb, current and former ANC officials say: he siphoned off money from schools and other public services to buy loyalty and amass enormous power, making him impossible to ignore on the national stage and putting him in position to shape South Africa for years to come.Mabuza (second right) (AFPGetty)“He didn’t become what he is now because of his political capability,” says\u0026nbspFish Mahlalela, a senior ANC figure in the province and a national lawmaker.“No, no, it was out of money and\u0026nbspmanipulation,” he adds. “Nothing else.”Perhaps more than any other member of South Africa’s new government, Mabuza undercuts the promise of a “new dawn” in the country after the removal of President Jacob Zuma this year.Besieged by scandals that have hacked away at the ANC’s legitimacy and electoral prospects, the party installed a new president, Cyril Ramaphosa, in February. From the start, he pledged to root out corruption and finally deliver on the promise of a just South Africa for all of its citizens.But to seal his new post, Ramaphosa first had to secure the backing of Mabuza, 57, who built such a formidable political machine that he became kingmaker in the back-room negotiations to choose South Africa’s new president. After campaigning for a rival, Mabuza abruptly switched sides and joined forces with Ramaphosa, helping the two emerge from a pivotal party conference last December as the country’s undisputed leaders.Then, to the surprise of many in his province, Mabuza gave a speech just weeks after being sworn in as deputy president this year, lamenting the poor state of the schools and the “tragedies that take away the innocence of our children”. He spoke movingly of a kindergartner electrocuted at school. Of a toddler who drowned after falling into a broken pit latrine. And of a five-year-old boy whose body was discovered by his mother at the bottom of another dilapidated pit, his hand sticking out of a pool of faeces.Such deplorable conditions were all too common, he noted, symbolising the failure to provide black South Africans with a decent chance at life.“Where is our care?” Mabuza said in the speech. “What has gone wrong with our nation?”Yet under Mabuza’s leadership, millions of dollars for schools in his province have been misspent year after year, according to the national government. His province routinely spent less on poor students than required\u0026nbspand school construction projects have been riddled with inflated costs, government records show.Nearly a quarter of the primary schools in Mabuza’s province still have only dilapidated pit toilets, despite ample government funds to fix them. And during his tenure, his province was caught fabricating the passing rates on the annual national exam, enabling him to claim big leaps forward that never happened.The schools Mabuza did champion provided an easy way to funnel large amounts of money into politics, according to ANC officials, high-ranking defectors and anti-corruption groups. He pushed to build big boarding schools whose costs tripled\u0026nbspfor unexplained reasons\u0026nbspto $30m (£23m) each, alarming education experts. Some construction was so shoddy that roofs sprouted leaks soon after being finished, toilets barely worked, students lacked water, retaining walls collapsed and dormitories were missing doors, according to a provincial report.Over the years, Mabuza’s province also became known as one of South Africa’s most dangerous. Nearly 20 politicians, most from inside the ANC, were assassinated in the past two decades, some after exposing graft in public works projects.All the while\u0026nbspMabuza’s political career flourished. He attracted legions of new ANC members with government contracts, cash handouts and even KFC meals, according to current and former party officials.His sweeping recruitment drive turned his relatively insignificant province into the ANC’s second biggest voting bloc. Under the party’s delegate system, his territory became more influential than even Gauteng, the province that includes Johannesburg and Pretoria\u0026nbspwith a population three times the size and an economy nearly five times as big.Now, critics contend, Mabuza’s role as the country’s second most powerful politician casts doubt on the legitimacy of the new government and its assertions that the ANC is turning the page on corruption.Under the ANC, Mandela’s once-heralded liberation movement, tens of billions of dollars meant to lift poor black South Africans have been stolen by party leaders. Strong institutions like the tax agency have been hollowed out by party officials bent on shielding their illicit activities.But the nation’s poor schools are perhaps the ANC’s greatest betrayal of the dreams of black South Africans – some of whom have turned to burning down such institutions in protest.Mabuza, who declined to be interviewed, built his political career on the schools. Unlike other, more celebrated anti-apartheid leaders, he did not go into exile he was not imprisoned on the infamous Robben Island. Instead, he fought for the right of black South Africans to receive an equal education, a call he echoed in his recent speech.As many South Africans pin their hopes on Ramaphosa’s pledge for a fresh start, analysts say that much of the country is looking past an unpleasant truth: the new president owes his victory in part to corruption, and much of his administration’s future – as well as the country’s – rests in the hands of Mabuza.“If there is any powerful person whom Ramaphosa’s presidency actually relies on, it is Mabuza,” says\u0026nbspRalph Mathekga, the author of Ramaphosa’s Turn: Can Cyril Save South Africa?“We are being reluctant as a nation to face the reality of Mabuza,” he adds. “If Ramaphosa gets hit by a bus, Mabuza is going to be the president.”Scandal from the startThe numbers just didn’t add up, even at the beginning.After apartheid ended in 1994, Mabuza got his first big break: he became Mpumalanga’s education minister, a chance to shape the schools and generations of students attending them.He had the perfect resume. The son of farmers, Mabuza grew up here in the province, walking miles from his village to the only primary school in a nearby town. Though he often had no shoes, he always tucked in his shirt and buttoned it up to the neck, recalls\u0026nbspReginah Mhaule, a childhood peer.“He was never late,” says\u0026nbspMhaule, a longtime ally who recently became one of South Africa’s two deputy foreign ministers.A bright student, Mabuza ultimately took one of the few jobs available to black South Africans back then. He taught maths at the local high school and later became a founding leader of a teachers’ association.Poor schooling was a major spark in the anti-apartheid movement, most notably in Soweto in 1976, when thousands of students protested the introduction of Afrikaans as the language of instruction. In Mabuza’s province, teachers and students began organising against white minority rule in the early 1980s.The teachers were at the centre\u0026nbspof the movement, says\u0026nbspSandile Sukati, a teacher who recruited Mabuza into the main student organisation. Mabuza quickly stood out, he says, travelling far and wide to build ties among anti-apartheid groups.Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)Museum of London  Henry GrantMuseum of London  Henry GrantA United Nations photograph by Kay MuldoonCourtesy of the News LineCourtesy of the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern AfricaSATIS (Southern Africa - the Imprisoned Society)“He was a leader in his own right,” Sukati says.But after apartheid ended, Mabuza quickly ran into trouble, leading to the province’s first big scandal of the democratic era.\u0026nbspIn 1997, three years into his tenure as education minister, the schools were performing poorly, especially on the national obsession: the annual matriculation exams that determine whether students graduate from high school. The passing rate in his province was 46 per cent that year, slightly below the national average.Mabuza was feeling the pressure, particularly as powerful ANC leaders returned from exile, often with military credentials that overshadowed his own, several current and former ANC officials say.Sukati, who worked under Mabuza at the education department, recalls Mabuza\u0026nbsptelling some of the teachers: “I am in a tight situation.”\u0026nbspThe next year brought a stunning improvement. The passing rate inexplicably jumped to 72 per cent – an incredible turnaround that catapulted Mpumalanga to second place\u0026nbspamong the nation’s nine provinces.“I was suspicious,” says\u0026nbspSukati, who is now a senior education official. “It couldn’t just happen like that.”A whistleblower exposed the cheating a few weeks later. The real passing rate, authorities announced, was under 53 per cent. Moreover, the doctoring had taken place inside Mabuza’s residence, where he met with a small circle of bureaucrats, some of whom were later fired.An investigation was never completed. Mabuza never admitted wrongdoing or suffered any significant consequences. Dropped as education minister, he was named head of housing instead.Ever since, Mabuza’s career has been remembered for that scandal, one that helped establish the kind of culture of impunity in his province that has tarnished the ANC across South Africa..“I think\u0026nbspthe man, he had to be charged, but unfortunately I don’t know what went wrong,” says\u0026nbspRonnie Malomane, an ANC official who was taught maths by Mabuza in the early 1980s. “They were just giving him position after position.”Nationally, Mabuza’s standing kept rising, propelled by his success at attracting new party members. In 2009, Zuma appointed him premier of all of Mpumalanga province.But Mabuza raised more red flags, stripping some of the decision-making power over government projects from local officials and concentrating it in his own office. He justified the move – called the “Rapid Implementation Unit” – as a way to act quickly. Others had a different explanation.“That’s how he managed to loot,” says\u0026nbspCollen Sedibe, a former ANC leader who grew up on the same street as Mabuza and worked under him in the provincial housing department.Treasury officials in the province say they are now investigating the irregular expenditures “incurred through the contracts arranged centrally by the Office of the Premier”.But parents, officials and educators had warned about the damage from corruption and neglect for years, pointing to the painfully overcrowded classrooms and decaying, apartheid-era schools.‘They wanted to kill me’It took four days of rage before the local ANC councillor showed up.The councillor, Justice Twelve Siboza, explained that he had been busy the week Ziyanda fell into the toilet, tending to another corner of his ward. Other activities had also drawn his attention: he is a gospel singer with his own radio show, so he crisscrosses the region to perform at weddings and funerals.By the time he got to Ziyanda’s school, hundreds of parents had closed off the unpaved roads, furious that their grievances had been met with near silence from the ANC’s leaders.Siboza made sure to bring a gun. Politics is dangerous in South Africa, sometimes lethal, he says.The ANC has a grip on the area around the school because most residents, aside from the lucky few working at the sugar cane plant, are poor and rely on the party for government jobs, contracts or monthly welfare grants.It is an area Mabuza knows well. He began his ascent inside the ANC as the head of this part of the province. It was once part of a homeland set aside for black people by the apartheid government. To this day, several ANC officials say, Mabuza has kept a hold on it through powerful proxies.Some see a deep cynicism behind the conditions in the schools. When black South Africans become educated and move into the middle class, their loyalty to the party tends to wane, recent elections have shown. So by perpetuating a culture of dependence, critics contend, the ANC ensures its dominance.But Mhaule, the childhood peer of Mabuza, rejects\u0026nbspany suggestion that the ANC had failed to prioritise education.Officials like Mhaule say the rising pass rate on the national high school exam provides clear evidence of progress. But the figures can be misleading. The number of students taking the exam has declined in the past two years. Weaker students who would drag down the rate are being held back, education experts say.About 600 protesters gathered at the school that cold Friday morning when Siboza, the local ANC councillor, arrived with a police escort. As he moved to talk to the parents, demonstrators showered him with rocks.“They wanted to kill me,” the councillor says.Siboza made a run for it, reaching for the hip holster under his brown overcoat. He took out his gun – firing three times and hitting two teenagers, a girl and a boy.Agreement Mashele, the school board chairman, was shocked. “This man is a church member,” he says.A few days later, the ANC councillor visited the children he had wounded.“The councillor said he was very sorry,” says\u0026nbspthe girl, Siphesihle Ngobeni, whose left leg was grazed by a bullet. The councillor pleaded with her not to press charges and gave her about $15, she says. She used the money to buy sanitary pads.The boy’s injury was more severe. His father, Petros Thobela, who had gone to the same primary school and did not have a job, accepted a similar apology and compensation of, according to the councillor, about $150.The boy’s mother, Nobuhle Ndlovu, who does odd jobs, deplores\u0026nbspthe state of education.“They promise,” she says, “and they just disappear.”Still, she would remain loyal to the governing party.“Yes, of course, I vote ANC,” she says. “It’s our freedom.”‘He always had money in his house’The protests spilled into September, but the country’s attention was fixed on another battle: the national push to replace Zuma as South Africa’s president.The all-important ANC party election was only a few months away, and officials in Mabuza’s province were bracing to see whether his years of hard work had paid off.In early October, the ANC released the delegate breakdown, with good news for Mabuza: his previously low-ranking province was now the ANC’s second most powerful.Mabuza owed his outsize influence to a single feat. In the past decade, ANC membership in his province had skyrocketed nearly 190 per cent, eclipsing the national increase of less than 60 per cent. No other province came close to matching Mpumalanga’s explosive growth.But Mabuza’s numbers were as cooked as his high school passing rates, current and former ANC officials contend.In South Africa, taxes are collected by the national government, which distributes the money to provinces. The provinces then use the money – with little oversight from above.Treasury officials in Mpumalanga say that “irregular expenditures” more than doubled in the previous two budget years, particularly in education, housing and health.Wages account for most of the education and health budgets. So money is usually siphoned off by politicians and business allies through contracts for services or construction, ANC officials say. When costs are suspiciously high, schools are poorly built or facilities are badly maintained, they say, it is often a warning that money is being skimmed, at the students’ expense.Thousands in Israel protest draft law that would ‘exclude’ ArabsGrenfell victims were subject to ‘social apartheid’, says Diane AbbottSouth Africa is the most unequal country in the world, says World BankMandela’s letters chart his heartbreaking struggle from behind barsAs premier, Mabuza promoted the construction of big boarding schools, or mega-schools, in farm areas to improve rural education. Since 2012, the province has completed five, with two more in the pipeline.For reasons that have not been explained, the price of each school has ballooned from $11m to around $30m.Asked whether Mabuza wanted the mega-schools to facilitate the theft of public funds, Mhaule, his former education minister, laughs\u0026nbspand says:\u0026nbsp“I don’t know.”But other officials say the mega-schools were overpriced projects to reward Mabuza’s allies and finance his ANC membership drive.Mabuza\u0026nbspwas sworn in as deputy president in February. “His passion,” reads his official biography, “still remains in education.”Minutes after the swearing-in, he faced questions about corruption and political killings in his province. “There’s nothing to set straight,” he told the national public broadcaster.“I’m here to serve South Africans,” he added. “Let’s give this government a chance.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/06/08/23/arron-banks.jpg","title":"arron banks joins conservative party vote brexit leadership former ukip donor","story":"Created with Sketch.Mr Banks claims to have received a confirmation email welcoming him to the ToriesClick to followIndy PoliticsMultimillionaire former Ukip donor Arron Banks’ attempt to join the Conservative Party in order to vote in a future leadership contest has been rejected.Te insurance magnate\u0026nbspwho also donated to the Vote Leave referendum campaign in 2016, claimed through his Leave.EU campaign group he had joined the party as he urged his supporters to follow his lead.But a spokesperson for the Tory party said his application alongside his spin-doctor, Andy Wigmore, had not been approved.Leave EU boss walks out of select committee during questioningBanks admits giving Trump campaign phone number to Russian governmentBrexit donor Arron Banks \u0027had meetings with Russian officials\u0027 Brexit donor Arron Banks refuses to appear before fake news inquirySpeaking to the Westmonster news website, Mr Banks said he believed the “battle for Brexit” is now within the Tory ranks and an “inevitable” leadership election.Over 1.4m people follow Leave.EU online and we have urged them to join up and have their say,” he said.

So we’ve not called for a vote on the deal. We’ve called for a vote in parliament on the deal.“But I accept the proposition that if it’s voted down parliament then decides what happens next. And in those circumstances in my experience of the last few years, keep your options on the table, not off the table.”Party officials said afterwards that Sir Keir’s words did not represent a change in Labour’s official position, but insiders accepted that there is an implication within it that parliament might chose to back a new Brexit referendum.One told The Independent: “There’s agreement across the shadow cabinet that there has to be a process for parliament to decide what happens if the deal is voted down or if we’re faced with no deal.“The options are open. That’s the whole meaning of it being a ‘meaningful vote’.”Labour MPs backing the People’s Vote campaign for a new referendum said Sir Keir’s comments looked like part of a slow shift in the party’s broader stance.Chuka Umunna told The Independent: “It’s extremely encouraging to hear what feels like a change in tone from the shadow secretary of state for Brexit.“Labour members, supporters and voters will certainly be pleased to see the party inching towards committing in full to a people’s vote.”Meanwhile ex-shadow chancellor Chris Leslie said: “I’m increasingly confident that we are seeing the Labour Party move towards giving the public a final say.“There’s still a long way to go, party conference will be crucial, let’s hope Keir has the ear of the leader’s office on this.”People\u0027s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People\u0027s Vote demonstration against Brexit Gina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People\u0027s Vote March \u0027Two months too young to decide on my future\u0027A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowds Crowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain\u0027s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar Square Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 marchEven if Ms May manages to hammer out a deal with the EU, the likelihood of parliament blocking it appears fairly high, with her baseline plans unlikely to meet Labour’s established tests and Tory Brexiteers in open opposition – bringing the question of what happens if the prime minister’s deal fails into sharp focus.Mr Corbyn would prefer a new election over a referendum, bringing with it the chance of broader power, but leader’s office insiders are said to be increasingly doubtful about the chances of Tory MPs allowing one to happen before 2022.Brexit campaigner Banks claims he has joined the ConservativesNo-deal Brexit could disrupt delivery of foreign sperm to BritainI’ve written my own Brexit impact paper.

Id wee in a bowl and pour it on the carpet but this made things worse as children who wet themselves are often accused of being possessed.Mardoche says he became withdrawn and felt he had no-one as his father was in the DRC.My relatives were clever. Although I was threatened, I wasnt beaten up. They were careful not to get caught.They took me to several pastors and advised me that the situation with my possession was so serious I would need to be sent back to the DRC.Thankfully, his school contacted social services. He ended up spending three months in a psychiatric unit as he became suicidal, before being placed in foster care.He is one of the lucky ones - if hed returned to the DRC it is likely he would have died due to the brutal exorcisms performed there.There, children are sliced by razor blades and knives in order to cut out the witchcraft, and have chilli pepper rubbed in their eyes.Dr Hoskins says: I also saw a little girl who was emaciated due to being starved for days - shed also not been given any water despite the boiling heat. She was almost at deaths door.Sometimes, children are pushed to the brink of death during exorcisms.Occasionally the perpetrators cross the line and end up killing the children in the process.This is what happened to 15-year-old Kristy Bamu, who was found dead in a bathtub in a council flat in East London on Christmas Day 2010.He had been staying with his sister Magalie Bamu and her boyfriend Eric Bakubi, when he was accused of bringing kindoki into their home.Kristy sustained 130 separate injuries after being attacked with an armoury of weapons - including metal bars and ceramic floor tiles smashed over his head - over a three-day period of exorcisms.He died due to drowning after being submerged in the bath towards the end of the ceremony.While in 2001, the torso of a young African boy, known only as Adam was found floating in the River Thames. He is believed to have been the victim of a brutal exorcism ritual.And Dr Hoskins says there could be many more cases of children that have been murdered that have gone unreported.Nobody is really sure how many cases there really are - of this kind of abuse and also children dying from it - because nobody wants to tackle it, he says.If you talk to anyone from these communities, they will say that pastors are pushing witchcraft beliefs on families.But because it is a belief system theres a perpetual fear [from the authorities] of stepping on peoples toes and causing offence.Half of UK police forces dont even record incidents and many local authorities are also unable to provide figures.We havent got past this political correctness when dealing with these case, adds Dr Hoskins.Because it is related to a belief system you hear from the Met police officers or even social services that they arent here to tackle beliefs, so nothing is done to stop it.But there needs to be a change because these belief systems tip over into abuse.Dr Hoskins says the witchcraft belief has roots in fundamentalist Christianity - where the words of the Bible are taken literally - and with traditional West and Central African superstitions beliefs.Theres a passage in the Bible that says sometimes a demon will be cast out and find seven more powerful ones, so even children that undergo exorcisms can be dragged through the whole system again a few months down the line, he says.But why is it children that are targeted?It is scapegoating, plain and simple, explains Dr Hoskins. Years ago, it was older women - the old crones who were branded witches.Many of these African countries have seen major problems in the last few years, such as civil war, economic deprivation and corruption - and when things go wrong in peoples lives they will blame a weaker party.Theres overpopulation too - Ive had people in these countries say to me that they cant afford to keep their children so they will force the idea of witchcraft on them in order to drive them out on the streets.Many children dont recover from the trauma of their abuse. Ive had them tell me their lives have been destroyed, says Dr Hoskins.Mardoche is one of the lucky ones: taken out of his abusive home, he built up his confidence through continuing to play football and now is a motivational speaker.He also works with various organisations to help teach people to spot the signs of children being accused of kindoki, and a film about his life, called Branded, will be released this autumn.However, he still lives with the effects of his experience.I find it difficult to get close to, and trust, other people, he admits. And at the time, I wanted to die. When youre constantly told youre evil, that youre to blame for your mothers death you start to believe it. Its not something that is easy to get over.My heart sinks every time I hear of another child being accused of being a witch, adds Dr Hoskins.The Government needs to take action to protect these young people and outlaw this belief system - we need criminal sentences for these pastors as what they are doing is abuse.We take a hard stance on terrorism in the name of religion, so there is no reason for us not to outlaw this. It leaves children mentally, emotionally and physically scarred for life.If you are affected by any of the issues raised in this article, please call the NSPCC on 0808 800 5000.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As soon as my hands were free I hit him with my tray.Deaths do happen though. One nasty incident involved an elderly guy who was staying for the TT motorbike race.His intestines had exploded and he haemorrhaged out in the room.The stench was awful - you could smell it along the corridor.The room was like a scene from a Quentin Tarrantino film with blood on the carpet, the bed and up the walls.You just have to clean it up as quickly as possible so the room is ready to rent again.Hotel receptionist Anna Thistlethwaite, 31 is a married mum of one who lives in Cambridge.She says: I have worked in the hotel industry for three years as front of house at a 4-star hotel in Hertfordshire.A common occurrence at weddings is for couples to go to their rooms - then when the bride passes out drunk the  groom goes and has sex with someone else.He’ll even go back and check his new wife is still asleep before returning to the woman in the other room. It happens a lot.We catch the blokes out because they always mix up the key cards.We make them wait at reception for as long as possible to reissue them with one for their room.One guest would check in every Friday night, pay for his room in cash and refuse to give any contact details.Forty-five minutes later a woman would literally run across the lobby and head towards his room.It was obvious he was cheating on his wife but we couldn’t work out if she was a prostitute or his mistress.We routinely see businessmen come in with different women during conference weeks.The wife normally joins them at the end none the wiser to what he has been up to.We have to keep a straight face and remember that the customer is always right.Josh Tully, 27, is general manager of La Vue France, boutique hotel \u0026amp wedding venue in southwest France. He says:I used to work for an upscale UK establishment which was the destination for the rich and famous.One A-list Hollywood star flew in to give the bride away at her wedding.It was raining lightly and he refused to walk outside in case he ruined his Louis Vuitton suede loafers so we had to ensure there was a buggy available at all times to take him to and from the church and hotel.Anyone would have thought he was the bride.Another time, a guest who had reserved in advance asked us to ensure we had a £500 bottle of vintage Krug champagne on ice for his arrival.Our supplier let us down on the morning – so we improvised.We presented him with a bottle of the £20 house champagne and he was none the wiser.He thanked us for going to the trouble of getting it in and even explained how you could taste the difference.We kept a straight face and took the compliment.Other famous guests included a boy band who stayed to write songs.One of them had a fish only diet - each meal was fish guts, fish oil and fish blood whizzed up in a blender - It smelled disgusting.Yet we all had to go along with it and tell him how amazing he looked as a result of knocking back the revolting shots.One thing Ive learned is that people always seem to get frisky when they go away for the weekend.Once I walked into the games room only to find a couple having sex under the snooker table.They saw me but made the decision to carry on, so I left them to it.They just nodded at me when they eventually walked out.Maria Andrews, 29, lives in Northolt and is a married mum-of-one.She says:I worked in a 4-star hotel for the last five years. Nothing anyone does surprises me any more. I have delivered room service to a man who opened the door completely naked.I walked in and put the tray of two beers and some nibbles on the table. He wandered towards me. I didnt notice he was starker’s until I asked him to sign the bill.As I stood up his willy came into view. It was enormous - I can only assume he wanted to show it off.His wife was in bathtub next door also naked.Neither of them were drunk but - they were just blatant exhibitionists.Then there was the time a woman came downstairs in the middle of the night completely naked.She said shes got locked out after mistaking her room door for bathroom one.We didn’t believe a word of it. We suspect she got caught with someone she shouldn’t have been with and had to scarper.She had to stand at reception starkers while we ran her identity through the system.She had a great body which was just as well as the entire hotel staff saw the security footage of her streaking along the corridors.People behave badly from the moment they check in. I would never go back to the hotel industry. We were treated like sh*t.One man came the hotel to use the wifi. When we asked him to leave, he started threatening one of my colleagues with a glass bottle. I jumped on him and pinned him to the floor. It was just as well the police arrived because he was starting to choke.Guests also always assume if it isn’t nailed down then they can pinch it.After one wedding I clocked a woman trying to walk out with several 3-foot high centrepiece hidden under her coat.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is whether the PM herself will seize the initiative and signal her own plan to jump before she is pushed.The undeclared contest has transformed Britain’s negotiating stance — from Theresa May’s meek, slow-motion surrender to a strident demand for a decent, honourable settlement. The good news is that while MPs have been away on holiday, Brussels has begun to blink.At long last it has dawned on our EU neighbours that they have more to lose from a messy Brexit than we do.Forfeiting the UK’s £40billion ransom payment — plus our annual £12billion contribution — would instantly cripple the EU expansionary budget plans and plunge poorer nations such as Greece into crisis.Car and pharmaceutical giants, not to mention French farmers, who export vast stocks to the UK, would be plunged into crisis. Cooperation on crime, security and defence would be at risk. Governments across Europe are now piling pressure on Brussels to see sense.Tory leadership wannabes have sniffed the way the wind is blowing.The Tories won’t pick another Remainer as party leader. Nor does this Government have a prayer at the next election unless it can see off Nigel Farage and his Ukip insurgents with a deal that satisfies the 52 per cent who voted Leave.This explains a sudden enthusiasm at the top for stating the blindingly obvious: Britain will survive a clean Brexit, while an obstructive Brussels will be diminished.After two years of being bossed around by EU bully Michel Barnier, senior Cabinet ministers are coming out as born-again Eurosceptics. Foreign Secretary and repentant Remainer Jeremy Hunt admits Britain will experience some turbulence, but says the EU will be damaged “for a generation”.His warning is echoed by Brexit supremo Dominic Raab, who has rubbished “Project Fear” stories about food and medicine shortages.While loyally insisting a deal is “still the most likely outcome”, Mr Raab insists Britain will cope with the alternative.Hunt and Raab are now openly jockeying for the top job — along with Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson, Treasury chief Liz Truss and a host of others.Significantly, Michael Gove seems out of the race after endorsing Mrs May’s Chequers sellout. So where does this leave Boris Johnson? If tens of thousands of grass- roots Tory supporters have anything to do with it, he would be way out in front. As things stand, they don’t.BoJo is out of office and fighting confected outrage over Muslim face masks. Enemies such as the priestly Dominic Grieve threaten to quit the party if he is elected.Under present rules, Boris needs enough support from fellow MPs to be one of the two candidates submitted to party members for a final verdict. His rivals will do anything to stop him — which is why party activists are demanding rule changes to allow any MP with 20 votes to enter the final ballot.Boris has gone quiet — but not for long. He is reportedly planning a nationwide tour — complete with bright-red battle bus — trashing Mrs May’s Chequers deal and calling for a clean Brexit.There will be plenty of opportunities for car-crash interviews and zipwire-style TV images. But the bookies aren’t the only ones making BoJo the clear favourite as Britain’s next Prime Minister.He names Somalis, Ethiopians, North and Central Africans and Afghans as being responsible for the knife-gang slaughter of young black and Asian men.“Race is part of the picture,” says the equality campaigner. “Failing to point this out impedes the fight against these crimes and imperils yet more children of colour.”He is right, isn’t he?But how long before this decent black man is himself accused of racism for daring to tell this unvarnished truth?Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Will our current free movement regime be rebadged as a “Labour Mobility Framework”?Such a move, speculated on in the media this week, would be politically toxic and very poorly timed. It would also betray her own instincts, which she rightly gave voice to when she became Prime Minister.Striking a chord with millions of people angry and alienated at their voices being ignored by the political elite on immigration and the downside of globalisation, delivered for her record poll ratings then and a real feeling of hope that at last people in power were listening.Yes, the main driver for the Leave vote was about democracy, independence and national sovereignty but it was also about the fundamental choice that a UK outside the EU would have: Who comes to our country and on what basis – decided by our own Parliament.Voters have noticed that the tightening of the labour market and record employment levels, as revealed by the Office for National Statistics last week, mean that at long last real wages – i.e. pay packets less inflation – are slowly rising and that belatedly big business is beginning to move away from an over reliance on cheap foreign labour, undercutting the pay and conditions of indigenous workers and giving rise to higher welfare dependency.It might seem a radical concept, but such employers might just have to pay workers decent wages, train them better, improve their skills and try hard to retain them. That’s why EU workers are still coming to the UK in huge numbers, despite ridiculous Project Fear stories to the contrary.So yes – Brexit will mean higher pay for British workers! Top businessman Stuart Rose, briefly spokesman for the Remain campaign, accurately predicted such a development before the EU Referendum.Regrettably, the multinationals’ trades union, the CBI didn’t get the message: No surprise that they now want no restrictions on foreign workers post Brexit – in other words an endless pool of cheap labour just like now.Likewise, they’re happy to defend the growing gap between average pay and that of FTSE 100 bosses.Ironically, The Prime Minister could still snatch victory from defeat on this issue, notwithstanding her lamentable record as Home Secretary on reducing net immigration to the tens of thousands.The alternative White Paper which David Davis and his Ministers were working on prior to it being dumped at Chequers, was much more evidence-based and looked to many workable international examples of mobility agreements between first world countries like Australia, the United States, Japan and Canada, as a model for future EU-UK immigration arrangements, to our mutual benefit.The policy would have been informed by the Migration Advisory Committee which reports next month, focused on what was the sensible policy for the whole of the UK and all business sectors rather than a noisy minority and their well-paid advocates.It also sought to end the systemic bias towards low paid and low skilled EU citizens over the well qualified from across the globe.It was pro controlled immigration and not about pulling up the drawbridge and that’s where most British voters are now.Will Theresa May use the opportunity to keep faith with the millions of people in the north and the midlands, in south Wales and south west, who look to her to keep her promises and defend their interests and not just those of the well heeled, the multinationals and those comfortable with the Brussels status quo?Will putative leadership contender Sajid Javid have the courage to resist further attempts at craven supplication on continuing free movement in all but name? Will Conservative MPs who benefited from the highest ever blue collar vote for their party in history, ignore their own electors’ concerns and just accept further concessions?The electoral prospects of her party depend on it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Many in work earn half what they did ten years ago.Hundreds of thousands of Greece’s brightest have fled.The Eurozone works nicely for Germany . . . but that’s it. Thank God we never signed up to it.Brexit Anxiety Disorder is real, two top psychologists believe. It certainly explains the gibbering hallucinations of Andrew Adonis and his mates.Two grievous losses tipped this complacent Remoaner elite over the edge:The control over our national direction to which they always felt entitled. And our departure from the corrupt, bullying, protectionist EU club they bizarrely consider a beacon of liberal values.Their latest co-ordinated ruse — backed by rich celebrities, has-been politicians and former newspapers — is to pretend a second referendum would “bring a divided Britain together”.They are actually arguing that after two years of abusing 17.4million Leavers as thick racists, Remainers now deserve a second chance to get what they wanted. And that, whatever the result, we would all magically unite behind it.If there’s a more laughably mad contention, we haven’t heard it.We might once have wondered what they were smoking. But the truth is simpler: they are just genuinely barking.It has known for a year the prison was dangerously understaffed. What were the MoJ officials onsite up to?The stories now emerging are appalling. Constant violence. Lags living in terror, warders more so. A “secure” staff car park torched. Routine use of drugs and synthetic highs, brazenly dropped by drones flown in by crime gangs.It’s not about whether prisons are run by the private or public sector.

Appropriation.In the eyes of today’s politically correct policers of “wrongthink”, there is no greater crime than cultural appropriation.Cultural appropriation is when people embrace the grub or music or ideas of a culture that isn’t theirs.Like when Kylie Jenner wore her hair in cornrows. Or when Katy Perry donned a Japanese kimono. Or when drunken lads on a university campus put on sombreros as they neck shots of tequila.All of these things have been branded cultural appropriation by today’s potty warriors against “offensiveness”.And to this blacklist of things we must never appropriate, we can now add non-native foods.This is not the first time Jamie Oliver has been criticised for making foreign dishes. Two years ago foodies were up in arms when he put chorizo in paella — which the Spanish tend not to do.Clearly Jamie Oliver is only allowed to cook “white” British food, like roast beef and toad-in-the-hole.Not Cornish pasties or Yorkshire puddings, though.After all, what right does a man born in Essex have to appropriate the food of Northerners and people from the West Country? And presumably Dawn Butler only ever tucks into Jamaican dishes.If it is cultural appropriation for Oliver to make jerk grub, surely it must be cultural appropriation for Ms Butler to rattle up a bit of sushi?This would be the crazy conclusion to the war on cultural appropriation — none of us would ever dip into other cultures and experience their pleasures.What is most depressing about the Butler/Oliver spat is that it confirms how mainstream the miserabilist, divisive PC worldview has gone.It used to be just time-rich posh kids and snowflakes on university campuses who raged against cultural appropriation.Like the officious students at Cambridge who banned an Around The World in 80 Days fancy-dress party for fear students would wear “culturally appropriated” costumes.Or the clipboard bores at the University of East Anglia who banned students from wearing sombreros.Or the easily offended muppets at the University of Ottawa in Canada who banned a yoga class, because for white people to indulge in this ancient Indian discipline is an act of “cultural genocide”.I bet you never knew that when you do a pelvic tilt at your local gym you are being a horrible racist.Now, however, with Butler’s missive against the crimes of Jamie Oliver, this PC claptrap has crept from the fringes into the political centre. Butler is Shadow Secretary for Women and Equalities, and she is very close to Jeremy Corbyn.Is this what we should expect under a Corbyn government? Finger-wagging at anyone who deviates from PC rules?The worst thing about the clampdown on cultural appropriation is how divisive it is. The message is that we must always stick with our own cultures and never borrow from others.Didn’t that used to be known as racism?In recent years, Beyonce has been slammed for wearing a sari. Glastonbury has banned attendees from wearing Native American head-dresses. Selena Gomez was ridiculed for doing a Bollywood- inspired dance on US TV.This new racial divisiveness makes ­culture stiff and dull.Anthony Horowitz, author of the Alex Rider teen spy novels, says he was “warned off” from writing a black character. Apparently a white writer like him ­cannot understand the black experience.Is this really the world we want to live in? Where people never mix and never try to empathise with those who have had different life experiences to theirs?We should stand up for cultural ­appropriation.The global intermingling of food and fashion and art has enriched human life.As the great American novelist Lionel Shriver reminds us: “People with different backgrounds rubbing up against each other and exchanging ideas and practices is self-evidently one of the most productive, fascinating aspects of modern urban life.”Yet in their Brave New World, everyone would stick to their own people and their own ways. What a dispiriting, divided world that would be.I would far rather live in a world than has Jamie Oliver jerk chicken in it than in such a racially regimented PC nightmare.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Supplies won’t dry up and prices for drugs won’t rise.Mr Raab will also make a plea to Brussels to mimic Britain by being “responsible European neighbours, partners and allies,” suggesting it would even be sensible to work together “when it comes to No Deal planning.”But on Wednesday Labour’s Owen Smith MP hit back: It beggars belief that more than two years after the Brexit vote, the Government are making speeches and publishing ‘notes’ on what happens if they can’t secure a deal.”The Best for Britain backer, warned: “no amount of contingency planning or spin can hide the fact that the peace and prosperity of our country is at risk.”Last night, Tory Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg urged the party to “respect the referendum”.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But that’s where we have got it so wrong.It comes as no surprise that nearly 50 per cent of UK schools are failing to achieve the target 25 per cent of A-level entries in STEM subjects — science, technology, engineering and mathematics.The nation is crying out for STEM skills. It is estimated there is a STEM-worker shortfall of 40,000 — and it is set to rise. We are facing a national crisis.Yet schools are rewarded on delivering grades, not different subjects. And this relentless focus on grades means youngsters are potentially being deprived access to high-paid and fast-growing careers.Research shows interest in maths and science dramatically declines during secondary school.When it comes to gender, there is a big difference. Interest in STEM subjects drops by 56 per cent among boys and 74 per cent among girls.Quite often girls underestimate their performance and, although they get better grades in maths and physics at GCSE, fewer of them take the subjects at A level than boys.There is this perception that you have to be a genius to do maths or science, but that is not true.Often teachers will say unless you get a grade A in maths or science at GCSE, don’t even bother taking it for A level. The reality is, even if you get a lower grade in the subject, it is still viewed very well by employers. Even if you take just one STEM subject, it will open up so many more doors.This is one of the reasons I created Future Finder, a free app to show young people the relationship between subject choices and their career pathway.After all, this is about preparing them for a job, not getting them to the top of the school system.Science is also fun, it is creative. It’s not dull and nerdy, which is how it is often perceived.We need to tell youngsters there are such jobs as autonomous vehicle engineers, gamification designers and carbon capture technicians, because you can’t be what you can’t see.Sixty-five per cent of children entering primary school now will end up working in jobs that don’t yet exist. And unless young people are learning the right skills, they’re not going to get them.Nearly 30 years ago, when I set up a data analysis company with my husband Clive, people threw data away because it was too expensive to keep. We went on to create Tesco Clubcard, the world’s first supermarket loyalty card.We were only a small business, but we had the skills to figure out something Tesco couldn’t on its own — exactly what its customers were buying.It revolutionised the way we shop, the supermarket doubled its market share within the year and we went from employing 30 staff to 1,500.We were at the forefront of a new science and it was an amazing time.I’m incredibly lucky and I’ve had a brilliant career. Now I want to help give back by preparing tomorrow’s talent.I was the chair of Your Life, a national campaign to encourage youngsters to consider careers in STEM.As a result of that movement, the Government now gives schools an additional £600 per pupil studying maths at A level.Figures also show that STEM subjects are becoming more popular. More than a third of all A-level entries in 2018 were in these subjects and more girls are taking STEM subjects.But we are already far behind countries such as America and China. That gap is only going to get wider too, as we estimate we will need 1.3million more science professionals by 2030.If schools are the talent factory then we need to deliver the skills the nation needs. We must start by giving extra weighting to maths and physics when it comes to measuring a school’s success.We are defined by the talent coming through our schools. That’s our future, that’s who we will be.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Quite the reverse. The vast majority come for a better life and a decent job and integrate perfectly.Our objection is to short-sighted politicians who failed to foresee the cost.Now wages are depressed, houses and rents unaffordable, schools overcrowded, the NHS and our transport system under massive strain.Migrant numbers should be tied to our economic need — but it is vital, with the annual net increase still at 280,000, that we build the infrastructure to match.What’s being done? Precious little.WHAT credibility can Labour’s promises over the freedom of the media possibly have when their single biggest financial backer is the odious Max Mosley?Leave aside that he is a former fascist who was present as his father Oswald’s thugs marched through a Jewish area of East London chanting “Jews out”.He now bankrolls Corbyn’s mob, to the tune of £300,000 last year alone, because he knows they will try to crush the popular Press given the chance. His apparent sole motivation being revenge after his lust for Germanic sado-masochistic hooker orgies was exposed.This, then, is the rancid state of Labour:A cesspit of a party, run by public schoolboy Marxist class warriors, infested with anti-Semitic racism and funded by one of the most unimaginably unpleasant individuals in public life.How proud its MPs must be.IT’S far too easy for banks to blame ­customers conned out of their savings.Most of us are still too savvy to give our details to cold-callers or emailers.

The couple own other properties too.Baroness Shami ChakrabatiThe shadow attorney general and has said that she is against the reintroduction of grammar schools because they “segregate” young children.But it was revealed her 13-year-old son was admitted to the selective Dulwich College, which charges fees of £18,000 a year.Speaking to ITV she denied being a hypocrite, saying: “I live a charmed and privileged life, much more now than I ever did when I was a child, but people on the Left have often had charmed and privileged lives.“I live in a nice big house, and eat nice food, and my neighbours are homeless, and go to food banks.And not forgetting... Jeremy CorbynThe Labour boss grew up in leafy villages and large houses including the seven-bedroom Yew Tree Manor in Chetwynd - once part of an estate owned by the Duke of Sunderland.According to Rosa Prince, Mr Corbyns biographer, he enjoyed a thoroughly upper-middle-class, scruffy country upbringing.He attended Castle House Prep school and then a grammar - before going travelling around Jamaica and Latin America in a fashion similar to todays gap yearsI think there can only be one reason why he is doing this, which is to create an atmosphere of resentment and prejudice, to presumably suit his political purposes.Bob Seely MP described Mr Corbyns team as a bunch of posh Marxists.But there are others in his team who come from more down to earth backgrounds.Shadow Education Secretary Angela Rayner left school when she got pregnant, and went on to work as a care worker.Rebecca Long-Bailey, who grew up in Old Trafford, began her working life in a pawn shop, and also worked in call centres, a furniture factory and as a postwoman before she went on to become a solicitor. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Local stockpiling is not necessary.Patients will not need to and should not seek to store additional medicines at home, he explained.Earlier this week health bosses warned that hospitals could run out of life-savings drugs in a no-deal situation.This is because they havent prepared for what might happen if the UK leaves without a deal.But today Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab insisted it was unlikely that we would leave next March with no agreement.He said: Im still confident a good deal is within our sights.

Corbyn’s speech was full of cuddly sounding expressions.But the real message was clear: Never mind all that freedom nonsense — let’s nationalise the news.So, the Labour leader says he wants to invest taxes in public-interest journalism.Who would want journalism that goes against the public good?But the question is: Who decides what the public interest might mean?Government ministers? High court judges? Simon Cowell and Cheryl? Jeremy Corbyn’s press office?Look a little closer and it is clear there is no consensus on what qualifies as public-interest journalism.It is just an ethical-sounding excuse for imposing your own interests on what are really matters of personal taste and political preference.One thing seems certain: It will not be the British public deciding which sort of public-interest journalism taxes should finance.Corbyn wants his state-backed media fund to be “independent”.A buzzword that should raise the question: Independent of what?There are no independent angels floating above the grubby political battles below, with only the public interest at heart.Everybody has interests and agendas of their own.Labour’s independent media funding body would be another government-backed quango, stacked with placemen from the political and cultural elites.Corbyn had the nerve to protest that the media today is “unaccountable”.Yet his independent media board would be less accountable to the public than newspapers, which must respond to their readers who pay their hard-earned money for their newspaper of choice.As for taxes funding journalism to create a more informed public — informed by who, peddling which line?It is not hard to imagine the sort of information Corbyn wants the media to feed us, it would be like the old Russian Communist party paper Pravda.It is no coincidence that the Labour Party’s biggest individual donor last year was the odious, Press-hating Max Mosley.The Labour leader singled out something called the Bureau Of Investigative Journalism as an example of an independent outfit that should be given charitable status and tax perks.Would that be the same self-righteous bureau that prompted the BBC’s flagship Newsnight programme to throw its ethics overboard a few years ago and falsely inform us that a Tory lord was a paedophile?Newsnight never recovered its reputation in the wake of the debacle.When Corbynites talk about wanting a more “diverse” media, one thing they do not mean is diversity of content and opinion. They want a conformist media that will report what it is told and not ask awkward questions.Even the BBC — bastion of the Remainstream media establishment — is too insolent for Labour’s tastes.If you want to see the real face of Labour’s attitude to journalism, just look at Corbyn’s smirking response to a Sky News reporter who asked him some straight questions about the recent wreath-laying controversy.His contemptuous reply basically said, “You have no right to know what I do or think” — in which case, neither do the mass of viewers.Labour’s track record gives the lie to any notion that it is interested in a more open media.The non-Corbynite deputy leader, Tom Watson, is an even more embittered Press-hater.Who does Jeremy Corbyn think he is, to be laying down the law on what a free Press should or should not investigate, and protesting to regulators when they report facts or express opinions not to his liking?Yet Corbyn’s quasi-Stalinist vision of State-approved journalism seems to go down well with his cultish fan club, who ensured that #ChangeTheMedia was trending on Twitter even before he spoke in Edinburgh.Perhaps they should more honestly have made it #ChangeTheMedia-OrElse.“Just because it’s on the front page of The Sun or The Mail,” Corbyn claimed yesterday, “doesn’t automatically make it news.”If he had his way, it would be more a case of: “Just because it’s news, doesn’t automatically mean it should be allowed on the front page of The Sun.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Girls continued to do better than boys, but the gap has closed. ­Nearly one in four girls got a grade 7, compared with one in six lads.But the new system was dubbed a waste of time and resources as GCSEs no longer meant much as far as employers were concerned.Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, questioned the cost in hours, stress and money of exams at 16, “when for employers, it’s what they get at 18 that’s important?”A PROFOUNDLY deaf student who got a clean sweep of top grades in her GCSEs said her impairment pushed her to work harder and she refused to let it define her.Lily Olliver sees herself as just an “ordinary girl who happens to be deaf”.The 16-year-old, of Hove, achieved 10 9s and the top mark of an A hat - the equivalent of an A** - in further maths.Last year her sister Jessica, who is also deaf, gained eight A*s at GCSE as well as two As and a B, a 7 and a 6 at the school.Lily, who sits on the youth advisory board for the National Deaf Children’s Society, said: “I’m in shock, I’m really pleased. It’s a relief.“I was really worried about religious studies and additional maths.A GIRL from Portugal has achieved top GCSE results after learning English by watching Netflix.Vitoria Mario, 16, barely spoke a word of English when she arrived in the country two years ago.But yesterday she was celebrating two grade 8s in English, as well as 9s in maths and Spanish.Vitoria, of Stratford, East London, was hooked on dramas Power and Blindspot. She said: “I watched a lot of Netflix.”“I don’t think being deaf should stop you in anything you feel you want to do.“I don’t want it to define me.“If anything it caused me to work a bit harder and fight a bit more.”She plans to return to Brighton College for A-levels and is hoping to study a combination of chemistry, biology, maths, further maths and philosophy but is still deciding exactly which subjects to pick.She said she is also exploring ideas for her career.Her parents Pam and Andy Olliver said they were so proud of their “little girl”.A tearful Mrs Olliver added: “Lilly is profoundly deaf but she is pretty steely.“She did really well and had to work very hard.PE teacher James Riley, 41, opened his results with his class live in front of the cameras on ITV’s Good Morning Britain.The Head of Year 11 at Furness Academy in Cumbria revealed he had sat the paper to discover how hard the new exam was.His grade is equal to a C under the old system.“What she’s keen to say is she’s just an ordinary person who happens to be deaf. It’s how we raised them.”Teen chess genius Dominic Miller, of Littlehampton, West Sussex, who secured a place at the school aged 13 when he won its first ever chess scholarship, achieved nine 9s, A*s in German and computing and an A hat in further maths.He won the backing of one of the UK’s best chess players, grandmaster Nigel Short, to take his place at the school and has hopes of becoming a grandmaster himself.Out of the 732 students across the country who received seven grade 9s or above, 34 studied at Brighton College, the school said.There were 10 students who achieved at least nine 9s at the school with one getting the highest he possibly could in all exams - eight nines, an A hat and two A*s.Some 89.6% of all grades were the highest - 7,8 and 9 or the equivalent in the existing marking pattern - taking into account all exams sat under the new grading system and the existing structure, the school said.It added that 90.9 per cent of girls and 88.8 per cent of boys achieved grade 7 or higher.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But the last thing he wants is it holding a future Labour Government to account.He detests scrutiny, as his tantrums sparked by tricky questions prove.As for his plan for a state-run Facebook rival, can you imagine anything more ridiculous or pointless?The ­Austin Allegro of social media, making ­gargantuan losses for taxpayers?And how about his “Netflix levy” to fund the BBC?Is there no limit to the costs he wants to pile on ordinary people?NOW, by contrast, is the time for the Tories to CUT taxes.There is depressing talk of a new hike to fund the NHS. But the public finances are in unexpectedly good shape, the deficit plummeting and growth on the up.Corporation tax should be as low as Ireland’s, stamp duty slashed to get the housing market moving, fuel duty lowered, and income tax cut too.With No Deal Brexit more likely, we need to boost the economy and lure investment with a low-tax regime as never before.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We\u0027re wading through the small print - and it isn\u0027t happy reading for you or your familyShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByNicola BartlettPolitical CorrespondentDan BloomPolitical reporter11:36, 23 AUG 2018Updated14:51, 23 AUG 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay nowGet politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe Tory government has today published 25 notes warning of the consequences of a no deal Brexit. They\u0027ve deliberately been played down so people won\u0027t be alarmed at the prospect of crashing out in March 2019. Sweat-drenched Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab even denied there would be a “sandwich famine”. Calming fears of the unlikely event like an air steward, he added: You will still be able to enjoy a BLT after Brexit, and there are no plans to deploy the army to maintain food supplies. But as reassuring as this must be to everyone, by no means is it all good news. Mr Raab sensationally admitted the government is poised to recruit 9,000 new civil servants to work on Brexit - on top of 7,000 already - and said: Real livelihoods are at stake here.  Mr Raab also announced plans to recruit 1,000 more Border Force staff, on top of current recruitment for 300 border staff that is already underway.  Buried in hundreds of pages of small print of his No Deal \u0027technical notices\u0027 - of which there will eventually be about 80 - are some proper nasties that would make life more difficult in the UK. Already the plans have prompted outrage. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said: A no-deal Brexit has never been viable and would represent a complete failure of the Government\u0027s negotiating strategy.  Welsh First Minister Carwyn Jones added: The writing is on the wall. No-deal would be a catastrophic failure of the UK Government that would cause huge disruption and serious, long-lasting economic and social damage to all parts of the UK. TUC general secretary Frances O\u0027Grady said the reports confirmed no-deal Brexit would be devastating for working people. Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) National Chairman Mike Cherry said: The dangers of a sudden and unplanned no-deal Brexit have today been laid bare. So what do the documents say? We\u0027re rounding up what we\u0027ve found in the worst of the small print. 1. It will cost you more to use your credit card  The cost of using a credit card to buy goods or services from an EU company is likely to rise. That is because cross-border payments will no longer be covered by the EU\u0027s very recently introduced credit card surcharge ban. In 2015, British consumers were charged \u0026pound166million. Remain-backing peer Lord Adonis, of the Best for Britain group, said: No one voted for this two years ago.  Companies based in the EU, such as Airbnb and Ryanair – both used by millions of people – would no longer be bound by rules limiting what they can charge UK customers who pay by plastic. Who even knew that card payments were going to be affected by Brexit. It\u0027s time for a people\u0027s vote. 2. It will cost more and take longer to buy anything from the EU  This one is somewhat obvious but the papers confirm it in all its horrifying detail. If there’s no deal, UK-based payment service providers such as PayPal would lose direct access to the EU’s central payments structure.  This mean customers “could face increased costs and slower processing times for EU transactions”, the papers say. Meanwhile, the papers sketch out a whole load of new hoops UK businesses would need to jump through before importing goods from the EU. They include registering for a UK Economic Operator Registration and Identification Number and submitting import declarations to HM Revenue and Customs. Businesses are being advised directly by the government to look into buying up warehouse space for goods awaiting customs approval.  A stockpile of six weeks\u0027 worth of 200 medicines already exists due to the threat of French lorry strikes. But now the government is asking pharmaceutical companies to ensure they have an additional six weeks supply of medicines in the UK - on top of their own normal stock levels. The warning comes in a letter to pharma firms today by the Health Secretary Matt Hancock. Brexit Secretary Mr Raab told the BBC: There are potential issues around the border in the worst case scenario. So it\u0027s right, too, we will be working with industry around stockpiling of medicines for a working assumption of six weeks. 4. UK farmers face NINE-MONTH wait for exports that could bankrupt them  UK farmers face a crippling nine-month wait for approval to export organic goods to the EU. That is because logos on packaging would need to change, with UK producers being forced to drop the EU\u0027s organic food logo.  Yet the farmers would not be allowed to apply for this change until 30 March 2019 - and there is a nine-month wait. We are exploring alternative approaches that should speed up this process, say the technical notes - but they don\u0027t explain what those approaches will be. Lib Dem MP Tim Farron, of the Best For Britain anti-Brexit group, said: A nine month wait for organic farmers to sell their produce into their biggest market would see farmers up and down the country wiped out. The Government’s disastrous mishandling of these negotiations looks almost certain to lead to British organic farmers being put out of business – nobody voted for that. NFU President Minette Batters said: Not only would this be hugely disruptive but it threatens livelihoods and businesses in the UK. 5. Expat Brits could lose access to their pensions  It doesn\u0027t look good for Brits living abroad who still have a bank account in the UK.  They may face restrictions on their ability to borrow money and in accessing certain insurance.  In particular, UK expats in the EU could lose access to their pension income and other financial services, the papers warn. Lending and deposit services, insurance and annuities - which people rely on for a regular pension income - could all be affected. The notes warn that UK citizens abroad may lose the ability to access existing lending and deposit services, insurance contracts (such as life insurance contracts and annuities) due to UK firms losing their rights to passport into the EEA.  If there\u0027s no deal, any parcel from the EU to the UK worth up to \u0026pound135 would have VAT charged on top.  It could be charged to the overseas firm sending the parcel - which in turn would charge VAT on customers at the point of purchase. This means a hike of around \u0026pound20 on mid-value parcels being sent into Britain in a No Deal Brexit. 7. Workers will lose an important voice in the workplace  No new requests to set up European Works Councils will be accepted after a No Deal Brexit. These are bodies within a company that represent European employees and keep up communication between them and management about the progress of the business. Labour - who repeatedly claimed Brexit could be an excuse to water down workers\u0027 rights - slammed the plans. Shadow Business Secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said: The Prime Minister has waxed lyrical about protecting workers’ hard-won rights after we leave the EU. However, as is typical with this Tory Government, it was nothing but meaningless empty rhetoric. By not allowing new European Works Councils to form, nor having a contingency plan to replace them, the Tories are leaving British workers at a disadvantage compared to their EU colleagues. Leaving workers out of the loop and out of negotiations with management about pay and their terms and conditions. 8. New medicines will face a major chunk of red tape  New medicines will need UK approval before they can be made available to patients in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), which regulates drugs in the UK, will take on the functions of the EU if an agreement is not reached by March 29. Products will have to go through national assessment before they receive market authorisation to be sold in the UK. The notice states: After EU exit, to market a product in the UK, an initial market authorisation application will need to be submitted to the MHRA and will go through a national assessment. MHRA will take a streamlined approach to approving UK market authorisation applications that places no greater burden on industry and ensures that patients can access new and innovative medicines at the same time as EU patients. Most new medicines currently come to the market through a licensing route overseen by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). 9. Brits could face longer queues at Dover  We\u0027re still not sure on whether Kent\u0027s main motorways will be turned into a lorry park as some experts have warned. There is still no clarity on whether customs will be collected at the border delaying lorries coming into the UK.  But the note does admit that officials will need to minimise delays.  It says: HMRC will work closely with industry to ensure its interventions are conducted in a way which minimises delays and additional burdens for legitimate trade, while robustly ensuring compliance.  10. Cigarette firms will have to fork out for horrifying new pictures of lungs  We know, we know - get your tiny violin for costs incurred to tobacco firms. But really, tobacco companies will have to come up with some new horrifying pictures of people’s lungs - because the “existing picture library is owned by the European Commission”. The Government says cigarette and tobacco packets will have to have the new pictures from day one of when we leave the EU. 11. Bad news for hunters?  The European Firearms Pass would no longer be available for people in the UK taking their personal firearms to the EU. They should still be allowed to take them as a temporary export.  However, they would need to be sure that the individual country will let them re-export them - i.e. bring them back to the EU. 12. Britain\u0027s men could have to do more masturbating. All for Britain, of course  It\u0027s pub quiz time. Who knew that Britain imports bucketloads of sperm - 3,000 samples in 2017 - from Denmark? Well, it\u0027s true. Those imports can likely continue in a no-deal Brexit, the technical notices say. But in order for that to happen, UK importers would need to reach agreements with individual establishments exporting sperm for use in fertility clinics. That adds extra red tape. The papers insist it will be a minimum burden. But what if it can\u0027t be overcome? There\u0027s only one answer, surely - the nation\u0027s men must masturbate for Britain! 13. And finally...

And it seems the shake-up - which replaces A*-G with numbers 1 to 9 - is so complex, even the Education Secretary struggled to explain it clearly. Tory Damian Hinds, who has a first class degree from Oxford, fumbled as he was asked to explain the grading system on LBC radio. After two minutes of horse-trading with host Nick Ferrari - where he admitted the grades were complex - he eventually said: We don\u0027t need to get into all of this.  It came after a confusing exchange where he said a 6 was not directly a B, adding: We link these things at C to a 4 and A to a 7 and between those it\u0027s arithmetic. So that\u0027s all clear then.

It\u0027s the first time there has been a net departure from the so-called EU8 states, including Poland and Czech Republic, since they joined the EU in 2004.  The stark fact - prompting warnings of a Brexodus- comes after \u0027net long-term migration\u0027 to Britain dropped sharply since the Brexit vote in 2016.  The measure records the difference between the number of people arriving and leaving the UK for at least 12 months. Around 45,000 immigrants arrived from EU8 countries - Poland, Lithuania, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia and Latvia - in the year to the end of March. At the same time, 47,000 departed - giving a net migration figure of minus 2,000.  While this was a non-statistically significant fall, net EU8 migration has dropped from 42,000 since June 2016. Net migration of citizens from 14 longer-term member states such as Germany, Italy, Spain and France has almost halved since the Brexit vote. And in the latest period, 38,000 more Romanians and Bulgarians arrived than left, down from 62,000 in the 12 months to June 2016. From across the whole of the EU, net migration to Britain has fallen to around 87,000, the lowest level for more than five years. Meanwhile net migration from outside the EU to Britain is higher than at any point since 2004. Overall, the balance between immigration and emigration was 271,000.  This is below record levels seen around 2015 and 2016, but still almost three times the Government\u0027s net migration target of less than 100,000. Nicola Rogers, of the Office for National Statistics, said the figures show net migration is continuing to add to the UK\u0027s population. Looking at the underlying numbers we can see that EU net migration has fallen, as fewer EU citizens are arriving in the UK, and has now returned to the level last seen in 2012, she said. Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, said: The UK has clearly become a less attractive country for EU migrants since the referendum.

Some journeys will take almost four times longer than normal as holidaymakers embark on getaways to make the most of their last 2018 summer hurrah.  The RAC said research suggests 11.2 million people have planned a car journey for a day trip or extended break between Thursday and Bank Holiday Monday, while a further 3.2 million intend to drive during the period but are undecided on which day. Highways England is lifting or completing more than 300 miles of roadworks from motorways and major A roads from Friday morning. But around 40 sets will remain.  See below for list of roadworks, traffic jam hotspots and train disruptions   Where will be busiest on the roads? The busiest times on the road for getaway trips are expected to be on Friday and Saturday, with 3.6 million cars on both days. Traffic information supplier Inrix predicted the most delayed route will be the M5 from Junction 4 to Junction 1 in the West Midlands between 1pm and 6pm on Friday, when journeys with a typical travel time of 21 minutes could take an extra hour. On Saturday the M1 is predicted to be badly affected from Junction 22 to Junction 25 in the East Midlands, with journey times increasing from a typical 16 minutes to 62 minutes.   Any other traffic jam hotspots?  - The M20 from Junction 9 to Junction 3 in the South East between 7.30am and 9.30am on Friday - The M6 from Junction 28 to Junction 32 in the North West between 12pm and 3pm on Friday - The M5 from Junction 22 to Junction 20 in the South West between 2pm and 4.30pm on Saturday RAC traffic spokesman Rod Dennis said the Bank Holiday has huge potential to bring gridlock to major roads.

Lyndsey Henderson, 30, boogied along to the hit 90s song with her new husband Sean Henderson, 28, and their 100 guests at their UK wedding reception at the Cadbury\u0027s Factory in Birmingham last Saturday. The couple, who met each other at a gym in 2013, chose to hold a second wedding reception after their first in Santorini, Greece a week earlier. But an over-zealous jump in the air saw the new bride land on the sides of her feet causing a hairline fracture in her right foot and three broken bones in her left foot.  Miraculously, the newlywed didn\u0027t notice she had broken her size 5 feet and continued dancing until 2am. Two days later, Lindsay, a primary school teacher from Longbridge, Birmingham, went to A\u0026ampE at Quen Elizabeth Hospital and was told she would need to wear two casts and rest for up to six weeks. Lyndsey said: “I chose not to drink as I wanted to remember the night with all my loved ones. “Now there’s no chance in that! “I just went absolutely crazy as it’s one of my favourite songs and was the first one I bought on cassette in 1998!  “It was around 11pm and the DJ put the song on and I was doing my best Michael Flatley with all my bridesmaids. “Then when I went a bit freestyle I managed to jump up and land on the sides of my feet. “At first I didn’t realise what had happened. I noticed I landed funny but didn’t give it a second thought. “I kept on dancing for another six songs and even had a dance with my dad to Wonderful Tonight afterwards.  “It wasn’t until the next day when I started walking a bit weird on my left foot that I thought something was up. But I just thought it was a sprain. “I spent the Sunday with Sean just watching movies and chilling out. Thankfully for the newlyweds, Lyndsey’s injury will not affect their honeymoon - as the couple won’t be jetting off to Barbados until next April.

Corporal Alec Jay was captured at Dunkirk in 1940 and taken to the notorious German Setzdorf prison camp.  One afternoon, while the prisoners were playing football an SS officer arrive, stopped the game and shouted out: Were is Alex, the Jew?  The British soldiers formed a protective ring around him and told the Nazi he would have to \u0027shoot them all\u0027 to get to him. A tense stand-off ensued and the German guards carrying machine guns eventually backed down. The remarkable story has now come to light after Cpl Jay\u0027s son John discovered his late father\u0027s memoirs and has published them in a book \u0027Facing Fearful Odds\u0027.  His father never spoke of his wartime experiences although in his final years he began to write his memoirs before abandoning the project. John, a 61-year-old financier, discovered the transcript which had been typed out on his late mother\u0027s typewriter in a plastic bag while sorting through her belongings following her death. He said: “After the surrender, my father faced fearful odds because he was imprisoned by a regime dedicated to exterminating his race.  Cpl Jay was born in Clapham Common in 1919 and worked on the stock exchange before the outbreak of war. He was a Bren gunner in the Queen Victoria Rifles who although vastly outnumbered held out for four days against two German Panzer divisions during the siege of Calais. The crucial rearguard of 3,000 British soldiers against an enemy force of 25,000 enabled the Allies to evacuate hundreds of thousands of soldiers from the beaches of Dunkirk and regroup in Britain. But he was captured and sent first to a camp in Aachen, Germany, and after that to Setzdorf work camp. Cpl Jay escaped four times from Setzdorf but was recaptured on each occasion, until the guards sent him back to Lamsdorf where he stayed until early 1945.

A poll of 2,000 Brits found getting ready and leaving the house in the morning takes 45 minutes for people with a child, compared to just 22 minutes for childless adults. And the more children you have, the longer it takes – an average breakfast takes 24 minutes for those with three kids but just 18 minutes for one child families. Doing the food shop will take 30 minutes longer with the kids in tow while shopping for clothes and shoes will also need an extra half an hour than if you were on your own. Packing for a holiday or trip away, cleaning the house and meal times are also among the daily tasks which will take longer once you have children.  Simon Wilson, Head of Buying at Deichmann Shoes, which commissioned the research, said: “I think all parents out there will agree that having kids is really rewarding. “But simple tasks that you didn’t even think about before – such as shopping – suddenly become a mission worthy of planning with military precision. “What used to take you a few minutes can now suddenly take up a huge chunk of your day. “Even just getting out of the front door can be a task, and shopping is often something parents dread having to do with children. “Our stores all have a rack room style layout, with all styles and sizes available for people to help themselves to. “With our shoe measuring service and Back to School offers, including buying one pair and getting another half price, hopefully shopping for school shoes will be one less thing for parents to plan with such exactness.” The study found 67 per cent of parents admitted they had no idea how much longer it would take to do everyday tasks once they had children.  In fact, the research revealed that almost all of a parent’s day is spent completing tasks, with the average mum and dad getting less than two hours of spare time a day. But those without children will enjoy more than three hours to themselves. As a result, 35 per cent of parents admit they miss the pre-child days when they could get everyday tasks done in less time. And nearly half have had to ask someone to babysit for a few hours so they could complete some jobs without kids in tow. When asked what they would most like to do if they had a moment with no children to worry about, 30 per cent of parents simply said ‘sleep’. A quarter would curl up and get lost in a good book while 29 per cent would give their house a good, top-to-bottom scrubbing to get it as clean as a whistle.

Located on the A64 near Bilbrough, the caf\u0026eacute is so popular with foreign customers that it has translated its menu into both Mandarin and Cantonese and has even set up its own page on Chinese micro-blogging website Weibo. Tony Webster, 56, the manager of the award-winning restaurant, says he has been so busy that he has even turned away whole groups because he was not able to cater to its needs.      Tony said: It\u0027s growing, but typically we get around 100 Chinese visitors a week, which is maybe three or four coach parties. The word is spreading. The Chinese are very active word of mouth marketeers themselves, so by embracing their language and social media platforms, that\u0027s the thing that really seems to be working for us.

Generations have learned to drive using a clutch and gear stick – with all the crunching and lurching that involved. But fast-changing technology has led to booming demand for automatics. The Society of Motor Manufacturers says the number has surged 70% to 8.4million since 2007. While that is still a lot less than the 26.2million manuals around, there has been a big shift in new sales. Autos accounted for 40% of all cars bought in the UK last year, up from 34.8% in 2016 and double the proportion a decade ago.  If those trends continue, automatics could surpass manuals for new car sales by the end of 2019. Meanwhile, the prospect of driverless cars could sound the death knell for manuals altogether.

The recent heatwave seems like a distant memory as maximum temperatures are only expected to reach the high teens (Celsius) across much of the country this weekend. Temperatures started to dip yesterday as a cold front brought fresher air from the Atlantic. Met Office deputy chief meteorologist Martin Young said: The cooler conditions will continue through the weekend and for some it\u0027ll certainly feel quite different to what we\u0027ve been used to this summer.  The mornings especially will be quite chilly with temperatures locally in single figures and some of us in rural areas may even have a touch of frost overnight. Saturday will see plenty of sunshine in most areas but a few showers are likely. Rain will arrive in the west on Sunday morning and spread eastwards across many parts of the UK through the rest of the day.  Monday, which is a bank holiday in all the home nations except Scotland, will see conditions improve with bright and breezy weather as well as a few scattered showers. Despite the mixed weather, traffic is likely to be extremely busy as people embark on short breaks and day trips to make the most of the last long weekend before the festive period. The RAC is expecting more than 14 million cars to be on the roads for leisure trips between Thursday and Monday.

Little Caden and his mother, Hannah Sewell, were in the supermarket buying some food on Saturday when the youngster spotted his favorite packet of apples in their trolley. Caden, who does not speak, was so excited he started to jump up and down. But his happiness was short-lived when a stranger in the store come up to Hannah and said: Control your kid because people are trying to shop. Shocked mum Hannah apologised to the woman and told her that Caden was just excited, but claims the woman just rolled her eyes and interrupted her. To make matters worse, the woman then did something Hannah really wasn\u0027t expecting.  The woman bent down to get closer to Caden, who used to be afraid of strangers. He got excited again thinking the woman was going to say hello. But instead, Hannah says, the woman got close to his face and asked him: What is wrong with you, does your mommy never take you anywhere? As Caden has no verbal skills he could not reply - and Hannah claims the woman laughed when she told her this. Hannah left her shopping and took heartbroken Caden for some chicken nuggets in the hope of cheering him up, but he was too upset to eat and sat there distraught. In an open message to the woman on Facebook , which has been shared 161,000 times, has 76,000 comments and 264,000 reactions, Hannah, from South Carolina, writes: To the woman in Aldi that made my son and me feel like complete sh*t today. I\u0027m sorry you felt that my son being excited about getting a bag of his favorite apples and jumping up and down beside me was such a big deal that you needed to ask me to control my kid because people are trying to shop.  When I told you that he can\u0027t help it and was just excited, and even apologized to you, you decided to roll your eyes and cut me off. And then you did something i really wasn\u0027t expecting. I\u0027m not sure if you noticed it when you bent down, but Caden got excited again thinking you were coming to say hi. He used to be afraid of strangers. We\u0027ve been working on that. But instead of saying hi, you got close to his face and asked him \u0027What is wrong with you, does your mommy never take you anywhere?\u0027 Then you pointed out that he didn\u0027t say anything back to you. When I informed you that he is unable to talk, you laughed and said \u0027No surprise there, he cant even walk through a store\u0027 before walking away. I\u0027m not sure if you can tell, but you broke his f***ing heart and mine when you did that. I left all of my groceries and walked out of the store. I took him to Wendys, his favorite place. I thought he would like some nuggets and he loves the apple slices there because they\u0027re different colors and he can line the colors up on his tray.

According to the latest predictions, Hurricane Lane will hit the northern most point of Oahu first before moving south towards the state capital of Honolulu.  If the hurricane stays on its current track, Honolulu and the island of Maui will be hit in the early hours of Friday morning local time. The storm could be one of the worst to hit the U.S. island chain in 25 years with threats of high winds and lashing rains and the potential to trigger flooding and landslides.  Residents have been warned to stockpile a 14-day supply of water, food and medicines in preparation for the storm as schools, government offices and businesses closed. Packing sustained winds of up to 130 miles per hour (215 km per hour), Lane could dump as much as 20 inches of rain triggering flash floods and landslides, the National Weather Service (NWS) said. More than 30 inches could fall in some places, it said. Preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion, the NWS Central Pacific Hurricane Center in Honolulu said in an advisory. As of early Thursday, Lane was centered about 210 miles (335 km) south-southwest of Kailua-Kona, a town on the west coast of the Big Island, the NWS said.  It was classified as a powerful Category 4 storm on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane strength.  The NWS said the storm weakened slightly overnight but excessive rainfall would affect the Hawaiian islands into the weekend, leading to significant and life-threatening flash flooding and landslides.  More than a foot of rain has already fallen on part of the Big Island, the NWS said on Thursday morning. The centre also warned of very large and damaging surf along exposed west- and south-facing shorelines, likely leading to significant coastal erosion.  A hurricane warning was in effect for Oahu, Maui County and Hawaii County. The islands of Kauai and Niihau remained on hurricane watch and could face similar conditions starting Friday morning.  Governor David Ige has urged residents to take the threat seriously and prepare for the worst by setting aside a 14-day supply of water, food and medicines.   All public schools, University of Hawaii campuses and nonessential government offices on the islands of Oahu and Kauai will be closed for at least two days starting on Thursday, Mr Ige said Wednesday.  The shelves of a downtown Honolulu Walmart were stripped of items ranging from canned tuna to dog food as well as bottled water and coolers full of ice after warnings of possible power outages.   I went to Safeway last night for regular groceries. Everyone was in a panic, said Thao Nguyen, 35, an employee at a Honolulu branch of Hawaiian shirt retailer Roberta Oaks.   Long lines of cars formed at gasoline stations in Honolulu and people pulled small boats from the water ahead of the expected storm surge.  U.S. Navy ships and submarines based in Hawaii were instructed to leave port, a common practice when a hurricane approaches to avoid damage.

But despite being on the front cover of newspapers and magazines across the world, the newlyweds are very private and we very rarely see them out and about unless they\u0027re on official visits. So when royal fans spotted the Duke and Duchess of Sussex jumping in a taxi, tucking into a pub lunch and walking the dog in a public park, they were a tad confused. But it turns out things weren\u0027t quite what they seemed.   It was actually Madame Tussauds London \u0027s Live Figures of Harry and Meghan - and they look extremely realistic.  The figures made their debut at the Britain\u0027s Got Talent final in June, and they\u0027re now regular features at the London tourist attraction.   But they took a break from entertaining fans to go for a little trip around the capital.  They were spotted hailing a taxi, taking their beagle for a stroll around Battersea Park, and even grabbing a quick lunch stop at The Sands End pub, a popular haunt of the prince. Steve Davies, general manager at Madame Tussauds London, said: Our Live Figures of Harry and Meghan have been intriguing and entertaining visitors to the attraction since their launch earlier this year so we thought it was about time we spread some famous fun elsewhere in London.

Jessica O\u0027Neill began professional cuddling six months ago and could soon earn up to \u0026pound45,000 [$79,000 AUD]-a-year by cuddling strangers at her studio based on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. The 35-year-old - who has spent a decade being a massage therapist and counsellor - has only recently introduced cuddle therapy to her treatment list. Jessica claims the cuddles - which start at \u0026pound46 [$80]-an-hour - help people suffering loneliness and depression to feel loved, valued and cared about. She said: I\u0027ve always been a really affectionate person and have always cuddled people. It\u0027s just in my nature and is part of who I am. My mother was always super affectionate and loving when I was young. Her hugs always made everything okay even if there were bad things happening around us. I\u0027ve always had a really lovely response from the people I\u0027ve hugged. Everyone loves a cuddle.  She continued: I started massage therapy when I was 20. I then went on to do fitness instruction, nutrition and counselling. I love massage because when I touch people I can really pick up what is truly going on. Often people don\u0027t express what their feeling, but through touch we can break down that exterior shell. When I started counselling, I just felt like my clients needed more. I wanted to be closer to them, so I could pick up on what they were feeling. It\u0027s not normal to give your clients a cuddle. These environments are usually very clinical and sterile. It is extremely hard in those situations for people to let go of their false ego or hard exterior they\u0027ve created for protection and unlock their true potential. It all started when I began giving my clients a hug when they\u0027d come in for a counselling session. It totally allowed them to drop their guard and open up so much more. I could see their anxiety and tension melt away. Then I could get to the core of their persona and do what I can to heal them. So really, it was a long time coming. I first heard about cuddle therapy six years ago, and I remember telling everyone that what I wanted to do. They thought I was crazy, and probably still do. But I love it so much. It\u0027s so much more rewarding than just massage or counselling. I feel like it\u0027s what I was put on this earth for.  Cuddle therapy with Jessica starts at $80-an-hour for \u0027strictly cuddles\u0027 in the studio, while hugs and counselling costs \u0026pound63 [$110] per session. For those longing for the blissful combination of caffeine and cuddles, a \u0027friendship style\u0027 session of drinking coffee followed by cuddles will set you back \u0026pound86 [$150]. Jessica said most of her clients are men over the aged of 35, but revealed she has a growing number of middle aged women seeking cuddles too. She also claims that there are younger men coming in for cuddles due to experiencing \u0027loneliness and disconnection\u0027 in the digital age. And despite the cuddle sessions being intimate, Jessica insists that 99 percent of her clients are \u0027very well behaved\u0027 and never cross boundaries - but has had \u0027one or two\u0027 awkward experiences.

The company announced today that they are discontinuing their original Naked palette. Yep, I\u0027m sorry to say, you read that right. It\u0027s not 100 per cent clear why this decision has been made, but the palette\u0027s creator, Wende Zomnir, said it was essential for the company to always evolve and that they would turn the grief into greatness.  In a statement, Urban Decay added: Today the beauty world mourns Urban Decay\u0027s beloved Naked Palette , the product that revolutionized neutral eyeshadows.

It was just a terrible performance from the start.“I thought we were slack, very poor in possession.“Ayr had several early corners that put us on the back foot, there were bits of the first half where we got going but it really wasn’t good enough.“As a team, it’s not often I’ve seen so many players off form in one game. It was the polar opposite of Aberdeen last week, against the second best team in the country for the last few years, where we more than matched them.“The players can’t just take plaudits for how well they play and miss chances and then turn in a performance like that, it’s just not acceptable.”Striker Sofien Moussa was dropped to the bench after a poor run in front of goal but did his chances of a reprieve no good whatsoever after his introduction from the dugout.Within 15 minutes of replacing Jean Mendy, Moussa’s continual fouling caught up with him as referee John Beaton gave him his marching orders after a barge on Ayr midfielder Mark Kerr.And to cap things off, centre-back Genseric Kusunga was shown a straight red with the final kick of the game, scything down Michael Moffat in injury time.Neil added: “It was really poor from him, really poor from Gense.“I told Moussa that he can’t be making silly fouls, especially the one where he dived in to try to make a tackle on a yellow card.“It was a very dangerous game and he was warned and then paid the price for a poor challenge.“Then Gense obviously lost his composure and got a straight red which hurts us for this weekend, adding insult to injury.“Moussa had a great impact on the game, getting sent off, but, on the whole, our performance had a greater impact from start to finish, just not good

We’ve got to give Ayr some credit but the defeat was down to us. We weren’t at it at all.“We knew their qualities and had watched them so it wasn’t about under-estimating them.“We just didn’t create enough and were second best for the whole game.“It might be a lesson for some of the new guys, the league is tough and you need to be ready every game.“I don’t even know what to say, to be honest – it’s a hard one to take and we have to pick ourselves up for a big game this weekend at St Johnstone.“We need three points there.”Focus turns completely to the league campaign now after the Betfred Cup disappointment and what has now become a huge game at St Johnstone.The Dark Blues picked up three wins from four against their Tayside rivals last campaign, including a much-needed first victory of the season.That came in mid-September – this time around Kamara is keen to help the side repeat that 3-2 victory by grabbing a first three points of the season.He added: “Hopefully we can repeat that.“We’ll just do our stuff on the training pitches for the week coming up and put our attention now on St Johnstone but we definitely have to look back on the game on Saturday, we can’t just forget about that performance.“There are always other games and it’s a long season ahead but it’s really hard to go out of the cup like that.“We’re always after a cup run so it’s a tough one to take.“We have to pick ourselves up but I know this team is capable of doing that.“We played some good football in the games before Ayr so we know what we are capable of.“The results haven’t gone our way, though, and it’s obvious Saturday just wasn’t good enough from us.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"life long dundee fan liverpool midfielder charlie adam linked with move away from stoke bolton wanderers","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee fan Charlie Adam looks set for a move away from Stoke City.New Potters boss Gary Rowett previously told the 32-year-old he was free to leave the club.The Dundonian has another year on his deal at bet365 Stadium but Bolton have been linked with a move for the Scotland midfielder.Wanderers are believed to be eyeing up a loan deal from their Championship rivals.Fintry-born Adam has not appeared once this season for Stoke and only made five Premier League starts last season.According to reports, Rangers had thought about resigning their former man while Aston Villa also pondered a move but Bolton are now said to be the favourites to complete a deal.Adam, who was signed for £4m from Liverpool in 2012, has become a vocal critic of his Stoke side with digs at new Red Xherdan Shaqiri and former boss Paul Lambert.The life-long dark blue, who has made more than 160 appearances for Stoke, has played twice for Dundee in testimonial games and hasn\u0026#8217t ruled out joining The Dee in the future.\u0026#8220That’s me done it twice.

Three of those defeats came against Inverness Caley Thistle, Morton and Queen of the South in league outings.There were also draws against Dumbarton, Inverness and Dunfermline, meaning a total of 15 points that were expected to be taken were, in fact, shipped.That proved crucial as United finished 13 points behind champions St Mirren and one adrift of second-place Livingston, meaning they kicked off at the first stage of the promotion play-offs, while Livi had the benefit of a two-week break before beating them in the semi-final.Before last week’s Irn-Bru success with a side that was a mix of kids and fringe players, and against very young opposition, there was little to suggest this season would bring an improvement.Over 90 minutes, the Tannadice outings in the Betfred Cup against Arbroath and Alloa were drawn and the opening day of league business ended in a painful 3-2 defeat against Dunfermline that saw the Pars dominate more than the final score suggested.That United must improve at home start is important, not just in terms of their promotion challenge but also economically.The new regime under chairman Mike Martin have invested in a new squad and that’s cost money, some of which they’d like to think will be recouped by fans paying at the gate to watch their team chalk up regular victories at home.Decent income has already come from season ticket sales that are now approaching the 4,000 mark and, if that’s down on previous years, it remains a number that would be the envy of many Premiership clubs.It would be no surprise, however, if that cash has already been spent on the rebuilding of the squad, making supporters who pay on turning up for games a vital source of further funds.In not buying season books, many have adopted a wait-and-see policy so far as attendance is concerned. If United are going well they will come, if not, they’ll find something else to do.That makes wins at Tannadice vital and, in fairness, despite the problems the team’s experienced there in the past 12 months, there are now some encouraging signs.United looked impressive in Dumfries and could’ve scored more than the two goals.And in new arrivals Pavol Safranko, Nicky Clark and Craig Curran, they have strikers who bring as close as anyone is going to get of a guarantee of goals.A more direct style this term should also help, though, ultimately, the proof of this pudding is going to be in the eating.Hopefully, from Saturday the fans can start getting tucked in to what becomes a regular menu of home wins.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/06/595376876461f.jpg ","title":"volunteers wanted to help clean up local beaches","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBroughty Ferry, East Haven and Tentsmuir Point beaches are in line for a makeover next month.The Marine Conservation Society (MCS) is calling for people to help clean up their local beaches as part of the 25th Great British Beach Clean from September 14-17.The society is running 41 beach cleans and surveys around Scotland, including in Tayside, Angus and north-east Fife.Last year more than 1,500 volunteers cleaned up 100-plus beaches.

It will also no longer run through central Charleston, instead going along South Road and Buttars Loan.Loons Road will no longer be on the route, with buses travelling along Harefield Road. It means Loons Road, Alpin Road and the Glenesk area will no longer have a direct connection to Ninewells.The 17 service will continue to service the Technology Park, with Xplore now considering sending every number 17 there.The number 4 service between the city centre and Dryburgh will be re-routed via City Road, instead of Milnbank Road and Polepark Road, “in order to streamline and simplify the service”, Xplore has said. The number 5 bus, which links Ninewells and Barnhill, will be re-routed via Dickson Avenue, instead of the end of Perth Road and Tom MacDonald Avenue. This service is set to run every 10 minutes instead of every seven minutes following a successful trial.Linda Groat, 51, who lives off Perth Road, has multiple sclerosis and finds walking distances difficult. Last month she told the Tele previous changes to the 5 route had left her feeling “trapped”.Responding to the latest alterations Linda said: “These changes are even worse. We have to walk about a third of a mile to get to the bus stop.“Why are we the only area that doesn’t have a bus service? They are not helping this part of the town. It’s quite disappointing.”Maggie Jamieson, 45, a social care officer who works at the hospital, said: “There are lots of elderly people up Loons Road so this would be quite bad for them.”Another service going to Ninewells, the 29 from Douglas, will be re-routed via South Road with Dunholm Road losing its direct connection to Ninewells as a result.Joan Heggie, 59, a hospitality worker from Craigowan Road, said: “The 29 not stopping at Dunholm Terrace will affect a lot of people doing the school or shopping run.”But Anna Ratter, 74, a retired B\u0026ampB owner from Perth Road, said: “There is always a bus when I need one. I think the changes are a good idea if they are going to make the buses smoother and more punctual.”Terrence Kelly, 79, from Broughty Ferry, was also positive: He said: “I am happy with the way the service is now. I think the changes to the bus times are not too bad.”Lynne Short, the council’s transport spokeswoman, said the local authority was “getting things right for as many people as possible” – and stressed that no decisions had yet been made.She said: “At this stage we are still in the middle of consultation. We are in discussions with Xplore, and ultimately ourselves and the bus operators want what’s best for the people of Dundee.”Xplore’s managing director Christine McGlasson said: “Changes we’re planning for October are intended mainly to simplify some routes and improve reliability.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"woman bit man in dundee pub","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSinead Fowler, 20, of Alloway Gardens, had sentence deferred for reports.Fowler had previously been found guilty after trial of assaulting Andrew Will by repeatedly slapping him on the head and biting him on the body at Trades House bar on Nethergate on July 14 last year, and shouting and swearing and placing her face in close proximity to Mr Will at the same place on the same date.Sentence was deferred until September 14 and she was granted bail.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"pet-collar-melts-into-cats-neck-in-heatwave","story":"                          A WOMAN has issued a stark warning to other cat owners after her furry friend\u0027s newly-bought collar melted into its neck - leaving serious burns."},{"url":null,"title":"mcdonalds-to-create-thousands-of-apprenticeships","story":"                          MCDONALD\u0026rsquoS has pledged to create 43,000 apprenticeships across Europe by 2025, including a substantial number in the UK."},{"url":null,"title":"popes-visit-an-opportunity-to-end-the-cover-ups","story":"                          THE Pope\u0027 visit to Ireland is an opportunity to end the cover-up of abuse, Sinn Fein\u0027 vice-president said."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgows-belle-and-sebastian-join-forces-with-scots-opera-for-one-off-show","story":"                          A GLASGOW band will join forces with Scotland\u0027s national orchestra to celebrate a new \u0026pound21million hospice."},{"url":null,"title":"orange-order-refuse-to-re-route-parade-away-from-church-forcing-council-to-impose-new-route","story":"                          THE ORANGE Order has refused to re-route a parade away from the church where a priest was allegedly attacked and faces having a new route imposed on it."},{"url":null,"title":"new-bridge-next-step-in-major-renfrewshire-development-project","story":"                          A NEW bridge over the Black Cart will connect cyclists and pedestrians to a major investment area being developed in Renfrewshire."},{"url":null,"title":"davis-cup-returns-to-the-emirates-arena-for-world-group-play-off","story":"                          THE Emirates Arena will play host to Great Britain\u0027 Davis Cup World Group play-off against Uzbekistan."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-traffic-news-road-closures-and-delays-as-city-hosts-two-major-events","story":"                          Motorists travelling into Glasgow are being warned to expect delays caused by extra traffic."},{"url":null,"title":"austin-lafferty-what-can-i-do-about-my-noisy-neighbours-and-how-can-i-get-my-money-back-from-an-unhelpful-retailer","story":"                          I BOUGHT a display cabinet from a furniture retailer.

near the Longman roundabout, will deal with 83,000 tonnes of annual Highland waste.It was chosen above 169 other locations considered in recent months and could be operational by late 2021.A facility is needed because of new legislation banning the historic practice of landfill.After much speculation about an incineration plant being part of the equation, council officials emphasised that they are \"not looking at energy from waste at this time\" but a location to house a \"materials recovery facility to process all of the Highlands\u0026rsquo waste\".Almost 40 per cent of the region\u0027 waste comes from Inverness and Nairn.City SNP councillor Ron MacWilliam was the most vocal member during an environment committee debate about the issue.He acknowledged the need for such a facility but pointed out that an officers\u0026rsquo report suggesting \"a potential for an energy-to-waste operation in the future\" underplayed things.\"I\u0026rsquod say there\u0027 a likelihood,\" he said.\"It\u0026rsquoll be quite difficult to argue, once the infrastructure is in place to deal with waste at that site, that you might locate such a facility somewhere else.\"He wanted data about volumes and the potential air quality impact on the surrounding area and what impact the facility may have on other possible uses of neighbouring land.He was specifically concerned about the close proximity of a travellers\u0026rsquo site.Officials informed councillor MacWilliam that the picture would become clearer from a development brief for the future of the Longman landfill site which was currently being worked on by officers.Friday 24 Aug 2018 6:36

Not a chance.Ross relished the opportunity to create and played a key role in the 4-0 demolition of the Buddies.It is a footballing philosophy that was fundamental to Holland legend Johan Cruyff, the player who developed the dribbling trick he hopes to recreate with the Reds.Ross hopes he will be given the chance to shine again from the start at Hibs in Premiership action on Saturday.He said: “I want to enjoy football. That is all I am worried about, I don’t care about anything else.“Little nutmegs, Cruyff turns, that is the way to play football.“It is boring just playing along passing it all the time.“The way to play is skilful nutmegs, all that.“That is what gets me excited.”Pressure? Never.There is no stress when the main concern is revelling in the game and entertaining the supporters.He said: “There is only pressure if you put yourself under pressure.“If you just go out and say ‘right I am going to enjoy this and couldn’t care if I lose it (the ball)’ that is the way to play.“A lot of players put themselves under too much pressure.“Just go and play.“I just play the same way in training. I enjoy playing football and I was not nervous at all before St Mirren – I just went for it.“Hopefully I have done enough to start against Hibs although obviously it is not down to me.”Ross operated on the left wing against St Mirren but admits his favoured position is further infield.He said: “I can play anywhere but centre-mid, I like that No 10 role.”Ross received the nod he was starting for only the second time in his Dons career 15 minutes before the second round tie kicked off.He said: “During the possession Niall pulled out and I took his bib and took part.“It was just 15 minutes before kick-off and I was told I was starting. I was buzzing. I wouldn’t have been nervous even if I was told an hour and a half before.“I just want to play football and enjoy it.”Ross’ only other start was in a 1-0 win at Dundee last December, just days after scoring a superb free-kick in a 2-1 loss to Rangers after coming off the bench. He went on loan to Morton soon after.McInnes revealed he started Ross ahead of £200,000 signing Chris Forrester because he had been the stand-out player in training for the last few weeks since returning from an injury.“I have waited so long for that because there have been heaps of times I have been on the bench and not come on,” Ross said.“I made my debut ages ago, four years ago, with five minutes at the end of a match at Dens Park.“You do start to think when will my chance come. When you see players come in and start you do think ‘why is that not me?’“I started one game last year at Dundee at Dens Park but the cup-tie was the first time I started at home.“It was great to get

be repaired next year.The Old Aberdeen community previously hit out at the eyesore repairs undertaken to a section of the cobbled High Street.The works, at College Bounds and High Street, were undertaken by Aberdeen City Council in May this year, to improve safety in the area where there were sections of missing stones.It emerged that to make the repairs, it would cost Aberdeen City Council more than £100,000, which the local authority said could not be accommodated within the current financial year’s budget.The Old Aberdeen Community Council, alongside councillors, wrote to the local authority urging officers to take urgent remedial action, with Councillor Alexander McLellan even writing to outside bodies in a bid to secure the funding that was needed to carry out the repairs.At a meeting of the Old Aberdeen Community Council on Tuesday evening, a roads officer revealed that a source of funding has now been identified, and that it is hoped work will be carried out in the spring.Transport spokesman at Aberdeen City Council and ward councillor for Old Aberdeen, Ross Grant, said: “When there is a defect in the cobbles the problem can become a domino effect if it’s not dealt with.“The council officers said that 70 metres of the road will be reconditioned – where the cobbles will be taken up and relayed in the full and proper way.”Repairs were carried out after a member of the public tripped on the cobblestones and reported it to the council.The problem was classified as a category two defect by safety inspectors and, as a result, the repairs had to be carried out within a week.Pouring tarmac on the road was deemed the fastest way to temporarily repair the area without damaging the cobblestones.To fully repair the road, it will take six to eight weeks, followed by a further four weeks to cure.Mr Grant added: “The work the council is carrying out is to repair the road as properly as they can.“As an administration, we are committed to seeing the works through and keeping the community involved.”Utilities companies need to be given three months’ statutory notice to plan work, which made an immediate permanent fix earlier this year

at the centre of plans by Aberdeen boxing champion Lee McAllister to create a £10 million health and fitness village.Bosses at the garden centre have cited issues with the new AWPR route as the reason behind their possible move. If the offer for the school is accepted, it would see the garden centre moved to the Riverview Drive premises.It would also see the business expanded, with the addition of free community allotments, a horticultural classroom for groups and schools, a children’s play area and a farmer’s market.Gordon McGillivray, joint owner of Parkhill Garden Centre, said: “We have put in an offer for the former Cordyce School site.\u0026#8220Parkhill is already a popular venue used as a meeting place for local people and businesses.\u0026#8220It would be even more accessible at Cordyce for those who walk or are dependent on public transport.“The previous B977 Dyce to Balmedie road was there when our nursery business moved in 1984 from Allenvale to its present site.“Prior to the AWPR the original road was on the same level as the garden centre, there was a forest at the opposite side of the road and our own tree shelter belt at our side of the road.\u0026#8220This gave complete protection from the prevailing winter winds from the west.”The new road has been elevated to rise up, which has left the centre exposed to the winds, which is blowing salt on to the premises in winter, and knocking plants off displays in the summer.Gordon said: “We have been aware of the possible problems from the AWPR scheme for some considerable time but we were continually told by Transport Scotland that no decision could be reached before the scheme was finished.\u0026#8220The artificial wind break has not been successful.“Due to our inability to display plants outside for sale, throughout the road salt spreading season, we cannot continue to trade profitably through the winter months.”The company is hopeful that members of the public will lend their support to the proposal and the hardworking staff, with the hope that more job opportunities could be created in the move to Dyce.Meanwhile, boxer Lee McAllister has also submitted an application to Aberdeen City Council for the Cordyce School premises.The “Aberdeen Assassin” has proposed £10 million plans to turn the disused school into a health and fitness village.It would see the facility as a location for children and adults with disabilities, recovering cancer patients, people with mental health issues, recovering drug and alcohol addicts and the homeless.Proposals for the site include a multi-purpose gym and a pool.The boxer said: “If we win the bid and they are willing to work together we’d be more than happy to work alongside them.”A Transport Scotland and Aberdeen City Council declined to comment.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dees forbes relishes locos test","story":"\t\t\t\t\tBanks o’ Dee co-manager Tommy Forbes is looking forward to the challenge of taking on Highland League Inverurie Locos.Dee meet the Railwaymen at Harlaw Park tonight in the first round of the Evening Express Aberdeenshire Cup.The tie was originally scheduled for August 1, but clashed with Locos’ involvement in the Irn-Bru Cup play-off round.Forbes said: “It’s still early in the season.

As ever, I will looking into every issue brought to my attention by local residents across my council ward.After travelling back to Islay I checked up on the state of road repairs across the island. Some progress has been made in many areas like the Hospital Road in Bowmore and Mansefield Road in Port Ellen. The potholes in Port Askaig that I had been telling our roads department about have been filled in.After calling and emailing around about the large and dangerous potholes at An Creagan Place in Port Charlotte, I have been informed that the road in this area is not the responsibility of Argyll and Bute Council.

The Tories’ policy is set to cost around £4 million – yet boosting the wages of those receiving less than the real living wage would cost, at most, under £400,000.This smacks of utter hypocrisy from the Tories, after their comments of recent days regarding pay for forces personnel.What the Tories are choosing to overlook is the immense benefits service personnel have living in Scotland, like free prescriptions and university tuition fees for their children.  And it’s only those earning above £33k who pay a fraction more.If they are so concerned with equality – why aren’t they ensuring that all MoD staff are paid the living wage?Boosting the incomes of the lowest paid MoD staff could cost the Tories less than a tenth of what they are spending to top up higher incomes – yet once again, for people on lower incomes they are not prepared to lift a finger.The Tories’ double standards know no bounds – it’s one rule for the elite and another for the rest.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"the sands of time are running out","story":"\t\tDorothy H CrawfordUpdated: 02/08/18, 6:33 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAncient sayings relating to sand generally highlight its abundance. In the Bible for example: ‘I will…make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.’ But despite estimates that Earth contains roughly seven quintillion, 500 quadrillion grains of sand, world stocks are running dangerously low.Chemically, sand is mostly silicon dioxide, and is non-renewable.  It is essential for manufacturing bricks, plaster, glass, microchips, and above all concrete the most popular and versatile modern building material.  Concrete accounts for 75 per cent of our demand for sand with around 20 billion tons produced globally each year.  Even so, surely there’s an almost infinite sand supply from deserts.Unfortunately not.  Sand grains come in different shapes and sizes, and while desert sand has small, smooth grains, concrete requires large, coarse-grained sand.  This is generally mined from rivers, beaches and the sea bed.  And because international control of sand mining is well-nigh impossible, sand piracy is rife, causing huge ecological damage.Recently, 24 Indonesian islands were mined to extinction, with most of the sand used for land reclamation in Singapore, the world’s largest sand importer.Our dependence on concrete is not just for new builds.  Concrete’s life expectancy is just 50-60 years, after which so-called ‘concrete creep’ allows water seepage that corrodes supporting metal structures. So more concrete is required to repair or replace old buildings.Now engineers are coming up with ingenious ideas for repairing cracked concrete, including using bacteria and fungi that produce calcium carbonate.This could heal micro-cracks but the process will be years in development, while right now the US spend around $79 billion annually on bridge and highway maintenance and there are an estimated 188 million daily trips across ‘at risk’ bridges.Many UK bridges are similarly at risk, so do we have a solution? The short answer is ‘no’, but right now the race is on to find new, more durable building materials to replace the need for sand and in so-doing preserve marine ecosystems.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures 4","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/08/18, 11:35 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowReader Fiona McCuish provides this week\u0026#8217s photograph, which features the Crinan Basin in colourful glory despite driecht overcast weather.

However, they often endure short, painful lives without the most basic requirements.This is where SPANA makes such a huge difference, ensuring animals have access to the free veterinary treatment they urgently need when they are sick or injured.Actors Dame Judi Dench and Joanna Lumley are throwing their support behind this year’s event, and we hope your readers will be inspired to take part and help transform the lives of working animals around the world.The SPANA World Tea Party fundraising pack, full of free recipes, is available from www.spana.org/teaparty or by calling 020 7831 3999.SPANA World Tea Party Host, Tom HorsfieldSir,It only takes one person to put a stop to the accidental loss of life to drowning.With recent headlines being filled with tragic stories of people losing their lives to drowning, Lesley Laird, Shadow Scottish Secretary and the Royal Life Saving Society UK (RLSS UK) urge the public to be that \u0026#8216one person\u0026#8217: take some simple precautions and get \u0026#8216water smart\u0026#8217, before cooling off this summer.For more information on the issue, the statistics involved and interview opportunities, please contact Claire Huggins on 0300 323 0096 or email clairehuggins@rlss.org.ukSenior Communications Executive, Claire HugginsSir,There are more people using Instagram for interiors inspiration than ever before, but 70 percent of Scottish Instagram users feel dissatisfied with their homes after looking at images of other people’s houses on social media, a study has found.Researchers who polled 1,500 UK adults using social media for inspiration with their homes, found that a whopping 66 percent of those are displeased with their home. They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ (HDD).energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"late inveraray surge leaves islanders sweating","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 10/08/18, 7:14 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Bute 3 Inveraray 2Bute saw off a late fight-back from the Inveraray second team to win at the Meadows.With Gregor Mather missing for Inveraray and Graham MacPherson serving the second of a two-match suspension, Kieran Kirkhope provided cover in goals.The sun was shining as the hosts drew first blood, punishing the Inveraray defence for not dealing with a routine corner. The ball made its way through to the unmarked Robert Walker who had the simple task of tapping the ball home to open the scoring with 15 minutes played.Bute’s centre line started to dominate play and John MacCallum set up Iain MacDonald who made it 2-0 five minutes before the break.Inveraray came out stronger in the second half, enjoying the bulk of play, but it was Bute who scored a third goal with Robert Walker netting with 15 minutes remaining.The goal seemed to spark life into the Inveraray team who went on to score two goals in a four-minute spell.Craig Taylor fired home an unstoppable shot on 79 minutes, and just a couple of minutes later captain John MacKenzie made it 3-2.The visitors almost snatched a draw at the death through a Steven Cameron shot which went just inches wide of goal.Taynuilt 2 Kilmory 3Alister MacArthur scored twice as Kilmory beat Taynuilt at the Taynuilt Sports Field.Taynuilt started strongly, but while they dominated play the Kilmory keeper didn’t have a save to make the home side missed chances.The second half was only three minutes old when Alister MacArthur, who individually has scored more goals than the whole Taynuilt team this season, showed the reason why by firing the ball past Reid in the Taynuilt goal.He repeated the feat five minutes later to give Kilmory a two goal cushion.This seemed to stir Taynuilt into action and David Campbell scored from the edge of the D on the hour to reduce the deficit.Taynuilt went all out for the equaliser but were caught out on 72 minutes when Sandy Leiper ran away from his marker and laid the ball off to Ally MacLennan to slip it passed Reid and restore Kilmory\u0026#8217s two-goal advantage.It was a crucial strike as the home side pulled a goal back just six minutes later after a well-worked corner between David Campbell and Jamie MacFarlane with the latter firing a shot passed the Kilmory keeper to make it 3-2.Taynuilt laid siege to the Kilmory goal for the remainder of the game but they lacked the composure to get an equaliser.Best for Kilmory were Jones, Cunningham, and MacArthur and man of the match, Leiper.Kilmory leapfrog Taynuilt in the league and unless Taynuilt can find someone to put the ball in the net, they are going to be in the relegation dog-fight.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"imagination and colour at lochgilphead lego show","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 11/08/18, 6:31 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA vast array of imaginative models were on display at the two-day Lochgilphead Lego Show.Lochgilphead Community Centre was the venue for the weekend of plastic brick magic on Saturday August 4 and Sunday August 5.Interactive workshops with Glasgow-based Bricks4Kids gave an insight into basic engineering using Lego, while the imagination room did exactly what the name suggests.

Saints had the majority of possession in the second 20 minutes but the Star back line of Kyle Selfridge, Andy Weir and Luke Naisby remained resolute along with Luke Kalache in goal.The other sides in group two were debutants Port Glasgow who ran out 2-0 winners against Neilston as two first half goals sealed the match in the Inverclyde men’s favour.Red Star’s next game against Neilston was an entertaining affair. After a goalless first half, Star took the lead through Ian McGuinness before an equaliser from Neilston after some sloppy defending. Innes Meikle restored the Red Star advantage with a long range effort which he curled away from the Neilston keeper for 2-1. Star were once again pegged back however as a free kick into the box bamboozled Kalache in the box and ended up in the back of the net. Just as it looked like the points would be shared Gregor Peacock got on the end of a Cammy MacDonald flick on and headed into the net to secure a 3-2 win for the hosts.Oban Saints and Port Glasgow took to the Astro next and the Oban side soon got into their stride and ran out comfortable 2-0 winners to move to the top of the section on goal difference.Saints stayed on to play their final group match against Neilston and they continued to play some excellent attacking football with Donald Campbell scoring the pick of the goals in a 3-0 win to secure top spot.This left Red Star and Port Glasgow to face each other in the final game to determine who would go through as runners up. Both sides were keen to secure the victory but the defences remained on top in a 0-0 draw and the Lochgilphead side made it through after picking up five points from their three matches with Port Glasgow finishing on four.Over at the Ropework, Campbeltown Pupils opened up their campaign with a 1-0 victory over local rivals Tarbert. Kilsyth, making their tournament debut, also got off to an excellent start with a 3-1 victory over Dunoon.Dunoon stayed on to play against old rivals Campbeltown Pupils in what turned out to be a feisty encounter with the Pupils running out 2-1 winners thanks to a Martin McCallum free kick in the final minute.Tarbert then took on Kilsyth in a 1-1 stalemate, with Nikki MacDougall scoring the equaliser, before fighting out another draw with Dunoon to end the campaign with two points.This left Kilsyth and Pupils fighting for the top two spots in the final match of the section and the North Lanarkshire side edged the tie 1-0 to secure top spot and a semi-final against Red Star.The first semi-final saw Oban Saints take on Campbeltown Pupils, with Saints taking the lead in the first half after Fraser McFarlane was felled in the box. Up stepped Lewis Cameron to make no mistake from the spot.Pupils weren’t lying down, however and got back into the game with a penalty of their own to equalise, and will be disappointed not to have forced a winner late on.The match was decided by a penalty shoot-out and Saints eventually came out in top on a contest that swung back and forward, providing some excellent entertainment for the crowd that had gathered.The second semi-final also proved to be an exciting affair as Red Star took on Kilsyth. The hosts fell behind early on when Kilsyth opened the scoring after their midfielder finished well from 20 yards to beat Kalache in the Star goal.Red Star equalised soon after with a Ben Forbes wonder strike from 30 yards which thundered past the Kilsyth keeper. Star took the lead when Gregor Peacock was barged in the box and Andy Weir stepped up to fire the penalty beyond the ‘keeper to give the hosts the lead. Kilsyth were causing Star plenty of problems however and were level again before the half-time whistle when a scramble in the box saw the ball deflect in off the unfortunate Luke Naisby.The winner came for Star early in the second half when Kilsyth couldn’t clear a free kick into the box and the ball broke kindly to John Kennedy, who volleyed home to secure the win and send Red Star into the final where for the second year in a row they would face Oban Saints.Into the final and the Red Star side were clearly feeling the effects of their exertions as they struggled to contain a fluid Oban Saints attack early on. Saints had a couple of good attempts saved by Luke Kalache before Matt Rippon opened the scoring after the ball broke kindly on the edge of the box.The Premier division side put themselves 2-0 up on the stroke of half time when more good play saw the ball fall to Shaun MacIver who bundled home.The second half saw Saints stretch their lead through James Ford before Cammy McDonald pulled a late consolation for Red Star but it was Oban Saints who ran out deserved 3-1 winners and won the tournament for the second year running.Saints also had the Player of the Tournament, which was awarded to Lewis Cameron who was excellent throughout the day.Red Star would like to thank all the teams and officials who took part in the competition, as well as the Stag Hotel for their excellent hospitality.Tomorrow Red Star round off their pre-season schedule with a home match against Helensburgh which will take place at the Ropework, with a 2pm kick-off.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK.

It strikes me this sort of selfish attitude is something that may also be contributing to the growing problem of drivers throwing rubbish out their windows on Argyll\u0026#8217s road network.If you can\u0026#8217t find a public toilet, at least find a tree to hide behind when you\u0026#8217re caught short \u0026#8211 and a bin to chuck your rubbish in.Name and address supplied.Sir,At Royal Mail we never forget that we form an essential part of the UK’s social fabric.We know our postmen and postwomen are valued members of the local community as they deliver letters and parcels six days a week \u0026#8211 in all weathers.

Builder John MacDonald followed with colourful tales of Archie McVicar, with whom he worked as a young man.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex (number two) from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

The Labour list MSP hit out as it was announced rail users traveling to Glasgow from Kilmarnock will have to shell out an additional \u0026pound55 for season passes. Regulated rail fares are set to rise by 3.2 per cent, in line with the retail price index rate of inflation, from January. That will see a season pass increase from \u0026pound1692 to \u0026pound1746. Commuters in Ayr would see an increase of \u0026pound78 from \u0026pound2452 to \u0026pound2530 for a season pass. Mr Smyth said: “These rail fare rises are unwanted, unwelcome and unnecessary. “It is simply unfair that commuters in Ayrshire are being burdened with these rip-off rail fares for less than satisfactory services.  “The cost of rail fares being paid by passengers is simply unacceptable, with passengers from Kilmarnock having to fork out \u0026pound1746 a year to travel to and from work. “Scottish Labour is clear: it’s high time working people stopped having to pay such excessive fares to simply line the pockets of private companies. “Only Labour is fighting for a publicly owned railway which will serve the many, not just the few.” Elsewhere, an annual Lockerbie-Edinburgh fare will now cost \u0026pound5250 – up \u0026pound162 – after the Scotish Government decided peak fares were to increase. Transport secretary Michael Matheson said the rises were “unwelcome” and stressed action had been taken to minimise them.  Increases in off-peak fares in Scotland will be held at 2.2 per cent as the government have pledged to cap them at 1 per cent below inflation. All fares in England will rise by the RPI rate of inflation. Mr Matheson said: “This means in Scotland average fares increases are lower than England and Wales.” In recent months staff from rail union RMT have staged protests in cities around the UK. Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT, said it was “nothing short of a scandal” that ticket prices were up to five times more than fares in Europe. Lib Dem MSP Mike Rumbles MSP said the rises are the last thing hard-up passengers need.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnLabour PartyScottish LabourGlasgowAyrKilmarnockEconomyTransportLockerbieKilmarnock NewsTransport ScotlandCheap travel"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"musical tribute concert honour loved","story":"NewsMusical tribute concert will honour loved onesFollowing on from the success of last year’s event, the Joan Price Memorial Concert will take to the stage once again next month.Share\u0026nbspByAbi Smillie16:27, 22 AUG 2018NewsColin Price and Pauline Moriarty join together for the tribute concert (Image: Ayrshire Post)Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA musical tribute concert will honour the lives of two well loved members of the community. Following on from the success of last year’s event, the Joan Price Memorial Concert will take to the stage once again next month. Joan Price, a beloved trombone player, was tragically killed in a road traffic accident in January 2017 by two boy racers who are now serving jail sentences. Joan’s fellow band members wanted to do something to honour her memory and decided to organise a concert featuring all three bands which she had played for. Kilmarnock Concert Brass, Irvine \u0026amp Dreghorn Brass Band and Dunaskin Doon Band will join together on September 1 to pay tribute to the Troon gran. The brass band show will now be an annual event, with each band taking it in turns to nominate a charity. This year Kilmarnock Concert Brass has chosen Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out (SCIO) as the worthy recipients. Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out (SCIO) supports bereaved families of suicide victims and any troubled person by providing and funding services such as counselling, music, play and drama therapy.  The charity was set up by mum, Pauline Moriarty, originally from Ayr, following the suicide of her 13-year-old daughter, Jenna. The concert will honour Joan and Jenna with traditional marches, big band hits, movie themes and film scores. Tasty treats and a raffle will be on offer during the interval. Colin, Joan’s husband said: “Our family is delighted and honoured that the three bands have decided to make this concert an annual event in Joan’s memory. A lot of hard work goes on behind the scenes to make a concert like this happen and I’m indebted to everyone who has helped or who is playing on the night. “Last year’s concert was a fantastic night of entertainment and I’m looking forward to meeting many old and new friends again this year.” Pauline Moriarty added: “We are so touched the bands have chosen to raise funds for the work of a Beautiful Inside \u0026amp Out (SCIO). It is such a lovely tribute to Joan Price and it will help us to potentially save lives.” Joan Price Memorial Concert will take place on Saturday, September 1 at 7pm at Kyle Academy on Overmills Road in Ayr. Tickets, \u0026pound7 (under 12s and over 65s \u0026pound5) are available by emailing secretary@ddband or messaging Dunaskin Doon Band on their Facebook page. A limited number of tickets will also be available on the night.

Fraser and Freya Russell have qualified for the National final of the American Golf Junior Golf Championships. The pair, who live in Troon and attend Marr College, progressed from the qualifying competition held at Leven Links Golf Club and now go forward to the final which will be televised on Sky Sports later this year. Competing in the gross score stroke play competition, 14-year-old Fraser, who incredibly plays off a five handicap at Royal Troon, put in a superb performance to take the qualifier with a score of nine over par. Not to be outdone by her older brother, Freya, 12, put in a fantastic performance to score 32 points in a stableford off a handicap of 13 in the girls’ net score competition. That was enough to take top spot and secure a spot in the final at Gainsborough Golf Club, where she will take on the UK and Ireland’s best girls. Speaking after the qualifier, Fraser said: “I am delighted with how I played, it will be a great chance for me to play golf on a good stage and I can test myself against some of the best.”  And younger sister Freya is looking forward to the continuing her golfing journey as she commented: “I love to play different golf courses, meeting new friends and getting to play golf with other girl golfers.” The pair play their junior medals on the Portland Course at Royal Troon, but due to their impressive handicaps they are allowed to enter in competitions that are played on the par 71 Old Course. They are both coached by Royal Troon pro Kieron Stevenson. Both Fraser and Freya represent Ayrshire for their age levels, and Freya has been playing with the West of Scotland U18 team since she was just nine. And they both played in the World Championships at the stunning Pinehurst course, which held both the men’s and women’s US Open just a year later - won respectively by Martin Kaymer and Michelle Wie.  Pinehurst has also been pencilled in for the 2019 US Amateur Championships and the 2024 US Open. The pair’s dad, Craig, has always played golf and he helped get them into the sport. Craig, who played golf for Cambridge University, said: “They have always been interested in golf. “I took Fraser to play at a young age, and Freya’s first steps were when she got up to pick up her brother’s golf club! “I’ve never forced it on them though, anytime they play golf it’s because they want to, which I think is the key. “They aren’t just into golf though, Fraser plays rugby for Marr and Freya wants to play hockey for her school, and both of them swim.” "},{"url":null,"title":"new-galashiels-agency-searching-for-tv-and-film-extras","story":"A NEW Galashiels business hopes to give locals their big break, by becoming TV and film extras.\nFirefly Casting and Modelling Agency recently opened in the town\u0026rsquos Overhaugh Street, and as the film industry in Scotland continues to grow, the business aims to showcase the talent the Borders has to offer.\nThe new venture, which is taking on a variety of film/TV extras, models and musicians, has been set up by Angela Jewitt and Donna Cooper, both from Clovenfords.\nAngela previously worked as a TV extra for shows such as Inspector Morse, Minder and Coronation Street and has been involved with modelling for many years.

Scottish Borders Council calling for a rethink of its benefits assistance service.\nIn November 2017 the council merged the customer, homelessness, and welfare benefits services to become one integrated department.\nNow, a petition signed by over 200 Borders residents has been handed into Scottish Borders Council, urging the authority to employ officers with a specific remit to assist benefits claimants in applying for welfare. \u0026nbsp\nThe petition further calls on the council to \u0026ldquoensure there are sufficient staff resources within Scottish Borders Council for maximisation of benefit entitlement in the Borders and to \u0026ldquoacknowledge the error made in not carrying out any public consultation on the restructure.\nThe author of the petition and chair of the Borders mental health forum, Jenny Mushlin, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom very concerned that at a time when the benefits system has become so complicated the council has changed its service.\n\u0026ldquoThere are now fewer welfare officers and they are all working across different services.\n\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom hoping this petition will give some understanding to councillors of what people are facing at the moment, and hopefully persuade them to hire more people in the future to help people with filling in of forms and other admin.\n\u0026ldquoThe welfare benefits service was a much loved service which really helped people and the changes were made with no consultation whatsoever.\n\u0026ldquoWe are calling for them to consult with people who claim welfare benefits as

has written to councillors urging them to take no further action.\nIn her statement, she said: \u0026ldquoThe aim of the restructure was to ensure that the level of service provided continued and in some areas improved, ensuring Scottish Borders Council was prepared for ongoing welfare reform including the rollout of universal credit.\n\u0026ldquoThe Department for Work and Pensions expectation on customers to self-serve online has created increased demands on Council services to assist customers.\n\u0026ldquoPrior to November 2017 the equivalent of 1.7 welfare benefit assistants were employed to assist with basic benefit enquiries including form filling with customers.\n\u0026ldquoWe now have 49 customer advice and support advisors across a wider range of locations, with a remit to assist customers at the first point of contact with their enquiry whether they present in a locality office face to face, over the telephone or online.\n\u0026ldquoThese advisers already deal with

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do? Are they determined to strip Prestonpans of everything?  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe changes being made differ from those proposed in 2016. Housing enquiries will continue to be dealt with at Aldhammer House, while payments for other services can be made at the library. This will in turn improve the range of services available at our improved library \u0026ndash and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received on this from customers so far.  Tim Porteus, Prestonpans storyteller and Courier columnist, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom disappointed. I recognise the council is under pressure to make cuts but they should say that it what is about: saving money."},{"url":null,"title":"catriona-matthew-brings-solheim-cup-to-north-berwick","story":"  Matthew will captain the European team for the event \u0026ndash the female equivalent of the Ryder Cup \u0026ndash and was in her home town on Monday to start the countdown.

For some it was a practical way to live in the country they have chosen to call home for others it was a way to end anxiety over their future under Brexit.  Christa Gerdwilker, 51, has lived in Scotland for over 30 years. She and wife Susan live in East Saltoun but she said the uncertainty over what would happen when Britain leaves the European Union had prompted her to seek UK citizenship.  Christa said: \u0026ldquoBrexit is the reason I decided to apply for citizenship.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove lived here for 30 years and came with certain expectations thinking we were secure but it has pulled the rug from right under our feet and suddenly the future is uncertain.  \u0026ldquoIt has caused some sleepless nights and so it made sense to get permanent residency.  The ceremonies, which are held in East Lothian three or four times a year, are the final part of applying to become a British citizen.  Since April 2016, 103 people have taken part in a ceremony in East Lothian.  Each person who takes part is presented with a certificate confirming their residency status and a welcome pack. East Lothian Council also presents everyone who takes part in a ceremony in the county with a memento of the occasion.  The Lord Lieutenant said: \u0026ldquoFor the people here it is the end of a journey which for some has been a very long one. It can be an emotional moment for many and is important to them.  \u0026ldquoIt is extraordinary to see the range of places people are from who want to be UK citizens.  The ceremony was held in the Adam Room at John Muir House and overseen by registrar Janet Fairnie.  East Lothian Provost John McMillan and Angela Leitch, chief executive of East Lothian Council, joined the ceremony welcoming the new citizens, who were watched by family and friends invited along.  Mr McMillan told the new citizens: \u0026ldquoCitizenship brings certain privileges. You now live in a parliamentary democracy where everyone is equal in the eyes of the law. It brings with it a responsibility to treat fellow citizens with respect and be good neighbours, and to take an active part in society, which I hope you will.  Ms Leitch praised the East Lothian residents who had gained their new status.  She said: \u0026ldquoI know it has been quite a journey for some who have come through a process that many of us who have lived in this country all our lives do not have to go through.  The citizenship process involves a series of tests which those applying have to pass, quizzing them on all aspects of British life.  Mohamed Sherif, 31, an engineer from Musselburgh, has lived here for 10 years and is originally from Libya. He said: \u0026ldquoIt is a lot easier to have citizenship than have to spend a lot of money on renewing visas.  \u0026ldquoWe know we want to stay in this country so it made sense to apply.  The seven new citizens who attended were: Christa Gerdwilker (originally from Germany), East Saltoun Mohamed Sherif (Libya), Musselburgh Carmen King (Mexico), Ormiston Bernadette Fitzgerald (Australia), Tranent Diego Onate (Colombia), East Saltoun Gabriele Hegerl (Germany), East Linton John Crowley (USA), East Linton."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-a-bath-in-butterdean-wood","story":"  BEING surrounded by trees, in a wood where the world outside cannot be seen, is a primeval experience. It connects us to our ancestral origins and reasserts our relationship with nature, of which we are also a part. There are few such important gifts that we can give our children, and ourselves, than a regular forest bath.  The term forest bathing of course comes from Japan, where it was first coined in the 1980s to describe the mental health benefits of regular meditative time spend in the woods. But the spiritual and mental uplift that nature provides has long been known, and here in Scotland the Celtic tradition in particular has a powerful relationship with trees and the nature.  But we are forgetting it all. We are forgetting who we are and from what we came. And we are suffering as a result.  Another recent term is nature deficit disorder, a phrase created by Richard Louv who wrote Last Child in the Woods in 2005. While it is not an actually recognised medical condition as such, putting a name on the effects of nature deprivation has made people more aware of it.  So for my final journey of discovery this summer, I took a friend who is unused to spending time in nature for a walk in Butterdean Wood. I cannot put into words how important this place is for my family and my soul. My children have grown up, and are growing up, in this wonderful wood. It\u0026rsquos a cradle of nature where you can feel simultaneously lost and found, for the trees envelop you, as if to say \u0026ldquowelcome back.  It\u0026rsquos horrific to think that a number of years ago there was a plan to cut the wood down, but thanks to Gregor Neil Robertson and others, a campaign to save the wood, supported by Friends of the Earth, was successful.  My friend suffers from depression and anxiety. When I told him I planned a walk in a wood he protested. He has weight issues as well, and going for a walk is something he knows he should do, but doesn\u0026rsquot enjoy.  \u0026ldquoYou will enjoy this walk, I reassured him.  \u0026ldquoDon\u0026rsquot think so, was his reply, but he nonetheless finally agreed to come along, after I\u0026rsquod promised it would only be a short one.  There are different options when you begin to explore the wood, but my family have a favourite part and so that\u0026rsquos where I took him. Trees have a way of bringing feelings to the surface and soon my friend was talking about stuff.  We first wandered through the pine wood. It\u0026rsquos planted with mainly non-native pine trees but has a wonderful atmosphere.  I told him of the story about the brownie who hides in the wood, because he is fearful of humans whom he believes to be cruel after witnessing a farmer\u0026rsquos son whip a horse.  The story took us to what my children call the \u0026lsquofaerie bridge\u0026rsquo. It is here that the wood changes in character. Once across the bridge the wood is more mixed, with mainly deciduous trees: oak, rowan, ash, sycamore, beech and hazel, but also the occasional Scots pine.  \u0026ldquoCheck for something metal on you, I told my friend. He looked at me funny. \u0026ldquoEh?  \u0026ldquoSomething made of iron or metal of some kind, I reiterated.  \u0026ldquoWhat for?  \u0026ldquoWell, because the faeries live in the part of the wood across the bridge, but iron undoes their magic. So you are safe if you are wearing something made of it, I explained.  \u0026ldquoSeriously?  I just smiled. He was lucky, he had a metal strap on his watch. And so we ventured over the bridge.  This part of Butterdean Wood is vivid green in high summer. We soon reached a junction in the path.  \u0026ldquoOK, this is the short way back, we\u0026rsquoll take that. I was keeping my promise that we\u0026rsquod only go on a short walk. But my friend protested.  \u0026ldquoOh naw, let\u0026rsquos go on for a bit more, I\u0026rsquom actually enjoying this.  And so we ventured further, past the tall beech tree which still has the rough end of a rope tied round one of its upper branches. It was here, in summers about 10 years ago, my now grown-up daughters would swing on the rope swing I made for them.  We sat here for a short while so my friend could take a breath. He noticed the silence, which was then softly broken by the swish of tree tops swaying in a breeze. We sat for perhaps two minutes, not looking at each other, but just being present under the canopy of nature.  \u0026ldquoOK, he said, \u0026ldquoyou\u0026rsquore right, it is magic.  I smiled and nodded.  We walked, at a guess, over three miles through Butterdean Wood on this day. I introduced him to different trees and we paused often, soaking in the power of it all. It\u0026rsquos a place of constant minor changes, as all woods are, and it\u0026rsquos only when you visit them regularly that you notice the changes.  As we left, my friend commented on how much better he felt, how his anxiety had eased and that he\u0026rsquod want to come back with his son.  \u0026ldquoButterdean Wood would be a gift for your son, I said, \u0026ldquolet him bathe in the forest too.  We all need this, and on a regular basis. We need to find time for it, find a wood we can reach and bathe in. It benefits our health in so many ways but it also helps us to connect and have a relationship with nature. It should be a birthright of our children to run free in the wood, to explore and become part of it.  Later in the week I returned with my children. We followed our trails of memory, my older daughters walking in their own footprints of younger years, which are now overlaid with the imprint of their younger siblings. I searched but saw no signs of autumn.  But soon the summer will end, and the heatwaves of 2018 will become part of our folk memory.  Autumn in Butterdean is nature\u0026rsquos show, but it\u0026rsquos not ready for that yet, it\u0026rsquos still fully clothed in summer\u0026rsquos colours."},{"url":null,"title":"disgraceful-state-of-north-berwick-toilets-slammed","story":"  The quality of the toilets on the town\u0026rsquos Quality Street has long been lauded by residents and visitors alike, but last week it drew criticism from one resident, who contacted the Courier to offer her concerns.  Helen Mulgray wrote: \u0026ldquoI was shocked to see how the cleanliness of the toilets had deteriorated.  \u0026ldquoThese once highly praised, award-winning toilets have been degraded to become offensive and at times a health hazard \u0026ndash no soap to wash hands and no toilet paper unless [it is] picked off the floor.  She described the condition of the toilets as a \u0026ldquodisgraceful memory of a visit to North Berwick for the thousands of visitors that flock to the town every summer.  East Lothian Council is currently proposing to cut the permanent toilet attendants at the county\u0026rsquos public loos and instead see them maintained by an extended team of mobile attendants.  Ms Mulgray slammed the council for the proposal, adding: \u0026ldquoImplementing the proposed plan to do away with full-time attendants means this mess will be a permanent sight for visitors to the toilets.  \u0026ldquoIt takes no account of the crowds coming from the beach until late, busloads stopping at the car park, and events like the Fringe [by the Sea] and the [Highland] Games.  \u0026ldquoIs saving money this way more important than the tourist image of North Berwick?  Ms Mulgray added that when she returned to the toilets last Monday, they were \u0026ldquospotless.  She put the improvements down to the fact that the usual full-time attendant had returned from annual leave.  Ms Mulgray wrote to the council to express her concerns about the toilets being allowed to deteriorate last week and, in a response seen by the Courier, Lorraine Faulds, senior officer of facilities management, wrote: \u0026ldquoLooking at your specific concerns with North Berwick toilets, it has been maintained by a combination of permanent and mobile attendants for more than six years.  \u0026ldquoThis pattern has ensured appropriate levels of cleanliness throughout the year and includes recognition of the busier summer months.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that at any toilet, on any occasion, whether by intent or accident, toilets or sinks can be blocked by paper or left as debris.  \u0026ldquoFortunately these remain isolated incidents at our sites and North Berwick toilets actually have a more frequent attendance by the mobile attendants than some of our other sites.  She said the emptying of sanitary bins would increase from once a week to twice due to Ms Mulgray\u0026rsquos complaint of them \u0026ldquooverflowing.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoWe take our service provision extremely seriously and aim to maintain the very high standards of our public toilets.

It comes as the number of lairs at Deer Park Cemetery, opposite where the proposed new burial ground would be sited, reaches a dangerously low figure.  Ward councillor Norman Hampshire stressed the importance of new burial spaces being created in the town.  Mr Hampshire, chairman of the council planning committee, was unable to comment on the merits of any specific application because of his role on the committee.  But he said: \u0026ldquoI have been told by officers, early next year there will be no spaces available in the cemetery.  \u0026ldquoIt would mean people in the community would need to be buried outwith the town, which would not be acceptable to people. There is a desperate need for [a new] cemetery within Dunbar.  The proposed new cemetery comes as part of a controversial planning application approved by the planning committee last year.  More than 100 houses are set to be built on land at Newtonlees Farm, despite the site being outwith the sites identified at that stage by the council\u0026rsquos Local Development Plan and recommended for refusal by planning officers.  Mr Hampshire ultimately had the casting vote on the Gladman Developments scheme after the vote at the council meeting was tied at 4-4.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe original proposal had been to extend the existing cemetery.  \u0026ldquoHowever, when the consent was given for a housing development along with the golf course at Dunbar Golf Club, the land was not secured at that time by the council.  \u0026ldquoThere have now been more burials in the cemetery and the way the layout is the bit of land that was available to purchase would not have created the substantial extension that would have been viable for the future in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoThat is why the council had to look at alternative sites to create a new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoThe two cemeteries are very close to each other.  \u0026ldquoThere will be parking still available in the old Deer Park site and some new parking created within the new cemetery.  \u0026ldquoI think the two will work well together and be a cemetery which is available for a long number of years and satisfy the needs of the Dunbar community.  Deer Park Cemetery opened in 1953 and is expected, according to East Lothian Council, to reach capacity by the summer of 2020.  There are a total of 1,300 lairs in Deer Park cemetery, which are expected to be full within 18-24 months.  A spokeswoman for the council said: \u0026ldquoThe size of the proposed cemetery is approximately 1.2 hectares offering 2,000 lairs, 700 ashes-only lairs and an area for woodland burial.

The town\u0026rsquos St Gabriel\u0026rsquos Primary School would be unaffected.  The merged school would continue to operate over the two sites within the existing buildings and facilities, but with a single management team.  Currently, Prestonpans Infant and Nursery School, on West Loan, has a school roll of 358 up to P3, with the primary school, on Preston Road, home to 332 pupils from P4 to P7.  The leadership of Prestonpans Early Learning and Childcare Centre, which opened last year on Kirk Street to provide additional nursery places for the town, would also transfer to the headteacher of the new single school structure if the move goes ahead.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, was surprised to hear the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoFirstly, I would like to see the details of it and what is behind the proposals because the infant school is a superbly-run school and works exceptionally well.  \u0026ldquoThe primary school is a very well-run and successful school as well \u0026ndash we have got two very well-run and successful schools.  \u0026ldquoWe would need to look at what the implications are.  Fiona Robertson, East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos head of education, stressed the local authority was \u0026ldquoabsolutely committed to continuously improving the quality of education at the two schools.  She said: \u0026ldquoOur Education Service Local Improvement Plan sets out a range of key outcomes, one of which is to ensure consistency in our approaches to planning learning, teaching and assessment.  \u0026ldquoWe believe that the proposal to establish a single school operating under a single management team offers the best solution to ensuring this consistency, improving transitions for children, and will deliver considerable educational benefits to all of the schools\u0026rsquo children and young people.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and children\u0026rsquos services, said: \u0026ldquoOur first priority is to ensure that we provide the best educational experiences and outcomes for the children and young people of Prestonpans. The consultation process will focus on how we do this through an educational benefit statement.  \u0026ldquoWe have already informed the chairs of the parent councils of this proposal.  \u0026ldquoAll parents, carers and the wider school community will have the opportunity to comment on the proposal once the consultation has been published and the statutory consultation period begins on Monday.  The consultation runs to October 2, with drop-in sessions held at both schools next month.  Prestonpans Infant School hosts a consultation event on September 4 from noon to 5pm, with the primary school event taking place a week later between the same times.  Finally, a public meeting takes place on September 26 from 7pm at Preston Lodge High School.

The scheme will apply to the section of the town north of the railway line, with major roads such as Belhaven Road also included.  All roads affected previously had 30mph speed limits.  The new order, which is an experimental order, will mirror what is already in place south of the East Coast Mainline in the Hallhill area of the town, where all the streets, with the exception of Kellie Road, are 20mph.  Herbert Coutts, from the town\u0026rsquos community council, has been heavily involved in moving the project forward and was pleased to see progress being made.  He said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased about it because that is what essentially the research carried out by the community council demonstrated. There was public support for it in Dunbar and it will be good to see it going ahead and I am hopeful the outcome will be positive.  Mr Coutts stressed that the change in speed limit would not see an end to speeding but he felt it would help improve people\u0026rsquos safety.  He added: \u0026ldquoIt was never thought by people supporting it that it was a magic answer to all our speeding problems but a step in the right direction and people become accustomed to going at 20mph in the town.  \u0026ldquoThereby the safety of pedestrians \u0026ndash particularly children and elderly but people of any age \u0026ndash will be enhanced.  \u0026ldquoThat is the hope and hopefully people will observe it.  A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe order has been made and we are just awaiting the appropriate signage, which should be within the next month.  \u0026ldquoThe order will be for an 18-month period and is an experimental order.  If the order is deemed a success, steps will be taken to see the 20mph speed limit become a permanent fixture.  Feedback from members of the public could also help decide whether any roads become exempt from the 20mph speed limit in the future.  Currently there are no plans for traffic calming measures, such as speed humps or chicanes, on the streets affected by the new speed limit.  The 20mph speed limit starts to the west of Edinburgh Road\u0026rsquos junction with Shore Road and Beveridge Row.  To the east, it comes into force as drivers make their way along the A1087."},{"url":null,"title":"your-chance-to-apply-for-thousands-of-pounds-of-support-for-your-charity","story":"  Last year, donations totalling almost \u0026pound300,000 were made up and down the country on behalf of Newsquest Media Group, one of the UK\u0027s largest publishers and owners of the East Lothian Courier.

One of the successful applicants last year was Lothian Autistic Society, which received \u0026pound5,000 for its East Lothian Basecamp service. This service supports children, aged 5-13, with autism and helps them develop social communication and social interaction skills through structured themed group and play sessions.  The foundation supports charities with projects which take a creative approach to fundamental issues such as education and neighbourhood improvements, economic development, youth development, local problem-solving, assistance to the disadvantaged or disabled, environmental conservation and cultural enrichment.  And it values projects that bring lasting benefits to local communities.  A spokesman said: \"While preference may be given to ideas which create a durable legacy for the community, judges will consider single events or projects of limited duration that otherwise meet the criteria.\"  Typically grants are made for substantial projects which require and merit awards of between \u0026pound5,000 and \u0026pound10,000, although applications can be for any size of grant and level of ambition.  The foundation will join with other contributors to support elements of larger projects, but prefers to be in a position of making a donation which will fund a project in its entirely or which constitutes the final instalment to complete a project.

The findings come at the same time as overall employment in the county has increased slightly.  Figures show that the number of people in either part-time or full-time employment in East Lothian rose to 78.6 per cent between April 2017 and March 2018, an increase of 3.6 per cent from the previous year, when the rate was at 75 per cent.  Councillor Brian Small, leader of the opposition Conservative Group on East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoObviously the fact that 4,000 households are without work is worrying.  \u0026ldquoWork isn\u0026rsquot only important for the financial benefits to those in employment, it also generates health and social benefits for them.  \u0026ldquoHaving something to get up in the morning for is good for you.  \u0026ldquoBut we have to welcome that East Lothian is better than both the UK and Scottish average but there is still more that can and should be done to get people back into work.  Peter Dicker of East Lothian Foodbank, based in Tranent, said: \u0026ldquoAlthough the statistics for the increase in the population in work is encouraging, the foodbank can only comment on the fact that over the same period that the statistics were compiled for April 2017 to March 2018 we here at East Lothian Foodbank experienced a 12 per cent increase on the number of referrals we had sent to us \u0026ndash this 12 per cent compares to a national average of a 13 per cent increase on referrals (Trussell Trust stats).  \u0026ldquoSince the introduction of Universal Credit in April 2016 we have seen an increase in people being referred to us by over 45 per cent (April 16 to March 17 was 37 per cent increase).  The figures from the ONS estimate that last year 14 per cent of households in East Lothian were workless, lower than the Scotland-wide average of 18 per cent.  County MP Martin Whitfield said: \u0026ldquoClearly the increase in the local employment rate over the last year is welcome. However, the fact there are still many people out of work remains a concern. It underlines the complacency of the UK Government, which is simply not doing enough to help people into work.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council, through its East Lothian Works employability service, is doing a good job supporting jobseekers, but both the UK and Scottish Governments must do more to enhance prosperity and create new jobs.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray added: \u0026ldquoI welcome the fact that East Lothian\u0026rsquos employment rate is higher than the Scottish average. However, too many local people are still not in work. We need a fundamental shift in how we grow our economy.  \u0026ldquoWe also need to ensure opportunities for creating these kind of jobs locally are maximised at the former Cockenzie Power Station site and the new innovation park at QMU.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoUnemployment figures in East Lothian are following a positive trend as there are over three per cent more people in employment now compared to last year.  \u0026ldquoThe council continues to strive to grow East Lothian\u0026rsquos economy and to make it the best place in Scotland to live, work and do business and we would very much hope our employment figures will continue to rise year-on-year as a result of this work.  \u0026ldquoIt is difficult to comment in detail on the figure of 4,000 households being classed as out of work as it\u0026rsquos unclear, as yet, exactly how this figure has been calculated.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to note that the roll-out of full service Universal Credit in East Lothian has had an effect on the recording of our out-of-work levels so this too needs to be looked at more closely.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Works continues to support people of all ages and abilities to gain skills, re-train and undertake courses and work experience to get them back into rewarding employment, working closely with employers and education providers. There are also many initiatives to support the most vulnerable in our society, including those living in poverty, including projects initiated by our area partnerships designed to meet the needs of our very different communities across East Lothian.  Across Scotland, the most common reason people gave for not being in work was being sick or disabled \u0026ndash 37 per cent of out-of-work individuals cited illness or disability as the primary reason.  Students made up 13 per cent of the group, and 18 per cent were early retirees, with 10 per cent of jobless people in the area officially \u0026lsquounemployed\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash looking for work and able to start within two weeks.  A spokesperson from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said: \u0026ldquoSince 2010 the proportion of workless households is down in every region of Great Britain.  \u0026ldquoThe unemployment rate remains at its lowest since 1971, but we\u0026rsquore committed to ensuring that everyone who wants to work has the opportunity to do so \u0026ndash while making sure there is a safety net for those who can\u0026rsquot.  The DWP has also said that the majority of employment growth has been in both full-time and permanent roles.  David Leese, policy analysis manager at charity the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said that workless families in particular were at a much higher risk of poverty.  Figures from the DWP for 2016-17 show that in workless households nearly 75 per cent of children were growing up in poverty, compared to only five per cent of children with two working parents.  \u0026ldquoIf a child lives in poverty, it affects their health, their education, their family relationships and their plans for the future, Mr Leese said. \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos not right that any child lives in such insecure circumstances."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-courier-pet-idol-see-the-top-50","story":"  Pictured here are all the 50 pets still in the running.

Among the East Lothian pubs to have permanently closed during this period are the Elphinstone Arms in Elphinstone The Hub in Tranent the Bay Horse in Haddington and The Hayweights, Burgh and Mrs Forman\u0026rsquos in Musselburgh.  The figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that in 2010 there were about 55 pubs and bars in East Lothian but by 2017 that had fallen to about 45.  Michael Peters, who is behind The New Pheasant in Haddington \u0026ndash which opened this week at the site of the former Pheasant, which shut in 2009 \u0026ndash was not surprised by the figures.  He said that there were a variety of reasons for the decline in the number of pubs, including the lowering of the drink-drive limit in Scotland in 2014, issues with breweries, and the state of the economy.  Mr Peters felt that there was a real need for pubs in towns and villages and said: \u0026ldquoI am not biased but every town needs a pub.  \u0026ldquoIt is not just for drinking but socialising and the community \u0026ndash nothing would be happening. Most things that happen \u0026ndash golf trips, football, anything like that \u0026ndash it is organised when you are in the pub.  \u0026ldquoWhere do most people socialise?  Across the UK, 5,745 pubs closed over the same period, and there are 54 local authorities across the country where 30 or more shut.  Pubs have been pointing the finger of blame at the taxman for their troubles, complaining about the duty on beer, VAT levels and the cost of business rates.  Britain\u0026rsquos Beer Alliance, a group of organisations in the pub and brewing sector, has started a campaign called Long Live the Local with a petition and calls for people to write to their MP to have beer duty reduced.  The latest data from the ONS shows that between 2016 and 2017, 655 pubs and bars across the UK called time for the last time.  In East Lothian there was a slight upturn in that period, with numbers up by about five.  A change in consumer habits, with people drinking at home more often, has been blamed for fewer people visiting pubs.  There are 21 areas of the country that have bucked the decline and have more pubs now than they had in 2010. Top of the list is Hackney in East London, which had 55 more bars in 2017 than it did in 2010."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-mermaids-magic-storm","story":"  AFTER our return from a final camping trip in the midges and mist, my youngest daughter started school. She needed an early-morning shower to remove the lingering smell of wood smoke in her hair this morning before getting ready.  She protested a bit, as she said she liked the smell of wood smoke because it reminded her of camping in the Highlands. But soon she was all excited to be dressed up, smart and clean for school. She is attending Prestonpans Infant School, as her big sister did before her, and as I did when it was the primary school.  She looked so smart and business-like as she walked into class with a beaming smile. We shared this moment with many other parents, who were taking the same photos and shedding similar tears. Only the day before, Skye had climbed the side of a mountain in Glencoe as if she had once been a mountain goat and proclaimed she wanted to live by a waterfall.  Now, all dressed to conform (although hair still looking slightly wild as she likes it), she has entered a formal system which in my day did its best to (literally) beat out any original creativity that didn\u0026rsquot fit in with teachers\u0026rsquo expectations.  But as our daughter walked through the same doors I had once gone through, I was uplifted by a hopeful expectation that when we come to pick her up she will be less smart, less clean and her hair even wilder. That\u0026rsquos what school should be like for a wee girl not yet reached five. And I know she is in good hands in that respect at Prestonpans Infants.  But as I kissed her goodbye this morning, she asked: \u0026ldquoCan we have tea by a campfire in the woods? The campfire had been the communal focus during our camping trip. As darkness fell, the spirit of the fire glowed brighter and danced with our imaginations as we told stories and riddles with each other. I of course agreed, but her comment helped me think of which tale to tell this week.  Much of our summer has been spent exploring the wonders of East Lothian. We explored beaches and caves. We climbed hills and moors. We swam and paddled in rivers, climbed trees and sat under them having picnics.  But wherever we went there was one thing that we always saw, even in quite remote places: litter. Sometimes there was more, sometimes there was less, but we couldn\u0026rsquot escape it. My children notice it I suppose because I mention it. Our children pick up other people\u0026rsquos litter as we walk, so we now need an extra rucksack to carry it.  \u0026ldquoWhy do people do this? asked my nine-year-old after she had watched a family sitting in a car in a car park by a beach. They had been eating sandwiches and drinking juice, and then threw all the packaging out of the windows. The plastic juice bottles rolled about in the breeze and the sandwich packaging blew away and got caught in some sea buckthorn bushes nearby. The family then drove away, no doubt having had a nice day at the beach, but leaving their rubbish for others to enjoy.  I make no apologies for sounding angry at this. And I do not blame the children, it\u0026rsquos the adults who frame this behaviour. I understand people want to keep their cars tidy but I couldn\u0026rsquot answer my daughter\u0026rsquos question as we sat watching someone else\u0026rsquos rubbish desecrate a beauty spot. I just can\u0026rsquot understand the mindset. So all I said was: \u0026ldquoWell they just don\u0026rsquot know any better I suppose, or maybe just don\u0026rsquot care.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos so sad, she replied, then went very quiet. Then she came up with an answer to the problem: a story:  \u0026lsquoThe king of the sea told all the mermaids not to go close to the shore because of the dangerous litter that humans pollute it with. One mermaid asked what litter was and the king replied it was many things, such as broken glass and plastic which kills sea creatures, as well as making the place humans live look ugly.  \u0026ldquoWhy do they do this? asked the mermaid. The king shrugged his shoulders, and said: \u0026ldquoThey must be less clever than the animals they kill.  But one day the mermaid disobeyed her king and swam to the shore close to the beach at North Berwick. But her tail was cut by broken glass and then she got caught in plastic bags floating on the surface. She was in trouble and a fisherman saw her.  He helped her remove the bags and gave her cream for her cut tail.  \u0026ldquoWhy do you people do this? she asked him. He felt ashamed because he also would throw litter. He promised her he would never do it again. But there was so much rubbish in the sea that they agreed they would try and collect it.  So the mermaid gathered her friends and collected the rubbish. The fisherman\u0026rsquos boat was soon so full that it nearly sank, and when he returned to the harbour people saw the mountain of rubbish he had caught. They laughed at him, thinking he was not a good fisherman because all he had caught was litter and rubbish.  \u0026ldquoLook, said the fisherman, \u0026ldquothis is what we are doing to the sea and the land. Why do we do this? But nobody cared.  \u0026ldquoThis is impossible, we can\u0026rsquot collect all of it, said the mermaid, \u0026ldquoand every day the wind blows more into the sea.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos hopeless, people will never change, said the fisherman. But the mermaid was angry: \u0026ldquoThey must change or else we will all die, including them too eventually.  Mermaids have powers to control the wind. They can whip up storms and so she decided she would make a very unusual, magic storm.  The wind blew not everywhere but where the litter lay. It blew all the rubbish thrown by the humans back into their houses and cars. People woke up with broken glass in their beds and plastic bags covering their children. Their homes were piled high with dangerous and ugly rubbish. When they tried to get rid of it, it just blew back in.  The countryside and sea became wonderfully litter free because of this magic storm, and when people littered the storm whipped up again and blew it straight into their house or car. They couldn\u0026rsquot escape from it. People were living knee-deep in the rubbish they had thrown out of windows or not recycled.  So soon they stopped littering because now they understood what it meant for the other creatures. Finally they cared, because they were the ones who suffered most. At last they got the wisdom of the animals.\u0026rsquo  This story, I think, would make the perfect start to any school day."},{"url":null,"title":"new-world-record-set-at-haddington-rugby-club","story":"  A total of 458 men, women and children took to the pitch at Neilson Park on Sunday as part of the Haddington 700 celebrations.

The match between Haddington President\u0026rsquos XV and Haddington Barbarians XV was kicked off by Provost John McMillan.  The councillor, who previously played for Murrayfield 3rds, said: \u0026ldquoIt was a real honour. I have not played rugby for well over 40 years and it was an amazing day, with a great turnout.  \u0026ldquoIt was very well-organised, despite the horrific weather. It was a great community thing and I was impressed how many people were there \u0026ndash men, women and children of all ages.  \u0026ldquoIt was a great tribute to the club but also the community.

Haddington RFC will also use the prize money to contribute towards a recruitment drive to increase playing numbers at all levels and fund community engagement projects.  Haddington RFC\u0026rsquos charity partner Wooden Spoon were also in attendance on the day.  Mr Wallace, who took part in the early stages of the mammoth six-hour match, thanked current Scotland internationalists Stuart McInally, Willem Nel and Sarah Law while there was also an appearance from ex-Lions and Scotland forward Finlay Calder, who grew up in Haddington.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see. It supports the masterplan, looking at how it could be delivered.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out our ambitions for a public energy company and its contribution towards tackling fuel poverty.  \u0026ldquoWe will be consulting on proposals later in the year and will make sure that Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council have an opportunity to provide their views."},{"url":null,"title":"whats-on-this-weekend-five-ideas-of-things-to-do-in-east-lothian","story":"  1.

Mother Nature has been kind and the pipe is, by and large, under sand once again \u0026ndash though there are concerns it is likely to be exposed again in future if a permanent solution is not found.  As well as being an eyesore at a popular tourist spot, sand and rocks collect around the pipe and are then blasted by the tide at the sea wall, causing it damage.  The town\u0026rsquos community council has long voiced concerns over the issue and claims houses overlooking the iconic West Beach are \u0026ldquoin danger.  North Berwick Community Council (NBCC) contacted Scottish Water over the issue and the company\u0026rsquos response was read out at a NBCC meeting last week.  A letter from Brian Lironi, director of corporate affairs, said: \u0026ldquoWe are not able to re-lay this section of pipe. However, following an inspection of it, we plan to carry out some work on the casing around the laterals and raised manhole columns.  \u0026ldquoThis work will take place outside of the bathing season when the laterals are more exposed and the beach is less busy. This should help to improve the aesthetic of the pipe.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoOn the point of erosion, we do not believe our pipe is to blame for this. With that said, I am asking for this to be looked at in more detail as it is important that we take an evidence-led approach. This will not happen during the bathing season.  Mr Lironi said the community council would be kept informed of any developments.  Spring 2018 was not the first time that severe weather saw the sewage pipe badly exposed. The pipe was clearly visible in the aftermath of storms in December 2010 and it took many, many months before the tides re-covered it with sand."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  HADDINGTON...

Plans lodged with East Lothian Council are split into two.  The design and access statement states: \u0026ldquoThe brief is twofold: to diversify the core business on the site with the introduction of small-scale gin and whisky distillation to enable the production of speciality spirits for sale within the business pub chain.  \u0026ldquoSecondly, in light of the increasing demand for both brewery tours and the use of the Monk\u0026rsquos Retreat as a function venue, it is felt that the facilities require being upgraded, both in terms of general amenity, improving the visitor experience and to provide for the disabled visitor with the addition of a platform lift and accessible toilet.  A spokeswoman for owners Greene King explained why they were looking to diversify at the site, on Belhaven\u0026rsquos Brewery Lane.  She said: \u0026ldquoLike any business we are always exploring options to develop our business and facilities. The recent planning application is just one of many opportunities we are considering but no decision has been made yet about whether it is an option we will pursue if planning permission is granted.  In terms of the production of gin and whisky, a still house would be created.  According to the design and access statement: \u0026ldquoThe distillery will be designed to produce 250 litres of spirit a day. It will be unique in the marketplace, making spirit from the same wurt as the beer.  \u0026ldquoThe spirit will be a mixture of Scotch whisky, gin and rum.  \u0026ldquoThis volume and complexity will mean that the brewery will need to employ an additional person to run the distillery.  \u0026ldquoIn time the site would like to re-instate a historical greenhouse within the gardens in order to grow their own botanicals to add to the gin however, this will be part of a separate application.  The new still house would mirror the mash house, which was given planning permission in January 2011, in terms of its look.  It is two storeys, with a more modern design than some of the historic buildings on-site.  If the plans were given the green light, work would also be carried out at the main building on the Belhaven site.  A museum is already in place on the ground floor of the main building, with a pub on the first floor.  Plans show a refurbishment of both floors as \u0026ldquothe existing interiors are now tired and dated and in need of a revamp.  The application, which could go before members of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee later this year, adds: \u0026ldquoConsidering the site\u0026rsquos historic importance both locally and within Scotland, it is clear that any development both internally and externally requires to be sensitive.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to recognise the value of this development in terms of the improved visitor experience, which will impact visitor numbers to the area as a whole, and the business diversification."},{"url":null,"title":"avid-lynyrd-skynyrd-fan-pens-foreword-to-new-book-about-his-idols","story":"  Iain Monk has contributed to The Gospel According to Abraham by Paul Abraham, who was the American band\u0026rsquos road manager for a decade.  The new book is full of stories about the band, best known for hits such as Sweet Home Alabama and Free Bird.  Iain said: \u0026ldquoI became an instant fan of the band in the 1970s and was instantaneously hooked by the music, that kind of southern rock music.  \u0026ldquoMy obsession for the band just grew from there but the first time I saw them live was in 1988 in New York when I flew over to see them.  \u0026ldquoI had written to the band\u0026rsquos management to see if they could help me with tickets and I think they were impressed that I was coming from Scotland to see the band.  \u0026ldquoThat relationship grew with management, road crew and members of the band and I started following them across America.  Iain, who lives in Gullane, has spent countless hours travelling across the globe to see his idols perform at 31 shows, ranging from New York, Boston and Washington to Belgium, the Netherlands and all across the UK.  His friendship with band members and those associated with the band has even seen him spend a week at the family home of Randall Hall, who was the band\u0026rsquos guitarist, in Florida. A friendship also grew with Paul Abraham, with Iain interviewing the road manager for his Lynyrd Skynyrd blog about his intention to write a book.  Iain said the band, which was formed in 1969 and continued following the tragic death of lead singer Ronnie Van Zant in 1977, were \u0026ldquoamazing live but also \u0026ldquolovely people.  He added: \u0026ldquoThey are down to earth, very friendly people in my experience and the people that formed the band are very approachable.  \u0026ldquoI have been very, very fortunate that I have been given access to the band over the years.  \u0026ldquoThat is something most fans would simply not get and I think that is down to trust and trusting me not to take advantage of their generosity.  The 55-year-old was delighted to be asked to write the foreword for the book, which is now available online.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis memoir provides a ringside seat, it is an intriguing glimpse into Skynyrd\u0026rsquos world. Fans will feel more than satisfied. Paul had a lot to get of his chest. The book offers up more explosive revelations than a Donald Trump press conference.  \u0026ldquoOver the many years I followed Skynyrd on tour, I was treated like royalty by the band.

Having binge-watched Love Island while off her feet, the 16-year-old Ross High School pupil was starstruck when Jack \u0026ndash who was already in Tranent to visit family \u0026ndash appeared at her Church Street home to wish her well.  \u0026ldquoIt was mental, Hannah told the Courier.  \u0026ldquoHe was in Tranent and my little sister [Sophie, 12] had messaged him, and I didn\u0026rsquot know.  \u0026ldquoShe told him I\u0026rsquod had surgery and was being really moody!

He has family up here so he was up visiting them.  \u0026ldquoHe stayed for about 20 minutes. He plays sport too, so he was asking about my injury and about judo.  \u0026ldquoI just asked him about Love Island, and what life was like after the villa.  \u0026ldquoHe said that he had a gut feeling he was going to leave, and that they all shared clothes and had a laugh.

Mr Corbyn was delivering the prestigious Alternative MacTaggart Lecture at the Edinburgh TV Festival, where he outlined his vision to shake up the entire media industry \u0026ndash including overhauling the BBC.\u0026nbsp  He said: \"One of the more ambitious ideas I\u0026rsquove heard is to set up a publicly owned British Digital Corporation as a sister organisation to the BBC.\u0026nbsp  \"The idea was floated by James Harding, former BBC Director of Home News in the Hugh Cudlipp lecture earlier this year.  \"A BDC could use all of our best minds, the latest technology and our existing public assets not only to deliver information and entertainment to rival Netflix and Amazon but also to harness data for the public good.  \"A BDC could develop new technology for online decision making and audience-led commissioning of programmes and even a public social media platform with real privacy and public control over the data that is making Facebook and others so rich.\"  He added: \"It could become the access point for public knowledge, information and content currently held in the BBC archives, the British Library and the British Museum.  \"Imagine an expanded iPlayer giving universal access to licence fee payers for a product that could rival Netflix and Amazon. It would probably sell pretty well overseas as well.\"  Mr Corbyn said the BDC could be funded using a digital licence fee collected from tech giants and internet providers, or through a \"windfall tax\" of digital corporations such as Facebook and Google.  He wants to force major tech companies to\u0026nbspplough cash into a \u0026ldquopublic interest media fund while giving some local, investigative and public interest journalism organisations charitable status.  The Labour leader also called for\u0026nbspBBC staff and licence fee payers to have a say in electing its board.  He argued the broadcaster could lead the way in publishing transparent workforce equality data \u0026ndash \"including for social class\". It is not clear how this would be defined.  Elsewhere, he suggested placing the BBC on a permanent statutory footing to end government control through charter renewal.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe BBC should be freed of government control, democratised and made representative of the country it serves to help it do that.  It came as he launched an attack on the \"print barons\" and editorial choices of UK newspapers, insisting: \"A free press is essential to our democracy, but much of our press isn\u0026rsquot very free at all.\"  He added: \"For all the worry about new forms of fake news we\u0026rsquove ignored the fact that most of our citizens think our newspapers churn out fake news day in, day out.\"\u0026nbsp  Questioned by a reporter, Mr Corbyn\u0026nbspdenied his plans were \"retribution or retaliation\" following a summer of press scrutiny over claims of anti-Semitism within the Labour Party.\u0026nbsp  He raised the prospect of giving journalists the power to elect editors and having seats on boards for workers and consumers \"when a title or programme gets particularly large and influential\".  Tory chairman\u0026nbspBrandon Lewis branded the proposals a \"wholescale plan for more state control over our media\".

However he said Brexit itself would not be delayed beyond March as there was a host of obstacles to extending the Article 50 process.  His comments came just a day after top European negotiator Michel Barnier said nothing would be agreed until November.  Mr Barnier had been speaking after Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said he remained confident of reaching a deal at the summit of EU leaders planned for October.  Mr Barnier said any deal would be \u0026ldquonot much later than November, certainly, confirming a widespread view that the October deadline would be missed.  However speaking to the media in Edinburgh, Mr Lidington went further and floated the prospect of a deal in December.  The Cabinet Office minister, who was Europe minister from 2010 to 2016, said 80 per cent of a deal was there, with the Irish border question the key issue still to resolve.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are making progress with the negotiations. We remain of the view that we are hopeful or optimistic about there being a good deal agreed in the autumn of this year.  \u0026ldquoWe saw Mr Barnier yesterday suggesting it might not be in October, but it might slip until a little bit later and frankly that doesn\u0026rsquot surprise me.  \u0026ldquoI was Europe minister for six years. I\u0026rsquove seen enough of these negotiations to know that these deadlines slip. I think there will need to be an agreement by the end of 2018.  But he said there was a \u0026ldquoreal pressure for Brexit to happen on 29 March 2019 as planned, and it was not practical or desirable to extend the Article 50 process.  Besides requiring the unanimous agreement of all 28 EU states, the European Parliament would switch focus to its own elections in the New Year, making it difficult to get enough MEPs together in a plenary session to pass a deal and get legislation through Westminster.  There would also be a new European Commission being appointed next year and the European budget to settle, with EU leaders moving on to other issues.  He said: \u0026ldquoFrom our point of view, I don\u0026rsquot see an extension as being in our interests. What we need is a real focus upon getting the detail of the Brexit negotiations sorted, done and dusted.  \u0026ldquoYou need a deadline in order to make people focus because there are always lots of other things that are consuming the bandwidth.  \u0026ldquoIf you delay things there\u0026rsquos the risk you don\u0026rsquot give yourself extra time to sort it out, you just end up in a situation where people\u0026rsquos attention wanders.  \u0026ldquoThey don\u0026rsquot focus on cracking the last challenging problems.  Mr Lidington also said a no-deal Brexit would not jeopardise the Union, despite the SNP arguing it would be evidence of a broken Westminster system.  He said there were would still be \u0026ldquopowerful and persuasive arguments in favour of keeping the union together even if negotiations end without agreement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI think that the merits of the union of the United Kingdom are still there and are still very powerful and persuasive regardless of the outcome to the European negotiations.  \u0026ldquoThe UK Government is absolutely determined to get a deal and a deal that works well for all parts of the United Kingdom.  Asked if his meetings with Welsh and Scottish ministers to discuss Brexit were cordial, he described them as \u0026ldquobusiness-like.  Nicola Sturgeon said a no-deal Brexit would be an \u0026ldquounmitigated disaster.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe fact that the UK government is even talking about it is evidence of their abject failure. That they once had the nerve to tell us that independence threatened our place in Europe adds insult to injury. Scotland deserves better.  Meanwhile former Irish Taoiseach Bertie Ahern has predicted the transition period immediately after Brexit will stretch beyond the next scheduled Westminster election.  The 21-month adjustment phase, in which the fine detail of trade and customs is worked out, \u0026nbspis due to end in December 2020.  However Mr Ahern said he thought it would be pushed beyond the 2022 election.  The former Fianna Fail leader said: \u0026ldquoThe transition period will be lengthened, it will be kicked out to the other side of the British election and I don\u0026rsquot know what will happen then."},{"url":null,"title":"scots-workers-win-unfair-dismissal-cases-against-g1-in-landmark-case","story":"  A group of five staff, who had been working at Grosvenor Cafe on Ashton Lane, launched a legal battle against the G1 Group, run by millionaire Stefan King, after they\u0026nbspwere sacked.

The judgement is in addition to an\u0026nbspearlier concession by lawyers representing the company that their clients had acted in breach of its employees\u0026rsquo statutory rights when they refused staff the right to be represented by their chosen trade union representative.  Judge Shona Maclean who handled the case said G1, which operates bars, restaurants and clubs across the city had \u0026ldquonot carried out a reasonable and proper procedure and the decision to dismiss... fell out with the band of reasonable responses which a reasonable employer might have adopted.  Last September, protests were staged outside the Grosvenor cinema and cafe after the dismissals.    G1 had previously been the focus of \u0027Better than Zero\u0027 protests from young hospitality workers\u0026nbspto protest against what they described as \"low pay, zero hours and poor employment practice\".

Today, our members may have just broken their stranglehold.\"  \"This was very much a David and Goliath story for the hospitality industry - one that should give confidence to hospitality workers across the country.  \"On September 52017, the board of directors for G1 Group had a letter delivered by hand by Stefan King\u0026rsquos private security guards to Unite\u0026rsquos offices on West Regent Street.  \"The letter contained a formal complaint regarding the representation that they do not need to put-up with exploitation.

That is clearly of benefit to the Scottish Government because any mass exodus would not only prove hugely embarrassing, it would also make the whole process of testing in P1 rather pointless.  What remains to be seen is how parents and schools interpret the phrase.  In 2016 John Swinney, the Education Secretary, allowed schools to use a form of internal assessment called units to give pupils a safety net \u0026ldquoin exceptional circumstances.  In fact, the instruction was comprehensively ignored and some 10,000 pupils were awarded National 4 qualifications as a result of passing the unit assessments.  It remains to be seen whether the current campaign to encourage parents to opt out of the P1 tests will have the desired affect.  Despite concerns over the distress caused to some pupils, other schools have reported no such issues.  However, should parents want to opt out in significant numbers, even after discussing the issue with schools, is it the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos expectation that headteachers will ignore them?  That would be counterproductive to the sort of positive community relations schools are trying to foster.  It would also be an uncomfortable position for the Scottish Government at a time when Education Secretary John Swinney has launched a \u0026pound350,000 project to encourage parents to get more involved in the day to day life of schools."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8456872.jpg?type=article-full","title":"the-prodigy-launch-new-album-with-a-glasgow-show","story":"  The band s twenty-date UK and European\u0026nbsptour will see the band play the opening night of their tour at the SEC on November 2,\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspto coincide with the\u0026nbsprelease date of their new album No Tourists.

He also revealed the UK Government was updating its no-deal analysis ahead of the key Commons vote on the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos final Brexit agreement.  This will be seen by Brexiteers as a blatant attempt to scare MPs into forcing through her Chequers compromise.  Mr Hammond\u0026rsquos Remainer colleague Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Commons Treasury Committee, said the Chancellor had \u0026ldquoconfirmed the Government forecasts a disastrous hit to our economy and living standards in the event of a no-deal Brexit.  The Treasury\u0026rsquos original analysis, published in January, calculated a no-deal Brexit would cost the UK economy as much as 10 per cent of GDP, leading to \u0026pound80 billion a year in extra borrowing by 2033 with possible additional tax rises and spending cuts.  As the Government published the first in a series of technical notices aimed at advising the public, official bodies and businesses on how to prepare for a no-deal, the Brexit Secretary suggested the \"vast majority\" of consumers would not notice its impact.  He sought to debunk no-deal scare stories, telling journalists: \"Let me assure you, contrary to one of the wilder claims, you will still be able to enjoy a BLT after Brexit, and there are no plans to deploy the Army to maintain food supplies.\"  However First Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: \"A \u0026lsquono deal\u0026rsquo Brexit would be an unmitigated disaster \u0026ndash and the fact that UK govt is even talking about it is evidence of their abject failure.

Scotland deserves better.\"  While Mr Raab, a Brexiteer, admitted failing to secure agreement with Brussels on the UK\u0026rsquos withdrawal posed \"short-term risks,\" he argued Britain in the long run would be better off.  While he expressed confidence a \u0026ldquogood deal is within our sights, the Secretary of State nonetheless insisted contingency planning for a no-deal was prudent and responsible.  But Labour\u0026rsquos Sir Keir Starmer said the Conservative Government\u0026rsquos approach was \u0026ldquothin on detail, thin on substance and provided no answers to how ministers intend to mitigate the serious consequences of leaving the EU without an agreement.  His colleague Chris Leslie, the former Shadow Chancellor, speaking on behalf of the People\u0026rsquos Vote campaign, said: \u0026ldquoOn the same day the Brexit Secretary was desperately trying to play down the risks of no-deal, the Chancellor has fired off a Brexit bazooka by admitting it would mean \u0026pound80bn in extra borrowing or cuts each year by 2033.  He added: \u0026ldquoThis Government is being pulled apart at the seams by Brexit but it\u0026rsquos the country that will ultimately pay the price when it all falls apart.  Ms Morgan noted: \u0026ldquoIt is clear the Government\u0026rsquos mantra that \u0026lsquono deal is better than a bad deal\u0026rsquo is dead in the water and that no deal is in fact a very, very bad deal.  The developments came as David Lidington, Mrs May\u0026rsquos effective deputy, on a visit to Scotland, insisted a no-deal scenario would not threaten the Union and suggested the deadline for securing agreement with Brussels might be pushed back from the European Council in mid-October to as late as December.  The Government papers declared: \"People and businesses should not be alarmed by no-deal planning and preparation nor read into it any pessimism. Instead they should be reassured we are taking a responsible approach, ensuring the UK\u0027s exit can be as smooth as possible in all scenarios\".  Yet they also said a no-deal could mean consumers facing:  *higher costs, from goods to holidays, due to a \"likely increase\" in the cost of card payments between the UK and the EU because cross-border payments would no longer be covered by an EU-wide \"surcharging ban,\" which prevents businesses adding an extra levy when consumers pay  *price increases when shopping online with parcels arriving in the UK no longer liable for the EU\u0026rsquos Low Value Consignment Relief on VAT and  *many of the 900,000 ex-pats living across the EU might not be able to access their British pensions as they \u0026ldquomay lose the ability to access existing lending and deposit services, insurance contracts [such as life insurance contracts and annuities] due to UK firms losing their rights to passport into the EEA\".

Lord Hague, the former party leader, urged the Tories to reject proposals to give party members more choice in future leadership contests as the idea, favoured by supporters of Boris Johnson, could give Corbyn-like influence to \u0026ldquounrepresentative minorities and reduce the chances of the party selecting a leader with widespread appeal.  Arron Banks, the multimillionaire founder of the Brexit campaign, and Andrew Wigmore, his spin doctor, announced on social media that they had joined the Conservatives.

Mr Banks recently encouraged Leave.EU supporters to join the Tories to have a say in any forthcoming leadership battle, claiming such a contest was likely within the next three to six months, and thereby determining the type of Brexit pursued by the UK Government.  However, Tory HQ dismissed the Brexiteers\u0026rsquo claims.

Chairman of the venture, Sir Ewan Brown \u0026ndash former chair of Creative Scotland and Lloyds TSB Scotland \u0026ndash said a new, mid-sized music venue for the capital has been is long overdue and would be transformational for its arts scene.  \u0026ldquoThere has been a perception that this is just for the Scottish Chamber Orchestra, but it is for all kinds of music, he said.  \u0026ldquoThey will play their concert a week, and they will be using the rehearsal facilities, but it will also be for rock and pop, for Celtic and traditional music, for choral and classical music.  \u0026ldquoAnd unlike the Usher Hall, we will be open all day \u0026ndash it will a community, welcoming space, and we envisage a musical performance in the foyer, everything from buskers to choirs, there will be something there every day.

They said the meaning of the symbols is debated but it is believed they may represent the names of individuals or groups.  The survey and removal of the stone was co-ordinated by teams from HES, Aberdeenshire Council and the University of Aberdeen.  Contractors worked with a specialist lifting company to remove the stone from the river safely, HES said.

The company’s response was to suspend him from his post in order to explore options, but then later sacked him, despite them having been advised by medical experts on the condition, that with some suitable adjustments to his working conditions, he could continue to be a valuable employee.        The employment tribunal which heard the case has now issued its ruling that BrewDog unlawfully discriminated against Mr Ross and treated him unfavourably because of his condition.The company, which has been valued at £1.8bn were told to pay compensation to Mr Ross in the sum of £12,052.New legislation which passed into law in 2015 prevented the tribunal from ordering that BrewDog staff undergo further equality training.A spokesman for the company said: “This was a really difficult situation for every member of our team involved in it, and clearly for the Tribunal panel too as their decision on the outcome was split.                                                                                                         “We worked with James in order to find a suitable alternative role within the business where his safety would not be compromised, but James wanted to keep his packaging role. “We ended up in a position where we had to balance James’ wishes with the best interests of the team around him, and while we regret that an agreement couldn’t be reached, we have a moral responsibility to prioritise the safety of our team. “We wish James all the best in his new role and his upcoming studies.”RNIB Scotland, which supports blind and partially sighted people, said: “Many employers still assume this group would be difficult or even impossible to employ.                                                                                                        “We know of journalists, teachers, bankers and physicists working in Scotland with sight loss.“It’s about encouraging employers to consider what people can do, not what they can’t.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"housing development for inverurie site","story":"        A new  housing development may be about to get underway in Inverurie following a recommendation to grant planning approval for a new development by CALA Homes.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Friday 24 Aug 2018 6:37

agency employee, others should not be deterred from launching similar action.DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment while employed as a fisheries officer for Marine Scotland at Scrabster harbour, but a tribunal this week ruled against her in the case.Speaking to the Groat, Iain Gregory, the deputy manager of Caithness Citizens\u0027 Advice Bureau (CAB), stressed that bullying regularly takes place in the workplace, and each year he hears numerous complaints.\"Clients feel that they have been the victim of unfair dismissal, discriminatory treatment, bullying or other types of incorrect treatment,\" he said.\"Anyone who feels they have been the victim of such conduct or treatment should never be deterred from reporting the matter.\"DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \"whistleblower\" while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland at Scrabster.The 49-year-old Canadian national told an employment tribunal in Aberdeen recently that she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards between 2015 and 2017, and claimed she was targeted with sexual harassment, for being a woman, and because of her age.In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick had also alleged that she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.The employment tribunal, however, ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.In its judgment, it said it could not agree whether the cards came from current colleagues, and is understood to have been unable to consider the chair allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.Mr Gregory says that each year CAB deals with a \"substantial number\" of bullying cases, each of which is examined carefully and then detailed evidence is obtained.He says in many cases CAB is able to resolve matters without progression to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) or to a tribunal \u0026ndash \"perhaps by raising a grievance with the employer or by negotiation\".He added: \"However, there are numerous cases which require referral via ACAS and we can often resolve issues at this point by using the \u0027Early Conciliation\u0027 process.\"He underlined that it is \"comparatively unusual\" for a case to proceed to tribunal, with only a \"small percentage\" going that far.\"While it would be inappropriate to comment on any case in which we were not involved, I would stress that people should not under any circumstances be dissuaded from pursuing their rights,\" Mr Gregory said.\"The system exists to ensure that your case can and will be properly considered and we can advise you and make sure that you understand it.\"Friday 24 Aug

These are exciting proposals and it is going to be important that everyone understands the vision for future care in Caithness.\u0026ldquoThis is about making sure that as many people as possible can take part and have their say.The proposals resulted from extensive engagement to explore possible options. NHS Highland recently approved the move to public consultation, which has been widely welcomed.The preferred option includes the development of a proposed care hub/village at the Dunbar Hospital site in Thurso and the Pulteney House care home site in Wick.The plans also include a multimillion-pound upgrade for Caithness General as part of an overall \u0026pound30 million investment for the area.The option of developing Wick\u0026rsquos Town and County Hospital will also be included in the consultation.The Wick event will be held on Monday, August 20, between 6pm and 7pm, while the Thurso one takes place the following evening at the same time.People planning to attend either should contact Christian Nicolson of NHS Highland on 07870513114 or email christian.nicolson@nhs.net to help ensure adequate seating can be provided.The health authority says further events will be arranged in due course and dates will be widely publicised.Friday 24 Aug 2018 6:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116965.jpg","title":"Wildlife cruise passengers get close up view of orca pod","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIt happened on Sunday during a Pentland Venture wildlife cruise when five orcas, including two calves, came into view \u0026ndash to gasps of delight from onlookers.Fred Fermor of John O\u0026rsquoGroats Ferries said: \u0026ldquoAs luck would have it we had more than 100 passengers on our wildlife cruise that day.\u0026ldquoI was taking a walk round the stacks and witnessed the spectacle from the shore.\u0026ldquoIt was great to hear the excited chatter and shouts from the passengers when they saw the orcas approach the Pentland Venture which by that time was just bobbing around.He added: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a case of letting people see these magnificent creatures while respecting their space and habitat.\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos great to think that Caithness can offer such experiences and that folk will go back to the far corners and tell their friends what a wonderful place we live in.The orcas were photographed from Duncansby Head by Colin Bird, former area group co-ordinator for Sea Watch Foundation, who started the annual Orca Watch at Duncansby.He said: \u0026ldquoThe ferry has been a great help in providing sightings of cetaceans in the Pentland Firth over the past 15 years.These sightings have helped form a greater understanding of the movement of orcas between Iceland and the north of Scotland.As reported in the Courier, local wildlife photographer Karen Munro saw seven killer whales on Friday close to the shore at St John\u0026rsquos Point, where they \u0026ldquoharassed seals for about an hour. They moved on towards Stroma and she alerted the ferry team.Mr Fermor said: \u0026ldquoThe orcas stayed at Stroma for a while and although some distance from John O\u0026rsquoGroats it caused a bit of a stir onshore and Karen generously let visitors view the whales through her powerful telescope.Meanwhile, Sea Watch Foundation says its latest National Whale and Dolphin Watch event looks like being the best in the past two decades in terms of the unprecedented variety of species of whales and dolphins seen around the British Isles.The event involved thousands of volunteers from all around the British Isles and was conducted between July 28 and August 5.This summer\u0026rsquos stable weather is one possible explanations for the high number of cetacean sightings in the country as a whole, with higher temperatures bringing warmer-water species and creating the conditions for plankton fronts to develop \u0026ndash attracting shoals of fish and, in turn, whales and dolphins.Meanwhile, Sea Watch Foundation says its latest National Whale and Dolphin Watch event looks like being the best in the past two decades in terms of the unprecedented variety of species of whales and dolphins seen around the British Isles.The event involved thousands of volunteers and was conducted between July 28 and August 5.Friday 24 Aug 2018 6:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"August 23, 2018 at 6:00 amThis week\u0026#8217s 56-page edition of The Orcadian is now available in shops and online, here.

No personal information will be gathered as part of this.Evidence suggests that across Scotland more than a quarter of people in education have struggled at some point in the previous year to access sanitary products with some girls and young women having missed school or skipped classes because they didn’t have access to products.The Scottish Government, local authorities and the university and college sectors have therefore committed to providing free access to sanitary products in all schools, colleges and universities in Scotland beginning from the new academic term.Further information can be found at  www.young.scot/periods.\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Accompanied by a support boat, Mr Cameron, 40, reached the shore on the other side, near Duncansby Head, sometime just before 8.20pm tonight.Mr Cameron decided to take on the seven-mile swim across the Firth in memory of his girlfriend Ena Brown, who died suddenly earlier this year. Money raised through the challenge will be going to the Kirkwall Maternity Ward, where Ena had worked.Speaking tonight, Monday, following the swim, he said: \u0026#8220It was a grind, I was swimming for over four hours and I never stopped for one second, I just ploughed on the whole way.\u0026#8220It was quite choppy to start with but it got better as I went on. Things eased off after about an hour or so. I knew I had it in me, I was just worried about the conditions changing and having to pull the plug, so I couldn\u0026#8217t relax during the swim. I went through all sorts of emotions \u0026#8211 I was confident and I had moments of doubt.\u0026#8220That last hour was a real grind, I must confess. I could see Duncansby Head in the foreground and I didn\u0026#8217t think I had long to go, but I was scared to ask. I had thought I had about 15 minutes to go, but I had an hour-and-a-half to go. It was real tough going.\u0026#8221\u0026#8220I\u0026#8217ve done marathons, I\u0026#8217ve won Scottish championship surfing titles, but that\u0026#8217s the toughest thing I\u0026#8217ve done.Asked how he felt following the swim, he replied: \u0026#8220I feel a big weight off my shoulders.

Indeed, the evidence suggests that the capital grants previously available have made a real and positive impact.“Everyone agrees that encouraging new blood into farming is vitally important, including here in Orkney. At a time of real uncertainty for the sector, there is a need for the government to help provide what stability it can.“It is all the more surprising therefore that the minister has chosen to take this decision now.  I have written to Mr Ewing, who is due to visit Orkney next month, asking for a reassurance that the government does not intend to walk away from supporting new entrants and ensuring agriculture in Scotland has a bright future.”   \u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Made with footage culled from up to 240 cameras that captured both the initial launch and the nine-day mission that followed, the film is a vital scientific document, a portrait of late \u0026#821760s America and a visually cogent exploration of man\u0026#8217s place in the universe.With an original score by Charles Morrow and a commanding narration by Laurence Luckinbill, the documentary won a special award at the Cannes Film Festival. However, for the next few decades, it was practically forgotten even the original printing elements were lost.Christopher Riley is a film producer, director and writer specialising in science, engineering and history. His work has been celebrated by BAFTA, the US Television Academy, the Royal Television Society, the Sundance Institute and the Grierson Trust.He is a regular contributor to  newspaper and presents science documentaries for BBC Radio 4. In 2007 he tracked down Theo Kamecke — who was working as a sculptor in upstate New York — and found that he held the only remaining 35mm print. Working closely with Theo, Moonwalk One was re-mastered, combining a unique 35mm director’s cut with newly transferred 16mm NASA flight film media, to create a new HD digital master of the film.This will be the first chance to see the new high-definition Blu-ray version of the film which is due to be released next year.Moonwalk One: The Director\u0026#8217s Cut is on at West Side Cinema, Stromness Town Hall, Saturday, September 8 at 7.45pm. The film has been programmed to coincide with #skyranMOON and the Museum Of The Moon at Stromness Academy.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Her cooking was what initially drew clients to come to the centre and her baking, he said, was \"legendary\".This theme was echoed by speeches from Ina Mackenzie, Mina Stewart and Kerry Watson. Laela Maclean composed a poem which reminisced and poked good-natured fun at Cis\u0026rsquos life in Lochcarron and the Centre.Cis\u0026rsquos husband Sandy kept the feet tapping with musical interludes on his accordion \u0026mdash including one tune called Christine Ross of Lochcarron, initially written for Cis by the late Iain Crichton, from Stornoway.Christine Houser, Donar MacIver and his son, Stephen MacIver sang Gaelic songs \u0026mdash the eyes of some of the older guests lighting up as they joined in the choruses.Cis was aided by Morag MacCuish to cut her retirement cake which had been made by Harry Gow, her favourite baker. She made a speech thanking everyone for their presence and for the gifts she had received from the clients, staff and board members.The event provided a lovely send-off for Cis. The afternoon ended with everyone joining hands to sing Auld Lang Syne accompanied musically, as in life, by her husband Sandy.Friday 24 Aug 2018 6:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Hopes for a visitor trail around an area that was heavily militarised during WWII are now full steam ahead after the project team behind the Aultbea museum secured almost \u0026pound73,000 from the Scottish Land Fund towards the purchase of a former butcher\u0026rsquos shop it has been renting to house the display.People from 19 countries outside the UK were amongst the 5500-plus visitors dropping in between May and October last year and that number is set to mushroom as the facility is improved and plans for a wider trail developed.The project\u0026rsquos chairman Francis Russell told the Journal: \"To some extent we have become masters of our own destiny. This opens up new avenues of funding. The location on the NC500 is very important.\"We ask people when they come in how they heard about us and some say it was while they were driving by. It puts us on the map. We\u0026rsquoll look at the feasibility and cost of a major refurbishment and possibly an extension. We could do with much more space.\"Fellow project volunteer Elizabeth Miles said the boost \"will allow us to get on to develop it the way we would like\".She said: \"Owning the site will open new possibilities. We will look to create a WWII trail where everywhere gets visited. We\u0026rsquore hoping to really do something with it.\"Research found the NC500, which passes the makeshift museum, brought 29,000 extra visitors in its first year, adding an extra \u0026pound9m to the Highland economy.The \u0026pound72,820 award will contribute towards the purchase of the former butcher\u0026rsquos shop and surrounding land.Honorary president of the RACP George Milne said the aim is to create a multi-site museum for current and future generations to learn about the convoys.He said: \"The overall aim is to establish a unique multi-site museum in Wester Ross. Around Loch Ewe we hope to create a permanent exhibition centre, a WWII Trail with interpretation panels, a memorial garden, and the preservation of selected wartime buildings to honour all who served in the Arctic convoys to and from Russia from 1941-1945.\"\u0026nbspThe 75th anniversary of the last convoy to sail from the area will be marked in 2020, with relatives of servicemen and visitors from around the world expected to come in their droves.Gairloch Heritage Museum, which itself secured backing from the Heritage Lottery Fund and Highlands and Islands Enterprise for a \u0026pound2m project to convert the old anti-aircraft operations room in the centre of the village into a state of the art new facility, welcomed the news.It said: \"Congratulations to our friends at Russian Arctic Convoy Museum on procuring the funds to purchase their exhibition centre.

All my sculptures contain a memory and I felt it apt that this particular work should be imbued with the feeling of being held in a loving embrace, feeling safe and secure enough to develop your potential.\"The Shelter of Your Arms is one of a collection of pieces created by Ann on display throughout the garden and in the Sawyer Gallery within Inverewe House.Operations manager Kevin Frediani said: \"As a result of the Gulf Stream meeting the Highlands, Inverewe Garden is a nirvana of unusual and wonderful plants and wildlife.

We wanted to take positive action to help the red squirrel population spread into the local woodlands as safely as possible. The combination of bridge and road signs definitely appears to be working well, which is great news.\"It\u0026rsquos safer for reds to travel in the tree canopy rather than on the ground, so it\u0026rsquos likely that if they have the option of using a bridge rather than crossing the road, they will take it. We also installed feeders at each end of the bridge to encourage the squirrels to use it.\"Since the bridge and road signs were introduced, there has only been one known red squirrel road death locally, with none reported so far in 2018. The year before, there were three reported road deaths of reds in the immediate area and two others further away.The rope bridge is suspended over the A896 outside Shieldaig village, alongside the Ben Shieldaig woodland, one of Scotland\u0026rsquos few remaining fragments of ancient Caledonian forest.Local climber Chris Hingley worked with Becky to install the bridge last June 2017, with support from Highland Council.

A nationalised digital broadcasting corporation could be set up in the UK to rival global tech giants like Netflix and Amazon, Jeremy Corbyn has said.            The BDC (British Digital Corporation) could challenge the control which a handful of online firms have on “huge swathes” of public life, the Labour leader told an audience at the Edinburgh TV Festival yesterday.            READ MORE: Corbyn wants Facebook and Google tax to fund BBCThe new body would operate as a “sister organisation to the BBC” and could be funded through the licence fee, according to Mr Corbyn, who also proposed a tax on tech giants to fund journalism.Mr Corbyn said the BDC could “deliver information and entertainment to rival Netflix and Amazon but also to harness data for the public good”.  The Government should negotiate with tech companies “to create a fund, run entirely independently, to support public interest media”, the Labour leader added.If that is not possible “we’ll need to look at the option of a windfall tax on the digital monopolies to create a public interest media fund”, he said.Mr Corbyn said that “our media is failing” when it comes to news and current affairs.            He also suggested giving journalists the power to elect editors “when a title or programme gets particularly large and influential”.The Labour leader also proposed a shake-up of the way the TV licence fee is paid and set, and called for information about the social class of anyone who creates BBC content to be published, as he delivered his Alternative MacTaggart Lecture at the Edinburgh TV Festival.“The BBC could lead the way by setting best practice with complete transparency on the make-up of its workforce by publishing equality data, including for social class, for all creators of BBC content, whether in-house or external,” he said.He outlined proposals for an independent fund for public interest journalism paid for by tech giants, which could include Google, Facebook and Amazon.            He also argued that the licence fee should be  modernised for the digital age, with a “fairer and more effective way” to fund the BBC, which he called “a great institution”.He floated the idea of introducing a digital licence fee – paid by tech companies or through internet service providers – to supplement the existing licence fee, with a view to reducing the cost for poorer households and helping the corporation compete “more effectively”.Mr Corbyn also proposed \u2028the creation of a new independent body to set the licence fee and suggested the BBC should be placed on a permanent statutory footing so that it would be “freed of government control”READ MORE: Corbyn confident of taking seats from SNP"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4788466.1535013953!/image/image.jpg","title":"meter group sms secures tie up with energy firm","story":"        A Glasgow-based metering services firm has signed an exclusive agreement to supply smart meters to a green energy company, as part of a government-led rollout.

Good Energy, based in Wiltshire, has more than 250,000 customers across the UK, adding to the 2 million-plus customers already served by SMS.             Under the terms of the agreement, SMS will supply domestic smart meters as part of the UK government’s rollout programme, which requires that domestic energy supply companies provide their customers with a smart meter to use in their homes and small businesses by 2020.SMS will provide new “SMETS 2” smart meters to monitor energy usage, which have a user-friendly advantage over the previous SMETS 1 model, as they allow customers to switch suppliers without changing meters. The majority of smart meters soon to be installed under the main phase of the government’s rollout scheme will be SMETS 2.  Alan Foy, chief executive officer at SMS, which is quoted on the alternative investment market (AIM), said: “We are delighted to be working with Good Energy as their exclusive supplier, one of the UK’s leading suppliers of energy from renewable sources, in the rollout of their smart meter programme. “Good Energy have over 250,000 customers across the UK, SMS is well positioned to support them with the smart meter rollout given our strong track record for customer services and asset ownership and management.”            John Maltby, Good Energy chairman, said the partnership would lead to a good user experience for the supplier’s customers. He said: “We are pleased to announce our partnership with SMS as the chosen supplier of our new SMETS 2 meters, as part of the UK government programme to roll out smart meters to UK energy customers.“Good Energy is focused on making sure smart meters work for the renewable energy sector. “Partnering with SMS gives us the ability to provide our customers with a market-leading smart meter, and associated products, which will enhance user experience.”            This is the latest deal for SMS, which signed a meter rental agreement in February with Utilita Energy to provide more than 100,000 meters throughout the year.The firm in March upped its dividend by more than a quarter despite a dip in pre-tax profits.

Going behind the scenes is one of the great privileges of being a journalist.             I’ve been lucky enough to be shown round many extraordinary places that are off limits to the public, from airport runways to the top of the Forth Bridge.            However, once a year, hundreds of normally closed buildings across Scotland are opened for people to have a peek inside.Launched nearly 30 years ago as part of Glasgow’s year as European City of Culture in 1990, Doors Open Days (DOD) now describes itself as Scotland’s biggest free festival, generating 200,000 annual visits.DOD now provides not just access to 800 historic and architecturally notable buildings but a wide-ranging programme of guided tours and lectures, also all free.Over the years, I’ve looked inside many buildings in Edinburgh and Glasgow during DOD, joined fascinating tours of the Clyde and its bridges by bike and on foot.I’ve also been to lectures about Glasgow’s pioneering underground railways, visited former shipyards and the city’s oldest railway station building – the 170-year-old Pollokshaws West.            Of course, there are myriad other sites on offer by DOD over several weekends next month, a different one for each part of the country.READ MORE: Alastair Dalton: Experts reveal Scotland’s transport heaven – and hellThey include everything from private swimming baths and sheriff courts to breweries and an animal hospital.However, for those interested in how we get about, there are some 20 buildings and events connected with transport in Glasgow alone, and at least seven in Edinburgh, with the capital’s DOD events programme to follow.            Elsewhere, you can visit a newly installed train turntable at a railway heritage centre in Aberdeen, HMS Unicorn – Scotland’s oldest ship – in Dundee, and the construction site of a £35 million road in Perth, the new A9/A85 link.Edinburghers will have their first chance to enter the Edinburgh Trams nerve centre, at its depot in Gogar.Also on show will be Lothian Buses’ headquarters off Leith Walk, which are nearly a century old, and the Northern Lighthouse Board’s offices in George Street, which are approaching their 200th anniversary.There’s also a shed in Leith where the last shipbuilding at the historic port ended in 1984 after 500 years, and a bunker in Barnton from where RAF fighter attacks were co-ordinated during the Second World War.In Glasgow, I’m looking forward to hearing about the city’s roads from prehistoric times to the M8, and prospects for walking improvements, while you could also be shown round the radical Avenues project to widen pavement and cycle lanes on several major city centre streets and also create a new “Underline” route beneath the motorway.

So the exam results have arrived and throughout Scotland young people are rejoicing or apologising or complaining or crying or ... drinking, according to what was in their text message or their email or the certificate dropped off by the carrier pigeon.             Their parents will be doing the same – gasping with relief, full of pride or on the bus to lodge the appeals and ... drinking. My Higher results were handed to me in Kirkliston in 1974 by our postwoman, Mrs Arbuckle. She was a friend of my mother and she stood there for a minute, half hoping, I think, to watch me open the big brown envelope but I didn’t give her that satisfaction. Anyway, they were fine and I was glad, and amid all the discussion of grade inflation, standards dropping, paying for university and finding a job, let’s just pause and wish all this year’s exam candidates well for the future, remembering our own disappointment, terror, satisfaction or joy.            However, let’s also ask a question – why do some young people pass exams and others fail them? Here are possible answers in no particular order: a, some young people are taught the subject better than others: yes! b, ome young people are taught more about exam technique: yes! c, some young people work harder than others: yes! d, s a means of assessment, exams suit some people more than others – yes! e, some young people choose their courses better than others and get more help in so doing: yes! f, some young people come from socially disadvantaged households where education is considered less of a priority: yes! g, some young people’s parents spend a shedload of money on tutoring: yes! h, some young people have specific learning difficulties which are not properly recognised and are thus disadvantaged in exams: yes! i, some young people have to deal with difficult pastoral issues in the run up to exams: yes!And no doubt  j, k, l etc etc can also reasonably apply. Of course, there’s one answer missing: some young people are more intelligent than others.Now, before you set off to firebomb my lovely home, let me make a comment or two. Firstly, I know we are only talking about one form of intelligence, what for the sake of the argument I will call ‘academic intelligence’ – and I know there are lots of others ‘intelligences’ and secondly I know that all these other factors listed above really matter. READ MORE: Cameron Wyllie: Why we must radically rethink education            However, we do seem to have reached a point where talking about how ‘clever’ a child is has gone out of fashion to the point of political incorrectness. Now this causes two problems, the major one being that it enables those who plan our curricula to get away with making much the same offer to all our young people – a ‘level playing field’ argument, when in fact some young people are much more able to play that game from the outset because of their brains. Actually, what we should be doing is following the model of many other countries – say, for example, Germany – in accepting that different children have different skills and abilities, and widely differing levels of ‘academic’ intelligence and building school courses (and schools) accordingly. To many this may seem old-fashioned and reactionary but to many it’s just common sense. In education, one size does not fit all. One way of combating this would be to stop measuring the success of secondary schools in terms of how many pupils gain university entrance.Additionally, this state of affairs makes it very hard to explain with any honesty why one child does better than another – teachers, parents and pupils get caught up in a mire of excuse-making. It also underplays the huge successes of less able pupils who do relatively well through conscientiousness, good teaching and the support of teachers and families.            READ MORE: Cameron Wyllie: SNP seems to think school is like a Coke advertSo, we need to talk more about intelligence and accept that it matters and we need to take a much wider view of our young people and what they can achieve. This is not an easy thing to do, and it’s always been difficult, as I found out at a very early stage in my career.A long time ago, in a school in the faraway North (of Edinburgh) I had, in my Higher English class, a boy whom I will call Angus – a name his parents may have considered. Angus was new into the school, and was a great boy – kind, cheerful, hard-working. He became popular very quickly because he liked everybody, was quite sporty, wholly lacked conceit and was polite and respectful to teachers in a very genuine way. He did his Higher English prelim and he failed it and then we had parents’ night.So I am sitting with his mum and dad, and this was in the days before (heaven forfend) the students themselves came to meetings, a step which, of course, made them infinitely more useful. I begin by praising Angus as a model of decency, maturity and hard work. I suggest that they should be really proud of Angus, and, shyly, these nice people concurred. And then I carry on: “So as regards the prelim, he demonstrated real progress and I think, if his attitude to work carries on like it is, he will pass at the end of the day.”“Why did he fail the prelim?” asks his mother.             “He finds some of the work quite difficult,” I say, “but he’s trying very hard.”“Maybe he needs to do some extra work?” she responds.“He already is. He volunteered. He’s just done a big interpretation which I’ve marked (aaaaarrrrgggghhhh) and given him back. He sat down with me on Wednesday and we went over it.”“Do you think ...” the mother pauses, then says “it might be your teaching?”Angus’s father stirs in his seat. “No, he really likes Mr Wyllie,” he says pointedly to his wife.“Well, what is it, then?” she carries on.Her last remark irked me, I admit, but she had boxed me into a corner anyway. “He’s just not very clever,” I say, then watch, horrified, as Angus’s mother bursts into tears.Intelligence matters, and we’ve got to be more honest about it.

An army of the unemployed descended on Edinburgh from all corners of Scotland. With them were bands, field kitchens and banners. Each marcher had a knapsack and blanket. The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement (NUWM), whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

In July last year, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox was still insisting a trade deal between the UK and EU would be “one of the easiest in human history”, a common theme of the Leave referendum campaign. Fox recently revised his thinking, estimating there was a 60-40 chance of a no-deal Brexit after complaining bitterly that the European Union was putting “political ideology” before the lives of ordinary people.            However, as the UK Government yesterday laid out some of its contingency plans and advice for businesses about a no-deal scenario, Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab adopted a radically different tone. There was no Brussels bashing instead he spoke of “our EU friends” and stressed that, even if the negotiations failed, “we would continue to behave as a responsible European neighbour, partner and ally”.            So Raab clearly has an idea of the sort of tone it is wise to adopt when attempting to reach an agreement with someone, particularly from a position of weakness.READ MORE: What would a ‘no deal’ Brexit look like?He said he was “still confident that getting a good deal is, by far, the most likely outcome” and that this was “our top priority ... our overriding priority”, but the UK Government did have to plan for the “unlikely” event of a failure of the talks. The 24 documents published yesterday gave advice for a number of different economic sectors, including trade, farming, medicine and finance. Some of them were more useful than others.Firms in Northern Ireland were told, for example, that “if you trade across the land border, you should consider whether you will need advice from the Irish government about preparations you need to make”. Civil servants in Dublin may find themselves busy today, attempting to answer hypothetical questions. The advice published yesterday is likely to be the first of a whole slew of similar documents, all of which essentially tell the same story. And that is one which makes clear just how deeply embedded the UK has become within the EU and how difficult extracting ourselves is going to be.If we wrench ourselves out in one sudden movement, we are extremely likely to come to serious economic harm with a serious risk of an “unmitigated disaster”, to quote Nicola Sturgeon. If we are able to negotiate a careful, managed withdrawal, the damage will be less, but still the economy will suffer and the lives of Fox’s “ordinary people” will be worse.

University research            The UK Government has offered a guarantee to universities and research institutes receiving money through the Horizon 2020 programme, which has provided 4.6 billion euro to fund British research since 2014.            Existing research projects will not lose their funding - but the government admits that the situation is less clear in cases where British researchers are working with colleagues elsewhere in the EU.Those projects may no longer be eligible for funding from the UK, and may not meet Horizon 2020 rules, either.READ MORE: Holidaymakers and online shoppers to face higher costs under no deal BrexitOrganic foodOver a third of British lamb is exported to the EU, and organic farmers across the UK use European standards and labels to market their products on the continent. But in a no-deal Brexit, “UK organic operators would not be permitted to use the EU organic logo” even though the government says legal standard wouldn’t change.To have British exports recognised as organic products, “UK organic control bodies will need to apply to the European Commission,” one paper published today states. “Approval can take up to nine months, so we are exploring alternative approaches”.            The NFU has warned any interruption to trade on that scale would be devastating to organic farmers.TobaccoEU rules cover tobacco packaging including health warnings, and Brussels holds the copyright over the grisly images of lung and throat cancers that are currently printed on packs of cigarettes and tobacco. The UK would need to have its own warnings ready for Brexit deal under a no-deal scenario.READ MORE: Scotland faces ‘Brexit nightmare’ warns Mike RussellCard payments            The UK would suddenly find itself outside of EU-wide banking infrastructure known as TARGET2 in a no-deal Brexit. As a result, customers and businesses “could face increased costs and slower processing times for euro transactions”, the government warns.For everyone buying a product or service from an EU-based company, “the cost of card payments between the UK and EU will likely increase” - so most costs associated with a foreign holiday in Europe.In addition, a ban on card surcharges introduced by Brussels in January of this year would no longer apply to payments to EU companies - so there would be no way to block Ryanair, which is based in Dublin, from reintroducing its controversial 2% credit card fee, for instance.Financial servicesLondon is Europe’s leading financial services hub, with the international banks and investment houses based there working for clients across the EU. They could struggle to do so after a no-deal Brexit, because ‘passporting’ rights for service companies within the single market will end, and no new agreement will replace them.            “In the absence of EU action, EEA clients will no longer be able to use the services of UK-based investment banks, and UK based investment banks may be unable to service cross border contracts,” the government admits, by way of an example. “UK authorities are not able through unilateral action to fully address risks to the EEA customers of UK firms currently providing services into the EEA.”The government says it would seek a standalone agreement on financial services after a no-deal Brexit, but many companies have already moved to set up subsidiaries in the EU to get around any new barriers.READ MORE: Catherine Stihler: No-deal Brexit will blight Britain for decadesPensions for expatsOne group of British citizens living in the EU set to be hit the hardest under a no-deal Brexit are pensioners, who are likely to rely on British banks and investment companies to provide much if not all of their income.Documents state that \"in the absence of action from the EU, EEA-based customers of UK firms currently passporting into the EEA, including UK citizens living in the EEA, may lose the ability to access existing lending and deposit services, insurance contracts (such as life insurance contracts and annuities) due to UK firms losing their rights to passport into the EEA\"Fertility treatmentThe UK imported around 3,000 sperm samples from Denmark, and small amounts from other EU countries, for research and fertility treatments.Organisations would need to reach written agreements with sperm banks supplying samples to be able to continue imports, which the government says would “for the most part be a minimum burden on industry”.

Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way.

Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt.

I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain ( hoped for ) credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself (mainly in graphite but also in pastel and acrylic) doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate  (John Tulloch) and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! (I use the scientific meaning of parasite here).\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists ( or any other activity) when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday.

Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory.

Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"tour boat vandalised ","story":"was vandalised in the small boats harbour in Lerwick.\nOfficers said the damage was caused overnight from Friday to Saturday.\nAnyone with information is asked to contact police on 101.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"pupils philanthropy boosts five charities ","story":"Several charities benefited to the tune of £3,000 each thanks to a schools\u0026#8217 philanthropy scheme.\nThe Youth and Philanthropy Initiative (YPI) takes place across Scotland with pupils working together to decide which organisation to hand the cash to.\nAn entire year group takes part in YPI.

Tourism makes a critical contribution to the local economy, and indeed the wider Scottish economy, and indirectly enables people to live, work and raise a family on the island.\n“As such, we write to categorically assert that Skye and Raasay is well and truly open for business.”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Run-Rig-1977-ADJUST-e1534430676612.jpg","title":"highland exodus to stirling as runrig get set for final","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nAfter 45 years, Runrig will bring the curtain down on a remarkable musical career this weekend when they play their last ever shows.\nAn exodus of west Highland and islanders will be among the throng at Stirling’s City Park in the shadow of the town’s famous castle this Friday and Saturday.\nThey will be there to enjoy and celebrate one final time with a band which owes its roots to Skye and North Uist, and became an international flag bearer for Gaeldom’s language and tradition.\nSpeaking to the Free Press ahead of the ‘Last Dance’ shows, guitarist Malcolm Jones said he held conflicting feelings but there was excitement none the less at a final performance which will chart over four decades of music.\nHe added: “I would say we’re all approaching these final concerts with mixed emotions. There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27433  ","story":" Declan Kearney\nSinn Féin National Chairperson\nWe all need to be able to draw inspiration from history, past sacrifice, leadership and determination.\nLifelonganti-apartheid campaigner and veteran of the national liberation struggle inSouth Africa, Ronnie Kasrils was in Belfast and Derry recently to launch hisnew book ‘A Simple Man’.\nMartinMcAuley asked me to interview Ronnie for a Sinn Féinvideo.\nMy lastquestion was to ask what continues to inspire him and his vision for thefuture.\nHeexplained how much today’s youth inspire him, and in particular young AhedTamimi from the occupied territories in Palestine.\nLastSunday Ahed was released from prison.\n\nI mether daddy in Ramallah three months ago.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary (better known as ‘Nana’) Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system.

The party’s spokesperson for Business, Enterprise andInnovation Maurice Quinlivan TD has announced proposals to increase the numberof people in apprenticeships to 60,000 by 2023, whilst also branding thecurrent government’s reform plans as “unambitious, uninspiring and unacceptablyslow”.\nThe document outlines Sinn Féin’s proposals to reform the system in ways suchas trebling the number of apprenticeship programmes currently availablealongside focusing on plans to increase the female \u0026amp people withdisabilities participation rates within the programmes. \nDeputy Maurice Quinlivan said\n “Thegovernment is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming theapprenticeship system.

Record numbers of students are attending third leveleducation, but with this route not being suitable for everyone, Sinn Féin wantsto create more alternative routes for young people.\nDeputyQuinlivan continued\n“AcrossIreland we lack significant alternative opportunities for young people topursue other education. We want to build on the success of the traditionalcraft trades in Ireland such as plumbing, bricklaying and plastering, andexpand this way of learning, into a host of new fields.\n“Apprenticeships in fields such as green energy, retail, hospitality andfinancial services are hugely popular in other European countries. We aim toexpand the system into these areas to create different opportunities for allyoung people including more females and people with disabilities.”\n Currently,most apprenticeships are aimed towards male participants with just 160 out of13,589 people in apprenticeship programmes across the state being female in2018. In addition, the physically demanding nature of the current availableapprenticeships has resulted in just 1.7% of total apprentices in 2016 beingpeople with disabilities.\n\nSinnFéin aims to increase investment in apprenticeships to over €350 million perannum within five years. \nTheLimerick City TD, Deputy Quinlivan has said that this will “fund the treblingof the number apprenticeship programmes and provide places for 60,000apprentices”.\nDeputy Quinlivan continued: “€5,166,000 of investment will be required overfive years for the development of 63 new apprenticeship programmes, bringingthe total number of craft and new courses to 100.\n“Ireland’sallocation from the EU for training and education of the young is €68 million.Fine Gael was forced to return €19.8 million of this allocation in 2016, asthey failed to submit a payment application.\n“SinnFéin will ensure all EU monies allocated to Ireland would be fully utilised, tobenefit the education and training of our young people.

Teachers and support staff have worked hard to ensure that the school ethos has ‘created opportunities for success’. \n  \nWe would also like to acknowledge the success of our students in accessing collaborative courses through Ballymena Learning Together – especially with the NRC and Dunclug College, where our students were supported to achieve high grades in Mathematics, Construction and Environmental Technology.” \n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_935983.jpg--.jpg?1534836410000\n","title":"round britain reception honour for cadet megan","story":"  \nA local teenager who is taking part in a round Britain remembrance challenge has been given a Mayoral ‘thumbs up’! \n  \nMid and East Antrim Borough welcomed very special guests to the borough this week as the Lord Nelson tall ship, crewed by cadets and disabled veterans, sailed into Northern Ireland.\n  \nAs part of the remembrance activities to mark the end of the First World War, 48 injured soldiers and 80 cadets are embarking on a voyage of remembrance, adventure and personal development as part of Lord Dannatt’s Round Britain Challenge.\n  \nOne of those taking part in the challenge is local teen Megan McGaughey, a member of the Army Cadets.\n  \nMegan was recently joined by family and friends at a special Mayor’s reception in The Braid to mark her achievements.\n  \nThe 17-year-old from Cloughmills, said she was honoured to be selected and vowed to rise to every challenge that comes her way.\n  \nMegan has been an established member of the cadets since 2012.\n  \nShe said that during her time with the cadets she had made friends for life, represented Northern Ireland on numerous occasions through playing different sports, and has learnt lifelong skills.\n  \nAnd having dropping anchor in Belfast, councillors and staff were buoyed by the opportunity to greet the crew of the Lord Nelson in Mid and East Antrim.\n  \nMegan has completed her junior and senior instructor course, enabling her to deliver fun-filled lessons full of knowledge.\n  \nProud mum Debbie said: “Megan’s rank of Sergeant shows the time and commitment she has put into cadets and the fantastic opportunities she has been given, such as the Lord Dannatt Round Britain Challenge. She enjoys every minute she spends in cadets.\n  \nThe Mayor, Cllr. Lindsay Millar held a special reception in Carrickfergus Town Hall on Monday evening, where guest of honour, Mrs Joan Christie, CVO, OBE, Her Majesty’s Lord-Lieutenant for the County of Antrim, was entertained by cadets from Essex, Yorkshire and Shetland recalling their adventures on the Edinburgh to Belfast leg.\n  \nThe complement is working together to sail around the UK on board a specially adapted tall ship, changing crew every 10 days in each capital city (London, Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff). In each changeover port there will be a celebration of remembrance, inclusivity and diversity.\n  \nEach 10-day voyage sees injured service personnel, cadets and instructors aged 16-25 working as a team to sail the ship to the next capital city, climbing the mast, helm the ship, setting the sails and much more.\n  \n Councillor Millar, said: “We were delighted to welcome the Lord Dannatt Challenge crew to Mid and East Antrim.\n  \n“We in Mid and East Antrim cherish our close links to the cadets, who are very dear to Mrs Joan Christie CVO, OBE, Her Majesty’s Lord-Lieutenant for the County of Antrim. “\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":null,"title":"65300  ","story":"                \nBALLYMONEY Foodbank has seen an almost 20% increase in usage since the introduction of Universal Credit in November 2017.\nThis is the disturbing news revealed by a Director of the local Foodbank after they recently compiled figures covering this past year. \nCo-Director of Ballymoney Foodbank Mr Peter Rawlins said: We looked at the number of vouchers dealt with, the number of people helped and the weight of food distributed in the six months leading up to November 2017 and in the five months after November 2017 (excluding December which is always a peak month for any foodbank) and we found there was an 18% increase in first five months of this year. \nMr Rawlins continued: This is a significant increase on the previous six months and on the corresponding months the previous year. Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

We can\u0027t forget their big sister Kaia who has kept us all smiling.\nThe family\u0027s agony began on June 8 last year when Caden, a pupil at St Brigid\u0027s Primary School, was diagnosed with aplastic anemia, a rare blood disease where bone marrow fails to produce sufficient blood cells.\nSabrina, who has taken time off from her job at Limavady Grammar School to care for Caden, recalled: Bruises started appearing all over his body and Caden was tired, so we knew something wasn\u0027t right.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

The Skoda man felt the format incurred unnecessary expense in terms of fuel costs.\n\u0026#8220The fuel isn\u0027t cheap and the cars run on it whether you are driving a stage or the road sections, said Bogie. A remote service after Friday\u0027s first two stages would work for everyone.

And it’s an ideal venue to host birthday parties and school or group outings.”\n\nAir-tastic currently has two trampoline parks, located in Bangor and Cork, with a number of other Air-tastic trampoline parks planned to open in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in due course. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nFor further information on Air-tastic and the Craigavon trampoline park opening visit www.air-tastic or search Air-tastic Craigavon on Facebook.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602227.1534344744!/image/image.jpg","title":"can you help a history project","story":"\nDid you ever work in the old Mayfair manufacturing company in Portadown? If so, then Mayfair Business Centre would like to hear from you.  \n\n                \nThe present day Mayfair Business Centre is inviting former workers who were employed at the sewing factory to discuss their memories and experiences of working there. This unique history project is being supported by Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council as part of the PEACE IV Shared Spaces and Services programme.\n\nUrsula Kearns from Mayfair Business Centre said: “We are really keen to speak to any women and men who worked in the factory during the 1960s and 1970s, including those who were made redundant when the factory closed. We want to hear and collect their experiences and memories and we want those stories to be recorded and shared. The intention would be for the former workers to meet together on a regular basis over coming months. It will be informal and will be a chance for old friends and acquaintances to meet up. We intend that the project will be led by those taking part, so we expect that it will touch upon other work-places as well as people’s social lives. It’s also intended that the project will result in a permanent exhibition within Mayfair.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nInterested?

authority offers assurance about future of school crossing patrols","story":"\nThe Education Authority (EA) has given an assurance that school crossing patrols will be in operation when children across Northern Ireland return to school in the coming days.\n\n                \nA spokesperson for the EA offered the assurance in response to media coverage revealing that the authority had considered removing “lollipop men and women” in a bid to save money.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nA letter obtained by BBC News NI revealed that the EA faces an estimated funding gap of £58 million in 2018/19.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nIt highlights a number of “difficult choices” the authority is faced with in order to cut costs, including the possible removal of school crossing patrols, withdrawing uniform allowances and making compulsory redundancies in schools.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nAccording to the BBC, EA board members regarded the possibility of scrapping school crossing patrols – and other potentially controversial savings measures – as “unpalatable” and decided that any decision to make such cuts should be down to the Department of Education.\n\nThe letter also suggests that “traffic control measures” are not the EA’s responsibility, but that of the Department for Infrastructure and the

for school crossing patrols in the current financial year.”\n\nManned crossings are seen as a vital for the safety of children crossing busy roads, and the DUP’s education spokesman said any move to remove lollipop men and women would be “unacceptable.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“While undoubtedly the Education Authority and the department have to explore every option to live within budget, this idea cannot be regarded as a serious suggestion and it is clear that the members of the Education Authority would reject any attempt to propose it,” said Peter Weir MLA.\n\n“The safety of our children must be paramount, and there is no need to remove the current process for assessing individual placements of lollipop people provision.”\n\nThe Strangford MLA continued: “This bizarre suggestion does however highlight two key issues. Firstly, the extent to which education is effectively subsidising other elements of government particularly on road safety and transport and there needs to be a debate about where financial responsibility is borne. \n\n“Secondly, it further shines a light on the heavy pressures facing education in Northern Ireland, and the need for strategic changes and reform which need commitment on an Executive-wide basis, which again highlights the damage being done by a single party putting their narrow interests ahead of proper decision making and the restoration of government.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.banbridgeleader.co.uk/webimage/1.8602298.1534346604!/image/image.jpg","title":"fifty years on from first civil rights march","story":"\nOn August 24, 1968, Northern Ireland\u0026#8217s first civil rights march took place between Coalisland and Dungannon. \n\n                \nOn the march were teachers, students and politicians who all wanted the same thing, equality and civil rights.

This is the first time the event has been staged in Ireland.\nPope Francis will arrive in Dublin on Saturday, almost 40 years since Pope John Paul II came and addressed the faithful at capacity Masses in Drogheda, Knock and Phoenix Park. Pope Francis’ first engagement will be meeting President Michael D Higgins before visiting St Mary’s Pro-Cathedral and then the Capuchin Day Centre, which provides hot meals, clothing and showers for the city’s homeless. Pope Francis will then preside at the Festival of Families in Croke Park.\nHis visit will conclude on Sunday with a closing Mass at Phoenix Park. An estimated 500,000 people are expected to attend with thousands more watching the live footage from around the world.\nRector of Clonard Monastery Fr Noel Kehoe said that the parish is running a bus to the weekend events in Dublin “on Friday” and that he will be staying “to attend both the festival of Families and attend the Papal Mass”.\nParish Manager at St Oliver Plunkett Parish Glen Phillips told the Andersonstown News that Pope Francis’ visit had created “such a buzz within the parish”.\n“We have a coach leaving tomorrow (Thursday) so that parishioners can attend the WMOF Congress in the RDS.\n“A number of families from the parish will also be attending the Festival of Families in Croke Park on Saturday and we are also running a coach to the Papal Mass in Phoenix Park on Sunday.\n “There is such a buzz around the parish as the Papal visit approaches. Many older parishioners remember Pope John Paul II’s visit and many young parishioners were brought up on stories about it. Pope Francis is re-invigorating the Church and many parishioners want to be part of that and show support for him,” he said.\nSt John’s Church was proudly displaying its bunting and Papal flags as parishioners filed out from Mass on Wednesday morning. Parish Manager Conor Neeson explained how some of the decorations had stood the test of time and dated back to John Paul II’s visit.\n“We will have a number of buses on from Friday morning taking parishioners down to Dublin for the Pope’s visit. As part of the Falls Road Pastoral Community, parishioners from Corpus Christi, St John’s, St Mary’s, St Paul’s and St Peter’s Cathedral will all be travelling this weekend. There is a great sense of occasion and I’ll be staying behind to organise the parish hall for the Mass on Sunday as we will be screening it live,” he said.\nChair of the Pastoral Council Annette Hinchcliffe said she will be attending the Mass along with her teenage children and had also been part of history when she travelled down on the train to see John Paul II say Mass in 1979.\n“Many of our elderly population in the parish would have loved to have attended the Mass on Sunday but a lot of the instructions about once people get off their buses is the walk to Phoenix Park which is a possible three miles. We thought it would be nice to bring everyone together to give them a flavour of the day so that they wouldn’t just be watching it in the house. Our parishioners will have an opportunity to come to the parish centre to watch the Mass and be with the other people in their parish,” she said.\nParishioner Frances McEvoy told us: “I’m going down today (Wednesday) for the different discussions and events that are taking place over the next couple of days each day ending with a Mass and I’m looking forward to enjoying the weekend celebrations as well.\n“I was in Phoenix Park whenever John Paul II came and I think this Pope has the same charisma. I think he will be very welcomed despite all that is going on at the minute.\n“It’s very exciting. I was in Rome before Christmas staying with friends and I was at one of his meetings, when he meets the people on a Wednesday. The atmosphere when he walks in is just incredible. There is definitely  something about him. I think despite in terms of some of the negative publicly there has been around the visit he will speak to the people and he speaks from his heart,” she said.\nAt an extremely busy The Holy Shop in city centre’s Chapel Lane sales assistants Maura McShane and Teresa Nolan told us how there had been “great interest” in their Pope Francis memorabilia ahead of the highly anticipated visit.\n“We have rosary beads, candles, framed photos of Pope Francis and prayer cards all to mark his visit for the World Meeting of Families,” explained Teresa. “He is a very popular Pope and the amount of our customers going this weekend to see him is unreal,” she said.\nMaura said that many people were calling in since staff created their window display and there was a real “excitement” with people ahead of the weekend.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"brexit northern ireland businesses told to contact republics government to prepare for unlikely no deal","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Ireland businesses have been told to start making preparations for a no-deal Brexit by contacting the Irish Government to discuss potential arrangements if the UK and the EU fails to broker a deal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({})\n\n\nFirms that export and import from the EU may also have to apply for licences to continue to do so.\n\n\n \nKey points from no-deal Brexit technical paper release\n \n\n\nThe advice forms part of the nine-page ‘Trading with the EU if there’s no Brexit deal’ technical notice - one of a raft of documents published by the Brexit department advising businesses and the public on what they need to do to prepare for a no-deal scenario.\n\n\n\nNo-deal Brexit could cost consumers millions and hit pensions, papers reveal\n \n\n\nAnnouncing the publication of the documents the Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab again reasserted the government\u0027s commitments to Northern Ireland and how they were committed to ensuring there was no hard border at the Irish border.\n\nHe said it was important people and organisations had \"clear and practical advice and re-assurance\" in the event of a no deal.\n\n\"We are trying to make sure people have the information they need, the lead time they need and some guidance about the practical way through some of the difficulties in the unlikely eventually of a no deal.\"\n\nMr Raab also said the government would do nothing to disrupt the terms of the Good Friday Agreement.\n\nFor those Northern Ireland businesses that trade with the Republic they are advised to contact the Irish government about preparations they may need to make as ministers there have “indicated they would need to discuss arrangements in the event of a no-deal with the European Commission”.\n\nThe document states: “Businesses should now consider the impacts on them in a no-deal scenario, which would mean a requirement to apply the same customs and excise rules to goods traded with the EU that apply for goods traded outside of the EU, including the requirement to submit customs declarations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Northern Ireland businesses that trade over land with the Republic have been told to contact the Irish government about preparations they may need to make (Brian Lawless/PA)\n\n\n\n\n“Businesses should consider whether it is appropriate for them to acquire software and or engage a customs broker, freight forwarder or logistics provider to support them with these new requirements.”\n\nThe notice adds: “Engaging a customs broker or acquiring the appropriate software and authorisations from HMRC will come at a cost.”\n\nOn trade in Northern Ireland the technical paper states that the Government stands ready to “engage constructively” to act in the best interests of the people of Northern Ireland in the event of a no-deal.\n\nHowever, the department urged businesses in Northern Ireland to contact the Irish government for advice, stating: “The Irish government have indicated they would need to discuss arrangements in the event of a no deal with the European Commission and EU member states.\n\n“We would recommend that, if you trade across the land border you should consider whether you will need advice from the Irish government about preparations you need to make.”\n\nThe document concludes by stating that the Government “will provide further information on action to take to prepare for this scenario over the coming months”.\n"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37245612.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/fatberg1.jpg","title":"massive fatberg pours out of sewer into west belfast street","story":"\n

We would remind all our customers that opening a manhole and putting anything down it is forbidden. By doing this, you are obstructing a working sewer which is designed to take waste away from homes. Incidents like this cause out of sewer flooding and require valuable time and resources to resolve,\" she said.\n\nShe urged people to dispose of their fat, oil and grease properly. \n\n“While most homes and businesses use grease traps and bin their waste correctly, those that don’t, contributed to a massive fatberg in the sewers around the area,\" Mrs McCullagh said\n\n“We would appeal to all our customers, especially food outlets, to dispose of their fat, oil and grease appropriately. For householders, let it cool and then put it into the bin. Alternatively, pour it into a disposable container and take it to your local oil bank.\n\n“Businesses also risk blocking their own drainage systems, which results in extra costs being incurred in clean-up efforts. These fat blockages can not only result in out of sewer flooding, but odour problems and the risk of rat infestations both near and beyond your premises. Ways to dispose of FOG include fitting a grease trap, using an enzyme dosing system or recycling it.\"\n\nMrs McCullagh said the fatberg was having a negative affect on the whole community.\n\n“We have all seen the disgusting effects of an overflowing manhole in the street and no one wants to see or smell it (not even us!) but the reality is, it happens regularly at a cost of millions to NI Water each year,\" he said.\n\n“We all have the power to stop it. In the last ten years, NI Water has spent over £1.5 billion investing in water and wastewater infrastructure but no amount of investment will completely stop blocked pipes if people continue to flush wipes (including flushable), sanitary items and cotton buds down the toilet.”\n\nShe urged people to properly dispose of sanitary products.\n\n“According to recent research carried out by Water UK, 93% of the material causing sewer blockages was made up of wipes - including a high proportion of baby wipes - which are not designed to be flushed. Less than 1% of the domestic waste in the blockages was identified as made up of products which are designed to be flushed, such as toilet paper.\n\n“Customer awareness and behaviour change is the only real way to address sewer misuse it’s simple really, don’t flush anything other than paper, poo and pee.\n\n“Visit \nwww.niwater\n for further information.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed top 10 baby names in","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Zeplin, Blaise, Maverick, Ace and Jupiter on the other hand, were some of the less common names given to baby boys in 2017.\n\nIn terms of girls’ names, Grace has once again taken second place in the top 10, whilst Olivia comes a close third. Roise climbed the greatest number of places to join the top 100 names for girls, moving from rank 151 in 2016 to rank 90 in 2017. Isla and Charlotte both joined the girl’s top 10 for the first time in 2017.\n\nCompared with boys, a greater number of girls’ names have held the top spot since the reporting of first names began in 1997.  Some of the less common names given to baby girls in 2017 were Lady, Divine, Rio, Star and Vogue.\n\nAlmost 1,000 new baby names were registered in 2017 that had not been registered since the reporting of baby names began in 1997. Blockbuster movies, popular television series, current celebrities and memorable places continue to appear to be influencing factors for some parents.\n\nOf those registrations containing details of the father, almost 500 boys were given their fathers’ name as a first or additional name.  However fewer than 100 girls were given their mothers’ name.\n\nMore generally, the statistics published today highlight that the popularity of baby names in 2017 (both boys and girls) varied, for example, by District Council, age of mother, country of birth of mother and month of registration.\n\nTop 10 baby names in Northern Ireland, 2017\n\n\nBoys:\n\n\nJames  – 243 Babies\n\nJack  – 226 Babies\n\nNoah  –  189 Babies\n\nCharlie  – 185 Babies\n\nJacob  – 180 Babies\n\nHarry  – 169 Babies\n\nThomas  – 158 Babies\n\nDaniel  – 147 Babies\n\nOliver  – 143 Babies\n\nLogan  – 125 Babies\n\nGirls:\n\nEmily  – 216 Babies\n\nGrace – 202 Babies\n\nOlivia  – 179 Babies\n\nIsla  – 153 Babies\n\nAnna  – 142 Babies\n\nSophie  – 132 Babies\n\nElla  – 128 Babies\n\nAmelia  – 127 Babies\n\nCharlotte  – 124 Babies\n\nSophia  – 121 Babies\n"},{"url":null,"title":"why 15bn bridge to scotland could be the answer to","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Apart from the obvious support from London and Dublin, EU sources could include the cross-border INTERREG programme, the European Investment Bank, the TransEuropean Network and HORIZON 2020. The EU PEACE programme could be another valuable source because the bridge would still respect the Good Friday Agreement by promoting peace and prosperity in the region. Private funds would also be a must, and China a clear contender. With Chinese interest in access to new markets, investment for the world\u0027s most prolific bridge-builders could prove irresistible.\" Former Economy Minister, Strangford DUP MLA Simon Hamilton, reaffirmed the party\u0027s position that a solid connection between Northern Ireland and Scotland could be a catalyst for economic growth between the two regions.\n\nHe said: \"The DUP made the proposal of a feasibility study into a tunnel or enclosed bridge across the North Channel to the Scottish coastline in our 2015 manifesto. \n\n\"Some people are foolishly using Brexit to build a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, a border which the Prime Minister stated she could not accept and which would damage the constitutional integrity of the UK. \n\n\"There is growing support for our manifesto proposal. \n\n\"It\u0027s time to be progressive and forward thinking.\"\n\nEarlier this year Ards and North Down Borough Council agreed to engage with a Scottish Government feasibility study of the idea of a bridge, with Donaghadee mooted as a potential starting point on this side of the Irish Sea.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"taoiseach to tell pope lgbt catholics excluded from church","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

But outbreaks have occurred at Muslim, Christian and Hindu religious events, at sports events, and at large-scale open air festivals in the past. \n\n\"When they occur, they most commonly involve vaccine preventable diseases such as measles, influenza, mumps and hepatitis. \n\n\"Other reported outbreaks are mainly of gastrointestinal infections caused by a number of different pathogens,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan said. \n\n\"Given the nature of this historic papal visit, a large number of young children and elderly visitors are expected to attend the final mass, including many international visitors. \n\n\"In the current context of ongoing measles spread in Europe, it is highly advisable that all attendants, especially young children, ensure that they are up to date with their vaccinations,\" Dr O\u0027Riordan added.\n\nAccording to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the measles outbreak is continuing across Europe, with more than 30 deaths reported in 2018. \n\nThe Papal visit is expected to attract 15,000 overseas visitors and the final mass will draw a crowd of around 500,000 people. \n\nThe World Health Organisation (WHO) defines a mass gathering as \"a planned or spontaneous event where the number of people attending is sufficient to strain the planning and response resources of the community, state or nation hosting the event\". \n\nDr Jack Lambert, specialist in infectious diseases at the Mater Hospital, Dublin, said the reality is people risk contracting diseases during mass gatherings.\n\n\"There are real outbreaks, as with the Hajj in Saudi Arabia in the past… but most of the population in Ireland are protected against diseases like measles,\" Dr Lambert said. \"But, in saying that, if one person with measles is walking around 15,000 people and coughs, some individuals might get it.\" \n\nHe cautioned, however, that while infectious disease spread is not impossible during the Papal visit, it is \"highly unlikely\" and the risk is \"minimal\". \n\nPope Francis will attend the \u0027Festival of Families\u0027 in Croke Park on August 25 and a final mass in Phoenix Park on August 26. A significant policing plan has been put in place, along with major traffic diversions.\n\nIrish Rail will provide capacity for up to 250,000 journeys for those travelling to the Papal Mass. Extra bus and rail services will be provided by Translink for people travelling from Northern Ireland to Dublin for the visit.\n\nBuses will be run across both days by Translink, with additional services from Belfast, Banbridge, Newry and Londonderry for the Saturday. \n\nOn the Sunday, as well as the destinations listed, additional services will run from Larne, Dungannon, Downpatrick, Limavady, Dungiven, Magherafelt and Newtownards.

This usually happens when I want food.”\n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \nIt’s all about the angles ... do you think this is my good side? My Mom says it’s one of many. 📷: @missyaguilar\n\n \nA post shared by \n Bruno Bartlett\n (@theebrunobartlett) on \nAug 22, 2018 at 7:27am PDT\n\n\n\n\nBruno was adopted on August 21 by Lauren Paris and her boyfriend Jason Bartlett, who live in Chicago. The couple have since created a brand new \nInstagram\n account, where they will post photos of Bruno and document his weight loss. \n\nTo beat off competition from other would-be owners, Lauren, who works in musical theatre, wrote and performed a song about her desire to adopt Bruno. She also sent in letters of intent and recommendation, along with videos of her house, and application paperwork. \n\nLauren said: “I first saw Bruno in Wright Way Rescue’s post that was going viral. There were two pictures of him standing on his hind legs, showing off his curvy body, and a fabulously written bio. There is no other way to put it, than to say – I freaked out at my desk. I just knew we would be a perfect match. \n\n“The shelter kindly allowed us to visit him two days later (after receiving our application and all the materials), and we fell in love. Additionally, everyone there was so kind to us.”\n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \nMy Mom wrote a song about me to make sure she caught the attention of @wrightwayrescue - how extra is that? Don’t worry, she also sent in letters of intent and recommendation, videos of her, my Dad, and my new house, all in addition to the official application. They wanted me for all the right reasons! I met them on Saturday and they showered me and my friends with gifts - that better continue once I get home tomorrow! 😘\n\n \nA post shared by \n Bruno Bartlett\n (@theebrunobartlett) on \nAug 20, 2018 at 1:31pm PDT\n\n\n\n\nLauren said Bruno’s transition into her home has been seamless, and he is very cuddly and affectionate with the couple. \n\nShe said: “We got the call Monday afternoon that we’d been selected. When I saw ‘Wright Way Rescue’ pop up on my phone… I melted. I ran down the hall to clutch my co-worker as I received the news, and squealed and jumped up and down. And then I called everyone I know. \n\n“We’ve just received so much support from family and friends with all of this that it was so exciting to share the news with them too – they had a huge part in getting our video seen.\n\n“I am so happy to report that thus far, Bruno’s transition into our home has been seamless. From the moment he stepped out of the carrier when we brought him home, he’s really seemed at ease. Incredibly affectionate and cuddly, constantly purring.”\n\n\n \n \n\n\n \n \nGuys - great news. I’m HOME!!!!!! Also, I turn into camouflage on my new hardwood floors 😎\n\n \nA post shared by \n Bruno Bartlett\n (@theebrunobartlett) on \nAug 21, 2018 at 9:11pm PDT\n\n\n\n\nSocial media users loved Bruno for his polydactyl paws and chubby tummy, and the cat already has 34,000 followers on Instagram.\n\nLauren said: “I’m sure it sounds silly, but by the time we got in bed Monday night, I just started bawling. I hadn’t realised how much I missed having a cat in my life – I had an amazing cat growing up who was more like my sister (I’m an only child). \n\n“Bruno so far has exceeded our wildest expectations, and we couldn’t be more thrilled to have him as part of our family.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"if dating apps had been around in the 18th century what would your","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

“If this man goes out and about he goes and does things like this. \n\n“Quite frankly I am not letting him loose in Omagh to do more damage to the place.” \n\nHe sentenced Young to three months in prison, but added that this was not a \u0027long-term solution.\u0027 \n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derry shopping centre opens new sensory room facility children autism","story":"\nA Derry shopping

businesses to embark upon having a designated area where children and young people with Autism could have some quiet time, away from the hustle and bustle of daily shopping so it is fantastic to see this move from Foyleside Shopping Centre.\n\n“This dedicated facility is for for children and young people who may struggle with difficult moments associated with Autism while out and about.”\n\nThe new room is situated at the back of the food quarter and will be launched soon.\n\n“Although it has not yet been officially opened, a member of staff will be able to open it on request,\" added Councillor Dobbins.\n\n“I would like to once again congratulate the management and staff for embarking on the necessary training and the concept and design of the Sensory Room.
