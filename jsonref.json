Video: Enda O\u0027Dowd1.5 degrees is now in the driving seat: Despite vague language in much of the final declaration and too many “urges” and not enough “decides to”, Cop26 has delivered a big win.It is by way of acknowledgement the world – all 197 countries backing the 2015 Paris Agreement – has to get on a track rapidly to keep temperature rise to within 1.5 degrees to avoid dangerous climate impacts.Critically, key resolutions to pursue greenhouse gas emissions cuts in line with holding global temperature rises to 1.5 degrees were retained.This must be reinforced by “best available science”. It means countries will no longer get away with “we’re striving to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees” – the notorious political fudge that got the Paris pact across the line.The 2.4 degrees reality check: Promises committing to cut emissions (mitigation) in “nationally-determined contributions” were significantly strengthened in the run up to and during Cop26 summit, following relentless pushing for increased ambition by hosts the UK government – with the “keep 1.5 degrees alive” reminders at every turn.Ireland did its bit by rowing in with its 51 per cent cut. Our poor delivery on achieving cuts remains an issue, but that target means we are among those showing most ambition.After week 1, analysts suggested it all added up to the world being on target for less than 2 degrees, and maybe even 1.8 degrees a historic first. It injected optimism into negotiations.The sucker punch was later when Climate Action Tracker – the most reliable modellers in the world – said no, commitments if delivered would mean a 2.4-degree world. In short, an uninhabitable Earth more intense and ferocious extreme weather events and sea level rise of several metres this century. Trigger gloom at Cop26.It was agreed nations will be asked to return next year to strengthen their so far inadequate targets on emissions cuts – 1.5 degrees has yet to be kept alive but direction of travel is clear.The terrible “here and now” scenario: Global leaders including Taoiseach Micheál Martin landed for the first two days and in upbeat fashion backed greater ambition and participated in a flurry of announcements in form of alliances between various combinations of countries on coal phase out addressing deforestation, methane and unhinging vast amounts of private capital.Going into complex negotiations, that appetite for greater collective action dissipated as some big emitter states reverted to type.It was almost as if too many parties didn’t believe the latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report that concluded the climate crisis is here and now – and no place is safe.US envoy for climate John Kerry, and others, repeatedly underlined mitigation the key lever to force down global temperatures and should be “science, fact based not ideological or political”. There may be the promise of technological solutions such as “carbon capture and storage” to get to net zero. But this is unproven at scale so “we can’t bank on that ...We have to act now.”Methane moves centre stage: The superwarming greenhouse gas methane, arising from fossil fuel production and agriculture, is now the big “no no” in the global fight against global heating. More than 110 countries backed efforts to cut levels by 30 per cent by 2030, rowing in with a US-EU pact.This was further underlined when, unexpectedly, US and China, pushed aside differences on other issues and announced a plan to work together on climate action over the next decade, backed by tangible rapport in Glasgow between John Kerry and lead China negotiator Xie Zhenhua. High up on their action list was methane. This is because cutting levels ensures the quickest win in cooling global temperatures.Unprecedented public engagement: There is no question mobilisation of civil society is at an unprecedented level across that world. That was in evidence in Glasgow despite blatant exclusion of campaigners corralling many activists away from the venue, Covid preventing many from poorer countries attending, staggering costs for most attending the summit, and it feeling “a bit too white and elite” on the inside – amid heavy security at every access point.Stress of climate activism builds relentlessly: But there is a concerning trend evident among young climate activists who attended Cop26. They carry a heavy burden of worry. Many feel acute eco-anxiety and are up front about it. The issue dominates their lives when they should be getting on with living and pursuing life’s voyages of discovery.Unquestionably, this is compounded by their voices not being heard sufficiently they in turn are given token access to negotiations when they have a justifiable case to be at the table.As Elders chair Mary Robinson noted, when Greta Thunberg uses language like blah, blah, blah, “they say ‘is that all there is?” – when they deserve action and assurance this is not the case. Another young Irish climate justice campaigner, Valery Molay, questioned if it was worth coming to Cops any more – yet this is the only available multilateral mechanism the world has got for climate action.Global efforts will not get on the right track without their full participation, and politicians will fail the “providing a just transition” test unless they broaden their narrow mindset on this issue.Big Oil has not gone away: The world is finally beginning to decarbonise and coal is on course for phase out but the fossil fuel sector was all too evident. The NGO Global Witness established at least 503 fossil fuel lobbyists, affiliated with some of the world’s biggest oil and gas giants, were granted access to Cop26, “flooding the Glasgow conference with corporate influence”.In concert with big oil producer countries –\u0026nbspnotably Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Australia and Russia - their fingerprint was evident with weakening of the draft text, which finally came down on “accelerating phase-down of coal and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies”. Some developing countries claimed it provides loop holes allowing them to continue their polluting activities – in spite of being the single biggest source of emissions.The Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance may be only a coalition of less than 10 countries (including Ireland) but it marks a shift in approach by countries committed to greater ambition, and put down a big marker for change. It intends to build to a point where turning off the fossil fuel tap is central to global climate agreements with firmer timelines – as opposed the failed approach of trying to limit oil and gas emissions.Boris on the global stage: With typical unbridled enthusiasm UK prime minister Boris Johnson tried to persuade world leaders to take action on “coal, cars, cash and trees” in advance of Cop26. His keynote address won some plaudits, though his comparing the climate crisis to James Bond being strapped to a doomsday device was greeted with some headscratching.A Daily Mirror opinion piece had the headline: “Boris more Johnny English than James Bond as hypocrisy turns Cop26 moment into farce”.As he had a dinner with chums to attend in a posh London club, he jumped on a private jet and flew home belching out 1,000kg of CO2, when the train would have emitted just 20kg. He returned the following week trying to knock heads together in seeking greater urgency his press conference was dominated by the sleaze controversy.A lesson in effective diplomacy was provided by Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon in spite of her country not being an official party at the summit. She committed £1 million to a loss and damage effort to help developing countries, and was a strong fringe presence throughout. She doubled that funding by the finish, while winning plaudits for Scotland coherence on climate action.The country running the talks, the UK, cut overseas aid just before Glasgow, which did little to build trust with vulnerable countries already suffering due to global heating, though Cop26 president Alok Sharma did much to restore relationships.Capitalism’s big pivot: This was the Cop where the financial world was finally seen to be gearing up for a net-zero world, and it will be backed up for availability of private funds. Some insisted the vast sums about to be unleashed add up to complete reorientation of capitalism.The big announcement on this front was $130 trillion “of capital committed to net zero” by the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero, a group of 450 banks, fund managers and insurers led by UN climate envoy Mark Carney, former governor of the Bank of England.“The implication of this number is that finance is greening the world,” one sceptical banker told the FT. Reality is the transition will require huge state intervention backed by private sector money. The risk for GFANZ is that having overpromised, private finance will under deliver.Mr Carney has defended the extent of commitments and structure for delivery over the coming decades. “People will no longer tolerate worthy statements followed by futile gestures. They won’t settle for governments making announcements at summits that they don’t meet at home, or companies that speak green but don’t act. That’s why we’ve worked to transform the heart of finance,” he added.Urgency gap is glaring: This was supposed to be the Cop of “no more soundbytes, no more empty promises, no more blah, blah, blah”. It may not have lived up to that billing but neither was it “a greenwashing festival” dominated by the Global North, as Thunberg claimed.There was repeated endorsements of the climate emergency but a glaring lack of translating that into the level of urgency now required to have a better chance of avoid catastrophic climate change.The testimonies from countries in the frontline were truly harrowing as many face a future where “there is no high ground”. They are experiencing merciless sea-level rise with the risk that their countries will disappear and their citizens will become refugees.“You might as well bomb us,” declared Surangel Whipps Jr, president of Palau, an archipelago of over 500 islands in the western Pacific, speaking of the pain in watching his country suffer “a slow and painful death”."},{"url":null,"title":"cop26 everyone looks seven years older than they did at the beginning","story":"In the penultimate day of Cop26 nerves are rising among activists and delegates at what will be left in or out of the final document.  Video: Enda O\u0027DowdJournalists work inside the media centre at the Cop26 conference, in Glasgow. Photograph:  Oli ScarffAFP via Getty ImagesAt the Cop26 climate talks in Glasgow, blah blah blah is everywhere. It’s on protesters’ banners and placards outside the conference centre and on the lips of everyone inside, from Mary Robinson to Boris Johnson.But could Greta Thunberg be wrong? Could these five-yearly festivals of disappointment, where agreements fall short both in ambition and execution, still be the world’s best hope of avoiding climate catastrophe?“Build back better. Blah, blah, blah. Green economy. Blah blah blah. Net zero by 2050. Blah, blah, blah,” Thunberg told a youth climate summit in Milan in September.“This is all we hear from our so-called leaders: words. Words that sound great but so far have not led to action. Our hopes and ambitions drown in their empty promises. Of course we need constructive dialogue, but they have now had 30 years of blah, blah blah. And where has this led us?”At a demonstration in Glasgow last week, she said that change would not come from inside the conference centre and that it was on the streets that real leadership was to be found.“We say no more blah blah blah, no more exploitation of people and nature and the planet. No more exploitation. No more blah blah blah. No more whatever the f*** they are doing inside there,” she said.It’s not easy, even from inside the conference centre, to work out “whatever the f*** they are doing” and the most important meetings happen behind closed doors and beyond deepening layers of security. The venue itself is a study in alienation, so vast that one German journalist noted that his daily step count was higher than during a walking holiday in the summer.Social distancing and hygiene measures that are a throwback to the early months of the coronavirus pandemic add to the atmosphere of discomfort and awkwardness. A shortage of chairs and desks sees delegates, activists and reporters sitting on the floor of cold, hangar-like spaces, or perched on the sides of tables as they peer into their laptops.By the end of the second week, everyone looks seven years older than they did at the beginning, nobody has tasted a fresh vegetable since October and the mood has curdled. Billboards around the conference centre show images of pristine snow or solar panels with the single word “now”, which is precisely when most of the people who pass them would like to go home.Those billboards capture something of the curious spirit of climate negotiations, which are dominated by abstract language even as they focus on concrete actions to prevent real catastrophe. Ask one of the participants what they hope the conference will produce and they will say something like “solidarity, credibility and ambition”.Key concepts such as mitigation (reducing greenhouse gases), adaptation (making infrastructure more resilient to the impact of climate change) and loss and damage (compensation for damage caused by climate-related events such as storms and flooding) remain obscure to most outsiders. Even the central goal of “keeping 1.5 alive” is little understood (it means ensuring that the global temperature does not rise by more than 1.5 degrees compared with the middle of the 19th century).There is no established rule for how decisions are made at climate conferences but the practice is that they are taken by consensus, which means that the pace can be set by the least willing. The British presidency of Cop26 sought to circumvent this by starting the conference with a series of multinational announcements on forests, methane emissions and finance.But after the leaders left Glasgow early last week and the negotiations moved into a more technical phase, the initial mood of confidence gave way first to frustration and later to pessimism. It was clear by the middle of this week that the summit’s participants would not be able to agree on commitments that would bring them anywhere close to 1.5 degrees and attention turned to securing an agreement to meet again in a year or two with improved offers of action at a national level.Meanwhile, scientific experts and climate activists have pointed out that there is less to some of the summit’s most high-profile announcements than meets the eye. A commitment to end deforestation by 2030 restates a goal first identified at a summit in 2014, a methane emissions pledge was already announced two months ago and state-controlled companies such as Coal India and Saudi Aramco could evade curbs on coal and oil.But this year’s deforestation pledge is different because big players such as Brazil and Indonesia have signed up to it, and the initiative on methane backed by the US and the European Union has the support of more than 100 countries. Separately, the US and China – the world’s two biggest carbon emitters – have agreed to co-operate on “concrete and pragmatic” regulations to decarbonise, cut methane emissions and fight deforestation.The issue of carbon trading, which allows companies or states to buy and sell credits to emit carbon dioxide remains controversial, with developing countries especially sceptical about its impact and concerned that it could see a land grab by rich countries seeking to plant forests in poor countries to offset their emissions. As it entered its final hours, Cop26 looked unlikely to resolve disagreements over how a carbon trading system should work but the summit saw other initiatives to direct financial markets away from fossil fuels and towards clean technology.The issue of finance has been the most difficult and perhaps the most important, as poor countries struggle to fund the changes they need to manage the impact of climate change and reduce emissions. Rich countries have struggled to reach a target of pledging $100 billion a year in climate finance, which is itself universally recognised as inadequate.Like all its predecessors, Cop26 will be a disappointment, delivering too little too slowly and with inadequate mechanisms to guarantee that promises are kept. But if today’s situation is compared with that in Paris six years ago rather than with an ideal scenario, there are grounds for modest optimism.It was pressure from small island states in Paris that pushed the industrialised countries to consider shifting their goal from 2 degrees to 1.5 degrees. In Glasgow, the more ambitious goal has been at the centre of the negotiations and it is accepted by most participants as essential.Emissions have been falling in some developed countries, even if they continue to rise elsewhere and China’s will continue to increase for a number of years before peaking by 2030. National plans to cut emissions may not go far enough but they are more ambitious than before and many, such as Ireland’s, are enshrined in law.Among the most important changes has been in the attitude of the financial sector, which will not only make financing harmful industries more difficult and expensive but demonstrates that the world of finance recognises the political imperative of dealing with climate change.What has happened since Paris and been accelerated in Glasgow is nothing less than a reorientation of global capitalism towards a carbon neutral future. Economic actors led by the US, China and the EU will make the shift in different ways and at a different pace but the change of direction and increase of urgency are unmistakable. And that amounts to more than blah blah blah."},{"url":null,"title":"cop26 negotiators agree to strengthen emission targets by end of 2022","story":"Almost 200 countries have agreed a pact to tackle climate change, despite disagreements over phasing out fossil fuels and financial help for poorer countries.Cop26 president Alok Sharma brought the gavel down on a two-week conference in Glasgow after delegates agreed on a text more than 24 hours later than scheduled. In a historic move, fossil fuels feature for the first time in a final Cop decision by way of a call for “accelerating efforts towards the phase down of unabated coal power and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies”. In a dramatic move in the closing minutes of the meeting, India proposed a change to the language, replacing the words “phase out” with “phase down”. Mr Sharma appeared close to tears as he apologised for the way the process had unfolded, saying he was “deeply sorry” but he called on delegates to accept the change and approve the text. “I understand the deep disappointment, but it’s vital that we protect this package,” he said to applause. The European Union expressed disappointment at the change, warning it should not mean that it will take longer to exit from coal. But European Commission vice president Frans Timmermans said that should not stop the conference from endorsing what he described as a historic agreement. Representatives from Fiji and the Marshall Islands also protested against the last-minute change but said they would accept the agreement because it included measures their people needed. CutsThe deal, known as the Glasgow Climate Pact, recognises the need for deep emissions cuts this decade in an effort to contain global temperature rise to within 1.5 degrees – though commitments made before Cop26 and during the summit have come up short of delivering this. As a consequence, the decision requests countries revisit the targets “as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022, taking into account different national circumstances” – and in particular to strengthen 2030 targets next year. In the final hours of negotiation, developing countries – representing over six billion people – pushed for a “loss and damage” finance facility to build back in the aftermath of extreme weather events linked to climate change though there is no financing mechanism secured. This was blocked by wealthy countries though they agreed to limited funding for technical assistance and a “dialogue”. For the first time, a goal for adaptation finance was agreed – which was strongly backed by Ireland during negotiations. The commitment to double funding is below what developing countries asked for and need, but if realised it will increase support to developing countries by billions, according to negotiators. Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan welcomed the agreement as a compromise that kept the goal of 1.5C alive.“What the world has done today is to keep 1.5 alive, recommitting to keep the global temperature increase at a level that is liveable for humanity. We can only do that by delivering, including keeping our promises in Ireland to cut greenhouse gas emissions in half this decade and to reach net zero by 2050. “However it is deeply disappointing that the proposal to phase out unabated coal and inefficent fossil fuel subsidies has been watered down as part of the compromise needed to agree a deal,” he said.“We also have to deliver on climate justice by seriously addressing loss and damage in countries worst affected – something Ireland is working to progress. Glasgow has injected fresh momentum in the fight against climate change. We now have to go home and prove it will result in real action that protects people and the planet, and provide a just transition and a better economy for all.”WeakJennifer Morgan of Greenpeace International said the declaration was weak, and the 1.5-degree goal “is only just alive”. “But a signal has been sent that the era of coal is ending. And that matters,” the Cop veteran added. “While the deal recognises the need for deep emissions cuts this decade, those commitments have been punted to next year. Glasgow was meant to deliver on firmly closing the gap to 1.5 degrees and that didn’t happen, but in 2022 nations will now have to come back with stronger targets.”Cop26 saw progress on adaptation, with the developed countries finally beginning to respond to the calls of developing countries for funding and resources to cope with rising temperatures, she acknowledged. “There was a recognition that vulnerable countries are suffering real loss and damage from the climate crisis now, but what was promised was nothing close to what’s needed on the ground. This issue must be at the top of the agenda for developed countries as the Cop goes to Egypt next year,” Ms Morgan said.The line on phasing out unabated coal and fossil fuel subsidies “is weak and compromised but its very existence is nevertheless a breakthrough, and the focus on a just transition is essential”, she said. The call for emissions reductions of 45 per cent by the end of this decade “is in line with what we need to do to stay under 1.5 degree and brings the science firmly into this deal. But it needs to be implemented,” Ms Morgan said.On carbon market issues, she said: “The offsets scam got a boost in Glasgow with the creation of new loopholes that are too big to tolerate, endangering nature, indigenous peoples and the 1.5-degree goal itself. The UN Secretary General announced that a group of experts will bring vital scrutiny to offset markets, but much work still needs to be done to stop the greenwashing, cheating and loopholes giving big emitters and corporations a pass.” On the outcome Oxfam International director Gabriela Bucher said: “Clearly some world leaders think they aren’t living on the same planet as the rest of us. It seems no amount of fires, rising sea levels or droughts will bring them to their senses to stop increasing emissions at the expense of humanity.”She accepted the request to strengthen 2030 reduction targets by next year was an important step. “The work starts now. Big emitters, especially rich countries, must heed the call and align their targets to give us the best possible chance of keeping 1.5 degrees within reach. “Despite years of talks, emissions continue to rise, and we are dangerously close to losing this race against time.” Nick Dearden, director of Global Justice Now, said: “In the last fortnight, the climate justice movement that came out in force in Glasgow and around the world became mainstream. “We showed that you can’t tackle climate change without a radical transformation of the global economy and reparations from those who fuelled climate change to those facing its worst impacts,” he said.“But this hollowed-out agreement shows that, for all the lip service they paid, world leaders and big business have not listened.” "},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney locates psychedelic fungi in the context of culture, therapy and dangerStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"ireland could have 12 000 covid cases a day by christmas academics say","story":"Chief medical officer Tony Holohan urged people to ‘keep your contacts low and avoid crowds’ and to meet outside if possible. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsIreland could record more than 12,000 Covid-19 cases a day by Christmas, according to a forecast by US academics.Cases would peak at 12,300 a day in late December before falling again, while a further 2,000 deaths would occur by the start of March, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME), which is based at the University of Washington.The institute, which has correctly predicted trends earlier in the pandemic, attributes the rise in cases in the northern hemisphere to winter seasonality, waning immunity, decreased mask use and increased mobility levels.A further 5,843 confirmed cases were notified on Friday, the sixth-highest daily total since the start of the pandemic.Case numbers in the coming days are likely to remain at such high levels, as the process of clearing a massive backlog of tests is under way.The total number of confirmed cases, currently at 490,000, is set to pass the half-million mark within days. However, a total of 511,282 positive tests has been recorded.Friday’s figures include a backlog of about 1,200 cases from the past three days.There were 549 Covid-19 patients in hospital on Friday morning, up six on the previous day. This included 96 in intensive care, down one.‘Very significant increase’Chief medical officer Dr Tony Holohan said Friday’s high figures were another indication of the “very significant increase” in the incidence of the disease across almost all age groups.He said vaccination remained extraordinarily effective against severe disease, with the vast majority of people with Covid-19 experiencing mild symptoms.“However, the outcome for any one inidual who is diagnosed with Covid-19 is uncertain and it remains vital that we all continue to adhere to the public-health advice in order to protect ourselves and our families.“As we look ahead to the weekend, we need to continue to make every effort we can to drive down incidence of disease and break the chains of transmission,” Dr Holohan said. “Before you leave the house, think about the number of people you are going to meet, and the risk associated with the activities you have planned.”He urged people to “keep your contacts low and avoid crowds” and to meet outside if possible.“If you have any symptoms of Covid-19, you should assume that you have this virus, self-isolate immediately and arrange a test. Do not assume that it’s just a cough or a cold.”Meanwhile, more than 6,000 children and teenagers tested positive for Covid-19 in the first week of November, the latest figures from the Health Protection Surveillance Centre have shown. Rising case counts across Europe have forced a rethink on public-health measures by many governments. The Netherlands has ordered bars, restaurants and non-essential stores to close at 7pm for at least three weeks starting on Saturday.

Photograph: Jeff J MitchellGetty ImagesThe outcome of Cop26 falls far short of what is necessary to tackle the climate crisis, but countries who are climate leaders must show the way forward, “and let history judge the laggards”, according to Friends of the Earth Ireland (FoE).Irish climate NGOs and overseas aid organisations expressed disappointment about the outcome of the UN climate summit in Glasgow, though some welcomed gains on climate finance for poorer countries and increased funding for “adaptation” to help make climate-vulnerable states more resilient in face of inevitable impacts from global warming.“Glasgow was a staging post not a finishing line,” said FoE director Oisín Coghlan. He said what was clear now was that formal negotiations through this UN process “may never produce an outcome that reflects the urgency of the science and the imperative of justice. Not when the final text is effectively subject to a veto from any polluting country with a brass neck”.Collective agreement is no longer the limit on global action it once was, Mr Coghlan said. “While some countries are still dragging their heels others are beginning to pick up the pace. Equally, while fossil fuel companies are lobbying for the path of delay and destruction others are grasping the business opportunities of the race to zero.”The global climate movement was growing in strength and ersity, and this would continue in an effort to secure a better response by governments, he said.“We may not yet have succeeded in forging the international agreement we want but increasingly we can hold our national governments to the standards required by the 1.5-degree goal in the Paris agreement.“The two-steps forward, one-step back nature of the annual climate talks is deeply frustrating but we must pocket any modest gains from Glasgow – the first mention of phasing out of fossil fuels and the renewed commitment to adaptation finance for example – and ratchet up our demands for the next time,” he added. “Collectively our governments have not met the moment but our international movement emerges from Glasgow stronger than ever. We return home to push our national governments harder than ever to act in line with science and equity.”Mary Robinson, chair of the Elders group of international figures founded by Nelson Mandela, pushed repeatedly for greater ambition during the two-week long negotiations. She said it had made some progress, “but nowhere near enough to avoid climate disaster. While millions around the world are already in crisis, not enough leaders were in crisis mode. People will see this as a historically shameful dereliction of duty”.Climate activist Dr Lorna Gold, chairwoman of the Laudato Si Movement, said the outcome was a huge disappointment. “The only thing worse than this would have been no outcome. That would have spelt disaster. The outcome shows that the majority of leaders still do not yet fully accept the reality of the situation.”Last-minute watering down of critical language on phasing out coal deepened mistrust and did bode well for the road ahead, she added. “That said, this Cop was not just about the official outcome. Many key initiatives have been signed – including the agreement on methane and Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance, to which Ireland signed up.”On the fringes, however, critical discussions were held on financial realignment, including value-based organisations rapidly shifting financial assets into clean energy and adaptation, she noted. “The awakening of global finance is good news. Cop26 has not been a disaster – but not a success either. Some would call it a ‘compromise’ – a ‘balanced outcome’. Sadly, a rapidly changing climate does not react to such human excuses.”The failure of global leaders to include “loss and damage” financing in the final agreement is “deeply disappointing” and a “missed opportunity” by the powerful nations who have contributed most to climate change, according to Trócaire. The overseas development agency said the deal failed to show solidarity in supporting shattered communities recover and rebuild after climate disasters. Trócaire head of policy and advocacy Siobhán Curran, who attended Cop26, said: “There were huge expectations that Cop26 would be the moment when wealthy countries stepped up and acknowledged they have done most to cause the climate crisis. They have turned their backs on indigenous communities, small-scale farmers, women and girls who desperately need support to recover and rebuild after climate disasters. This is a matter of great injustice.” Ms Curran said although the commitment to “urgently deliver” $100 billion (€87 billion) for climate finance was welcome, it is still a fraction of the amount that will be needed in the face of the climate emergency. Trócaire chief executive Caoimhe de Barra said: “This was an exclusionary Cop. Civil society found it difficult to access the Cop sessions, and many were excluded from the negotiation area. “People from the global South and countries most affected by the climate crisis were under-represented . . . yet they are the most affected communities and their voices needed to be heard.” Simon Murtagh of Oxfam Ireland said: “At every level, Cop26 did not deliver the goals we sought urgent action on. The process couldn’t deliver for small island states facing immediate destruction. Nor could it deliver for two million Kenyans currently left destitute by the effects of climate change, nor for millions more in Yemen, Madagascar or central America, who face hunger and destitution caused by climate change.”"},{"url":null,"title":"imperfect cop26 deal builds platform for hastening climate action","story":"US special climate envoy John Kerry gestures at a press conference at the close of the Cop26 UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow on Saturday. Photograph: Paul EllisAFP via Getty Images As they emerged from the final plenary after two weeks of talks, exhausted Cop26 negotiators – some shocked at last-minute compromise on the vexatious issue of coal – knew they’d been through a bruising battle where “uncomfortable” compromise marked the outcome.In spite of this, tangible commitments, and even progressive moves to shift course, were nailed down. For the first time a Cop agreement targets fossil fuels as the key driver of global warming. The tone is much different to the usual arcane language of UN climate summit outcomes. The 2015 Paris Agreement is finally moving to gearing-up stage. There is no doubt now that keeping global temperature rise to within 1.5 degrees is the priority of the 197 signatory countries, who can no longer put vague commitments on the table in the hope that the world might warm by less than two degrees. Emerging into the Glasgow daylight probably provided a far greater shock for negotiating teams, especially political leaders heading up delegations, as the reaction was marked by a wave of deep disappointment. Reaction in climate-vulnerable states can be summed up by one word – despair. Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan admitted that dramatic twist was “gut wrenching” as India – the world’s third biggest emitter – pushed for “phase down” rather than “phase out” of coal. This prompted a rushed manoeuvre by the European Union, China and United States to amend the text in the interests of holding “what we’ve got”, though it was against protocols and the final political, rather than legal, decision was already agreed going into the final plenary. The critical target of keeping global warming to within 1.5 degrees was still alive, Cop26 president Alok Sharma insisted a view backed by those big players. “What the world has done today is to keep 1.5 alive, recommitting to keep the global temperature increase at a level that is liveable for humanity,” Ryan said.Unfinished businessMuch unfinished business, however, is confirmed by definitive analysis published in Glasgow showing all promises made before and at the UN summit make for a 2.4 degree rise in temperatures, where already dangerous climate impacts would become catastrophic. “For many countries, two degrees is a death sentence,” executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Patricia Espinosa said.The deal backs “best available science” to inform actions. Applying that framework, there is no sugar-coating the standout failure of ambition on actions to curb emissions, leaving our fragile planet still hanging by a thread. That said, there is enough to suggest the world is facing into a decade of scaled-up action. In that scenario the request that parties “revisit and strengthen the 2030 targets in their nationally determined contributions as necessary to align with the Paris Agreement temperature goal by the end of 2022” becomes the key enabler. A request in “UN speak” is close to a demand.The temperature issue aside, this was the most productive Cop since Paris. Decisions on doubling adaptation finance and setting up a body to assist countries most impacted by climate disruption represents progress, but more is needed. When it comes to hard money, the long-awaited $100 billion a year for developing countries under climate finance will be realised, while adaptation funding to help vulnerable countries adjust for inevitable climate impacts is set to be in excess of $1 trillion a year by 2025.While Cop26 failed to generate dedicated finance for “loss and damage” because of resistance by wealthy countries, vulnerable countries agreed to compromise on the understanding more help would come soon. Ireland has offered to co-host a “dialogue” to come up with ways of supporting those most affected. The outcome also finalises the most contentious elements of the Paris Agreement rule book, encapsulated in article six, six years after the landmark deal was done. This includes facilitation of a global carbon-trading market that closes glaring loopholes such as “double counting” of carbon credits.CompromiseA historic proposal to “phase out unabated coal and inefficient fossil fuel subsidies” was watered down part of the compromise needed to agree a deal by inserting “phase down”. It has left a bad aftertaste, especially for the EU. The reality, however, is the economics of coal-powered electricity generation no longer add up in face of cheap solar and wind energy. The coal industry that once brought wealth to the developed world is coming to a rapid end, probably by 2030. Developing countries are predicted to follow the same course over the following decade. Outside the COP process, groups of countries committed to ending fossil fuel extraction, to accelerate the phasing out of coal, to tackling methane and to ending deforestation. If all of this is delivered, acceleration of decarbonisation over the coming decade is realisable. New alliances between public and private sectors have been forged, especially on switching to green energy. There was also a strong indication that the financial world is gearing up for transitioning to a world of net-zero emissions.Analysis by Climate Action Tracker and the International Energy Agency indicate fresh pledges made over the past fortnight have the potential to reduce global warming by 0.5 degrees – a significant stride toward the 1.5 target. Delivery reinforced by meaningful near-term commitments is critical. Being unable to bend the emissions curve downwards this decade will put huge pressure on the remaining carbon budget for “keeping 1.5 degrees alive”. The Cop26 outcome has been described as a political lifeline for accelerating action to keep temperature rise below 1.5 degrees, but science indicates forcing down the global emissions curve in just nine years is essential. As climate scientist Prof John Sweeney has highlighted, the latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report has four out of five possible scenarios which indicate the world will exceed 1.5 degrees over the next 20 years. The one that keeps us to within 1.5 degrees is a trajectory the world is nowhere near at present. It will be some years before we know if Cop26 has helped bridge the gap.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Saint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"bravest vc","story":"In a quiet corner of Twickenham Cemetery, south-west London, beneath the outstretched branches of a gnarled cherry tree, there is a black marble tombstone. “Cherished memories of a dearly loved husband, father and grandfather,” reads the inscription.However, it is two letters after the name of the inidual that makes this grave so different from the others: “V.C.”, standing for Victoria Cross, Britain and the Commonwealth’s most prestigious decoration for gallantry in the presence of the enemy.This is the grave of Warrant Officer Norman Jackson VC as someone with a lifelong interest in bravery, I am the privileged custodian of the Jackson medal group. It is part of my VC collection – more than 200 strong and the largest in the world – that is on public display in the Imperial War Museum, London.Yet there is no single VC action that I admire more than the one carried out by Jackson during a bombing mission in the spring of 1944. Nearly 80 years on, the selfless act of valour that Jackson performed still seems impossible to comprehend.Norman Cyril Jackson was born in Ealing, west London, on April 8, 1919 and within months he had been adopted. After attending schools in Twickenham, he became a fitter and turner.On October 20, 1939, less than two months after the outbreak of the Second World War, he joined the RAF Volunteer Reserve, initially working as ground crew, then becoming a flight engineer.In July 1943, and by then a sergeant, he joined 106 Squadron at Syerston, Nottinghamshire, and completed around a dozen sorties before the squadron moved to RAF Metheringham, Lincolnshire, in early November.By April 24, 1944, Jackson had completed his scheduled tour of 30 operations, mostly over heavily-defended German targets. However, before taking some time off, he volunteered for one more sortie on the night of April 267 because the rest of the crew were one mission behind him. The target that night for the Lancaster crew was Schweinfurt, which was at the centre of the German ball-bearing industry.The Lancaster’s bombs were dropped successfully and the aircraft was climbing out of the target area when, suddenly, it was attacked by a night fighter at nearly 20,000 feet.The captain took evading action at once, but the enemy Focke-Wulfe 190 secured several hits. A fire started near a petrol tank on the upper surface of the aircraft’s starboard wing.Sergeant Jackson had been thrown to the floor during the attack and he was also wounded by shell splinters in his right leg and shoulder. Recovering his composure, he obtained his captain’s permission to try to put out the flames.Pushing a small fire extinguisher into the top of his flying jacket and grabbing small axe, he jettisoned the escape hatch. He then started to climb out in order to reach the burning wing.With the Lancaster travelling at 200 mph, he released his parachute inside the aircraft. This enabled other crew to hold on to the rigging lines, paying them out as Jackson crawled into the unknown. As he inched his way towards the fire, he slipped and grasped on to the leading edge of the starboard wing.Using the axe to secure a grip, he fought the blaze with the extinguisher. Despite his best efforts, the fire spread and soon his face, hands and clothing were severely burnt. Even worse, the enemy fighter came back and strafed the Lancaster a second time, forcing Jackson to drop the fire extinguisher. Unable to keep his hold on, Jackson was swept through the flames and into the night.When last seen falling towards the ground, his parachute was only partly inflated and was burning in a number of places. Jackson, with his parachute ablaze, was unable to control his descent and landed heavily. He suffered a broken ankle, his right eye was closed and his hands were burnt so badly as to render them useless.At daybreak, he crawled to the nearest village on his knees and elbows because his hands were such a mess. Once the German authorities were alerted to his presence, he was taken as a Prisoner of War and transported to Dulag Luft, a prison camp that acted as collection and interrogation centre for newly-captured Allied aircrew before they were transferred to more permanent camps.However, due to his 17 separate injuries, Jackson spent his first ten months in hospital before being imprisoned with other POWs. During his captivity, he made two escape attempts, the second, close to the end of the war in Europe, was successful. He met up with troops from General Patton’s Third Army near Munich.Jackson eventually learned that four others from the seven Lancaster crew had survived the attack. After the war he was reunited with his wife Alma, whom he had married in London on Boxing Day 1942. They eventually had seven children, four sons and three daughters.As the full story of Jackson’s courage emerged, he was recommended for the VC. His decoration was announced in The London Gazette on October 26, 1945 when his citation ended, “By his ready willingness to face these dangers he set an example of self-sacrifice which will ever be remembered.”Jackson returned to Britain on VE Day and received his VC at Buckingham Palace from George VI on November 13, 1945.  He retired in the rank of warrant officer with a disability pension and was always modest about his wartime role, once saying of his VC action: “I was the most experienced member of the crew, and they all looked to me to do something.”He worked as a travelling salesman for Haig whisky after the war, and died at Hampton Hill, Middlesex, on March 26, 1994, aged 74.Jackson’s VC was auctioned in London in 2004 at the request of his family. The medal group fetched a hammer price of £200,000, plus auctioneer’s commission. At the time, this was the highest auction price ever paid for a VC but one that reflected the incredible story behind the award.Furthermore, it was because of brave men like Norman Jackson that, more than a decade ago, I pledged £1million towards a £6.7million fund to build a permanent Bomber Command Memorial in London’s Green Park. This was built and unveiled by the Queen in the summer of 2012.Earlier this week, I visited Twickenham Cemetery to pay my respects to Jackson at his graveside and to meet one of his five surviving children. David Jackson, 68, a semi-retired businessman, told me: “Dad was a wonderful man with a great sense of humour. He was humble and rarely discussed his VC action but there is no doubt that the bravery he showed was simply incredible.”This week, as we commemorate our war dead, my thoughts have turned again and again to Norman Jackson VC, a man whose courage and self-sacrifice must never be forgotten and who, arguably, carried out the greatest VC action of all time.Lord Ashcroft KCMG PC is a businessman, philanthropist, author and pollster.

Freedom-loving societies are not just the best places to live, they are the most successful. When the Berlin Wall fell and the Iron Curtain came crashing down three decades ago, renewed democracies were established across eastern Europe. People have become freer, living better lives and their children have better futures. But these hard-won gains are now at risk with malign, autocratic regimes seeking to take away people’s freedom.Look at what’s happening in Belarus. The escalating stand-off at the Polish border marks the latest step by the Lukashenko regime to undermine regional security. He is using desperate migrants as pawns in his bid to create instability and cling on to power, regardless of the human cost.The United Kingdom will not look away. We will stand with our allies in the region, who are on the frontier of freedom. That’s why we are proud to be the first European country to assist Poland by agreeing to send a small team of personnel to provide engineering support to ease pressure at the border.In the same way, we were the first European country to put sanctions on the Lukashenko regime, targeting more than 100 iniduals and organisations with measures including asset freezes and travel bans. This shows we are ready to take the lead in standing up for freedom and democracy, acting robustly, decisively and relentlessly to take on malign actors wherever they are in the world.We are not just standing side by side with Poland as it bears the brunt of this shameful manufactured migrant crisis, but also the others in the Visegrad Four – Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic – and our friends in the Baltics and Ukraine.In Belarus, this carefully crafted crisis is an attempt to ert attention away from the litany of abhorrent acts and human rights violations that the regime has already committed. Since the fraudulent election in August 2020, we have seen members of the opposition, journalists and activists beaten, jailed and killed, while others have been forced into exile.In contrast to their tyrannical leaders, the people of Belarus are true democrats. We have seen ordinary citizens risking everything to stand up for their rights and keep the flame of freedom alive. As the chairman of the Belarusian Association of Journalists, Andrei Bastunets, said: “Today, the law does not defend us. Today, we defend the law.” Russia has a clear responsibility here. It must press the Belarusian authorities to end the crisis and enter into dialogue.We need to fight for the rule of law, freedom and democracy, and we must take that fight to where that ideological battle is. Security is no longer solely about military hardware. The battle is now taking place in cyberspace, the economy and in the appalling use of people as collateral.We will join forces with our partners to advance our shared interests. At the Nato foreign ministers’ summit in Riga in a few weeks’ time, we will put forward new proposals to challenge the 21st-century methods of aggression being used by those who threaten our freedoms, economies and democracies.The world is changing and modern threats are more complex. That idea lies at the heart of the Integrated Review of security, defence, development and foreign policy the Government published earlier this year. We need to work with allies who believe we must have a world where freedom-loving democracies don’t just survive, but thrive.That is why we remain the largest European spender on defence in Nato – the world’s greatest defence alliance. It is why we are working with friends and allies in south-east Asia, where we are deepening our defence, maritime and security ties. This week in Indonesia, the world’s third-largest democracy, I agreed new ties in cyber. I also visited Thailand and Malaysia, where our co-operation includes the Five Power Defence Arrangements. We are also increasing our defence collaboration with India, Israel and many others around the world. Through Aukus we are collaborating with the US and Australia on the next generation of technologies.I want our friends across Europe to join us. That means standing together, for example in opposing the construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. It risks undermining European security by allowing Russia to tighten its grip on those nations who rely on its gas, despite the pandemic reminding us about the importance of having erse supply chains to avoid being strategically dependent on unreliable partners.At this critical time, we should be deepening our investment and trade ties with countries that follow the rules and allow free-market economies to thrive.

Modelling by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) predicted large falls in November and low case numbers by Christmas.On Sunday, the Government reported 36,517 new cases in Britain, a fall of nearly 30 per cent since the last peak on October 21. Deaths are also down nearly seven per cent in the last week and hospital admissions by 13 per cent.However, despite the positive figures, Independent Sage is continuing to call for “Plan B” to be implemented “to save Christmas” and has warned that the NHS will not be able to cope under current pressures.The Royal College of Nursing has also called for the mandatory wearing of face masks to be reimposed.The Government is relying on the booster programme to protect the most vulnerable over the winter period, with 12 million people given their third jab by Sunday.“Every jab builds our wall of defence across the country ahead of Christmas,” said Sajid Javid, the Health Secretary.Those eligible for a top-up vaccine – people over 50 and those most at risk of Covid-19 – can now pre-book their jab five months after their second dose, so that they can have the injection on the day they become eligible.The NHS confirmed it had carried out more than 90 million vaccinations since the programme began last December, including one million 12 to 15-year-olds.Dr Emily Lawson, head of the NHS Covid-19 Vaccination Programme, said: “I would urge families to look at the information together and then book in to give children and their loved ones crucial protection ahead of winter.”More from NewsLiverpool Women\u0026#39s Hospital: Counter-terror police lead investigation into taxi explosion that kills oneLondon has its ‘Gherkin’ but Parisians are turning up their noses at skyscraping ‘Brie’The bank of mum and dad should be withdrawn now you are a grown-up, court tells 32-year-oldElderly being blocked from Covid vaccine booster jabs because of NHS blundersScotland’s problems of little concern as self-glorifying Nicola Sturgeon casts one eye to the futureThree people stung to death as storms in Egypt wash scorpions and snakes into the streetsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid test firm sell swabs carrying customers dna","story":"A leading Covid-19 testing firm is planning to sell swabs containing customer’s DNA, prompting an investigation from the UK’s data privacy watchdog.Cignpost Diagnostics, a government-approved supplier trading as Express Test, said it will analyse samples to sell the information to third parties, company documents have revealed.The company claimed it will also use the medical data to learn more about human health and develop new drugs and products, the Sunday Times reported.Customers booking tests through the Express Test website were not clearly told their data would be used for purposes beyond Covid-19 testing, the paper alleged.Instead, they were reportedly asked to tick a box agreeing to a 4,876-word privacy policy, which links to another document outlining its research programme.Typically, analysis of sensitive medical information can only be carried out with explicit informed consent.Cignpost diagnostics, which has 71 walk-in locations across the UK, is reported to have delivered up to three million tests since June last year.The company charges between £35 and £120 for a PCR test and is estimated to have generated tens of millions of pounds from test fees alone.Its research programme information sheet, last updated on October 21, says the company retains data including biological samples and the DNA obtained from such samples, as well as genetic information derived from processing your DNA sample ... using various technologies such as genotyping and whole or partial genome sequencing.The policy also says Cignpost may share customers’ DNA samples and other personal information with collaborators working with them or independently, including universities and private companies, and that it may receive compensation in return.It is unclear how many samples have been stored by Cignpost or whether they have been sold or used for any research so far, but the policy says that data belonging to all those providing a swab is retained indefinitely.Last week, Cignpost removed references to its research programme from its privacy policy after evidence of its activities was passed to the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office (ICO) and the Human Tissue Authority.The ICO has confirmed it is investigating the issue.In response to the claims from the Sunday Times, Cignpost said it is in full compliance with all laws related to data privacy, adding: We have invested significantly in robust systems and processes to ensure we protect our customers.

Unfortunately, that is what triggering Article 16 would entail (the EU side has even threatened a trade war) and it is an eventuality for which the Prime Minister must prepare. If Boris Johnson fails to do so, he will utterly undermine his own position in trying to renegotiate the Northern Ireland Protocol.That lesson was surely learned during Theresa May’s failed Brexit negotiations. She started out well, declaring that “no deal is better than a bad deal”. But then she went on to make no preparations for a “no deal” exit, making it plain to Michel Barnier and his team that under no circumstances would she ever allow it to happen. Barnier calculated, correctly, that this would allow him to treat May with contempt and lined up Britain for what the then-foreign secretary Boris Johnson called “punishment beatings”.In his own Brexit negotiations as Prime Minister in the autumn of 2019, Johnson was more serious about preparing for no deal, though the fact that he agreed to erect an internal border between Britain and Northern Ireland is the reason we are in such a mess now.He should not make the same error of allowing the EU to dictate terms again. Rather he should prepare for the economic dislocation and likely trade war that would be precipitated by triggering Article 16 by getting ready to do everything that the EU would least want us to do. This would involve an emergency Budget to slash taxes and deregulate –  we have hardly varied from any EU laws yet, which raises the question of why Johnson was so keen to leave in the first place. He should also target EU companies specifically with tax breaks to encourage them to relocate, and offer fast-track visas to any EU citizen who has a wealth-creating, job-creating business. In short, he should be prepared to turn Britain into what the EU feared most: a Singapore moored 20 miles off Calais.Britain should be laying the diplomatic groundwork, too. The idea that we would be somehow breaking international law by dumping the Protocol is bunk. Article 16 was written into the withdrawal agreement so that either side could unilaterally suspend the agreement in whole or in part if it was found to be causing “economic, societal or environmental difficulties”.This is clearly the case in Northern Ireland – and the Government, including our ambassadors around the world, should not be afraid to say so. As for Joe Biden, who would be sure to kick up a stink, Johnson needs to ask the US President every time he opens his mouth on the subject: how would he feel if some other country had the power to force him to put up a hard border between Delaware and the rest of the US?No one should want a trade war with the EU to happen. But to prepare for that outcome now is the only way we are going to dig Northern Ireland out of the deep hole into which it has been dumped.More from NewsThe bank of mum and dad should be withdrawn now you are a grown-up, court tells 32-year-oldElderly being blocked from Covid vaccine booster jabs because of NHS blundersScotland’s problems of little concern as self-glorifying Nicola Sturgeon casts one eye to the futureLiverpool Women\u0026#39s Hospital: Counter-terror police lead investigation into taxi explosion that kills oneThree people stung to death as storms in Egypt wash scorpions and snakes into the streetsCovid self-isolation rules to end by March under ‘Operation Rampdown’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"patricia cornwell put woke fisherfolk stories avoid rocking","story":"Patricia Cornwell has revealed she is now using the word “fisherfolk” instead of “‘fisherman” to avoid offending her readers.The best-selling crime writer known for the Kay Scarpetta novels has said she constantly grapples with the problem of which words are deemed acceptable or not.Cornwell admitted to having to use alternative vocabulary in her work, saying that the gender-neutral “fisherfolk” had replaced the traditional “fishermen” amid greater public sensitivity over causing offence.The American author said: “I deal with this all the time, like you can’t say a vehicle is ‘manned’. It has to be ‘crewed’.“I spent about 45 minutes yesterday trying to figure out the politically correct way to refer to people who fish for a living. Can’t call them ‘fishermen’. So I called them fisherfolks.“Everybody’s so worried about offending everybody.”Her comments come after a string of controversial decisions on the use of language made by major organisations, including the BBC.Last year, Katya Adler, the BBC’s Europe editor, faced a backlash after using the term “fisherpeople” on a Radio 4’s Today programme, despite women making up only a small fraction of trawler crews.Words that could be linked to historical racism were also reviewed by the BBC following Black Lives Matter protests in 2020, with “blackballed”, “blacklisted”, and “nitty-gritty” highlighted in training material on racial bias.Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals Trust this year became the first to adopt gender-neutral language in its communications. The NHS trust introduced terms such as “chestfeeding” alongside “breastfeeding”, “human milk” with “breast milk”, and “birthing parent” instead of “mother”.Similarly at the University of Manchester, a style guide was issued advising that words such as “manpower”, “chairman” and “mankind” could be replaced with the gender-neutral terms.Speaking to The Sunday Times, Cornwell said of the linguistic trend: “I mean, when are they going to say you can’t call them black holes any more? What will it be, a non-white hole?”Cornwell has argued that issues of racial ision have been made worse by the advent of social media, saying: “Instead of pulling everybody together, it’s isive. They keep saying we are different.“We’re treated different because I’m a woman, or I’m gay or I’m black or I’m white, or I’m Hiic or trans or whatever it might be. And that is a real shame. This has got to change, or the planet won’t survive.”Cornwell is set to publish her latest Kay Scarpetta thriller, Autopsy, through HarperCollins on Nov 25. The novel is the 25th to feature the fictional medical examiner with the first title, Postmortem, first published in 1990. More from NewsThe bank of mum and dad should be withdrawn now you are a grown-up, court tells 32-year-oldElderly being blocked from Covid vaccine booster jabs because of NHS blundersScotland’s problems of little concern as self-glorifying Nicola Sturgeon casts one eye to the futureLiverpool Women\u0026#39s Hospital: Counter-terror police lead investigation into taxi explosion that kills oneThree people stung to death as storms in Egypt wash scorpions and snakes into the streetsCovid self-isolation rules to end by March under ‘Operation Rampdown’More from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"gina tonic matt hancock lover","story":"Exclusive: Matt Hancocks lover bins bottles of booze outside lovenest before sharing kissWhile the country is still in the grip of the pandemic, Mr Hancock and Gina Coladangelo are happily enjoying time at their new lovenestGina Coladangelo puts a bag of bottles in the bin Image: colin jackByNigel NelsonPolitical Editor:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov | commentsEmpty booze bottles are binned by Matt Hancock’s lover – then the couple share a kiss just like the one that cost him his job. While the country is still in the grip of the pandemic, Mr Hancock and Gina Coladangelo are happily enjoying time at their new lovenest. The former Health Secretary, , has a flat in a two-storey block in West Hampstead, North London. And married Ms Coladangelo, his former aide, has been coming to stay overnight. She was spotted hauling a large bag of empties into the bin. Father-of-three Mr Hancock, meanwhile, went out to his car to take out boxes full of his stuff, before heading off to work.Days later they were seen sharing an embrace at the door after Gina, , had taken the bins out again. They locked lips, just as they did in the MP’s office back in June, when social distancing did not seem to be uppermost in their minds. Mr Hancock, who had presided over the Government’s shambolic handling of the pandemic, later fell on his sword and resigned. Neighbours in West Hampstead say the couple look very happy together. One said: “Wasn’t it Theresa May who said that taking the bins out was a boy’s job  Looks like Matt’s turned that on its head. “It looks like they’ve settled in pretty quickly, and they’re obviously really cosy with each other.”The pair have enjoyed two getaways in recent weeks – to the Swiss Alps and Croatia. Mr Hancock’s marriage of  years to we Martha broke down in the wake of the CCTV clinch scandal.At the time he said: “The last thing I would want is for my private le to distract attention from the single-minded focus that is leading us out of this crisis. “I reiterate my apology for breaking the guidance, and apologise to my family and loved ones for putting them through this. I also need to be with my children at this time.” Gina is a mother of three. Her children and husband Oliver Tress – founder of retail chain Oliver Bonas – live in the £.million family home in Wandsworth, South London.aposHeaposll need a stf drink once the inquiry startsapos - Analysis, by Nigel Nelson No wonder Matt Hancock is hitting the bottle. Not only did he lose the extra £, a year he was paid on top of his MP salary for his Health Secretary job. But soon after that he was disqualied from another one. And the only outside earnings he has been able to make to fund his new home is £, from a newspaper article. Though he is trying to negotiate a £, book deal. Not that he would have been quids in with the UN role helping Africa’s economy recover from Covid – as it was unpaid. But it would have given him the kudos he needs to rebuild his shattered political career. The UN withdrew last month’s offer after finding an obscure rule which says sitting MPs are prohibited from the post – and Africa was spared. Now Hancock will need a few more stf drinks before the sleaze row rocking Westminster engulfs him, too. It will not be long before his own cronyism is back under the microscope. The National Audit Office said half the £billion on pandemic contracts was awarded without competitive tender. Even the MP’s local pub landlord won a deal for Covid tests. Nothing to do with me, guv, said Hancock. And he’d better get a good stock of hooch in before the public inquiry into the pandemic begins as flowers bloom next spring. He won’t come up smelling of roses. PPE shortages, the test and trace fiasco and discharging patients with Covid back into care homes are mistakes likely to be laid at his door.

For too long, mental health has been ignored, treated as less important than physical health. But attitudes have changed and we all realise its importance. All, it seems, except the Government. The last decade or so of Tory rule has seen mental health provision slashed to the bone. Services have gone, units closed, beds disappeared. Those in charge have been careless. It’s bad enough during normal times. But in a pandemic it’s downright dangerous.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section  Now the seeds they have sown are bearing fruit. Last year every hospital had , people in a mental health crisis brought to AE by ambulance. That’s a % jump since . The system couldn’t cope anyway. Now it’s breaking. Ambulances are backing up outside hospitals, waiting lists are at all-time highs, paramedics and police are struggling to cope. The solutions are clear: proper funding for health services and proper provision for mental health, a revolution in social care, better pay and conditions for our health service staff. It’s a lot, but this Government has a knack of finding money when it needs to. This isn’t for a trip to the Cayman Islands though. This is big money to save our NHS, end the mental health crisis and enable our health service do what it does best: caring for people and saving lives.

But he continued as an advisory director at £, a year for just two hours work a month. He also makes £, a year from OpSec Security and £, from software company Enviivo. He has worked for Investcorp on and off since . From - the register of MPs’ financial interests shows he received £,. He lost the Bedford seat in  but was elected in North East Beds two years later. Since then he has had £, – seven quarterly sums of £, plus £,, £, and £, for extra work. Hazem Ben-Gacem, co-CEO of global firm Investcorp, has given Mr Fuller £, in political donations since . Investcorp has pumped millions into technology firms in China.  In , it invested in the China Everbright Limited New Economy Fund. In  it started to jointly manage the fund, overseen by the Chinese government. A key beneficiary was Sense Time, which has done work for China’s powerful propaganda unit. In a  patent for a facial-recognition product, Sense Time stated: “It is possible to ide the ethnicities... according to Han, non-Han and unknown, or according to Han, Uyghur, non-Han, non-Uyghur, and unknown.” Investcorp also backed Terminus, an AI firm involved in fitting “surveillance cam-eras with image identication capability” in some Chinese cities.

The family from South West London think nine-year-old Kip caught the virus when they had Covid in October .Vets at Ralph Veterinary Referral Centre in Marlow, Buckinghamshire checked Kit and Montpellier University in France carried out further analysis, confirming the diagnosis.Experts say there is no evidence the animal was involved in the transmission of the disease to its owners, or that pets or other domestic animals are able to transmit the virus to people.Alison told The Sun : “The family had Covid in October  and we think that is how Kip got infected. We thought it might be Covid because we heard a lot of people were suffering with heart arrhythmia but it was not thought pets could get it at the time.He was really poorly for a few weeks.” In line with international agreements, Kipaposs case was reported to the World Organisation for Animal Health. He has now fully recovered. The British Veterinary Association said: “Confirmed cases in cats and dogs worldwide remain rare and it’s highly likely that the transmission route was from infected owners to their pets, rather than the other way round.” Last week chief veterinary officer Christine Middlemiss said: There is no clear evidence to suggest that pets directly transmit the virus to humans. We will continue to monitor this situation closely and will update our guidance to pet owners should the situation change. Scientists in the Netherlands found that coronavirus -gtcoronavirus is common in pet cats and dogs where their owners have the disease and owners have previously been told to avoid their pets while infected.While cases of owners passing on Covid- to their pets bring negligible risk to public health, the scientists said there is a potential risk that domestic animals could act as a reservoir for coronavirus and reintroduce it to humans.

Some amateur leagues only have refs for % of games and there are fears large numbers of matches across the land will be called off as they leave the game “in droves”. Simon Richards, director at e-coach, warned of a national shortage unless the abuse a nd even physical assaults from players, coaches and fans stops. He said: “It won’t be long till thousands of games are being called off every week. One of the major contributing factors is the abuse referees put up with.” BBC presenter Victoria ­Derbyshire told how her son’s under- game was abandoned at the weekend after the ref was abused.And she said she had witnessed similar ­incidents repeatedly.  Victoria added: “It is shocking and disgusting. I can’t believe it is happening in kids’ football. “I have seen it at games where coaches and parents start shouting at the ref.” A discussion of referees this week heard of the torrid time they face. John Bryant, of the Football Association of Wales, said: “It is not just the players who are abusing referees. It is coaches, directors. If everyone is doing it, it’s not seen as wrong.

They finally orced one year before Dianaaposs death in , but had already been separated for a number of years. The two, due to their status as royals, had their relationship heavily scrutinised. To this day, Diana remains extremely popular. So what caused their relationship to break down  How old were Prince Charles and Princess Diana when they met  The two first met in  at Althorp House, Dianaaposs country estate in Northamptonshire. At the time, Charles was  and Diana just . In a  interview with the , Charles said: I remember thinking what a very jolly and amusing and attractive -year-old she was. I mean, great fun, and bouncy and full of le and everything. Charles was dating her older sister Sarah at the time but their relationship did not last long. Charles and the Spenceraposs did remain in the same social circles, however. Three years later in  is when the two seemingly got together for the first time, there relationship remaining a secret until September of the same year. On February , , they announced their engagement. Diana was just  and Charles . Signs all was not well between the two began to emerge here. In the documentary aposDiana: In Her Own Wordsapos, Diana said: We had this ghastly interview the day we announced our engagement. And this ridiculous [reporter] said, aposAre you in love apos I thought, aposWhat a thick question.apos So I said, aposYes, of course, we are,apos and Charles turned around and said, aposWhatever love means.apos And that threw me completely. I thought, aposWhat a strange answer.apos It traumatised me. When did Charles and Diana have children  Diana gave birth to Prince William on June   and Harry followed on September  , this was despite obvious problems in their union which began even before their wedding.It is said that before the wedding, Diana found out about a bracelet Charles was having made for old flame Camilla Parker Bowles. With Diana wracked with doubts, the wedding went ahead in front of a live audience of  million people on July  . Diana later called it the worst day of my le. An argument during their honeymoon over cufflinks gted to Charles by Camilla is then believed to have ensued. Charles and Camilla had dated in the early s, but the relationship soon fizzled out. Camilla Shand married Andrew Parker Bowles in , but the former and Charles remained close afterwards and it was this that reportedly caused tension in the marriage between Charles and Diana. However, one expert, former royal press scretary Dickie Arbiter, believes Diana and Charlesaposs marriage started going wrong after William and Harry were born. On the documentary Channel  documentary Charles and Camilla: King and Queen in Waiting, he said: Charles wasnapost the fully hands on dad that she would have expected, and I suppose that created a distance between the two.When did Charles and Diana orce   By , the marriage had all but ended and Prime Minister John Major announced their separation.Their last royal trip together was in that same year. Speaking on the documentary, Ingrid Seward, editor-in-chief of Majesty Magazine, said: They went separately and they left separately I think the press really jumped on that and they realised this was going seriously wrong, but nobody apart from Diana and her intimate circle knew about Camilla at that time. They eventually filed for orce in  and both continued their royal duties. As Dianaaposs popularity grew, so did alleged resentment between the unhappy pair. After a bout of depression following the birth of William, Diana then developed further mental health struggles. Media scrutiny around her, her marriage and looks was growing. Dficulties arrived this time in the form of the eating disorder bulimia. In the now infamous interview with the BBCaposs Martin Bashir, Diana said the bulimia was a symptom of what was going on in [her] marriage. Affairs then began to poke holes in the hull of an already unsteady ship. Charles later said that he became involved with Camilla once again in , Dianaaposs affair with army captain James Hewitt is believed to have started around the same time. Another affair, this time between Diana and her bodyguard Barry Mannakee was also rumoured. Mannakee joined her bodyguard in  and Diana would later describe him as the greatest love of her le. Manakee died in a motorcycle accident in , months after being transferred away from Diana. The same year, Diana said she confronted Camilla about her affair with Charles and said: Iaposd just like you to know that I know exactly what is going on. Shortly after the prime minister announced their separation, the aposCamillagateapos tapes were published. Charles - in a recording from  - joked with Camilla about living inside Camillaaposs knickers as a tampon. He said: Oh, God. Iaposll just live inside your trousers or something. It would be much easier! When did Princess Diana die   After their separation, their public fallout continued. In , Diana revealed a number of details about their marriage, saying: It was a bit crowded with Camilla seemingly the third member. Charles had admitted to his affair publicly the year before. At , Diana was killed in a car accident in Paris. The crash also killed Dodi Fayed and driver Henri Paul. Charles went to collect her body from the French capital. Her death caused a huge uproar among the British public, angry at how she had been treated by the royals and media at the time. British television audience peaked at . million for her funeral.

In previous years, the Queen had stood on the balcony at the centre of Kate and Camilla. All three women, Kate, Camilla and Sophie, were dressed in black hats and coats that had poppies pinned to them. Kateaposs Alexander McQueen coat was one she had previously worn to the same event in . It came as Charles looked emotional and almost teary-eyed as he led the nation in paying tribute to its war dead. He looked sombre as he observed the two-minute silence before laying a wreath on behalf of the Queen and one for himself. He was followed by Prince William, Princess Anne and Prince Edward, who also placed wreaths at the Cenotaph.Earlier today, Buckingham Palace said Her Majesty was disappointed to miss the event held annually at the Cenotaph in London.  She was set to lead the nation in commemorating the war dead during her first in-person public engagement since going into hospital. Buckingham Palace insisted her back strain was not connected to the recent hospital stay where she was forced to spend the night at the King Edward VII in Marylebone last month to undergo “preliminary investigations” for an unknown condition.Love the royals for the Mirroraposs daily newsletter to get all the latest news on the Queen, Charles, Kate, Wills, Meghan, Harry and the rest of The Firm.

In a statement, the Palace said it was with great regret the Queen would be unable to attend the service. The statement said: The Queen, having sprained her back, has decided this morning with great regret that she will not be able to attend todayaposs Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph.

She is claiming the Duchess of Sussex ly briefed about her to the authors of a controversial book. And Samantha is to meet with her legal team again on Monday about the possibility of suing Meghan for “defamation, libel and slander” as well as “breach of privacy”.She told the Sunday People : “I’m speaking to one lawyer in England and one in the US as there are dferent statutory windows and dferent issues.”Samantha, , said she was left in shock on Wednesday when Meghan apologised to the Court of Appeal after emails were disclosed, contradicting a claim that she had not collaborated with the co-authors of biography Finding Freedom.  The messages, revealed by the Duchess’ ex-communications secretary Jason Knauf, show she sent him details about Samantha and brother Thomas Jr, asking him to pass them to writers Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand. Writing in the third person, she also urged him to say that her siblings had “dropped out of high school” and that she had “never had a relationship with either of them”. She added: “Upon Meghan dating Harry, Samantha changed her name back to Markle and began a career creating stories to sell to the press. She had lost custody of all three of her children from dferent fathers.” Meghan has not spoken to Samantha since meeting Prince Harry in . Samantha, who disputes a number of Meghan’s claims, said: “I’m looking at suing for defamation in the US. In the UK, I’m looking at a breach of privacy and data privacy act breach because the statutory window for defamation is only one year in the UK.“Jason Knauf is subpoenable and the messages to [him] are evidence she was libelling and slandering me. Anything to keep this family quiet was my sister’s motto. It’s horrible.”  Wheelchair-user Samantha, who has MS, added: “I’ve never lost custody of any children. She said I changed my name when she met Harry, but I shared my name-change documents long before.” Samantha, who shares the same dad as Meghan, Thomas Snr, said they had a “normal family le” She added: “But she wanted to make us look estranged and separated to discredit us as that was an excuse to keep everybody away from the wedding.”  This week, judges heard Meghan addressed her father as “Daddy” in a letter that would “pull at the heartstrings”it ever became public. Some of her messages were presented as evidence against her claim the letter was purely private. The Mail on Sunday is seeking to overturn a High Court ruling that it unlawfully breached Meghan’s privacy by publishing extracts from it.  Meghan said she had “forgotten” giving Mr Knauf details of what to reveal to Scobie and Durand. Samantha, who has her own book, The Diary of Princess Pushy’s Sister, said: “It shows she’s manipulative.” It comes as Harry and Meghan are believed to be in talks to sign with crisis PR guru Howard Bragman, who has worked with both accusers and accused in the #MeToo movement. A source said: “Bragman is one of the most sought after PRs in the US.” Mr Bragman and the Sussexes did not respond to a request to comment.

Worried crowds at the Cenotaph memorial in central London watched on in concern with photographs showing the guard lying face down on the ground with their helmet having rolled off their head. Others in the Household Cavalry remained professional with one member glancing down at their fellow guard. It is not currently known what happened to the guard or what their condition is as a result of the suspected fall, which occurred prior to the two-minute silence at am. The Household Cavalry is formed of two regiments, The Le Guards and The Blues and Royals.Did you attend the service today  Let us know at webnews@mirror This yearaposs event saw ato pre-pandemic numbers of those participating, including scores of veterans and serving military personnel. Hundreds of servicemen and women lined up, and nearly , veterans marched past the war memorial led by the Coldstream Guards - the oldest continuously serving regular regiment in the British Army. Several thousand onlookers queued up from as early as am in chilly and overcast conditions, having travelled from across the country and abroad to watch the service.  The crowds were in jubilant mood during the march past, with many chanting and singing. Last year, the ceremony was closed to the public - with just  veterans permitted due to the pandemic.Buckingham Palace announced this morning the Queen had had to withdraw from the attending the service after spraining her back.  It would have been her first public appearance since an overnight precautionary stay in hospital last month. Only the rustling of leaves and the chirping of birds could be heard as the two-minute silence was held in honour of all those who have lost their lives in conflict. After The Last Post was sounded by The Royal Marines Band buglers, Prince Charles was first to lay wreaths - on his own behalf and for the Queen.A procession of politicians was subsequently led by Boris Johnson, and included Sir Keir Starmer, before dignitaries from across the Commonwealth, and military and defence chiefs also laid wreaths.The Prime Minister said it was a moment to “come together to remember those who sacriced everything in service of our country”.

The photogenic creatures, stars of the video game Minecraft, grow to cm , are rampant breeders, carry disease – and don’t do much . Experts worry that once the novelty wears off, many will be abandoned. Chris Newman, of the National Centre for Reptile Welfare, cautioned: “They’re not the ideal pet for everyone. People shouldn’t buy them thinking they’re going to be like highly interactive cartoon or game console characters – they’re not. “They’re not a hugely challenging animal to look after and they’re quite cute, butI’m being perfectly honest, they’re not the most exciting either – they don’t actually do an awful lot.”  Chris, who notes that they have a lespan of approximately  years, estimates there are already tens of thousands of axolotls in captivity in the UK. And there are fears they could end up being dumped in British rivers and lakes – just as terrapins were following the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles craze of the s. And axolotls, a type of salamander native to Mexico, carry a fungal disease that has made  other species extinct.  Lana Davison, of Southwest Axolotls, said: “Some people only want them because they’re in the game. We have heard of people who have dumped axolotls in lakes.” She added: “They can breed with other things we have already in this country and become an invasive species.” The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists axolotls as critically endangered in the wild. But the amphibians are also bred in home aquariums and science labs around the world, and are widely available on the internet. They sell for anywhere between £ and £. We found one owner in Doncaster offering an axolotl for free, however, because they had “lost interest”.

Now Amy, , has shared a tribute to her beloved boyfriend and a warning for others about how quickly le can change in the blink of an eye.Plasterer Mike, who was a master of his trade, left home in Penllergaer that morning to continue developing his business to raise funds to move his family into a brand new home.Amy, who says she will never forget that day, said Mike decided to take his bike to work to enjoy the beautul weather. She told Wales Online: When I found out about an incident involving a motorbike, I immediately rang him and just knew it was him, I didn’t want to believe it and it’s hard to explain how I felt but my heart felt empty, I just knew. The pain, the heartache, feeling numb, disbelief, you don’t want to believe it and you think it will never happen to you, I still don’t want to believe it, he was so young and we just started le as a family - that’s what hurts the most. The family were expecting to move into a new home, but were unable to after Mikeaposs sudden passing. Amy said Mike was such a loving, affectionate partner, my best friend. He was a fun-loving dad to his two kids, Ayla and Zion, and his face would light up every time he would see them. Amy says itaposs heartbreaking to see the kids growing up and Mike isnapost here to see that. I am so grateful he gave us two beautul children that will live on his name forever, she said. Amy and her two children are now moving into a new home. But a tragic milestone is looming as Zion looks forward to his first birthday, but without his father. Ayla does ask to see her daddy and I have to explain heaposs not coming home which is the hardest thing I have had to do in my le, Amy said.  She said: She [Ayla] knows her daddy loves her very much and wishes he could be here and is looking down on her every day. Amy said her friends and family have given an overwhelming amount of support as have people in the community who knew Mike. I am so grateful to every single person, not just for me but our family. After Mike passed we have come together as a family and I think Ayla and Zion have played a massive part in that, they certainly keep everyone busy. Through all this heartbreak, Amy wants to raise awareness that le can suddenly change for anyone. Mike was such a positive person and that was the way to be in le, he taught me to be positive and I’m going to carry that on in his memory, times like this you have to be positive. Don’t get me wrong, I cry every day, I just miss him so much, but it’s ok to cry, it’s ok to be sad. If I’ve learnt anything it’s to be in the present rather than the future because le can change in a blink of an eye. Be grateful for every second that you get to spend with the people you love.

Shes worked with some of the most famous killers in our country, such as Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutclfe, Moors Murderer Ian Brady and necrophile Dennis NilsenKerry Daynes has been a forensic psychologist for  yearsByKirsten JonesFeatures  Lestyle Writer:,  Nov Updated:,  Nov | commentsWolfing down my chicken kebab supper, I look around the table and idly wonder what most folk would make of my fellow diners – a collection of ex-murderers, sex offenders and arsonists. But I’m not frightened. It’s  and part of my job is spending time in this “halfway house” in a busy northern city. Imy empty plate to Nigel, a shy man who’s washing up. Suddenly, I feel a blow to my stomach. Nigel has stabbed me with a in kebab skewer. He looks panicked, eyes flicking from side to side. I remain calm, staggering to the staff office while blood seeps through my white blouse. “Call an ambulance!” I gasp, slumping to the ground. I’ve been a forensic psychologist for  years, working with some of the most famous killers in our country, such as Yorkshire Ripper Peter Sutclfe, Moors Murderer Ian Brady and necrophile Dennis Nilsen.  I use science and psychology to try and analyse people who commit crimes – from shoplting to shocking murders – and determinethey’re safe to be released from prison.I’ve always had a fascination with the macabre. As a child I read horror stories about killer grannies and watched Doctor Who from behind the sofa – monsters were about the only things that scared me. This career was my calling.I remember the first time I walked into a prison. It was Strangeways – now called HMP Manchester. I was a naive -year-old, keen to learn about crime psychology. It sounds cheesy, but I wanted to create a world with fewer victims in it. On my tour, the inmates started catcalling, “There’s some p***y on the wing!” The prison officer rolled his eyes at my confusion. He knew I’d be eaten alive. Two years later, in , I volunteered as a psychology assistant at Wakefield prison, nicknamed Monster Mansion by insiders. It’s full of sex offenders and murderers I’d only seen in the newspapers. I was feet away from parent killer Jeremy Bamber, Colin “Gay Slayer” Ireland and child murderer Terence McCready. It was utterly surreal yet I was so excited. This was long before the #MeToo movement and the male prison officers gave me a hard time. One day I interviewed a man who raped, strangled and murdered a woman. While we talked in the cell, the officers locked me in for a laugh.  When I tugged at the door, it wouldn’t budge. Then it hit me… I was stuck in a room with a killer. I tried not to look frightened but I’m a redhead, I must have flushed like a tomato. He looked at me with a creepy smile. I was intimidated and genuinely scared – and he loved it. He said to me, “You’ve got a pretty neck, you know. It looks a lot like my victim’s.” I was only locked in for  minutes, but it felt like forever. Another inmate called out, “Are you alright in there, Miss ” adding, “I hope you’re treating her well.” That was his way of telling the inmate I was locked in with, “I’ll deal with youyou don’t.” I shook like a leaf that afternoon, but it didn’t put me off. Nowadays, I’m desensitised to a lot of things others would find completely paralysing. You’re probably used to seeing grey-haired men commenting on crimes on TV, but most forensic psychologists are women. People still think I chop up dead bodies for a living – that’s not my job. Nor am I running around the country trampling over crime scenes in my high heels and single-handedly arresting serial killers, like they do in TV dramas. Not all of my clients are dangerous, either. In  I worked with a -year-old named Frank Ecclestone, who confessed to a gruesome assault with a baseball bat. It was a messy case and the victim had almost died. Frank was regarded in the community as “a bit strange”. When I interviewed him, he was wearing a T-shirt featuring John Wayne Gacy – the “Killer Clown” who murdered at least  young men and boys. Not only did this quiet young man confess to the assault, he also blurted out that he was a serial killer and began headbutting the hospital wall.Afterwards, we were intercepted by another patient who had slit her wrist. My arm turned red as I gripped her wound to stem the flow. Meanwhile, Frank had gone a terrible shade of green. I knew he wasn’t a serial killer. Nor hadhe assaulted the victim. He was clearly scared of blood.Frank had given a  confession. It turned out that he had been raped by his stepmother as a child, and his little sister Holly was actually his daughter. His father threatened him and Frank confessed, “If I could say I was a killer he [Dad] would be scared to fight me.” To Frank, killers were powerful people who commanded attention and respect. Indeed, serial killers have become almost like pop-culture celebrities. I’ve been contacted by women who have US killer Ted Bundy’s teeth marks tattooed on their bodies – they think he was sexy! One day I was sitting on the sofa at home watching telly when the phone rang. I put the phone to my ear and heard a faint Scottish burr: “Hello Kerry, this is Dennis Nilsen.”  I thought it was a wind-up, but it really was him. Dennis talked to me in graphic detail about his offences, keeping his fantasy alive. He spoke bitterly about his childhood in a Scottish fishing village, where he was bullied and was dishonest about his sexuality. He blamed a great deal of his dissatisfaction in le on his mother. Over four years he phoned me  more times. They were long, rambling telephone calls. Dennis loved to talk about himself and I wanted to understand his distorted version of the events that occurred at Melrose Avenue and Cranley Gardens in London. He’d revel in the TV shows about him. Receiving telephone calls and text messages from offenders and victims is common – you wouldn’t believe how many I’ve had. So Dennis’s chats weren’t that surprising. I now have Callon my phone, because I never know who’s going to ring me. A few years ago, I really felt fear. I was on TV talking about Jeremy Bamber. Jeremy doesn’t like me – he claims I wrote  stories about him and that I was never a qualied psychologist, which is nonsense. Anyway, someone who was watching became my stalker. This man set up websites in my name, claiming to be a fan of mine – I’m a forensic psychologist, not Britney Spears! He wanted photographs and information about me and when I politely declined, he got angry and wrote awful things about me. He said I was the criminal, he knew the size of my breasts and described what I was wearing each day. He was physically watching me and I was terried. One day I found the words “Jill Dando” written on my fence and, behind it, the leless body of my cat. I was devastated by the death of my poor pet.  I took the man to court myself and paid thousands to have the awful websites removed. Only then was he arrested and given a harassment warning. It was  and I felt more afraid at home alone than I ever did in a prison full of killers. I’m a single woman, so there’s no man to worry about me. And I didn’t tell my parents or sister about being stabbed with that kebab skewer – I didn’t want them to fret. But now, after  years in the business, I could tell my family anything and they’d take it in their stride.It’s only when I talk about my job that I realise how surreal it sounds, but after work I come home, do the washing up and watch Strictly like everyone .In the past I’ve spent a lot of time in therapy to stop me remembering crime scene photographs or the horrors that I’ve heard. But I’m not scared of anyone I’ve worked with – I find politicians far more frightening than murderers. I’ve met people who’ve done dreadful, unforgivable things, but I don’t believe they are evil. It’s my job to find those human drivers behind inhuman behaviour. Every person has a story.

This year his birthday coincides with Remembrance Sunday and he will be at the Cenotaph in Central London with the rest of the royals to lead the nation in commemorations. Three years ago he celebrated his landmark th birthday and several gorgeous pictures of him surrounded by his we the Duchess of Cornwall, sons Princes William and Harry and daughters-in-law the Duchesses of Cambridge and Sussex were released. However, stealing the show in the lovely images were his three grandchildren who were born at the time - Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis.  And while fans loved the family shots, it was reportedly an absolute nightmare to arrange as William and Harry made very little effort, a book claims. In their bombshell biography Finding Freedom, authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand claim that the royal brothers can be hot and cold with their father. The authors write: The boys can be hot and cold with their fatherapos disclosed a source, who gave the example of planning the photo session for Charlesapos th birthday, which they called aposan absolute nightmareapos.

Neither William nor Harry made much of an effort to make themselves availableapos, the source said. Two photos from the photoshoot were released, the first a more formal snap and the second a candid picture which shows the family laughing.  Since that day, Harryaposs relationship with his father seems to have deteriorated and he has been quite outspoken about the fractured relationship with Charles. During a bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey, Harry accused his dad of refusing to take his calls and claims he cut him off financially. Harry has also appeared on the Apple TV series The Me You Canapost See, where he spoke about the royalsapos total neglect and the Armchair Expert podcast, where he lashed out at Charlesaposs parenting. However, his bond with William seems to have strengthened and most recently Charles spoke of his pride in his eldest son for starting the Earthshot Prize, which he has launched to encourage innovative ideas to save the planet. Charles said: “I am very proud of my son, William, for his growing commitment to the environment and the bold ambition of the Earthshot Prize. “As a world, we need to come together to inspire, reimagine and build the sustainable future we so desperately need.

Sally Morgan, who was Princess Diana’s spiritual guide, met Harry when he was seven during a visit to Kensington Palace.And as our exclusive picture reveals, they were reunited at a swanky fancy dress party where Harry rushed up to her saying: “You knew my mother.” Sally, who started her career telling futures for free but can now charge £, a session, claims: ■ She predicted Diana’s tragic end ■ She knew that Harry would marry a brunette ■ And she foretold the couple would stay together despite going through a “tempestuous time”. Sally also claims she still receives messages from beyond the grave, where Diana watches over her sons. Diana died aged  alongside partner Dodi Fayed in a  car crash in Paris. It was around  years later that Harry called Sally to ask: “What do you think about how my mother died ”  He also asked her concerned ­questions about his “bruv” Prince William – as well as what colour hair his future we would have. Sally, , recalls how she met the adult Harry at the fancy dress do at Kensington Roof Gardens around . “He was there dressed in medical scrubs,” she said. “He wouldn’t have any ­photographs taken and he came over to me and said, ‘Sally, you’re the lady who used to see my mother’. “I said, ‘Yes I did. The last time I saw you, you were about seven’.  “And he said, ‘Oh, Sally, I remember, my mother would often talk about you, she spoke to you a lot’. “I said that she did and then he askedI wanted a picture. “He was with a group of lads and they were all tipsy, and I remember he bought everyone a round of drinks. It was a fun party.”  But it wasn’t until eight years ago that Sally received a phone call from Harry asking for a reading. They spoke for  minutes in what Sally believes was his first attempt to get to grips with his mental health, which he has since publicly spoken about many times. Sally said: “I was on holiday in St Tropez and he called me and the first thing he said was, ‘What do you think about how my mother died ’.” She says she told him to speak to Diana’s elder sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, because “she will tell you what I told her before your mother passed away”. Sally claimed: “I had spoken to Sarah before Diana’s death and had made a prediction the Queen was going to die, that she was in a really dark place and I could see a pavement. “I said they are going to drag her out and give her CPR and she is going to have a heart attack. That is what the Princess of Wales died of, a heart attack. I said a week later the Queen Mother will die because I can see her funeral. Well the Princess of Wales had the Queen Mother’s funeral that had been arranged because they had all their funerals arranged, and Diana took that. I didn’t tell Harry that though, I just told him to speak to his aunt.”  Following Diana’s death, Sarah questioned Sally about her prediction. Sally said: “After Diana died, Sarah said, ‘Well, you said the Queen’. “But I predicted that before she did the interview with Martin Bashir, where she said, ‘I want to be known as the Queen of Hearts’.” During the call with Harry, they also discussed his fears for his brother and who his own future we would be.  “How is my bruv going to be  Is he going to be OK ” she says Harry asked. Sally said she replied: “Of course he is. He will be good and he will be king, but he is in a dferent bubble to you.” She said he replied: “That is why I am always going to worry about him”. At that point Harry was still a bachelor, had dated mainly blonde women and was on off with Cressida Bonas.  But Sally says she told him he would marry someone very dferent. She said: “One of the sweetest things he said to me was, ‘What colour hair will my future we have  Will she have blonde hair ’ I said he would marry someone with dark hair.” Sally believes that their conversation was a prelude to “him waking up to his own mental health” struggles. It wasn’t until  that Harry spoke publicly about it but he has since then championed the ­subject for others.  He admitted to years of attacks both of panic and rage, disclosing that his le was in “total chaos” for two years. In her new book, Secret Spirit, Sally praises Harry’s openness, of which Diana “would have been very proud”. She says the princess told her “as a royal, you were expected to brush those kinds of feelings under the carpet”. “Harry and Meghan are helping drive the debate forward,” Sally added. Despite her le being very dferent to Harry’s, Sally can relate to his “awful” grief – she lost husband John in September, aged . They were married for  years and together for . Now, Sally is helping others with bereavement with John being her guiding light in the spiritual world. And she believes no matter what lies ahead for them Harry, , and Meghan,  – who have kids Archie, two, and Lilibet, five months – will “be together forever”, adding: “Harry will never abandon his children.”For details on Sally’s services visit sallymorgan.tv.

Ms Junor said: Itaposs very sad for the Queen because this is the one event in the year that she really, really likes to be at. Remembering the war dead is a very, very important part for her annual calendar. The public will be very sad and anxious to hear of yet another setback but clearly she must follow the advice and get herself well. The Queen has been under doctorsapos orders to rest for more than three weeks after spending a night in hospital for preliminary tests.  Buckingham Palace had said it was her firm intention to be at the Cenotaph, and announced on Thursday that she would be at the ceremony. But on Sunday morning, less than two hours before she was due to arrive, the Palace said she had sprained her back and could no longer attend. Ms Junor said: Itaposs not surprising because she is  years old. Weaposre so used to seeing her out and about and looking years younger than she is that I think weaposve been lulled into thinking she can go on at this kind of pace forever. Clearly she canapost. There comes a time in everybodyaposs le when they have to admit that they are getting older and canapost do the things that they perhaps want to do.  Suggesting it appears to mark a new phase in the Queenaposs reign, Ms Junor said: I think we will see more of her on video and probably less of her in the flesh. They should keep her warm and tucked up at home and not exposing herself to the possibility of infections. Joe Little, managing editor of Majesty magazine, said: There are shades of the time her mother was a similar age and things got progressively more dficult. But the Queen Mother soldiered on and there is no reason to think the Queen wonapost, but this is a setback. Clearly there are mobility issues. Getting from Windsor with a sprained back and having to stand for  to  minutes at the Cenotaph is not helpful for somebody of .  Mr Little said the Queenaposs calendar in late November and December is traditionally less public-facing with more behind-the-scenes events. The Queen usually also hosts a lunch for her wider family the week before Christmas. You would hope there would be a pre-Christmas family lunch for the extended family, hopefully at Windsor, Mr Little said. That would be a display of normality as far as the Queen is concerned. But in terms of official engagements before the end of the year, I donapost think we will see her out and about doing anything officially, evenshe recovers from the sprained back.

Her six missed Remembrance Sundays were restricted by tours abroad and pregnancy.  The Express reports: The Queen has appeared at most of the Remembrance Sunday events held during her reign.But she has previously not attended six services due to pregnancy, or because she was away travelling and could not attend.Some engagements to mark the run-up to Remembrance Sunday have taken place when royals have been overseas. The Mirror told earlier today how the Queen would not be attending because of a back sprain.  Buckingham Palace said she was disappointed to miss the event held annually at the Cenotaph in London. Her Majesty was poised to lead the nation in commemorating the war dead during her first in-person public engagement since going into hospital. The poignant service also sees ato pre-pandemic numbers of veterans, members of the armed forces and onlookers.  Occasions when the Queen attends and her reasons for not attending are outline on the Royal Familyaposs website. It says: The Queen and Members of the Royal Family attended a number of engagements each year in the lead-up to Remembrance Sunday. These include the annual Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall and the opening of the Field of Remembrance at Westminster Abbey.  Engagements sometimes take place overseas: in  when Prince Harry laid a wreath with troops in Kandahar, Afghanistan. Buckingham Palace said her back strain was not connected to a recent hospital stay where she was forced to spend the night at the King Edward VII in Marylebone last month to undergo “preliminary investigations” for an unknown condition.

Here’s what they each meanBesides the red poppy, youll see white, black and purple poppies being worn Image: REUTERSByMalvika Padin:,  Nov | commentsEvery year on November , people around the UK observe Remembrance Day or Armistice Day marking the day that the agreement which ended the First World War was signed. The Sunday closest to the th - which is November  this year - is observed as Remembrance Sunday, a day of memorial where the nation reflects and remembers the lives lost to war. The day is marked by memorial services, most notably at the Cenotaph in Whitehall, wreath-laying and observing a two-minute silence. People are also seen wearing red poppies throughout the Remembrance period, from the end of October to Remembrance Sunday.  While red poppies are most common, you might also see purple, black and white poppies being worn. Each colour has a dferent meaning about remembering the war. Red poppies During Remembrance, youaposre likely to see thousands of volunteers selling red paper poppies on the streets and in shops. The red poppy is considered a symbol of remembrance, not just of those who died in the World War I, but in conflicts before and since.  Sold by the Royal British Legion, the origin of the red poppy is from a poem written by Canadian officer John McCrae, first published in December , titled In Flanders Fields. The poem describes how poppies grew from the the graves of soldiers on the fields. White poppies White poppies are considered a pacist symbol of remembrance for the war. Distributed by the Peace Pledge Union , white poppies are said to describe three things: remembrance for all victims of war, commitment to peace and a challenge to the glamorisation of conflict. It intends to commemorate all victims of all wars – both military and civilians of all nationalities. But critics claim that white poppies undermine the message of red poppies and Armistice Day. Purple poppiesIntroduced in  by Animal Aid, purple poppies are less common and remember the animals that lost their lives at war. The appeal was begun by the charity because it felt that animals that die at war - mostly horses, donkeys and dogs - are often forgotten. The purple poppy was then replaced with a purple paw badge in . Black poppies The most recent addition to the dferent colours, the black poppy which was launched in  is worn to remember black, African, Caribbean and Pacic Islanders who lost their lives at war.  Distributed by the Black Poppy Rose, black poppies are described as a symbol that signies pride, honour and glory, with the hope that future generations will be inspired by these largely untold historical legacies”.

Posting on Mumsnet, the woman wrote: I canapost eat first thing in the morning so I have always eaten mid-morning, at my desk, sometimes something cold, sometimes something that needs a minute or two in the staff microwave.Past employers have never had an issue with this. Iaposm fairly new to this job but in the past two months, no-one has ever raised it as an issue. We have access to a microwave and toaster so sometimes Iaposll bring in a tub of beans, or eggs that Iaposve already put in a bowl and whisked at home so it takes  minutes in the microwave to heat them.  All during the space of time it takes me to make my first cup of tea of the day - which is taken after having already put in - hours work since I got in that morning. All of a sudden my line manager took me aside and said aposit had been noticedapos that I was heating up my breakfast and that I was no longer to do this as it was in work time, that the microwave and toaster were only for lunch breaks, unless I decided to split my break over both. The woman continued: This seems ridiculous to me as it takes max  minutes and I then bring it back to eat at my desk whilst working. I have seen colleagues gone for much much longer than thisthey get into social conversation with colleagues. Also, this instruction was directed only to me, not the team or department as a whole, so it feels very personal. The woman said is important to take regular breaks throughout the day. She added: Am I being unreasonable here  Do others do this at work with no issue  As I said, past employers have never had issue with it and I donapost take the p*** with it. One mum said the woman wasnapost being treated like an adult. She continued: It annoys me when a workplace doesnapost treat people like adults. So I would probably sweetly say aposOkay thataposs fine, Iaposll take the five minutes out of my lunch hour and just have a  minute lunch breakapos. I imagine smokers take up much longer out of their day to have smoke breaks. Others thought the woman was in the wrong. One mum wrote: Beans egg on toast is taking the p*** and stinks the office out. Iaposve never, ever seen anyone at work have more than a bowl of cereal or a yogurt. You are being unreasonable - and cheeky. Another said: I used to have a colleague who did this and it annoyed me so much. While she was stirring up her porridge and blowing it to cool it down, she couldnapost properly perform tasks. She could only type with one hand, often couldnapost answer the phone as she was chewing.

Kelly Pinkney couldn’t believe it when the kit she had bought to find out about her ancestry also revealed a first cousin. And after turning detective to track down her relatives, she met up with her dad Saeed Sotoudeh for the first time earlier this year and the pair are now forging a relationship. “It’s such an amazing feeling knowing who I am for the first time,” Kelly, , said. “When I look in the mirror I look at myself in a dferent way than I did before. I feel complete. I feel like I belong now.” Kelly was born in September  and conceived the Christmas before. She describes herself as a “sad” and “unhappy” little girl who always felt she was dferent.  Initially raised by her single mum, she was taken into care aged four. After that she spent time in a succession of foster homes before being placed with one family for four years. There she says she was miserable and started to run away, eventually being placed in Danes House Children’s Home in Gainsborough, Lincs, aged nine. It was there she began questioning her identity, as she was dark-haired and dark-skinned with brown eyes while all her mum’s family were fair. “It was very unsettling,” Kelly explains. “I got bullied at school because further north there were no black people, no brown people. “I’m not even that dark, but I was the darkest kid in the school, the only kid that was brown, everyone  was white. She moved back in with her mum aged ten and she began asking her about her parentage. Others would always ask where she was from and question her ethnicity - but it always made her feel uncomfortable as she could never answer them as she had no idea where her dark looks came from. Her mum told her she had been conceived one night in a hotel in London and she thought her dad was Arabic or Egyptian, but she couldn’t remember his name.  “Mum didn’t know she was pregnant until eight or ten weeks,” Kelly went on. “She said people said ‘Are you going to get rid of it ’ as there was no father and back in those days it wasn’t the done thing to be having a baby outside marriage. “She was adamant she loved me and was keeping me.” Kelly became an ambulance driver and settled in Bedford with her son. Then two years ago, she was chatting to a friend who had done an ancestry test with Calornia-based Me. Their tests use a saliva sample to assess someone’s genetic heritage. At the time, the test was advertised for £ and Kelly couldn’t afford it, but a few months later she saw it on offer for £ and decided to treat herself. After completing the kit and sending it off, five weeks went by before she received the results - telling her she was % Persian, from modern day Iran. But it also told her there was a first cousin also on the site - and connected them. Taking the plunge, Kelly messaged the man and explained her tale of being fatherless. It turned out that his mum had six brothers - one of whom must be Kelly’s dad.  Two were dead, two lived in the US and others hadn’t been in London in the late s. They chatted on the phone and he said he would explain the situation to his mum. “I didn’t want to cause any trouble but then again I was so excited about this discovery,” Kelly said. “But he rang me back and instantly his tone had changed. “He said there was a mistake and his mother and grandmother said it wasn’t possible as the family hadn’t come to the UK until the late s. He thought the company had made a mistake. “He wished me good luck and then cut me off. But I knew the DNA couldn’t be wrong so I started doing my own research - I was literally like an FBI agent.”She tracked two of the brothers down on Facebook but they didn’t reply to her messages, so she began talking to their daughters. The women agreed to a DNA test, but it revealed they were cousins.Another brother in the US agreed to a DNA test but was an uncle. And then, as word spread, Kelly received a message from another of the brothers called Saeed, who still lived in London. He thought he recognised Kelly’s mum and agreed to do a DNA test, which came back positive - he was Kelly’s dad. After  years Kelly had finally found the father she had been missing all her le - and amazingly his one regret in le was that he had never had kids of his own.  He had remained in north west London after coming over at  and said he wanted a relationship with Kelly’s mum - but she disappeared and he was never able to find her again. A second DNA test confirmed they were father and daughter and they met for the first time a few months ago. Her own looks began to make sense as she unravelled Saeed’s Iranian ancestry. Kelly said she took a photo of them together and was amazed at how much they looked alike when she saw it. Last week, they went out for his birthday to a Persian restaurant and are now forging a relationship. Kelly said: “When I found out I cried uncontrollably for an hour. I couldn’t stop. I thought of all the hurt and pain. “There was massive relief - I finally knew who I was. “He never met the right person, got married or had a family of his own and he said he always wanted children. And he was the only brother out of all of them who had no children. “It was a massive shock for him as he’s never known I was out there whereas I knew he was.

The -year-old loved to read in coffee shops and would go hiking on local nature trails to escape the noise of the city. But she also liked to spend Sundays with her family, catching up with her siblings and her mum. Valerie dreamt of becoming a tattoo artist and drew portraits for friends in the hope of one day opening her own parlour. Being creative also helped her as she struggled with depression. But despite her own problems, she always put other people first. In January  she met Javier Da Silva Rojas online. Rojas, an immigrant with joint Venezuelan and Portuguese citizenship, lived in Queens. He claimed to have fled political and economic turmoil the previous year, heading to the United States in search of a better le.  Compassionate Valerie would no doubt have had sympathy for him. She was noted for being hard-working and strove to make a good le for herself. Rojas worked in a restaurant but, unknown to most of the people around him, he was in the country illegally as his visa had expired. The couple started dating, but it was a short-lived association. Valerie’s family said “stubborn” Rojas was more interested in the relationship than she was, which led to tensions. Valerie ended the affair after three months and stopped all communication with him. He tried to keep talking to her but she refused. It was a chapter she wanted to put behind her. On  January , Valerie was reported missing after failing to turn up for work. She hadn’t been seen for two days and concern was growing. Her mother, Norma Sanchez, claimed that when she had last spoken to her daughter on the phone, she’d said she feared somebody was going to kill her. Valerie wouldn’t say why she believed this, but she was clearly frightened and was suffering anxiety attacks. Norma tried to push for details. Had someone been to her place  Had she been threatened  But Valerie wouldn’t reveal any more. Norma intended to follow it up during a shopping trip with her daughter. But when Valerie didn’t show, Norma assumed she’d changed her mind about meeting her. Then on  February, Valerie’s dead body was discovered by a group of highway workers in Greenwich, Connecticut, about  miles from her home. In a wooded area, about ft from the road, they spotted a red suitcase. The body was inside it.  Valerie’s legs and arms had been bound with duct tape and twine before she was stuffed into the suitcase. Several layers of tape had been placed over her mouth and there was evidence of a head wound and bruising to her face. It was a devastating discovery for Valerie’s family. A coroner determined that she had died from asphyxiation. A week later, it was revealed that someone had been using her bank card to withdraw money from her account. Surveillance footage showed a man wearing a black hoodie. He was in a rental vehicle that was traced to the man who hired it – Javier Da Silva Rojas. After he was arrested, police found that his DNA matched that on the suitcase handle and under Valerie’s fingernails. When questioned, Rojas admitted he’d visited her on the night of  January. Despite the fact they hadn’t been together for nine months, he claimed they’d had “rough sex”, during which Valerie had fallen and hit her head. He’d panicked and bound her in duct tape before shoving her in the suitcase and dumping it.  Investigators didn’t believe his story. If it was an accident, why hadn’t he simply called an ambulance  Valerie didn’t die from the head wound – she’d died from being suffocated. A consequence of his actions. Rojas had gone to Valerie’s apartment in a hire car. Before entering, he’d turned his mobile phone to aeroplane mode and switched off the location setting, suggesting he was covering his tracks from the start. Inside, the pair had a violent altercation that resulted in Valerie suffering a blow to the head. She was still alive when he bound and gagged her with duct tape and put her in the suitcase. He then put the case in the car and drove it to the dumping ground in Greenwich, where he tossed it into the wooded area not knowing whether Valerie was dead or alive. He also threw her phone away before starting to steal her money. In the hours after her death, Rojas began to withdrew cash from her account. A total of , was eventually taken. He also sold her iPad. These weren’t the acts of someone trying to cover up an accident – he was concealing a crime.  Rojas, , was charged with kidnapping resulting in death and in February  pleaded guilty at a court in White Plains, New York. Under a plea deal, which meant he avoided a le term or the death penalty, he was sentenced to  years in prison followed by two years supervised release. He will probably be deported afterwards. The court heard of the call Valerie made to her mother the day before her death, when she said she feared she would be killed. Although she hadn’t given any more details, she had clearly been scared. What had Rojas done to make her so sure she was going to die  During his sentencing in September this year, members of her family wore badges bearing her picture. While the prosecution contended that Rojas committed a “horric kidnapping” that resulted in Valerie’s death, his lawyer maintained he felt remorse for his crime. But it was pointed out that while Valerie’s family were desperately trying to find her, he had been stealing her money and trying to cover up evidence of his deed.  In a statement in court, her mother said, “You, Javier, deserve nothing but pain and rejection. I want you to hear the words of a mother who you devastated by taking away my baby girl.” She wept as she described the joy Valerie had brought to others and described her daughter’s killer as a “worthless soul”. In tears, Rojas responded, “No words can express how repulsed I am by the acts I committed. I will never forgive myself for that. I cannot ask [her family] to forgive me because I don’t deserve it. I would like them to know I’m very sorry.”The judge told Rojas, “What you did to this woman was sickening. Anyone who could do such a thing is not a good person, by definition. Anyone who can do a thing like that is an evil person. Justice requires an evil deed be punishedby a y prison sentence.”It remains unclear why Rojas killed Valerie, but her final moments were unthinkable.

One dog who has taken this to the extreme is Kuma the Morkie, who wasted no time rushing out into his Grandpa’s large garden. In a hilarious TikTok clip, the dog eagerly watches his owner while indoors, clearly after something. The on screen text gives viewers an insight into what may be going through the pup’s head, as he suggests to his mother that they take another trip outside. Kuma is used to living in a high rise apartment with his owner, where there is no access to a garden like the one at his grandpa’s. So understandably the Morkie is a little on edge at being cooped up when he knows there is a big open space outside just waiting to be explored, evenhe has already spent plenty of time zooming around the garden already.  Of course the adorable Kuma gets his way eventually, as the video ends with a clip of the hyper canine dashing around the garden and generally going berserk. The dog sprints as fast as he possibly can, going round and round in circles as Matthew Wilder’s ‘Break My Stride’ plays in the background. The clip, which was uploaded by TikTok user @kumathemorkie, was a huge hit on the video sharing , with over , views and almost , likes.Viewers were clearly amused by Kuma’s antics, with one user commenting: “Those zoomies hit dferent in your grandparentaposs yard!”TeamDogs is a community for dog lovers who want to get the most out of their relationship with their best pal.

I guess since was born later in the case, sheaposs not on the same timeline, and my cousin isnapost losing her rights to Anna yet.She arranged to see her cousinsapos kids and theirfoster parents in a local park to help her make her decision.After seeing them, she thought they all seemed happy and it was clear that the kids LOVE their foster family. She continued: The family had two older kids — Iaposd guess older teens — and I could see the bond between all of them. I decided not to try and take the kids, but the foster parents are allowing me to stay involved in their le as an aunt figure, she wrote. Evanstill remembers me vaguely, and was happy to see me. She didn’t want to take the kids from the foster home because she didn’t want the drama, she admitted. On top of not wanting to take them from the only home most of the kids remember, I also donapost want to deal with my cousin — sheaposs still using and is not someone I want in my le right now, she sadly admitted. But when she told her cousin her decision, she was furious.  She said the kids deserve to grow up with their family, and Iaposm doing a terrible thing by not adopting them. The woman asked Reddit users whether she was in the wrong for not wanting to adopt the children, but many people were on her side. One person said: Not the a**hole AT ALL!!!! The kids sound like they are in a good place, it sounds like they are happy and healthy and perhaps may even be adopted by them in the future. Bonus, you can stay part of their lives. Another wrote: [Original Poster]’s cousin is right that the kids deserve to grow up with family. But their ‘family’ is the foster parents that have been caring for them for the last three years. Kudos to OP for recognising this and honouring that bond. A third commented: You clearly have these children’s best interests at heart and your cousin clearly does not. Staying with a family that loves them and lets you stay involved as an aunt figure sounds like the perfect solution here. And frankly, your cousin lost her right to claim she knows aposwhat’s best for themapos when she refused to be a decent mother.Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Some people find it really dficult to land on the right name, whereas others just instinctively know what they will name their baby. One expecting couple fell into the latter category, and were so sure theyaposd found the perfect name for their son that they decided to announce his name on the very same day they announced the babyaposs gender, at the end of the first trimester. My husband and I are expecting our first baby, and weaposre due in just a few weeks. When we first announced our pregnancy to our family after the first trimester , we also announced our babyaposs gender AND his name, the mum-to-be explained on Redditaposs AITA forum. My sister and her husband have been trying to conceive their third kid for the last five years, however, due to some complications in her previous pregnancy, they have had to do several rounds of IVF.  For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. The womanaposs sister ended up falling pregnant just five weeks after her and later discovered she will also be welcoming a little boy, leading the sisters to get so excited at the prospect of their sons growing up as best friends. Everything was going pretty great until a few weeks ago. My mom decided to come to visit me to help me get the nursery ready, and mentioned that my sister had really liked the name my husband and I picked for our baby and that she had decided to take it, the mum-to-be continued. My mom then asked me what my husband and I would change our babyaposs name to since it would be too confusing to have two grandkids with the same name. I told my mom that we were NOT changing the name of our baby since our hearts were set on it, and we wouldnapost have announced itwe werenapost sure. The mum-to-be later received an angry call from her sister, who said that because this was their miracle baby, she should get first dibs on whatever name they wanted. I told her that she can name her baby whatever she wants, but that weaposre not changing our minds about our babyaposs name, she added, before turning to Reddit to question whether she was justied in refusing to change her babyaposs name. One Reddit user commented: Your sister is acting like the world revolves around her. I bet shes going to throw a meltdownyour kid is cuter. If you have a baby shower she will be mad because how dare you have a baby shower and take all the attention off her and her miracle baby! Or youaposll be gted some item she really wanted at your own baby shower and she will take it from you as she has aposdibsapos. Another added: You announced it first, sister is an a**hole for stealing it without even talking to you. But, I do hope itaposs a name that can have a nickname, for the kids sake. Itaposd be too much confusion otherwise. Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

The rocky environment filled with dust may not sound overly exciting, but this latest photo is creepy to say the least. NASA Rovers can find some interesting things on the mysterious planet, and recently stumbled across a vast amount of lonely rocks. It looks almost like a mass graveyard, giving the planet a very spooky aesthetic. Twitter users have already took to the social media  in the past to describe Mars as a ‘graveyard planet’.In the image, we can see all the rocks scattered closely together to look like a small cemetery. Grainy details and an abundance of rocks all dfering in size just add to the general intrigue of this picture. It’s safe to say the Rover has been on Mars for a while after launching in July . It will be heading back to planet earth on February .With over .m followers, the Mars Rover Twitter page has gained a lot of popularity, giving users a unique look at the planet.A recent Tweet shared an image of a patch of rock with a surface layer removed to give us a closer look. This left many Twitter users convinced of aliens. One Twitter user replied: “Can you turn over large rocks to look underneath them  Something that may not have been disturbed for thousands of years  Who knows what may be under some of them ” Another responded to the image: “Definitely a tiny white alien.” Some images are more spine-chilling than others, and although some believe the planet is filled with graveyards and aliens, Mars still manages to look beautul.

We communicate naturally. It’s a good start. Let’s give us a chance. Lauren then replied to him apologising saying that she wouldn’t go to someoneaposs house when she barely knows them.

Filming a video of her demonstrating its uses, she writes “Use on your fridge freezer, follow the natural grain.” In the second clip, she is polishing her tabletop and candle holders, and writes: ”Use on chrome surfaces to give it an extra shine.” While in her third demonstration, she wrote: “Buff into leather for a shine.” Baby oil also is a great cleaner for stainless steel as it can help to make it shiny,it’s buffed into the surface in circular motions.  To ensure that the surface isn’t sticky, remove excess oil by going back over it with a microfibre cloth or kitchen towel. What’s more, you can pick up the baby oil in most high street retailers from £.. Since being posted, the video has racked up almost , likes and dozens of comments from ided viewers. While some were impressed by the hack, others had a few questions. One person said: “Never thought to use baby oil. You have a beautul home by the way.”  Another asked whether you could use the oil to clean windows as well, but Manjeet recommended not to as it would smear. Instead, she suggested using Fairy washing up liquid and water. A third wrote: It’s all fine and dandy doing this but doesn’t it make your surface greasy  to which Manjeet replied, saying: “No hun not at all I use the smallest drop.” “I use it on my bathroom radiator, gives it a lovely shine,” revealed someone .Have you got a story to share We want to hear all about it.

Units from the SAS and Parachute Regiment have been warned they could be sent to the country within hours. The preparation comes after defence chiefs and the head of MI advised No that Russian President Vladimir Putin represents a clear and present danger to Ukraine and the West. Video footage that emerged appears to show Russian tanks, armoured vehicles and troops massing near Ukraine. Now a British force – consisting of SAS members, the Special Reconnaissance Regiment, medics, engineers, signallers and up to  paratroopers from  Air Assault Brigade based in Aldershot, Hants – is being set up.  A source said: “The high readiness element of the brigade was told it may need to deploy at very short notice. “Between  and  troops are ready. Their equipment is packed and they are ready to fly to Ukraine and either land or parachute in. They have trained for both eventualities.” Britain’s most senior military officer, General Sir Nick Carter, warned that there is a greater risk of accidental war erupting between the West and Russia than at any time since the Cold War. General Carter, Chief of the Defence Staff, said: “We have to be careful that people don’t end up allowing the bellicose nature of some of our politics to finish in a position where escalation leads to miscalculation.”  Tensions have been rising in eastern Europe after the EU accused Belarus of flying in thousands of migrants to engineer a humanitarian crisis on its border with Poland, a dispute that threatens to draw in Russia and Nato. Putin warned that unscheduled Nato drills in the Black Sea posed a serious challenge for Moscow and that Russia had nothing to do with the crisis on ally Belarus’ border with the bloc. US officials have alerted European allies about a possible attack, which would be the culmination of a long-running Kremlin feud with Ukraine. Russian officials insisted their troops were only sent to the border in response to the increased Nato border activity.  Senior British defence sources said hundreds of paras supported by artillery units could drop into the region within  hours of the green light. Footage on social media appears to show huge amounts of Russian military gear near the city of Voronezh,  miles east of the Ukrainian border. A large number of Russian tanks, howitzers and armoured vehicles were reported to have been moved there. The Kremlin has said the West was “playing with fire” by deploying warships and spy planes in the Black Sea. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has reassured Ukraine of Washington’s “ironclad” commitment to its security. The Ministry of Defence said: “The UK and our allies are unwavering in support for Ukraine’s sovereignty.” On Friday, the RAF said its Typhoons escorted two Russian Tu Blackjack bombers away from a ‘UK area of interest’ over the North Sea.

But his musical taste was very dferent to mine, although I did once manage to get him to sing along to Block Buster by the Sweet.My father died in August , just a week before I started high school at Preston Lodge. Irsquod just turned  years old. Soon afterwards, I remember going into his study, which had previously been out of bounds, and sitting in his chair, surrounded by his books, writing materials and music tapes.These were the days when combined radio and tape recorders were popular. His music tapes were in a special box, all titled in his handwriting. Hersquod recorded the music from the radio so the quality wasnrsquot brilliant.There were moments on the tapes when hersquod not switched it off quickly enough, so hersquod caught snippets of the presenter talking, and sometimes the tape had run out before the tune ended.But all this just made the tape collection a more powerful personal connection to my dad who Irsquod recently lost. So, while he had been unable to interest me in classical music while he was alive, I began to listen to his collection after his death. I would recognise tunes and was now able to put a name to them thanks to the titles hersquod written on the tapes.They conjured up memories for me. One was of a rainy Saturday afternoon in which my father invited me to join him in being the conductor for a Mozart tune. So he showed me how to conduct, leading and living the music with our arm movements. We had fun together doing this for what seemed like an hour or so in our small kitchen, as he explained the dferent instruments involved and how they merge together, and the role of the conductor. It was, in truth, a rare moment, but perhaps thatrsquos why I remembered it so vividly.It was the same Mozart tune that played on my car radio last week. It conjured another memory: of me standing in the kitchen being the conductor to the tune, alone, in the weeks after my fatherrsquos death. Irsquod found the tape and recognised the tune. I then learnt every pause, listened to the instruments and conducted to the music as my father had taught me.I didnrsquot understand it at the time, nobody spoke to me about it, but I now realise that I was in deep grief.My conducting the music was an expression of my loss, but I had nobody to talk to about it or process it I couldnrsquot allow the emotions to surface: ldquoBe strong, now you are the man of the family, boys donrsquot cry, they get on with it.My mother was stunned and closed down as well. I somehow learnt that tears, crying and being upset was something to avoid. So I buried my grief.So I did as advised, I got on with it. Irsquove done OK, I think, for I suppose when we walk with a stone in our shoe long enough we get used to it, and after a while stop noticing it. But, of course, it is still there, and only when we take our shoe off and finally find a way to remove the stone do we feel the dference and understand the effect itrsquos had on our walking.Last week was that moment for me: sitting in my car, overwhelmed with emotion from  years ago, remembering myself as a -year-old boy who felt he was unable to talk about what was then the greatest loss in his le.Irsquom a father myself now, of course, and thank goodness times have changed.There is a greater recognition these days of the need to talk, to express emotions and process feelings that our mental health is as important as our physical health, although words are often not matched with resources.But within our families also, we all need safe spaces to feel upset, let emotions surface and receive support from love ones. And that includes recognising our own mental health needs.I know most of us already know the importance of this. I certainly know it, yet despite this, I still tend to ignore the signs Irsquom struggling until my mental health is in tatters, which helps nobody.Just now my kids are having their own challenges, as so many are, and my own emotions have surfaced in my attempts to give support. The temptation was to quickly re-bury my emotions so I could concentrate on giving that support and also not let anyone down that voice is still in my head: ldquoGet on with it, man up.But that Mozart tune stopped me doing this. It made me connect with how I felt. It helped me understand why the adults close to me, when I was that -year-old boy, didnrsquot ask me how I was feeling or give me space and time to talk about my emotions and express my loss they couldnrsquot because they hadnrsquot allowed it for themselves.Mozart that day gave me the gt of self-care, which has helped me be more effective in caring and supporting loved ones, and ing at well at work.Itrsquos never easy to write about a personal vulnerability there is still that fear of ridicule. I had actually planned to write a historical tale this week, but events, and emotions, took over. There is always next time.Remembrance Day is this week, a time when we collectively pause to remember people we have lost in wars. Veterans know all about long-lasting trauma and loss, and the importance of acknowledging unseen emotional wounds.These issues can affect us all in dferent ways at dferent times. We rarely know the struggles that others are experiencing.

Because Irsquove been really stressed out.Friday morning in Leith and Easter has a new album, entitled System, to promote. We are sitting at a table outside the Word of Mouth Bistro to talk, but Easter seems a little edgy, a little haunted even. He sits at an angle, a little hunched up, maybe uncomfortable with talking about himself, maybe uncomfortable full stop.Easter is a singer songwriter who grew up in Dunbar and now lives in Leith. He is  and he and has just made a ferocious and fun record. System is a lo-fi, full-flavour thing saturated in pop melodies and dirty distortion and filled to the brim with short, sharp songs that carry echoes of early rockrsquonrsquoroll and Glam-era T-Rex, built around a voice thatrsquos gravelly croon. The result is genuinely thrilling.Easter will take the compliment, but the truth is, he seems a little weighed under today. ldquoItrsquos a bit strange. It was supposed to come out August initially and then September and now November. So, Irsquom kind of over it already, he says of the album. ldquoI wish it had come out earlier.Why so  Because itrsquos already November, he says. ldquoThen itrsquos Christmas and then itrsquos  and then everyonersquos looking for the new thing.Therersquos a wary, weary air to him today. Hersquos been struggling with things of late, he admits mostly about how to make music and how to make money at the same time.ldquoI donrsquot knowI should really be saying this, but you do consider packing it all in, he tells me at one point. ldquoJust the amount of time you put in, the hours for something to just go up and then ...He pauses, changes direction, something he does a lot during our short time together. ldquoThe level Irsquom at gigging is not covering the bills. Thatrsquos why I do solo, so I can kind of bring a bit home. But the amount of time hellip Yeah, itrsquos a tricky balance.I hope he feels it is worth it because System, his second album is a sticky, febrile compulsion, easily one of my favourite albums of the year. A pop album with a dark heart.ldquoI wanted to make a party album, he says, ldquobut then, lyrically, itrsquos maybe a party at the end of the world or something.It is mostly all his own work. Twin sisters Pauline and Jacqui Cuff, aka The Leith Congregational Choir, aka Soho, fondly recalled for their Smiths-sampling  hit Hippychick, contribute to the album from their home in Birmingham .Otherwise, he made the album himself in his tiny Leith studio just a few streets away from where we sit now. ldquoItrsquos all me playing, Easter points out.And much of what we hear are single takes, ldquoso you can feel the energy, he adds.ldquoMaybe I double track the guitar, but yoursquore just trying to bottle it basically. Production-wise, therersquos a lot of distortion going on everything. Vocals as well.The sound was inspired by listening to early Bo Diddley demos and Jessie Mae Hemphill. ldquoI discovered her this year. Shersquos from Mississippi. She used to play with her family in a fe and drum band and therersquos a live recording of her songs and you can hear that in there. I love that. I wish I could roll a snare. Thatrsquos what Irsquom working on.When he starts talking about music you can hear his enthusiasm audibly rise. From these influences he has created a raw, punchy, aggressive sound sweetened by his ear for melody. The noise of it is in keeping with the lyrics which often come from a dark place, whether itrsquos his horror at politiciansand just general morbidities.The first song What You Think  ndash which is, by the way, a total banger ndash basically begins with you imagining you are dead, Callum, I point out.ldquoThat, I guess, is trying to grab peoplersquos attention with that first line. During the pandemic to start the album with that line hellip I did think about it hellipldquoI didnrsquot have anything .He raises his head. ldquoThatrsquos a positive song as far as just living, basically.When yoursquore writing songs, Easter adds, yoursquore reacting to whatrsquos going on around you. ldquoAnd itrsquos been a very tense time. So much information and anxiety. So that kind of comes across. And trying to balance that in the lyrics hellip Not trying to be ambiguous but hellip He pauses again, questions himself. ldquoIs there much ambiguity in there He doesnrsquot have an answer. ldquoI was just trying to lay it out as I see it.Whatrsquos clear is that whatever has him on edge today itrsquos not all personal. ldquoIrsquove stopped watching the news really which hellip I dunno hellip Maybe I should start watching it again. But you just get so bogged down with everything.He s to the title track. ldquoThat song is about whatrsquos important around you. Because how do you change things  What needs to be fixed  Is it the billionaires  Are there too many billionaires Hersquos clearly not one of them. To keep making music he has a iety of day jobs, often working up to  hours a week.ldquoI usually have about three things on the go outside the music moneywise and that kind of lets me stay on my toes and be a bit flexible. But itrsquos a tricky balance.These jobs y from manual labour to sound design. ldquoWith the pandemic all my freelance work went, he says.The music, though, Callum, yoursquore going to keep on doing it ldquoYeah. I will. I had a wee rocky spell. I love recording and making the music, but thatrsquos about  or  per cent of it.ldquoSince the restrictions have been lted, Irsquove probably done about four or five gigs and theyrsquove all been dferent set-ups so I need to settle on that a bit. But part of me quite likes mixing it up like that. I like it when therersquos a feeling that the audience know that I donrsquot know whatrsquos going to happen and riding that thatrsquos a buzz.ldquoItrsquos how to make it more profitable.What, I ask him, is the shape of le outside music  ldquoI think thatrsquos whatrsquos been problematic for my mental health, really. I just need nothing for a bit at some point because all the gaps are filled up with music. Irsquove got family, yeah, two kids, no motor. what the f*** am I doing, really  Itrsquos been tense, man.This is the point where idealism meets reality, I guess. Irsquom hoping when it comes to Easter the idealism wins out. The album is a legacy, I suggest. I hope he feels thatrsquos worthwhile.ldquoYeah, sometimes I do.Given everything wersquove talked about this might seem a ridiculous question but what are his ambitions for his music  ldquoItrsquos got to be from here. He beats a fist against his heart. ldquoAndI can make a living just doing that, thatrsquos it. I donrsquot want to be a celebrity. Nah. That kind of veneer therersquos too much of that.And yet, as a new short film he has made shows, he has real presence, which, admittedly, is a dferent thing. The short plays out like an alternative vision of those Saturday night light entertainment shows from the s and s, in this case, ldquo minutes of dancers, a kne thrower, a dominatrix, he explains. ldquoAnd me singing. The self-loathing comes across. Itrsquos a bit dark. Itrsquos a bit gothic actually.Itrsquos also another example of his originality. And evidence of just what we might losehe was to give it up. BBC Scotland should commission a series.Easter has finished his drink, hersquos ready to get on with his day. He tells me that hersquos still working out how to play the new album live.ldquoI can do accordion versions of stuff, but Irsquom really into dub and Irsquod almost rather just play it back in an interesting way through a load of speakers and hammer it with effects.He has another thought. ldquoWhen Irsquove been playing these versions of songs, Irsquove not actually been playing all the bangers. I think I just need to start to play all the bangers.Sounds like a good plan.Callum Easterrsquos album System is out on Friday via Moshi Moshi Records in association with Lost Map.

We show them where we are coming from as farmers, and what the land has been used for.ldquoItrsquos about immersing themselves into something that has a deep history. And therersquos a feeling after the pandemic that they want to be outdoors.Visitors happily pay to roll up their sleeves and muck into the kinds of farm tasks that have been a way of le for generations of country folk. Fixing broken fences and learning how to build a drystane dyke are said to be particularly popular.As is the farmrsquos lsquoday in the le of a farmerrsquo all-day experience, which offers the chance to spend the whole day carrying out repairs, carrying out farm jobs and getting close to the farm animals.Indeed, some have been so taken with getting mucky on the farm, they are sharing the experience and buying gt vouchers for their friends to do the same.And itrsquos not just farm tours: recently Kay, , and husband Dougie, , unveiled Bonnie Barns, upmarket glamping retreats designed for couples ndash hot tub included, of course ndash at their Shemore Farm, to complement the existing self-catering business.Le on the farm nowadays, agrees Kay, is about much more than sheep, cattle and crops.Indeed, growing the number and ersity of authentic agritourism experiences in Scotland is among the main ambitions of a new strategy designed to galvanise the countryrsquos valuable agriculture and tourism sectors.Unveiled as part of the Scottish Agritourism conference held at Perth Concert Hall last week, Scottish Agritourism  - The Strategy for Sustainable Growth sets out a shared vision for the sector.Among its aims is to sustainably develop the rural economy, protect family farms for future generations, build consumer awareness and loyalty towards local produce, and celebrate the history and heritage of Scottish farm communities.A key area of focus is on expanding the food and drink experiences farm businesses offer to meet rising demand from consumers for local, seasonal and lsquofarm to forkrsquo produce.The strategy, supported by a staged action plan and spanning public and private sectors, will target both domestic and international tourists.Agritourism, the blending of agriculture and tourism to create days out and holiday experiences on traditional working farms, has become a growing consumer trend, with around  farms, crofts and estates now said to have ersied to attract visitors.Vicki Miller, VisitScotland Director of Marketing and Digital, said: ldquoAs custodians of our countryside, real working farms are a vital part of Scotlandrsquos story.ldquoThe sector is filled with passionate storytellers that can bring to le the unique aspects of our history and heritage, while at the same time educating others about the need to protect and respect our natural assets.At Lennox of Lomond, the farm business which includes Shantron Farm run by Kayrsquos parents, Anne Lennox,  and husband Bobby, , the agritourism is viewed as crucial for the future of the family business.ldquoSuccession is a big thing for us as it is with many other farming families, says Kay. ldquoItrsquos a struggle and there needs to be something financial there to support that succession.ldquoThe farm used to sustain two families, now itrsquos down to one. My parents are in their late s, they are thinking of easing up and as the next generation we want to know therersquos another income stream.Brexitrsquos impact on subsidies has also galvanised farming families to rethink their businesses, along with consumer demands for traceable farm produce, proof of animal welfare and quality.ldquoWersquore not mass production farmers, she adds. ldquoThe sheep we have are direct descendants from the original line that dates from .ldquoPeople want to experience what a farm like ours is like.At Bellevue Farm on the Isle of Arran, Ailsa Currie,  and husband Donald, , have also added farm tours, experience days and farmersrsquo markets to the existing farm cottage self-catering business.ldquoWe opened up the farm for an open day in  and it was a great success, we had people asking when they could come and look around the farm, says Ailsa.ldquoAt first, we just walked people around the farm, let them feed the animals, collect the eggs and told them about our lives, the ups and downs, the changing seasons.ldquoItrsquos grown from there.Therersquos now a purpose-built shed which hosts farm days, tours, and a farmersrsquo market showcasing local produce.ldquoPeople want to know where their food comes from, says Ailsa. ldquoParents think itrsquos good to bring a child to a farm, but often when we explain things like how silage is made and how we use slurry to fertilise the fields, the parents admit they didnrsquot know how much was involved in farming.The loss of farms on the fringes of towns to housing and a growing concern over food miles and processing has fuelled interest, she adds.ldquoI can point to plants and askpeople know what they are and they donrsquot know, and then are amazed when they dig it up and discover itrsquos a carrot.Itrsquos hoped the new strategy will help the agritourism sector double in size with at least % of agritourism businesses offering food and drink by .Helping to launch the strategy, Mairi Gougeon, Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and Islands, said: ldquoBy ersying operations, farmers and crofters generate a stable income and this, in turn, helps to sustain their businesses.ldquoDiversied activity also provides an economic boost to the wider rural community by attracting tourists from urban areas to our countryside."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/13200599.jpg?type=article-full","title":"remembrance-sunday-uks-leaders-lay-wreaths-london-edimburgh-queen-absent","story":"The Lord Provostrsquos wreath-laying party joined the military parade before the gun was fired, at Edinburgh Castle, on the dot of am to mark the start of the two-minute silence.At .am a second gun ended the silence and a bugler played the last post.Minister of St Giles Cathedral Reverend Calum MacLeod read Binyonrsquos Lines: ldquoThey shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old, Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn, At the going down of the sun, and in the morning, We will remember them.Lord Provost of the City of Edinburgh Frank Ross laid his wreath at the Stone of Remembrance followed by Ms Sturgeon and Scottish Parliament Presiding Officer Alison Johnstone MSP.First Minister Nicola Sturgeonduring the Remembrance Sunday serviceIn London, members of the royal family and senior politicians have led the nation in honouring the countryrsquos war dead on Remembrance Sunday.Buckingham Palace announced on Sunday morning that the Queen would be absent from the service at the Cenotaph in central London due to having sprained her back.:Queen misses Cenotaph Remembrance Sunday service after spraining her backThe event on Whitehall was given added poignancy by ato pre-pandemic numbers of participating veterans and military, as well as onlookers.The Prince of Wales and Prime Minister were among those laying a wreath at the war memorial for the National Service of Remembrance.Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Labour leader Sir Keir StarmerBoris Johnson, who appeared sombre as he laid a wreath, said it was a moment to ldquocome together to remember those who sacriced everything in service of our country.Only the rustling of leaves and the chirping of birds could be heard as thousands of people held the two-minute silence at am in honour of all those who have lost their lives in conflict.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer stood beside the Prime Minister while former prime ministers lined up behind Mr Johnson, with John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, David Cameron and Theresa May all paying their respects.The Duke of Cambridge, Earl of Wessex and Princess Royal also laid wreaths at the memorial.Prince WilliamLooking on from a balcony of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office building were the Duchess of Cornwall, Duchess of Cambridge and Countess of Wessex.

Its gooood.\"Glasgow-based Taahliah is the first black trans DJ and producer to be nominated and and win in two categories in the Scottish Alternative Music Awards and with just one EP to her name there was curiosity over just what we would be served.It threatened to be Cloth all over again.The roadies brought on the Pioneer decks, only after half an hour to take them off and replace it with a simple Apple Mac. The festival was threatening to turn into one long soundcheck.Much later than scheduled, we were finally at lt off and boy was it worth waiting for.Flanked by two dancers, one of whom had great dficulty keeping a top on, this Sophie-inspired hyperpop inspiration created a set of experimental and disorientating dancefloor majesty that is as original and captivating as you will hear anywhere.The Kilmarnock-born artist comes into her own on the block-rockin Bourgeoisie which makes the walls of this Cavern-esque venue shake.This was, however, more of a DJ set than an actual live show, with Taahliah staring into the Apple Mac screen a lot, while occasionally taking time to throw some shapes with the odd strut.While this festival becomes an impossibilityyou want to cover every venue - with some two miles apart - there is no questioning how eclectic the bands are.I can think of nowhere  where a dancefloor thump would be followed by the delightfully ear-bleeding effect-heavy rf-rock blast that is Londons Part Chimp, once signed to Mogwais Rock Action label.There is then a quick half hour speed-tramp to the QMU to arrive just in the nick of time as London-born and Edinburgh-bred composer, performer and producer, Anna Meredith lands on stage on time.It is perhaps all too perfect.The past Scottish Album of the Year winner and Mercury Prize nominee is gleaming in a black and white striped outfit.

The gun will be taken out of storage where it has been for some time and carried to Kirkwall for an onward journey for conservation work by JPS Restoration, specialist large industrial conservators based in Alloa. The gun willto the county in the run up to Christmas to take up position inside the new Museum extension.The heavy lting and relocation work is being carried out by local firms Orkney Builders Contractors Ltd. and Heddle Construction Ltd., as part of the contract to refurbish the Museum’s Pumphouse and build the new extension.The guns from SMS Bremse and SMS Karlsruhe are both cm SK L – both these vessels were interned  with the rest of the High Seas Fleet in Scapa Flow in , and scuttled by their own crews on  June . Bremse was salvaged by Ernest Cox ten years later, but Karlsruhe remains on the sea bed and is a popular site for recreational ers.SMS Bremse was a minelaying light cruiser launched in  in Stettin. She spent the war operating in the North Sea, taking part in a raid on British convoy to Norway in  which resulted in the sinking of two Royal Navy destroyers and nine merchant ships.SMS Karlsruhe was a light cruiser, launched in  in Kiel and named after the Imperial German Navy’s famous raiding cruiser which was lost in the Caribbean at the start of the First World War. She saw service in the North Sea and the Baltic. The gun from this vessel in the Museum’s collection is missing its gun shield.HMS Hampshire struck a German mine off Marwick Head in heavy weather on the evening of June , , and sank within  minutes. All but  men of over  on board perished, including Lord Kitchener, who was travelling with a delegation to Russia. Together the shaft plus the manganese bronze propellor weigh around  tons. They were removed from the wreck site in  by a German salvage ship.

These are PM, PE and PE and PM.Papdale Nursery is also closed in full until the same date due to all staff having been contact traced.Authorities have said that the situation is being kept under constant review by NHS Orkney Public Health and OIC and daily updates are being provided to parents, staff and the wider community via the head teachers and communications on the council website and social media, and local media outlets.Online learning to those pupils having to remain at home is being provided by the school.OIC executive director of education, leisure and housing, James Wylie, said: “The situation at Papdale is changing at pace and I must commend the Head Teacher and her staff for doing all they can to ensure learning continues for pupils whether that is in class or remotely during these extenuating circumstances. My same thanks must go to the Nursery manager and colleagues for also going the extra mile to work through the challenges.“Orkney has been very lucky up to this stage with comparatively low numbers of COVID-, however we are all now facing a very dferent picture – the waves which have hit other areas are now on our shores. I must also praise parents who have, on the whole, been very supportive of the staff at Papdale and recognise the tremendous efforts they have been putting in to try and follow the Public Health guidance and ensure the most appropriate and safe plans are in place.“As already said, we continue to meet with Public Health, Environmental Health, Safety and Resilience and Education staff to evaluate the present situation to influence the next steps. As a result of staffing issues due to COVID we have no alternative but to keep the P classes closed for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. We will update all parents as soon as possiblethis position changes and further closures are required.“We do understand that there are dfering opinions on this some parents are anxious about sending their child to school where there have been positive cases and there are others who feel that given the enhanced mitigating measures in place, that routines and learning should continue whenever possible.  What we must do as educators is look to the advice and guidance of Public Health and collectively, in a multi-agency way, find the balance.“I joined an Environmental Health colleague from the Council, along with the Head Teacher,  this morningon a walk through the school to evaluate the mitigations in place. For all those that may be concerned Environmental Health are confident that appropriate measures are being taken.“There is no doubt that the virus is not going to disappear in the near future so we must adapt as best we can. Our children deserve an education and that is what we will strive to provide. Please continue to follow the guidance which is outlined by our colleagues at NHS Orkney.”NHS Orkney say around one in three people with COVID- don’t show any symptoms.The health authority has emphasised that it’s more important than ever to take your two free COVID lateral flow tests every week and record your results, evenyou are fully vaccinated and don#t have symptoms.Lateral flow test kits can be collected from community pharmacies and local test sites or ordered online at nhsinform.scot testing.  You can access the direct link to order LFD tests here: https:www.gov.uk order-coronavirus-rapid-lateral-flow.Recording both positive and negative results allows the NHS to track the presence of the virus in our communities.Find out more at nhsinform.scot testingIf you, or anyone in your household is displaying symptoms of COVID, which include a continuous cough, temperature and loss in taste or smell, or you have a positive Lateral Flow testyou MUST self-isolate immediately and book a PCR test by calling  .copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

A further four staff are awaiting PCR tests or results. In total,  Papdale staff are off work today due to illness or other reasons.A total of  pupils remain within class today, and a further  are receiving online learning, out of a school roll of . The remainder —  pupils — are absent from school for a iety of reasons, including COVID, other illness, or due to parental concerns.James Wylie, OIC#s executive director of education, leisure and housing said: “It is unfortunate that we remain in the position today that we cannot safely reopen the four classes mentioned for the remainder of the school week due to COVID-related staffing shortages and the continuous slight rise in pupil cases across these classes.#It is important that this messaging is conveyed to parents as soon as possible in respect of the remainder of the school week to allow them the time to make appropriate childcare arrangements.“Head Teacher Wendy Bowen will be contacting parents now to make them aware of the decision and Nursery Manager Caroline Easton will also be updating those who use the nursery facility. We are continuing to hold daily meetings andthe position changes we will update accordingly.“As always, I thank staff for their hard work in trying to manage this situation and parents for their understanding.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We are scaling up the capacity of that already.Ms Sturgeon also spoke about the prospect of using hydrogen, and said the Scottish Government published The Hydrogen Plan during Cop.She said: ldquoWe set bold ambitions around hydrogen, green hydrogen in the main, in order to take advantage of our offshore wind and abundant supply of water ndash which puts Scotland in an ideal position to really exploit the potential of hydrogen, not just for our own needs here in Scotland but also as an export opportunity.ldquoI spoke during the week to a big gathering of those involved in hydrogen looking for investment opportunities and it is definitely an area where Scotland has got real strength.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

I sense every step of that journey.In , Borrodale school closed for that last time. And yet,we listen, we can still hear from Borrodale, forever young and in timeless cèilidh.Put in this kind of context we can sense how community relationships are deeply connected to change. The continuity of change, both backwards and forwards, gives us insight, and proximity with dferent and creative ways of being in place.Times change and culture continues. It is important to be hopeful in this and to not perceive the shadows of the past as a fading le force but as an index pointing to future relationships.The second social experience is of course relates to the typical excitement of guising at Oidhche Shamhna. Originally, Oidhche Shamhna was integral toour sense of place and the cultural relationships of le cycles, including time itself.Oidhche Shamhna is ‘the night of summer’s end,’ and in our older understanding of the festival, it reveals that new le begins in darkness and is born into light similarly, just as days used to begin and end at dusk, the move to the darker half of the year is also the continuation of a cycle and is equally about new beginnings.In the deeper memory of Gaelic cosmology, this is the beginning of the new year, and of course, November is still called ‘an t-Samhain’ in Gàidhlig.My earliest memories of guising would be like those of many, our dad taking my sister and I for a few easy visits to long-standing neighbours and family friends. Even though we would only go to a few houses in those early days, the intensity and excitement of the initiation on a cold dark night was largely experienced through the warmth and kindness revealed in the relationships that emerged in the evening.Guising, then, is a form of cèilidh, where the encouraging and nurturing of the gt of exchange is more intangible than we always appreciate. It is that dimension of sustaining or developing relationships that seems most important to me.One of the first homes we would have visited on my first Oidhche Shamhna will have been that of Angus and Effie Ross in Fàsach. In my early years it was a home that we probably had more time in than any house outside of my family.It was a home I visited everyday day walking home from Borrodale school. My errand was to collect our newspapers from the post office, but it wasn’t a job, it was a relationship.Our family had a strong connection with these Rosses. In , Angus Ross’ great-uncle Alexander Ross had been nominated to deliver the prepared statement for the Fàsach croftersto the Napier Commission.In it he testied specically to the clearance of my great-great-grandfather from Ramasaig , who was removed along with all the families from Ramasaig around -, to make way for sheep, congesting further the land in Fàsach. So, it is from at least that time that our family had been friends.Alexander Ross’s brother, Kenneth Ross, also Fàsach, had among his eight children a first son called Neil and a second called Norman, both being young boys during the land wars....I did know Margaret but I never did met James Ross as he had a fatal accident in the early s in Glasgow, outside the BBC.Angus Ross and Seanair worked together on the County lorry . We saw Angus and Effie a lot and my mum credits him with telling her and her siblings about their Cameron origin story in Glendale.A mysterious tale of a man with long grey hair and a beard living in a cave at Scornandaoine on the east side of Loch Poolteil. He had arrived from Lochaber, in the mid to later s, likely a refugee from any number of social problems in the Gàidhealtachd of that time.Even now it still sounds like a good Halloween story. Certainly, my mum has never been a fan of beards in the family, but we were always welcomed by the Rosses in the ceilidh ethic of everyday relationships., Tobraichean a’ Gluasad .Here, ‘Tuam’ talks about his knowledge of local wells the necessity to move between dferent wells for sustenance, and so there will be times when a well in one place becomes dry while water would be plentul in another well.A resource such as Tobar an Dualchais helps us think about our many and ied relationships with culture, place, and time.Part of the intangible gt to be found within the archives, and also with the people and places around us, is how the wells of culture will be found popping up with all their potential, anywhere and everywhere, carried through the voices and relationships we nurture and come to know.Importantly, this can activate new dialogues, experiences, and gestures of cèilidh, and to embrace these for all in our communities, our futures, wherever the wells emerge."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/20211103_133201-scaled.jpg","title":"climate action group to hold skye bridge march and vigil in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, which formed shortly before the pandemic, is inviting people to show their solidarity with activists across the world in highlighting the need for urgent change to tackle the existential threat of climate change.Speaking to the Free Press during the first week of the COP UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Skye Climate Action coordinator Anne MacLennan described the summit as “critically important” and was keen to emphasise that Saturday’s event should take place in a peaceful and respectable manner.#Saturday is the Global Day of Action for Climate Justice, and the themes are that we need to act, and act urgently, and there is also the huge justice issue,# she said.“The idea for the march is for us to leave the Kyleakin-end at  noon and to walk over the bridge by the pavements and walk back again.#It is really important that the event is peaceful, family-friendly, and respectful of everyone # I think it is a demonstration of the kind of society we want to head towards being, so we can live in a sustainable and equitable way.

It is important that those who are convincedcan demonstrate.#Addressing the potential for far-reaching consequences to impact people across the world, she said: #We are cushioned now to some extent, although people in the UK have had to suffer from flooding, wildfires, and drought.“Much of our food comes from overseas, andpeople will have to migrate and find somewhere  to live # so people will be moving around the world, so places that are nice and comfortable now might then receive other people.#A huge element of this issue is about all the youngsters and children # the more carbon we put into the atmosphere, the more trouble that they will have to face, meaning there will be less chance for them to turn the situation around.#This issue is critically important.”On Friday th November, as the conference is expected to be closing, there will be a candlelight vigil in Somerled Square in Portree from .-pm.Ms MacLennan added: “There is a sense that people want to show solidarity with what#s happening at COP in Glasgow, and they want to be able to express their concerns.#Holding it in Portree makes it more accessible for people in the north of the island, because Saturday#s march over the bridge is a long way for people further north to travel to be involved, especiallyit is a dreadful day.#For those unable to attend Saturday#s march over the bridge, everyone is of course welcome to walk over the bridge with signage at any point at the weekend.“It might be good for people to be wandering over the bridge to and fro at dferent times to help convey the message.”"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Uist-beach-Floraidh-Forrest.jpg","title":"climate change and the hebrides the rising sea and an eerily prophetic","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineFor those acquainted with Gaelic oral lore, it cannot be denied that there is something intensely perceptive, and eerily prophetic, about the traditions tied to the steady ingress of the sea.Since time immemorial, the mental record-keeping of a coastal people has documented and predicted the near imperceptible, yet near constant, rise of the waters since the Ice Age. century.In Tobar an Dualchais, there are numerous recordings illustrating similar examples where the sea has conquered the land.In one example from , Dòmhnall MacCuinn and Dòmhnall Ailean MacCuinn were recorded describing old domestic ruins seen at extreme low tides over a mile from the shore in An t-Ìochdar .These homesteads must have once been on dry land, they surmise.In Tracks   , the collector Dòmhnall Eairdsidh Dòmhnallach of the School of Scottish Studies asks Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson about submerged places near An t-Ìochdar, including Sgeir na h-Àtha – The Skerry of the Barn.Similar shore names which incorporate terrestrial features dot the seascape of Uist and evidence the widely held belief that the machair once stretched much further into the west.Anxieties tied to coastal le were not only informed by past experience and day-to-day observation they also manested themselves in people’s visions of the future.There is a prophecy, for example, retold by Dòmhnall Alasdair Johnson in Track . It presages that the Ìochdar shoreline will soon be as far inland as A’ Bhuaile Dhubh and An Càrnan, close to where the old Church of Scotland is.He remarks that such an outcome isn’t all that farfetched, considering the severity of coastal erosion in the area.Alexander Carmichael, the folklorist and compiler of Carmina Gadelica, also published several climactic prophecies. He was fascinated by these histories and repeatedly drew attention to the submerged remains of houses, temples and tree-roots in his writings.A poem collected in Lìonacuithe in  prophesies the flooding of the Atlantic: “The walls of the churches shall be the fishing-rocks of the people, while the resting-place of the dead shall be a forest of tangles, among whose mazes the pale-faced mermaid, the marled seal, and the brown otter shall race and run and leap and gambol, like the children of men at play.”The approaching catastrophe so arrestingly depicted in this verse parallels many of the same fears voiced by coastal communities today.Indeed, such predications are the reality for hundreds of millions of people across the globe. The most recent UN report on climate change published in August  warned that we could see the ocean ascend nearly  metre by the end of the century.Such outcomes will threaten many of these societies existentially. Island nations such as the Males and Tuvalu will disappear.Cities, including New York City, Shanghai and Kolkata, will be exposed to coastal flooding by . Bangladesh could lose up to a fth of its land mass, displacing -million people. century is our frightening reality.In Scotland, low-lying areas with soft coasts of machair are particularly vulnerable, especially those at the edge of the Atlantic like Islay, Tiree and Uist.In addition to the constant erosion on the western edges of Uist, there is a further struggle in low-lying areas.Drainage is critical, as any crofter will tell you.Sufficient and well-maintained drains allow water to flow to the ocean. When there is heavy rainfall – a trend that is due to intensy in the UK in the future, drains alleviate inland flooding.In South Uist, a large drain is called a “lig”, a term associated with letting water.There are several main lige systems in South Uist and some are apparent in placenames. There is An Lige Mòr in Dalabrog, An Lige Mòr in Loch Aoineart, Loch Bun an Ligidh in Dreumasdal and Loch an Ligidh at the western terminus of Loch Bì.While the ligidhean today act as drains, most of these sizeable watercourses were likely built as canals to transport goods.This is reflected in the oral tradition of Uist that most of the machair lochs were once connected by ligidhean.In Track , Dòmhnall MacAonghais of Taobh a Deas Ghleann Dail credits the Norse with the original construction of the canals, which ran from Poll a’ Charra to An t-Ìochdar. He says that the waterways were used in place of roads. Track  runs into Track , where Dòmhnall says that there were three places where the Norse wintered their fleets, at An t-Ìochdar, An Ròdha Glas in Cill Donnain, and at Poll a’ Charra.Interestingly, these places correspond to locations where there are manmade drains running to the Atlantic Ocean.Regardless of their actual origin, which is the subject of ongoing research, the ligidhean of South Uist endure as critical infrastructure against flooding.As sea levels rise, however, the drains are rendered less effective due to the reduction in the height between the inland water table and the sea.This gets so bad during some springtides that saltwater can even flow back into the freshwater system, risking the salinisation of the ecosystem.The threat of climate change and sea-level rise unites coastal communities across the world.It is imperative that the COP debates take notice of these voices and reflect on the cumulative experience and knowledge of these societies.Gaelic is only one voice, and there are numerous other climate threads and themes, from within Tobar an Dualchais and without, which couldn’t be included into such a short article.We can only guess at the breadth and depth of information about climate change that exists in other endangered and indigenous languages across the globe.This information is not only relevant to fully understanding the crises we face they may also point to a way out of them."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_4193378.jpg--.jpg?1635492771000\n","title":"frightful fun for all at hallowena 2021","story":"THE People’s Park, Ballymena will host one of the scariest nights of the year on Friday, October , from pm to .pm.The free event, organised by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, will thrill and chill with a packed programme of spooktacular activities for your little monsters to enjoy, with a huge walking dragon, fire juggling display, a fancy dress competition, a kiddies funfair, live music from The VIPs and a spooky illumination trail.You can sink your fangs into some sweet treats or tasty hot food to beat those Halloween hunger pangs, while the fun and festivities will finish with a fangtastic fireworks finale at .pm.Why not have your own #MEAdventure in the park  Outdoor areas including the brand new play equipment will be accessible during the event and there will be a free kiddies fun fair to entertain your little terrors.Wandering ghouls and spine tingling figures will be ready to spook you at every turn with a few hair-raising special additions.Follow the extended spooky illumination trail throughout the park and bump into some familiar characters along the way!Mayor of Mid and East Antrim, Councillor William McCaughey, encouraged everyone to join in the Hallowena fun: “It is a great delight for us to be able to safely welcome our community to events this year and the Hallowena celebrations are always among the most popular on Council’s entertainment programme.“There is literally something for ghosts and goblins of all ages to enjoy on Friday  October in the stunning People’s Park in Ballymena, and I am really excited about the evening.“I am privileged to welcome everyone in our community to the park for some spooktacular fun, and I encourage those attending to observe the necessary public health guidelines so that we can protect ourselves and those around us.”There are over  off-street car park spaces within a -minute walk of People’s Park so make an evening of it with a visit to any of the fantastic shops or restaurants in the town.Parking for blue badge holders is available from pm at the People’s Park council car park off the Ballymoney Road.To help with a safe set-up of the site People’s Park will be closed to all members of the public on Friday  October until the event starts at pm.For everyone’s safety dogs, alcohol or fireworks are not permitted in the park and under s must have a responsible adult with them.Admission is free and no tickets are required.Visitors to the Hallowena event are asked to use the hand sanitisers provided and observe social distancing.

Dr David Dobbin, Chairman of firmus energy, said: We very much regret having to increase our tarf however steep increases in global wholesale gas prices have forced our hand.

EUROSPAR Rossdowney champions a number of local suppliers in the North West area, from in-store florist Wild Berry Boutique to Higgins  Sons Family Butchers and McDaid’s Bakery with their famous burnt buns. The supermarket has also been developed with the local shoppers’ specic missions in mind – to pick up fresh, local food-to-go for now, and groceries for later. EUROSPAR Rossdowney is also the first home of the new Nourish deli, offering a nutritious selection of bowls, wraps and smoothies throughout the day. The concept has been created by Henderson Retail to offer shoppers even more choice from their popular food-to-go counters. Mark McCammond, retail director at Henderson Group, said the store represented all that was great and good about the local area. He added: “The people of the Waterside area are what makes it, and the local links for the new EUROSPAR Rossdowney store are second to none. “Not only do we have a team that has served the local community for decades, but we also have extensive ranges of products sourced from local suppliers which keep our food miles down. “We have researched the local shopper demographic extensively, so this store has been built with what they’re looking for directly in mind – fresh, locally produced ingredients for tonight’s tea, and on-site options, made fresh in-store for now.” Store manager, Keith Wilson, has been in charge throughout the build, and said the addition of  parking spaces, a two-pump MAXOL forecourt featuring regular grades and new % carbon offset Premium fuel grades, and a host of additional services on site made it the most convenient site in town. He added: “Shoppers can expect a wide range of services in-store including the Post Office and the extended range of products available from the butchery counter, alongside the first ever Nourish deli counter and all-new Barista Bar coffee, now serving flat whites and luxury hot chocolate and all the Barista coffee favourites. “Local is at the heart of everything we do, from our North West supplier roster which features Limavady’s Milgro and Broighter Gold, Derry’s Doherty Meats, Bonds Potatoes and McDaid’s Bakery alongside Coleraine’s Scott’s Crispy Onions and our top-class butchery serve over from Higgins Family Butchers in Castlerock. “We also have The CHEF range of home-cooked, pre-prepared meals which have recently been awarded Great Taste Awards. Our staff are all friendly faces, well-known and trusted in the area and our shoppers know they will be getting the best range, choice and value in-store.”  Bernie Friars, Lesley Ann Curry, Joyce Logan-Wilson, Grainne McLaughlin, Tina McElhinney, who have over  years of EUROSPAR experience between them, declare the all-new EUROSPAR Rossdowney officially open.  Over , big brand products have been price matched to Tesco, bringing even more value at a local level. Keith continued “We were delighted to have Foyle Search and Rescue on site for our opening day where we held bucket collections for the vital work they do locally. Throughout the year, we will raise money for the NI Children’s Hospice, EUROSPAR’s charity partner Cancer Fund for Children, and the Jack  Jill Foundation. Our community outreach work is extremely important we have donated sanitising stations to the local Dale View Nursing Home, and we’ll continue to support the team at Arc Fitness who do important work around mental wellbeing and addiction. “It’s very important for us to be a hub of the local community and we look forward to supporting all these organisations and more in the future.”  Flourish with Nourish The newest food to go offering created for EUROSPAR Nourish is a range of bowls, wraps and smoothies.

Her family said they are incredibly proud of Ava for using her own birthday to raise money and help other children.Ava even decided to have her birthday cake made with the charity’s colours. Her proud mum, Becky McEvoy, said: “The idea came about by me explaining to her that there are children who dont have any hair due to dferent types of sicknesses and their treatments. “I then showed her The Little Princess Trust’s Instagram posts and she automatically said Mammy, can I do that  I want to help boys and girls have beautul hair like mine.’ “Of course, it was no surprise to me, her daddy and the rest of our family. Ava is such a loving, kind and caring little girl that it is just in her nature to help others. “Ava was due to have her hair trimmed when I spoke to her about it so she already had about nine inches of donatable hair but we hoped that Ava would have - inches as she had only decided in the August and her birthday was on November . “My sister, Ava’s aunty Cheryl, set up a Just Giving page to raise money for the charity and we had originally set a target of pound to help the charity with the cost of turning Ava’s hair into a wig for a young person.” Ava has since smashed this target and has raised over pound between the fundraising page and cash donations from family, friends, her primary school and Irish dancing school. Becky continued: “We asked Courtney, at local hairdressers, Hair by CC, to cut Ava’s hair the day after her birthday. “Once Courtney had cut Ava’shair,she jumped up to go look in the mirror and check out her new hairstyle and of course loved it. “Every morning she gets up and looks in the mirror and says Mammy, I just love my new hair. “As her Mammy, I am incredibly proud of Ava, so is her daddy and the rest of her family. Ava is just an inspiration to everyone. “We cant thank everyone enough who was able to donate to help her help a young person feel like themselves again. “Ava has a younger brother who is ten months old and we cant wait until he grows up a bit so we can explain to him how incredible his big sister is.”ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeUrsula Bernadette Doherty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry hospitals Emergency Department very busy with over  people waiting overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tony Doherty, chairpersoDerry NewsBloody Sunday th anniversary programme of events unveiled overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSoftware engineer ran from police covered in mud after crashing through hedge overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Six-year-old, Ava, donates  inches of hair in charity fundraiserDerry NewsSix-year-old, Ava, donates  inches of hair in charity fundraiser overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

She co-founded successful online learning company Learning Pool in Derry in . Today, she works extensively with start-ups and scaling tech companies. She is one of the co-founders of cross-border social enterprise and female founder community AwakenHub and she is part of the EU’s flagship EIC Accelerator innovation team. googletag.cmd.push -------------------------------------------- A few weeks ago Digital DNA’s Simon Bailie asked me to write a short piece about Derry for DDNA’s Top Tech Companies in NIreport. Simon asked me to cover the Derry tech scene – how it’s altered in the almost  years I’ve been working in the city and perhaps more importantly, what the missing ingredients are that would make the Maiden City’s tech scene really sing. I enjoyed writing it and was surprised to find that no-one  has written about this. Here’s what I had to say in full. How much has the Derry tech scene changed  I began working in Derry in . I moved from Belfast where I’d been global CFO in one of QUB’s semiconductor IP spinouts.I’d spent a good bit of my time in the early noughties in Silicon Valley and Derry in  couldn’t have been further from San Jose. The only similarity was that the streets were completely deserted by .pm. When I told my friends in Belfast that I was taking a job in Derry they all tried to talk me out of it. I remember trying to recruit a team in  and talent was very thin on the ground. Most of the local workforce were lers in one of the FDIs or they commuted to tech jobs in either Belfast or Letterkenny. The local tech scene back then was dominated by the prominent FDIs Seagate  Allstate , big fish Singularityand a never-ending raft of call centres and it was populated by revered avuncular middle-aged men like Bro McFerran and Dr Alan McClure. Anyone calling the HP or Expedia customer help lines back in the day would’ve been greeted by a Derry accent, way before it was trendy. We started Learning Pool in London in  and quickly moved the company to Derry because it was bootstrap-affordable and because of the ready talent graduating from Magee. We couldn’t afford to hire an experienced team so we recruited new graduates with the right attitude and trained them. We didn’t have an office so we took a few desks in theshockingly haphazard co-working space at the university. Even though the space was supposed to be reserved for new startups, a few companies had been renting in there forever so we ended up with desks dotted here and there in random parts of the floor. No-one in our team could sit together and the co-working space manager constantly shushed us whenever we took phone calls and harped on forever about the washing-up. We had a desktop PC in the corner with a paper notice sellotaped to the top of it which read DO NOT SWITCH OFF  Today there’s a stable of promising scaling tech companies choosing to base themselves in Derry. Established companies likeElemental Software  Newer entrants like medtech company Respiratory Analytics, cyber security companyITUSand caretech challenger startupInCharge. Many companies keep one foot in Derry and the other in Donegal, thus preserving their EU status for access to customers and funding. Catalyst Incopened its doors in  on the historic Fort George site just outside the city and has been a great formal addition to the fabric of the local ecosystem. Other active startup supports likeStartacusand new island of Ireland female founder community AwakenHubare anchored in Derry. Today, the local tech scene is younger, more female, less formal, more global, well educated and informed and definitely ambitious. A lot of newer founders have lived away from Ireland for a while but are electing tohome and settle down, build a business. Catalyst’s Co-Founders programme has uncovered some interesting nascent companies. Some of those new graduates that I recruited back in  or  have gone on to found their own startups. That’s how ecosystems work. The FDIs are still present but they’re less dominant today. They don’t have a lot of employee churn and just tick along in the background, largely behind closed doors. They bring employment to an area of Northern Ireland that badly needs it and they sponsor the odd event and programme. Many of the call centres seem to have been bought over and have disappeared. Innovation and all the interesting stuff happens in the smaller, agile companies around the edges and this is what we need more of. As well as the FDIs we now have the presence of indigenous scaleups like Kainosand FinTru. It would be great to see a few more like these moving in but high quality office space is an issue. Maybe not so important in the future we’re facing post-COVID. The traditional talent pool has extended from the Bann well into Donegal and in Derry I’ve worked beside people who’ve commuted daily from as far afield as Ballycastle and Creeslough. Missing Ingredients If it was Christmas morning and I could have three wishes to improve the tech sector ecosystem in the North West this is what I would wish for: - An ambitious cross-border university named after the late John Hume with campuses in both Derry and Donegaland strong links into the powerful North West diaspora that stretches from Philadelphia to London to Singapore. I’m always impressed by the vibrant startup scene that exists in Letterkenny as a result of the numerous overseas students and researchers who come to LYIT for academic reasons and end up staying. This new university to be fastened at the hip to a well funded and well resourced startup, student and alumni accelerator regime like Oxford University has withOxford Foundrywhich in turn connects firmly into sources of venture finance, a bit likeEDEMin the marina in Valencia - A Derry-Letterkenny- Sligo-Galway Economic Corridor along the Wild Atlantic Way to mirror the Belfast-Dublin corridor that was formally announced in the east of the island last month. This to connect the opportunities that will naturally flow from the new Magee Medical School to the vibrant medtech cluster of companies and investors in Galway and to link in with the newly reinvigorated Western Development Commissionand the string of Atlantic hubs the Irish State has invested in over recent years. I am encouraged by news of a new cross-border scaling hub led by Catalyst Inc  LYIT which will be built in the image of thePortershedGalway model - A focus placed on determining how Derry and indeed all of Northern Ireland can tangibly and quickly benefit from being so close to an EU border in the post-Brexit world. Can Derry compete with Belfast  This was a provocative question posed by Simon in his brief to me. In my view, this is not the right question and shouldn’t be part of anyone’s ambition. Any venture starting out in the new world should instead think about opportunities presented as a result of global changes that the past  months have fast tracked. It’s now genuinely possible to be a global company from Day  and utilise talent from any part of the globe. Barriers no longer exist. Cities and regions need to start thinking this way too. To ask Derry to compete only with Belfast would not be setting a big enough challenge. So, in conclusion,you’re looking for a friendly and affordable university city to start your tech business, where it’s possible to be in both the UK and the EU, an hour from London by air, where   of the population is aged - and is well educated, where government startup funding is readily available, close to some of Europe’s finest beaches, with top class local state schools and a long history and culture … then maybe you should take a look at Derry. And my final call to action, on  April  Jayne Brady started in a brand new post at Belfast City Council as Belfast’s Digital Innovation Commissioner. An engineer and former Venture Capital Partner, in the  months since Jayne started she’s made a massive dference and she represents Belfast at the digital and innovation negotiating tables in both Westminster and Dublin. In truth, although she works for Belfast City Council she does her very best to represent all of Northern Ireland. Isn’t it time we appointed a Digital Innovation Commissioner to do the same and really own this agenda for the NW region of Ireland and its citizens, present and future ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeUrsula Bernadette Doherty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry hospitals Emergency Department very busy with over  people waiting overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tony Doherty, chairpersoDerry NewsBloody Sunday th anniversary programme of events unveiled overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSoftware engineer ran from police covered in mud after crashing through hedge overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Six-year-old, Ava, donates  inches of hair in charity fundraiserDerry NewsSix-year-old, Ava, donates  inches of hair in charity fundraiser overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Reporter: Colum Eastwood Nov   addthis, The British Government have managed over the course of the past year to do something many never thought possible – there is unity among victims and survivors and the political parties in N. Ireland and Ireland in opposition to their legacy proposals which subvert the rule of law and suppresses justice, truth and accountability.  googletag.cmd.push Current Downing Street proposals create a wholesale amnesty for those in state agencies and illegal militias responsible for the worst in the conflict. It slams shut the door to effective criminal investigations, to the already small prospect of criminal prosecutions, to inquests and to civil actions. All should stand in solidarity with victims and survivors. The scale of the amnesty is immense. A recent report said it was the worst proposed anywhere in the world, worse than the + models over recent decades in places emerging from conflict, worse than that introduced by the Pinochet military dictatorship in Chile. STAKE KNIFE IS FRONT and CENTRE Why  What is to fear  The proposals would mean that the current Jon Boucher Kenova investigation into the activities of the British agent known as Stake Kne would be closed. There are people – members or previously members of state agencies and militias - who will not want Kenova to see the light of day, want to see its work and its outcomes suppressed. Stake-kne is front and centre in the thinking behind the London approach.  The justied rage against all of this is rightly directed against London. But suppression of justice and truth is the agenda of state agencies and the illegal militias. Those in command and control of both have a common interest that less not more is known, that the spotlight fades from the brutality of what was visited on the people of Derry and the people of Ireland. UNANIMITY The opposition travel far beyond victims and survivors and political parties. The United Nations Human Rights Council has expressed grave concern over the British Governments legacy proposals and said they foreclose the pursuit of justice and accountability for the serious human rights violations committed during the Troubles and thwart victims rights to truth and to an effective remedy for the harm suffered, placing the United Kingdom in flagrant violation of its international obligations. The Council of Europe speaks out, the Dublin Government, US political leaders… the weight and range of opposition is verging on unanimous. VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS FIRST The most critical voices are those of victims, survivors and advocates. Together they speak out against these proposals. Their voices are clear and true and dignied and powerful. The victims groups I have met with reject these proposals wholeheartedly not because they want to remain in the past but because they have been denied fundamental truths about what happened to their loved ones. For years, families and victims groups have kept up the fight for truth and justice for their loved ones in their own reserved, dignied way. Earlier this year, I called on Boris Johnson to come with me to meet the Bloody Sunday families, the family of Paul Whitters and the countless loved ones of those killed by the IRA and tell them that they are not entitled to go through the justice process like everybody . He is yet to take me up on my offer. It shows that even Boris Johnson cannot look victims and families in the eye. He cannot produce the worst model of amnesty in decades anywhere and then claim that reject it as barriers to reconciliation. I have walked the same streets with victims campaigners where the British Army and paramilitaries murdered their loved ones, I have stood with them outside  Downing Street against these flagrant attempts by the British Government to close off remaining routes to truth and justice. Victims and families deserve respect and to be consulted because the only proper way to a reconciled future is to listen, understand, and engage with those our troubled past has affected most. WE ARE SECOND CLASS The British Government proposals create separate classes of cases. People across Derry will be subject to the rule of law, to criminal investigation for wrongdoing. You and me and our families and friends. But another group of people will receive special treatment because of the unorm they wore. They will not be subject to the rule of law. We will be second class citizens. In this great city, the frontline of democratic resistance to being treated as second-class, now in  it is alive and well. In addition,murder by the British Army, a state force or paramilitary happened in Newcastle, London or any other city in Britain, these proposals wouldnt even be entertained by the British government of the day, never mind being railroaded through against the wishes of those whom it will affect. WAITING As the MP for Foyle, I have raised the cases of Paul Whitters, Julie Livingstone and Paul Quinn with Boris Johnson and have called out his government at every turn when they act in bad faith on legacy. Last November, I called for a public inquiry into the murder of solicitor Pat Finucane and challenged the s that successive British Governments have gone to in an attempt to deny justice to his family including having to pursue accountability through interminable court proceedings. And still the Finucane wait and still so many other families wait for justice, truth and accountability. FOUNDATION STONE Parties here, along with Irish and British administrations, negotiated the legacy proposals contained within the Stormont House Agreement, including establishing the Historical Investigations Unit. While the SDLP wanted legacy processes to be more rigorous with more powers to get to the truth, Stormont House was the agreement. It remains the foundation stone. Nowyou wore a maroon beret or a balaclava, the Tories an others are looking the other way on your crime for political expediency. TOGETHER We have now reached a critical juncture in how we choose to stand up for victims and their families as well as truth, justice, and accountability for all. The SDLP will never allow the British government to trample over internationally recognised agreements, and more importantly, the rights and wishes of victims and families to pursue truth and justice. Victims and their families will continue their long march against unfair legacy proposals, and we will be with them every step of the way.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeUrsula Bernadette Doherty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry hospitals Emergency Department very busy with over  people waiting overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tony Doherty, chairpersoDerry NewsBloody Sunday th anniversary programme of events unveiled overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSoftware engineer ran from police covered in mud after crashing through hedge overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Six-year-old, Ava, donates  inches of hair in charity fundraiserDerry NewsSix-year-old, Ava, donates  inches of hair in charity fundraiser overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ieADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeUrsula Bernadette Doherty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry hospitals Emergency Department very busy with over  people waiting overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tony Doherty, chairpersoDerry NewsBloody Sunday th anniversary programme of events unveiled overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSoftware engineer ran from police covered in mud after crashing through hedge overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Six-year-old, Ava, donates  inches of hair in charity fundraiserDerry NewsSix-year-old, Ava, donates  inches of hair in charity fundraiser overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

In addition to pre-loved quality toys, the charity is also keen to receive donations of unused toys and games, which often prove popular in the run up to Christmas when customers are looking for presents at reasonable prices. Unused toiletries that can be used as gts for teenagers are also popular in Barnardo’s shops, as well as the usual clothing and accessory donations that the charity welcomes all year round. Paula Flood, Area Business Manager for Barnardo’s Retail in Northern Ireland said: “With preparations for Christmas getting underway, this is the time of year many people need to make space for new toys and gts, so we are asking them to keep Barnardo’s in mind and donate any of their good quality pre-loved toys, or clothes, to our charity’s shops. “It’s amazing what people unearth when they start looking in the back of cupboards and at the bottom of the toybox. “It’s a great way to clear out any toys or clothes your children and grandchildren no longer play with or wear, as well as any pre-loved clothes you are not wearing. We’re particularly keen to receive any ‘winter woolly’ type items that we can sell over the coming months. “The donated items will help to raise funds for work carried out to support local children and families who need a little bit of extra help. “We’d like to thank all of our customers and donors for their continued support, which really does make a dference to so many local children’s lives.” Any donations will be received at your local Barnardo’s store at their branches in Shipquay Street and Bishops Street, Derry.ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"console.log..detachTo ..detachTo ..detachTo  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this archived article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT --createDefaultAd --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Saturday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  HomeUrsula Bernadette Doherty overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Derry NewsDerry hospitals Emergency Department very busy with over  people waiting overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Sunday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Tony Doherty, chairpersoDerry NewsBloody Sunday th anniversary programme of events unveiled overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  DeathsDerry Death Notices - Friday, th November,  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Local NewsSoftware engineer ran from police covered in mud after crashing through hedge overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Six-year-old, Ava, donates  inches of hair in charity fundraiserDerry NewsSix-year-old, Ava, donates  inches of hair in charity fundraiser overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. --googletag.cmd.pushMultimedia \" title\"Throwback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Thursday: Revellers Out  About at Derrys Sugar Nightclub  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent. \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .jpg--.jpg \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ Dormans Magherafelt  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId .parent.

Available exclusively in Attitude Black paintwork, the new Sport Black Edition brings a distinctive sporty look to Toyota’s fth-generation RAV, and is available in front-wheel-driveguise only.     However, for buyers looking for the added security of an all-wheel-drivedrivetrain in their new RAV, there is the option of AWD in Sol, Sport and Platinum iants, while the entry-level Luna model is FWD only.Petrol Electric PowertrainLike every iant in the RAV range, the Sport Black Edition is powered by a .-litre four-cylinder petrol-electric hybrid powertrain, which produces bhp and Nm of torque and enables the five-seat family SUV to sprint from -km h in just over  seconds. Standard across the entire RAV range is a suite of safety features which offer maximum protection for all occupants, while providing the RAV driver with the latest technology in driver assistance systems.     Collectively called Toyota Safety Sense  , features include Pre-Collision Assistance , Speed Assistance , Lane Keepingand Automatic High Beam Assist.Gracious Exterior, Spacious InteriorThe exterior design of the new RAV is more appealing and less anonymous that its predecessor, and this is gained by way of boxy wheel arches, a squared-off nose with a large grille, and angular edges and creases in the bodywork. I feel that Toyota has done a great job of making the new RAV look and feel more ‘premium’ than ever, while also offering more interior space than any of its predecessors.Cabin quality is exceptional, with sturdy and durable materials used throughout, while overall passenger space is generous in every respect. This has been made possible by placing the front and rear axles mm further apart than before, and even tall adults will be able to sit in the rear seats comfortably, with plenty of legroom and headroom on offer.The RAV’s battery is located under the floor, but its boxy dimensions help to hide it well, with a slightly higher boot floor the only clue to what lies beneath.Compared to its predecessor, the RAV’s boot capacity has grown to -litres , with a massive ,-litres available when the rear seats are folded down.The RAV was awarded a full five stars by Euro NCAP in  and that was thanks in part to an upgrade to the second-generation of Toyota Safety Sense for the latest model.Test CarMy test car was a RAV Sport Black Edition which drew lots of admiring glances due to its terric road presence and distinctive design details.An impressive array of standard equipment includes TEX leather black upholstery with heated front seats, powered driver seat, auto-dimming interior mirror, front and rear parking sensors, rear view camera, auto lights and wipers, LED front light guide with daytime running lights, LED projector headlights, electrically operated boot door, ” Toyota Touch multimedia system, dual zone climate control, rear privacy glass, satellite navigation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, black headliner cloth, paddle sht, light blue ambient lighting, and illuminated entry along with many more comfort, convenience, safety and infotainment features.As is the case across all models in the RAV line-up, fuel consumption as low as .l km is achievable on a WLTP combined driving cycle, while Co emissions of between  and g kmensures low annual road tax in addition to low overall running costs.Toyota’s advanced hybrid technology ensures that the RAV’s petrol engine and electric motor combine seamlessly to deliver extra performance and outstanding fuel efficiency, while remaining ultra-smooth and extremely quiet when driving in electric mode.Toyota claim that up to % of the time you drive a Toyota Hybrid, you are in electric mode, with the added advantage that you never have to plug the car in to charge the battery.Toyota’s self-charging hybrid harvests the energy normally lost from deceleration and braking into a small battery. This unit doesn’t have enough capacity to propel the RAV alone for any considerable distance, but it does offer the convenience of being able to charge itself without any input from the driver.The RAV sits on Toyota’s New Global Architecture, which is also used in the Toyota Prius, C-HR and Corolla models. It brings big benefits in ride and handling, with more sophisticated suspension than the old model, so the RAV is capable of turning into corners with a surprising amount of poise and precision, with plenty of grip while resisting dramatic levels of body lean.The RAV’s CVTtransmission is smooth and slick in its operation, while a well-insulated cabin ensures that on-road refinement is top class. When travelling through towns and cities at low speed, the RAV’s electric motor is barely audible, with the engine shutting off entirely when stationary in traffic. At motorway cruising speeds, the RAV settles into a quiet hum, with only small amounts of tyre and wind noise getting through to the cabin.Verdict, Cost and WarrantyWith its unique and distinctive modern styling, faultless build quality, impressive tally of standard equipment and frugal petrol electric hybrid technology, the new RAV has all the necessary ingredients to comfortably fulfil the needs of a growing family.The new RAV Sport Black Edition represents great value. The new Toyota RAV is backed by a three-year ,km warranty, along with a five-year ,km warranty on hybrid components.Additionally, a hybrid battery warranty of up to an incredible -years is available upon completing an annual hybrid health check through Toyota’s nationwide dealer network.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.     Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.     The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.

Based on the A-Class of the time, Mercedes-Benz gave its smallest model some SUV flavour with clever body cladding and a raised ride height.     More SUV-Like Than EverLaunched in , the second-generation GLA also shares its DNA with the latest A-Class, but it gained a more traditional SUV shape. Standing cm taller than its predecessor, the new GLA’s wheel arches are more squared-off in shape and are clad in protective black plastic. Its wheelbase has also been increased to create more passenger space, while the wheels are pushed out to each corner, resulting in much shorter front and rear overhangs.     Pitched directly against rivals like the BMW X and Volvo XC hybrids, the new GLA  e uses the same powertrain as the plug-in A-Class— a .-litre petrol engine and bhp electric motor, drawing power from a .kWh battery. The fuel tank in the GLA  e is located ahead of the car’s front axle, which leaves space under the boot to fit the hybrid battery. Importantly, this means that the GLA avoids the awkward box-shaped intrusion into the boot area seen in some plug-in hybrid cars.Specication DetailsThe new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is available in a choice of two generously-equipped specication levels — Progressive and AMG Line — both of which come with standard features such as stylish five-twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, parking sensors with reversing camera, LED high performance headlamps, Light and Sight package, hard-disc navigation, MBUX multimedia system, digital radio, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Seat Comfort package with heated front seats, automatic climate control, roof liner in black fabric, Mercedes-Benz emergency call system, galvanised steering-wheel gearsht paddles, Easy-Pack tailgate, Dynamic Select, acoustic ambient protection, Active Lane Keep Assist, and Speed Limit Assist, along with many more comfort, convenience and security features.Additional AMG Line specication includes lowered comfort suspension, AMG body styling, carbon-structure trim, ” AMG -twin-spoke light-alloy wheels, Artico leather Dinamica microfibre black upholstery, and AMG floor mats.Test CarMy GLA  e ‘Progressive’ test car was finished in Night Black paintwith contrasting Macchiato Beige Black Artico leather upholsteryfor maximum impact.With a % battery charge, my test car estimated its own electric range to be km’s. The car defaults to Hybrid mode when started up, so you proceed in zero-emission fashion at speeds of up to km h, as long as the battery has charge and you accelerate gently.When the petrol engine cuts in performance is strong, as it and the electric motor combine their power in a smooth and orderly fashion. With a combined power output of bhp and a mighty Nm of torque, the GLA  e can sprint from -km h in as little as . seconds, and can achieve a top speed of km h .The petrol engine only really makes its presence known when you ask for more performance, while neat handling and sufficient grip from the driven front wheels provides great confidence on the road. The car’s steering is light but direct, and the ride is more than comfortable enough to deal with rutted road surfaces and speed ramps with ease.Cabin space is impressive, with excellent head, leg and elbow room available for all occupants, while a -litre boot capacity will be more than adequate for most families. However, the GLA’s standard split-folding rear seat backs allow for the transportation of larger items when called upon, with up to ,-litres of space on offer in this mode.The cabin of the new GLA certainly feels vastly improved over the original GLA in every respect. This has been made possible by the latest Mercedes-Benz MBUX interior layout, with crisp digital displays replacing the analogue instrument dials and flowing across onto the dashboard.Buttons have been largely replaced by a controller ahead of the gear-lever and voice control, which uses articial intelligence similar to that found in home smart devices to recognise more natural speech and commands. The turbine air vents from the original GLA have been retained, but the dashboard has been slimmed-down for a more spacious feel.VerdictOverall, the new Mercedes-Benz GLA  e is a competent all-rounder that offers a decent electric range, low emissions, predictable handling and a luxurious, technology-filled cabin — encased in a stylish and practical premium compact SUV body.

On Saturday night, Derry once again flocked to enjoy a night of the Undertones – but this time it wasn’t just their music - but their big screen debut that was getting the masses excited. The legendary band and their family, friends, and fans gathered to indulge in a celebration of their musical careers in the premier of a fitting tribute documentary, featuring the man who made it all possible – DJ John Peel. The documentary, produced by local man Vinnie Cunningham and directed by Tom Collins, traces the band right back to their first performances in school halls, when the lads had barely swapped their nappy rash for pimples.  Dr. Sid Dempsey, third from right, Head Consultant, Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children with members of the Undertones, Billy Doherty, John and Damien ONeill. Also included are Manus and Majella Martin.  The youngsters from Derry, who supported the Clash on their tour of America, never really appreciated how good they actually were, revealed Damien O’Neill - just one of the frank admissions that litter the documentary. The film is liberally interspersed with old video footage of the band as they bopped from the legendary Casbah to Top of the Pops - and features all the greats from ‘Teenage Kicks’ to ‘My Perfect Cousin’ to ‘It’s Going To Happen’. The fundamental ision between Feargal Sharkey and the rest of the Undertones is very apparent, although John O’Neill maintains that there is no real animosity against the singer who eventually caused the band to split. “The way we see it, he was one of our school friends and we eventually drted apart, the same thing that happens to everyone at some stage,” he said. “We really have no bad feelings towards him.” The banter throughout the showing had the audience in fits of laughter as the boys admitted some of their more embarrassing moments, and some revelations came courtesy of others. Caroline O’Neill certainly dropped husband John in it when she let slip that he had dumped her in the hope that fame and fortune would drive the chicks wild. “He’s going to kill me for saying this,” she said. “But he arrived two days later banging on my door and begging me to take him back.” Not so good-natured abuse The laughs were balanced by some more disturbing highlights of the lestyle that saw the boys also abused and often attacked because of their good fortune. “There were nights when we came out of the Casbah and had to leg it up the street,” admits Damien O’Neill. And Feargal Sharkey spoke of the animosity towards them when they were at home: “It was terrible having to face friends in Derry. You couldn’t buy people a drink or wear fashionable clothes because people thought you were being flash.” The Strand Multiplex was packed full of Derry people who have supported the lads over the last  years, and enjoyed reliving the highs and the lows with them all over again. Paul McCloone who now has the job of filling Feargal’s shoes described the documentary as “brilliant, really enjoyable”. John O’Neill, meanwhile, was about as enthusiastic as John gets: “I think it’s great. The most important thing is that the humour really comes across, and the sense that we were just five ordinary guys that managed to make it big.” The screening was held in aid of the N. Ireland Cancer Unit, and donations on the night, along with the money offered instead of an after show buffet, came to over pound. Manus Martin who lost his own son Anthony to cancer last year expressed his deepest thanks to all involved, particularly Vinnie Cunningham and Tony Collins. Two versions of the film have been compiled and the BBC will broadcast the -minute ‘short version’ by Perfect Cousin Productions Ltd, in association with the BBC, Arts Council and Irish Film Board.

After continuing with his le, as best he could, he collapsed last year in his garden with back and leg pain.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment.

Pic by George Sweeney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Nov Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Derry City  Sligo Rovers  googletag.cmd.push  Jamie McGonigle downed Sligo Rovers with two fantastic goals as Derry City comfortably won their last home game of the season. The striker struck either side of half time, with quality finishes to add to keep City’s hopesEuropean qualication alive ahead of the final game at Dundalk.  A peach of a finish from the striker gave City the lead on  minutes. The goal was reward for a positive start from the home side as Joe Thomson set up McGonigle, wh sent a superb left-footed volley past Richard Brush and into the net to make it -. Liam Buckley could not have been happy with his team at all in a one-sided first half, but his mood almost improved when Sligo created their first chance on  minutes, Mark Byrne breaking into the Derry penalty area, but his low effort was parried by Nathan Gartside who stopped the shot with a strong right hand. Gartside came to Derry’s rescue with an even better save five minutes later. Sligo were pushing hard for an equaliser before half time and they very nearly got it when Walter Figueira’s corner found the run of Garry Buckley at the back post, but the defender’s downward header was brilliantly stopped by the City goalkeeper. For all that Sligo pressure, it should have been - Derry City at the break, as McGonigle was able to race completely free through on goal. The striker showed tremendous poise as he dinked the ball over the oncoming Brush, but Lewis Bank was there to stop the ball on the line, much to the disbelief of the City fans. Lewis Banks then performed more heroics at the other end when Brush was caught in no man’s land trying to challenge Akintunde in the air before McGonigle rounded him and got away a strike that was denied on the line by the right back. Derry eventually doubled their lead in sensational fashion on  minutes. Will Fitzgerald ran at the Sligo defence and crossed the ball, only for Garry Buckley to head it away. The ball fell out of the sky straight onto the foot of McGonigle who lashed it powerfully beyond Brush and onto the top corner for -.

Pic by George Sweeney, nwpresspicsReporter: Gary Ferry Nov Email: gary@derrynews.net  addthis, Derry City  Sligo Rovers  googletag.cmd.push  Jamie McGonigle downed Sligo Rovers with two fantastic goals as Derry City comfortably won their last home game of the season. The striker struck either side of half time, with quality finishes to add to keep City’s hopesEuropean qualication alive ahead of the final game at Dundalk.  A peach of a finish from the striker gave City the lead on  minutes. The goal was reward for a positive start from the home side as Joe Thomson set up McGonigle, wh sent a superb left-footed volley past Richard Brush and into the net to make it -. Liam Buckley could not have been happy with his team at all in a one-sided first half, but his mood almost improved when Sligo created their first chance on  minutes, Mark Byrne breaking into the Derry penalty area, but his low effort was parried by Nathan Gartside who stopped the shot with a strong right hand. Gartside came to Derry’s rescue with an even better save five minutes later. Sligo were pushing hard for an equaliser before half time and they very nearly got it when Walter Figueira’s corner found the run of Garry Buckley at the back post, but the defender’s downward header was brilliantly stopped by the City goalkeeper. For all that Sligo pressure, it should have been - Derry City at the break, as McGonigle was able to race completely free through on goal. The striker showed tremendous poise as he dinked the ball over the oncoming Brush, but Lewis Bank was there to stop the ball on the line, much to the disbelief of the City fans. Lewis Banks then performed more heroics at the other end when Brush was caught in no man’s land trying to challenge Akintunde in the air before McGonigle rounded him and got away a strike that was denied on the line by the right back. Derry eventually doubled their lead in sensational fashion on  minutes. Will Fitzgerald ran at the Sligo defence and crossed the ball, only for Garry Buckley to head it away. The ball fell out of the sky straight onto the foot of McGonigle who lashed it powerfully beyond Brush and onto the top corner for -.  Teams Derry City: Gartside, Boyce, Toal, Coll, Lafferty Harkin, Thomson, FitzgeraldMcGonigle, Akintunde , Ogedi-Uzokwe.

There hasn’t been enough gigs this past year to have a best live act, how they arrived at a conclusion last year is strange but then I may be misinformed. There’s obviously no new bands to speak of so it’s just the two awards this year. I suppose it’s as close to democracy as we can get, but as with everything in the parish, the archaic powers that be hold way too much influence and are too stuck in the past. I’m the guiltiest and have no real business having a say and will keep my opinions to myself from now on. Well after I say that to my ears Andrew McGibbon’s Northern Gothic and Verse Chorus Verse’s What If We Won are the best albums on that list to me and Waldorf  Cannon’s We Are Your Government is the best single. I think we should all sit back and appreciate that Hannah Peel’s Fir Wave was recently up for the Mercury Music Prize kiss of death, sadly not winning butit was two out of two losses an outsider would be thinking that there is something really weird going on within the chambers of power up at the Oh Yeah Centre. I named the  nominators to remind myself that my taste really isn’t that important, and I should read my above statement about keeping my opinions to myself. Waiting for things to change in the parish is just something we are great at here. What next, I hear you ask, well there is a group that meets around a table and weighs up the options for the best albums, I’d like to think they do this in a fair manner and once they reach a consensus then the world, who will undoubtedly be waiting with bated breath, will get their answer The same is not true for the single, that is voted for by the public, you, and that’s why those bands were urging you to vote recently. The public vote is now closed so I suppose they know who’s won it by now but they’re not letting on. Rascals.

Miami Vice: Saturday, TCM @ pm Michael Manns stylish and action packed update of the famous s TV show about cops taking on drug dealers. Bristling with testosterone, its a moody grown up thriller full of suspense, action and neo-nazis getting shot in the face. Whats not to like about that  Colin Farrell  Jamie Foxx are solid as the leads but Naomie Harris steals the film with one small scene in a mobile home. The soundtrack is wicked too. Portrait Of A Lady On Fire: Saturday, BBC @ pm In Brittany at the end of the th century a painter called Marianne is commissioned to paint a portrait of a woman calledHeacuteloiumlse who is due to be married off to an Italian nobleman. A marriage she wants no part of. Do you fancy a romance that will both uplt you and leave you in absolute shreds  Well here you go. Magnicent turns from Noeacutemie Merlant and Adegravele Haenel carry a sublime story. Rain Man: Saturday, TG @ .pm Charlies father has died and left his fortune to an autistic brother he never realised he had. To get the money him and his brother tear off on a road trip where he finds out about both his sibling and himself. Aspects of Rain Man have dated these days but its still a lovely story of discovery and reunion buoyed by a couple of memorable performances from Dustin Hoffman and Tom Cruise. Pawn Sacrice: Sunday, BBC One @ .am  Bobby Fischer vs Boris Spassky. . The chess game to end all chess games. Two grandmasters. West vs East. Some said it was only a game but in a time of cold war its also something far more important than that. Tobey Maguire does fine work as the tragic lead of a well crafted film riddled with paranoia and suspense while Liev Schrieber uses his trademark brooding to intense effect. Walk Like A Panther: Sunday, Channel  @ .am  Their local pub is closing and the only way to make money is toto the lycra and capes. But these folks arent superheroes, nope, they are s wrestlers and aching hips and shoulders arent going to stop them. An entertaining slice of fluff and whimsy from  that will make you feel nostalgic for Saturday morning television. Stephen Graham, Sue Johnston, Robbie Gee and Julian Sands are among the familiar faces having fun. Ladyhawke: Sunday, Talking Pictures TV @ .pm Nare and Isabeau are in love but they have a wee problem. There was a curse placed on them making him a wolf during the night and her a hawk during the day ensuring they can never be together. The only person who can help is a thief called Gaston. Richard Donners  fairytale is a likable, well made, glorious looking romantic escapade. Michelle Pfefer and Rutger Hauer play the lost lovers and Matthew Broderick has a good time as their only hope. St Vincent: Sunday, Film @ .pm After an incident with his next door neighbour a grumpy old Vietnam vet begins to babysit her bullied son and soon they begin to see the best in each other. A funny, bittersweet comedy that will make you laugh and upset you in equal measures. Bill Murray in the lead is better than hes been in years and Melissa McCarthy as his neighbour does well in a role thats a lot more dramatic than her usual parts. Bridge to Terabithia: Monday, Great! Films @ .pm Jesse and Leslie become fast friends when she moves in next door to him. Soon their childhood imaginations are running riot and the kingdom of Terabithia is created. Real le is sadly never far away though. A little beaut of a movie, one full of lessons about le, both the lovely and tragic sides of it. Anna Sophia Robb and Josh Hutcherson are both amiable leads. Be warned, this could might will make you cry. Doubt: Monday, TG @ .pm A well liked priest is accused of child abuse. But did he do it  Thats the crux of the tale in an excellent adaption of the famous Broadway play. Philip Seymour Hoffmanis the priest in question and Meryl Streep is the nun investigating him. We get immense performances from both. The subject matter might be hard to take but its compelling and gripping stuff that will stay in your head for days after. Dog Soldiers: Monday, Film @ . A group of soldiers on routine training in the Scottish highlands find themselves under siege from a pack of beasts that should not exist. Neil Marshalls debut film is awesome. Hilarious, horric, quotable, disgusting and damn scary. A rare horror comedy that gets its blend just right. All this and we get a wicked cast too with Sean Pertwee, Kevin McKidd, Liam Cunningham and Darren Morfitt whos just deadly as Spoon. All The Kings Men: Tuesday, Great! Movies Action @ .am Wille Stark. A real salt of the earth fellow. Liked by all. Well...... Hes a politician, a self taught kind of guy. Hes a decent man, at least he was once, back when he hadnt sold his soul. A deserved Best Picture winner back in , this portrait of the rise and fall of a famous face mixes politics and noir to brilliant effect.Broderick Crawfordand Merceded McCambridge both put in first rate performances. Journeys End: Wednesday, BBC Two @ .pm France. . The trenches of Aisne. A young soldier called Raleigh once who once believed in the importance of war sits surrounded by his comrades in a filthy, rat infested trench as the German army only metres away get ready to attack their front lines. A powerful watch that shows us bullets make no distinctions when it comes to class and social status. Asa Butterfield, Paul Bettany and Sam Clafin do strong work. Nebraska: Thursday, Film @ .am A father and son called Woody and David are taking a trip from Montana to Nebraska to claim a prize. Woody is slowly losing his memory to dementia and David is dragged into the mess. Alexander Paynes comedy drama is a beautully written and crafted look at the complexities of family relationships. Plus it has a couple of wicked belly laughs hidden away. Bruce Dern, Will Forte and especially June Squibb are all on fire. Paths Of Glory: Thursday, BBC @ .pm The men of B-company refuse to make a suicidal run at a German hill during World War . Their general is embarrassed by his perceived failure and sets out to make someone pay. Stanley Kubricks masterful anti war film is an enraging watch, one that shows the toll military le can have on humanity even when the fighting is over. Kirk Douglas as Colonel Dax has never been better while George Macready as General Mireau will make you despair. Sam Whiskey: Friday, TG @ .pm Her husband is dead and Laura has a problem. The gold he stole is sitting in a boat at the bottom of the Colorado river and she needs someone to find it andit to its rightful place. Unfortunately she hires the rogue Sam Whiskey for the job. A charming. amiable western is just what you need for a Friday evening and this one led by Burt Reynolds and Angie Dickinson is just the ticket. Youll instantly guess how its going to end but it will keep you smiling throughout. American Mary: Friday, The Horror Channel @ .pm A broke medical student discovers an unusual way to make extra money and finds herself in some very very dark places as a result. This  dark drama horror film starring Katherine Isabelle is a highly effective piece of work. Be warned though, it should probably only be watched by those with a strong constitution butyou can go with it you discover a unique little story that will open your eyes to a whole other world. The Belly Of The Whale: Friday, RTEacute One @ .pm Joe and Ronald. Two loners in a miserable, run down seaside town in Donegal. One has come home after a long time and the other is already there scratching out a miserable existence. They come together with a plan but theres someone venal in their way. A dark dark dark Irish comedy from  that went under the radar at the time but its still worth your time. Michael Smiley, Peter Coonan and Pat Shortt do nice work as three men youd cross four fields to avoid.

The area will also be power washed.Just over pound, is to be spent on other planting and landscaping schemes in the Church Street area, while there are also proposals for a new bus stop and power washing the area outside the former telephone exchange.New safety railings are to be installed outside  Church Street, while a mural will be painted on one of the gable walls at the entrance to the car park at this part of the town.There are also plans to invest pound, on new interpretation material highlighting the Tower Bell at Down Parish Church and the grave of United Irishman Thomas Russell in the church grounds.Plans have also been outlined to provide new festive lighting on the side of the Down Arts Centre and on trees in De Courcey Place.The draft plan confirms a proposal to appoint a quantity surveyor to oversee the substantial investment with hopes that the work can start as soon as the document secures approval from the steering group.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has welcomed the opportunity business and property owners are being given to revitalise what he described as a key part of the town.ldquoThe proposed Church Street investment is welcome news in a part of the town where there are a number of family-owned businesses whose links with Downpatrick stretch back over several generations, he said.ldquoThe draft plan provides a vision for the future and business owners welcome the signicant investment which will considerably help Church Street which has missed out on funding for some considerable time.Cllr Curran said the revitalisation scheme provided a firm  on which to build for the future and he hoped that business and property owners will be encouraged to spend some of their own money on their respective properties to make them even better.He is also keen to see progress on the Irish Street scheme which has not made the progress many would have hoped by this stage.Cllr Curran added: ldquoRedeveloping the former police base site and neighbouring properties will be a game-changer and act as a catalyst to secure more investment, increasing footfall which will benefit existing traders.ldquoDownpatrick is a county town and its status warrants not only a vibrant retail hub, but a place where all buildings look smart and welcoming.ldquoSignicant sums of money have been invested in other town centre streets and I am delighted that it is now Church Streetrsquos turn to benefit from some much-needed, but very welcome investment..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10November2021_aughlisnafin.jpg","title":"Aughlisnafin make history  ","story":"AUGHLISNAFIN were crowned junior champions for the first time in their  year history after a pulsating contest with Dundrum concluded in a three-point victory at Pairc Esler on Friday night.Despite a commendable second half surge from John Clarkersquos Dundrum men, the lsquoFin showed their experience in the competition and managed to cling on to achieve intermediate status for next yearrsquos campaign.Dundrum began on the offence straight from the start, winning the throw-in and immediately attacking the opposition.This set the tone for what would be a highly paced and energetic contest, as Aughlisnafinrsquos Oran Flanagan fouled Dundrumrsquos Michael McGrattan for a free within the opening minute.However, what should have been a straight forward conversion was missed by Cormac Venney.Breannain McComiskey immediately made Venney rue his miss, as the Aughlisnafin man kicked over the bar following good build-up play from Shea Croskery for the opening score of the final.The lsquoFin kept their foot on the pedal and won the following kick-out, with Flanagan making up for his earlier foul to convert a point from play.Referee Conor Curran was kept busy throughout the game and first brandished his yellow card just four minutes in to Aughlisnafinrsquos Noel Travers after a sloppy high tackle.Following patient build up play, Croskery added his sidersquos third point of the game, with Dundrum now desperate to get on the board.It was clear nerves were playing a part in the early stages, as Venney failed to convert another free wide, this time dragging his shot right of the posts.With Aughlisnafin piling the pressure on the Dundrum defence the ball was worked back to lsquokeeper Walsh who played a fist pass out to team-mate Thomas McShane  metres from goal.However, disaster struck as the Dundrum man fumbled the ball in the danger area, allowing Flanagan to pick up the scraps and bury the ball into the back of the net to give The lsquoFin a six point lead less than ten minutes in.Michael McGrattan tried to answer for Dundrum but saw his effort drt wide before custodian Walsh finally got his side off the mark with a converted free.McComiskey replied sharply, notching his second point by kicking over the black spot from open play, although Venney did answer this with a point of his own that he desperately needed just before the water-break.At the conclusion of the opening quarter, Aughlisnafin were by far the dominant side and led - to -.On the restart Dundrum managed to find their groove and make up for earlier mistakes courtesy of successive points from Venney and McGrattan.However, Aughlisnafin would soon hit their opponents with a damaging blow as Tiernan Noadersquos high ball over the top found lsquoFin forward Adam Garland, who converted his sweetly struck shot into the top left corner for the second goal of the game after  minutes.Noade won a turnover from the resultant kick-out, but saw his effort sail wide before McGrattan replied with a point for Dundrum after winning an inidual battle with Aughlisnafin defender Sean Fitzsimmons.The contest was beginning to ebb and flow with both sets of supporters making their voices heard, as Garland dummied his man, but missed the target.Despite Noade pulling his shot wide a minute later, Aughlisnafinrsquos high balls over the top were clearly causing Dundrum all sorts of bother as their defence struggled to maintain the pressing forward line.Garland kicked over a free to give his side a - score line as Dundrum prepared to introduce substitute Odhran McKibbin to the pitch.Perhaps overeager to impress, McKibbin received a yellow card immediately following a late tackle, as referee Curran continued to show efficient officiating beyond his years.Soon after, McComiskey registered his third point of the match, but once again, Dundrum showed why they made it to the final.After overturning the ball in midfield, the ball worked its way to Dundrum captain Aidan Fegan, who played a lovely pass over the top to McGrattan.The forward found himself in acres of space and struck the ball with conviction past lsquoFin lsquokeeper Morgan Croskery and into the net.Garland replied with a free just before half time as the score read Aughlisnafin - Dundrum -.The lsquoFin began the quicker following the restart after a McComiskey lsquorsquo floated into Garland, who pointed over for the first score of the half.A series of wides took up the next five minutes of the game before McComiskey became the latest player to enter Conor Curranrsquos book, receiving a yellow for a high tackle.Travers then pulled his effort wide before his side won the resultant kick-out and forced a fantastic save from Dundrumrsquos Walsh, who stopped a certain goal.Walsh found himself at the opposite end of the pitch a minute later to kick over a fantastic free, which spurred team-mate Venney on to convert one himself in the following passage of play.This was Venneyrsquos third time raising the white flag and the last notable piece of action before the second water-break as Dundrum trailed by four.The last quarter was nothing short of dramatic, as both sets of players were clearly beginning to fatigue and yet still managed to throw everything at eachother.Dundrum really set the scene for a nail-biting last  minutes when they passed the ball neatly from one end of the pitch to the other before skipper Fegan found David McComiskey with only lsquokeeper Croskery to beat.Dundrumrsquos McComiskey duly converted make it a one-point game and now the atmosphere was beginning to reach fever pitch.John Hurley saw his chance sail wide for Dundrum before Garland kicked over a free to double his sidersquos lead.McGrattan continued to battle, winning a free out of nothing, before Walsh stepped up to send the ball over the bar.Shea Croskery received a yellow card in between two wide balls from Dundrum, as they resulted to kicking from range in the final five minutes.Walsh was forced to make another eye-catching save, this time preventing substitute Ruairi Croskery from converting.Garland managed to kick over a point a minute later to add to his impressive personal tally before Flanagan saw his long range effort split the posts to give Aughlisnafin a comfortable three point margin.With just seconds on the clock, Dundrum knew it was now or never and with the last free of the night attempted a short pass to allow an opportunity for a strike on goal.However, Shea Croskery was on hand to block the shot as Curranrsquos whistle sounded for the final time to signal it would be Dolen Croskeryrsquos men who would lt the trophy.Aughlisnafin: M Croskery J Matthews, S Fitzsimmons, S Willoughby O OrsquoToole, B McComiskey , N Travers D Steele , O FlanaganS

Undeterred he dug in and made his way through the small pack and was barely in his stride when he realised that it was time to sprint for the finish line.He couldnrsquot believe his luck when he was then handed a medal for second boy. Talk about a whirlwind experience - maybe the lack of time to consider what lay ahead was a good thing.Even though he had no time to greet them at the start, he was able to congratulate the two other EDAC runners at the end.Amelia Spick was taking on her first cross country ever and seemed to enjoy the race. Her new spikes are now duly christened and hopefully she willfor another shot at this discipline.She ran an even pace as advised and finished sixth girl and ninth overall. Ky Murray was two places behind and closing in the latter stages.Her lightning sprint brought her within five seconds of Amelia and she was placed eighth girl overall.The juniors then took on the role of supporters, cheering on the adults which was much appreciated encouragement. It is this element of whole club camaraderie that makes cross country so special.Further afield then were the Robinson brothers who had travelled to Stranorlar in Donegal for the NI and Ulster XC Championships .Despite some rain early on in Ballyclare, the athletes raced in dry, almost sunny conditions and there was very little mud to slow them down, but Oliver and Alex were not so lucky.The rain the night before made the course very boggy and although the rainbows on the day suggested it might clear, this was just a tease. Even during the dry spells the biting wind made conditions tough for the runners.Alex was first up running a distance of two kilometres in the U- race. He started safely and quickly became part of the leading pack on the course two loops around two fields.On the second lap he led the breakaway pack and looked comfortable as they disappeared into the second field.When he emerged he had ped to fth and was running with just one shoe having lost the other in the deep mud. The last m metres were heroic as he battled to hold his place only being overtaken in the last m.He was so disappointed with the outcome and on reflection said he should have ditched his shoe sooner instead of losing speed trying to keep it on.A hard lesson to learn but Alex showed his grit and has been rewarded with selection as an inidual into the U- Ulster and NI team for the All-Irelands in Gowran, Kilkenny at the start of December.He was placed sixth out of  runners in a time of ., only  seconds behind the winner. The wayward shoe was retrieved from the mud later.His brother Ollie was in two minds whether to run at all. He was nursing an injury acquired at rugby but he showed commitment by putting his vest on to line up for the U- four-and-a-half kilometre race.He knew he wasnrsquot at his best but didnrsquot want to withdraw without giving it a shot. He went out steadily, wisely treating it as a training run, but still finishing rd out of the field of  runners.When the times are analysed he may well end up at the All-Irelands as part of the county team. Either way, he did the club proud and both boys are to be congratulated on their efforts..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10November2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Make the Call helps families with £5m aid  ","story":"NEW figures have revealed that over , people across the Newry Mourne and Down area claimed almost poundm in unclaimed benefits last year.The cash was paid under the lsquomake the callrsquo scheme spearheaded by the Department for Communities.The government department said figures for the last financial year reveal that people who used the service became pound better off per week on average, with almost , accessing almost poundm in unclaimed benefits province-wide.The lsquomake the callrsquo service supports people in accessing benefits, services and supports to which they are entitled, but have not been claiming.A total of  people in Newry Mourne and Down claimed pound,, last year.Stormont communities minister, Deirdre Hargey, said her departmentrsquos scheme has helped people who lsquomade the callrsquo become, on average, pound. better off per week.ldquoDuring  , we received over  referrals from our partner organisations which helped ensure people are receiving their full entitlement to benefits, supports and services that can make a real dference to their lives, she explained.ldquoOften people donrsquot realise there is support out there to assist them during dficult times.

Enough is enough, it is time to see these projects delivered to improve the lives of local workers and families.With the approach of winter and worsening road conditions due to weather and darker evenings, Cllr Mason said visibility will become poorer.ldquoWe need to see urgent action from the Minister to address the concerns of the local community to ensure our roads are safe and up to satisfactory standard before winter hits, she contended.ldquoWinter gritting is a huge cause for concern for many in our local rural communities and the Minister needs to deliver a more effective solution to winter gritting on our rural roads with priority for those in more isolated areas who fear another winter stuck in their homes, the councillor continued.ldquoMany farmers who rely on milk collection lorries arriving daily and accessing feed supplies for their animals, need the certainty that their services and routine will not be disrupted. Those who work as frontline staff such as the emergency services and domiciliary care workers must have a safe passage to and from peoplersquos homes, while childcare services and rural schools must be able to operate smoothly.ldquoWe cannot allow ordinary people to suffer and a management plan must be implemented to ensure gritting is carried out throughout the winter period, she added, confirming that she has written to Mrs Mallon to raise her concerns.A DfI spokesman said Mrs Mallon ldquocompletely rejects these unfounded assertions and will continue to work equitably across all council areas, including South Down, to improve the condition of the road network.ldquoThe Minister is fully aware of the condition of roads in South Down and will continue to work for all communities to deliver the infrastructure they need, he said.ldquoThe fact that the Minister has increased the funding for the rural roads fund by % and allocated poundm mdash a % increase on last yearrsquos budget mdash specically for rural roads across the North, including South Down, is a clear demonstration of this commitment to rural communities. This funding is not impacted by current legal challenges.The spokesman explained that as a result of challenges to awarding resurfacing contracts earlier this year, ious schemes which the Department had intended to progress during the current financial year have been delayed in four council areas, including Newry Mourne and Down.But he confirmed the Department is taking forward a new procurement strategy and hopes to be in position to go to tender shortly and to have new term contracts in place next January to continue resurfacing programmes in these areas, including in South Down.ldquoSignicant programmes of work have been delivered across all areas in  , in particular on rural roads and while capacity to reallocate resurfacing budgets across areas is limited, every effort is being made to maximise spend across all areas, said the spokesman.ldquoIn relation to the Ballynahinch bypass, Minister Mallon provided an opening allocation of pound.m for land costs and scheme development in -. The next steps are procurement and progression to construction.ldquoProgression to construction will, however, depend on budget allocations made to the Department in future years. Subject to funding being made available, it is estimated that it would take around  months to the start of construction from any decision to move to procurement, and a further  months to construct the scheme.The spokesman explained that as part of planning for the winter gritting programme, the Department ensures that adequate staff are available, all winter service equipment is in satisfactory working order and that there are adequate supplies of salt.He added: ldquoWhile the Department generally salts the main through routes which carry more than , vehicles per day, in exceptional circumstances, roads with dficult topography carrying between , and , vehicles daily will also be salted.ldquoGrit piles are also available for use by the public on a self-help basis on selected routes not included on the salting schedule and arrangements are in place to enlist the help of private contractors and local farmers to assist in efforts to clear blocked roads in rural areas..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10November2021_smell.jpg","title":"Multi agency  response call on foul smell  ","story":"A LOCAL politician has called for a multi-agency response to two issues of concern in the Dundrum area.Northern Ireland Water, the Department for Infrastructure and Rivers Agency have been asked to address recent damage caused by flood water at the Moneycarragh River, with the utility company and Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos environmental health department asked to investigate the cause of foul smelling liquid seeping from land close to Dam Lane in the village.The appeal for the ious agencies to work together on both issues has been made by Slieve Croob councillor Alan Lewis.In relation to the Moneycarragh River, the councillor has called for the waterway to be ldquoed to its natural state, with the appeal coming after recent flooding which led to a burst pipe resulting in a number of consumers in the area left without supply.In June, Cllr Lewis raised concerns of local farmers with NI Water after a concrete floor was installed on the floor of the river, directly under Bennettrsquos bridge which runs over it.ldquoThe work prevented water from pooling, which subsequently forced floodwater to erode stone walls and the river bank which exposed a water supply the pipe which was damaged by rocks and it burst, he added.Cllr Lewis claimed rising floodwater has also undermined the integrity of the bridge and widened the river banks which exposed the water supply pipe.ldquoPreviously, farmers were able to drive machinery down the natural land slope to collect water from the river for animals and farm use, but this access has been altered so much that a sizeable dip has been left on the river bank.Cllr Lewis said the damage was ldquopredictable and claimed that the manipulation of the riverrsquos natural flow has, over time, distorted its integrity, warning that erosion which will eventually cause the collapse of the supporting walls at the bridge and adjoining roadway.He has asked NI Water and roads officials to urgently join forces to address the issue andthe river bed to its natural state.Turning to Dam Lane, Cllr Lewis says he hopes local afgghghuthority environmental health officials and NI Water will be able to address the issue.ldquoI recently received numerous complaints regarding a foul smelling fluid which has been seeping onto the pavement at this part of the village. There are suggestions that fluid is coming from a nearby drain or sewer, he explained.Cllr Lewis said that while he is aware that there is a sewage treatment plant nearby, there are no suggestions that the spillage came from it.He added: ldquoIt is in everyonersquos interest to identy what is casing this issue and to recty it as soon as possible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/10November2021_kathy.jpg","title":"Newcastle woman Kathy to meet Sir David Attenborough at event  ","story":"A NEWCASTLE woman will be rubbing shoulders with Sir David Attenborough at a virtual event which will explore ways of ensuring a better future.Kathy Black is taking part in the Festival of Discovery, which begins tomorrow and ends on Saturday.Also joining her in the event, which is being run by the Eden Project, will be comedian John Bishop, best-selling author Ben Miller and BBC gardening presenter Mark Lane.Al of them will be taking part in inspiring sessions about eco-friendly initiatives taking place across the UK.Kathy, who runs Unit T in Newcastle, will be sharing the story of how she and a team of volunteers responded to their local arearsquos needs by opening a sustainable community kitchen during the pandemic.Built from re-purposed materials and located in the heart of the town, Unit T distributes home-grown produce, local goods and food near its sell-by date.As well as providing a vital and sustainable service for the community, Unit T have inspired and involved young people to live within their means and connect with each other and the natural world.The three-day Festival of Discovery is jam-packed with speakers,  and workshops.Tracey Robbins, Head of UK Delivery at Eden Project Communities, said: ldquoWersquore absolutely thrilled to be inviting Kathy to the Festival of Discovery.ldquoHere at Eden Project Communities, we know that there are thousands of amazing people doing their bit to protect the planet by joining forces with their communities and seeing the amazing things that can happen when we work together.ldquoWe canrsquot wait to hear some of their stories and hope that everyone attending will come away feeling inspired and motivated to get together to protect our planet.The Festival of Discovery will take place online.

Beneath the article I have add updated thoughts on my points below.THE Union is secure, and will be in , many of our contributors have told us.In the News Letter’s Union  series so far there has been large agreement that the British link will survive past Northern Ireland’s th anniversary.But what does it mean to say that the Union is secure, or indeed what does it matter Those are follow-on questions that have not been so widely considered.What does it matter that the Union has been securedthe concessions to Irish nationalism are so comprehensive and wide-ranging that Northern Ireland in fact looks utterly unlike any other part of the kingdom Some of the following scenarios may seem provocative, but take a moment to imagine them: • A Northern Ireland in which you need a passport to get to Great Britain• A Northern Ireland teeming with powerful enforcers who see discrimination and sectarianism behind all sorts of human failings• A Northern Ireland which is, in terms of its very identity, an enlarged Stroke City, in which the media alternate between using its name Northern Ireland and other labels that deny its existence, such as the north of Ireland• A Northern Ireland that has fiscal powers that remove its economy yet further from the British mainstream• A Northern Ireland in which BBC Radio Ulster is broadcast in gaelic night after night, so that the overwhelming majority of the station’s listeners are unable to understand it during much of evening primetime• A Northern Ireland in which all road signs are jointly in gaelic • A Northern Ireland which toleration of violence in the name of human rights is pushed to the very extremes, providing it is aimed against agents of the state. In which calculated attacks on police, risking paralysis or death, are accepted in preference to a police response involving real force• A Northern Ireland which has a Bill of Rights that includes socio and economic rights, like something out of the old communist Eastern bloc• A Northern Ireland in which there is a growing consensusthat the earlier NI was a failed state• A Northern Ireland in which that coalition agrees that there was widespread collusion – facilitating wholesale murder – between loyalist killers the RUC and British Army • A Northern Ireland in which such assumptions about an entirely malign British form the basis on which the past, or any allegiance to it, is investigated or treated• A Northern Ireland in which those who planned massacres against civilians are not only treated as equals with the British forces, but are able to demand full accountability of those state forces while shamelessly covering up their own history• A Northern Ireland in which the Republic’s president can come and go freely, presiding over official s – a presidency that appears to allow its office-holder to cite political preconditions before the apolitical British head of state can set foot in the Republic [this was before the royal visit of ]• A Northern Ireland in which the Republic’s government can be a partisan player, while demanding neutrality on the part of those who actually have sovereignty• A Northern Ireland which must, necessarily must, include in government a party that the Republic will not tolerate in its own halls of powerTo be clear, imagining these ious scenarios does not mean they likely: as our recent story [published in ] on Northern Irishness pointed out, a large minority of Catholics accept the title and the state.And the Human Rights Commission’s Bill of Rights proposals have been comprehensively rejected by the main GB parties, and received coolly even in the Republic.Further, the Tories under David Cameron have sent out clear “hold on a minute” signals to any assumptions that they must be impartial on matters such as the future of the Union.Meanwhile, there is no suggestion that Northern Ireland will ever lose its Westminster MPs and many unionists, indeed Orangemen, will point to a real change in how they are received south of the border.So it is extreme to assume that all of the scenarios listed above will come to pass. Yet all the scenarios, and more, are at least conceivable within the Union.Some are not hypotheses but the actual position.Andall this could happen within the Union, then the urgent question is – what does the Union matter I raised this question verbally with an interested observer. He responded: ”The subvention perhaps  That may be why it matters.”It sounds convincing to say that the huge subsidy from the Treasury in London is what makes it all worthwhile. After all, that is what makes the province reasonably affluent. But you could just as easily argue that the other way – that the subsidy alongside relentless political concessions means that Irish nationalists within the province can enjoy all of their key demands, and the financial benefit too.One little-noticed, but intriguing, suggestion on the future that would have implications for this anomaly came from a recent writer on our  pages, Garvin Crawford. He suggested the world’s first community state in which people are able to designate themselves as Ulster British or Ulster Irish, and pay taxes and receive benefits accordingly.But, despite its logicality, the idea that those in Northern Ireland who opt for Irish citizenship would lose British benefits would surely provoke uproar amongst Irish nationalists globally.Union  will continue throughout the summer.Perhaps some of the coming contributors will address this question of what a secure Union means, and why it matters.• The essay above was written in August . I am surprised by parts of it, for example my reference to us one day needing a passport to get to Great Britain. There was no prospect of Brexit in , because David Cameron was new to power and had not promised his In-Out vote, but I think the idea was in my head because the Labour government had tried to introduce security measures for cross Irish Sea movements from which it retreated. Also, I had seen or reported on matters such as police sometimes in Belfast airports asking flight passengers from the mainland for a passport, rather than photo ID, and a Tory MP complaining about the same in Dublin in lack of observance of the Common Travel AreaThe sections on legacy above were brewing in  but are far worse now. Also, in  the Irish language push and Bill of Rights push were almost dormant but it was clear they were so central to republican goals that they would arise again.The expanding role of ‘enforcers’ has continued, as it was obvious in  it would.Similarly, the sections on Irish government partisanship, on the Irish presidencyand on contested terms such as Northern Ireland have become much more pronounced since Brexit, but I had forgotten until revisiting this essay the extent to which they were building regardless of the UK’s position in or out of the EU.The double standards in the Dublin establishment with regard to Sinn Fein having to be in power on one side of the border but not being allowed in the other have diminished in recent years as some Irish leaders seem to begin to prepare for striking a deal with them.• Ben Lowryis News Letter editor.

There were no abstentions.But despite the more straightforward nature of todays vote, there were still criticisms in the Senedd from members who opposed the Covid Pass scheme.Darren Millar, of the Welsh Conservatives,said his party had warned the scheme \"would set a dangerous precedent, and it gives me no pleasure today to say that we were right\".He added: \"Vaccine passports are not a route out of restrictions, they are restrictions.

He has been a very valuable asset to our union and will be sadly missed.Mr Pricersquos contribution will be acknowledged at the Annual Glamorgan County Dinner that is being held at Cardfrsquos Angel Hotel on Friday November .More than  guests and dignitaries will attend the black-tie dinner, with glasses raised to the Glamorgan first team who beat Devon last month at Long Sutton Golf Club in the final of inter-county league.It had been a long wait since , but the convincing - victory in Somerset - which came after Glamorgan topped their group with just one defeat in the entire season - was the perfect way for Mr Price to bow out of the role.As well as the first team, Price has assisted in running the junior teams and the seniors team.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityLast week I joined my fellow Labour MP Ruth Jones, along with Vale of Glamorgan Member of the Senedd Jane Hutt and others, to speak at the s Women of Wales rally in Cardf Bay.The group continues to campaign for justice on their pensions, calling for fair and fast compensation from the UK Government, following the summer finding by the Parliamentary  Health Service Ombudsman that the Department for Work and Pensions should have given more notice of their decision to raise the womenrsquos state pension age.I met group members outside the Senedd, many of whom have faced great hardship as a result of the DWPrsquos actions, and I will continue to support them in their fight for justice.Irsquove recently heard from many constituents about sewage pollution. It is shocking that the UK is ranked th out of  European countries for coastal water quality and only % of waterways meet good ecological status.As a regular open water swimmer myself and someone who loves our beautul rivers, lakes and coastlines, Irsquom deeply alarmed at the ongoing revelations about sewage discharge and other pollution incidents.After UK Conservative MPs tried to block efforts to improve the situation via an amendment to the Environment Bill, the House of Lords emphatically voted to send back the amendment to end the routine discharge of raw sewage into rivers. Unsurprisingly the Government then voted to weaken that amendment.They are simply in the wrong place environmentally and politically ndash which is deeply concerning in the week of COP. We need bolder, more urgent actionwe are to address the climate and nature crisis.While the regulation of water and sewers is generally reserved to the UK Government, here in Wales there are powers to regulate undertakers whose areas are wholly or mainly in Wales ndash and Irsquom pleased the Welsh Government is committed to tackling pollution by using these powers.This year marks  years of Remembrance as we know it, as the Royal British Legionmarks its centenary..removeAs we approach Armistice Day and Remembrance Sunday, it was an honour to plant a stake in the first Parliamentary Constituency Garden of Remembrance, to remember all those from Cardf South and Penarth who have served and paid the ultimate sacrice.It brought to mind the huge sacrices of our armed forces across the years and to this day. We owe them all a huge debt of gratitude. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

The rough clftop path between bushes resembled a river after previous heavy rainfall and paddling their way along it, a deviation into fields for a quick stop for morning refreshments as overhead there were traces of blue in between the clouds.Crossing a sticky muddy ploughed field brought them to the dismantled railway line where at last the sun made an appearance and following Fort Road and crossing the busy Lavernock Road, a gate led them into Cosmeston Lakes Country Park beside the Medieval Village.A lush green meadow above the Sully Brook brought them to a stile leading into the Community Orchard, planted by volunteers in  and then through a gate into Cogan Wood, where squirrels were bounding and delicately prancing along the ground seeking food before scurrying up into the trees. Reaching Mile Road they continued towards Old Cogan Hall Farm to enter the churchyard of St Peterrsquos where lunch was taken whilst soaking up the sunshine that felt more like May than November.Refreshed they walked on through what had been the deserted medieval settlement of Old Cogan which relates to the th century when the church was built. It appears buildings were set within gardens on either side of a sunken lane and there was a village pond or a well with a mill and leat set to the south of the village..removeA narrow track brought them into woodland at the rear of Myrtle Close to hop across the Sully Brook into the lovely open green space of St Cyres Park with deep blue skies overhead. Then onto pavements taking them through Penarth town by way of Glyndwr Road, Elfed Avenue and across Redlands Road, through Mountjoy Crescent and more open parkland to the lovely upgraded Golden Gates Park and past the Grade II listed St Josephrsquos Church, which took seven years to build as work was interrupted by the Great War.By lane to reach Dingle Road and across the railway footbridge just as a train was approaching and then across the A Windsor Road into Windsor Lane, across Plassey Street to Plassey Square open space and along Harbour View Road to Queen Street. Here they heard the oldest reference to Penarth goes back to Osbert a Norman Knight that granted land there to St Augustinersquos Abbey in Bristol. The land was then taken by King Henry VII and leased out to local well to do families like the Herbertrsquos, Windsorrsquos and Lewis families.This area to the north of Penarth is known as The Bowery and was a poor area without access to education, doctors or a good standard of living. Many of the Irish navvies that came over to build Penarth Docks lodged in this area which became known as lsquoDagger Townrsquo and fights, prostitution, opium dens and gambling along with no doubt a murder or two was re. The Irish making the journey by boat often arrived starving and disease riddenthe journey had taken longer than expected. Whilst to the south of Penarth, it was a dferent story as the middle and upper class residents were better dressed, had moral values and enjoyed wealth and all the other things their counterparts in the north of the town lacked. A lane between houses built into the hillside at the rear of Paget Road brought them to Steep Street for the short walk back to their start, this time with sunny views across Cardf Bay and beyond.You can follow the grouprsquos exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

At thelowest point, in the early summer, Covid patients accounted for around two per cent of all hospitalisations in Wales.But despite the recent rise in Covid patients, we are a long way off the worst of the pandemic, when in January this year more than one in three hospitalisations in Wales was due to coronavirus.What comes next Vaccines have \"weakened\" the link between infection and serious illness, meaning the situation Wales faced last winter should not be repeatedndash at least to the same extentndash this time around.

Mask-wearing in shops and on public transport, social distancing and the recommendation to work from home when you can.Non-essential items were blocked off in Welsh supermarkets during the fire-break lockdown in autumn . Picture: Huw Evans Picture AgencyIf the situation gets signicantly worse and there is a risk of the NHS being overwhelmed, Wales would switch to the other option, and the government said it would reintroduce ious national measures that are appropriate the the level of crisis the nation is facing.In the meantime, the vaccines remain the best way to protect yourself and other people. Today, first minister Mark Drakefordndash after receiving his own booster shotndash said: \"I would like to thank all the NHS staff and volunteers that have worked tirelessly over the last few months, to ensure that the vaccination programme has been such a success here in Wales.\"I urge everyone that is offered a booster vaccine to turn up for their appointments.\"We must do everything we can to keep everyone safe as coronavirus has not gone away.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Northern Ireland has experienced a .% increase in average rental values this year[]. With the price increase, OFTEC, representing the liquid fuel industry in Ireland, is concerned that students may take cheaper accommodation options without properly inspecting the property. With this in mind, OFTEC has issued advise to help students ensure their accommodation is safe before they sign the dotted line. Raise the alarm – Currently, it is not a mandatory requirement for private landlords to provide smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, but the HSENI recommend that they do. It is a legal requirement to fit a carbon monoxide detector when a fossil fuel appliance has been replaced. Carbon monoxide is potentially lethal as it has no smell, taste or colour. Without a working alarm, it is impossible to identy carbon monoxide leaks. OFTEC’s advise is to ensure that there are working fire and CO alarms in the property, and that they are tested on a regular basis.Heating requirements - The Health  Safety Executive recommend that all boilers should be serviced annually and tenants should ask for evidence of recent servicing. If you have concerns, ask for a CD  Landlord Oil Installation Check which is carried out by an OFTEC registered technician and will give you peace of mind. For a gas heated property, ask for a copy of the annual gas safety check.Look for damp – It is easy to hide damp patches with a coat of paint, soyour house smells musty or you see evidence of mould, find out how the landlord is planning to fix the problem. Mould has no place in the home as it can cause respiratory problems and headaches.Furniture and fittings – Ask the landlord for a list of everything that is included and make note of any damage that is there before you move it. Check any beds, sofas and chairs are in good condition.Secure your home – burglars may target student areas because of lax security. Ask your landlord to fit key operating locks on the windows and lever deadlocks on external doors.  OFTEC Ireland Manager, David Blevings, said: “Quite often the excitement of moving in with friends can overshadow the concerns about the accommodation itself. We are urging students to play it safe this year and carry out these essential checks before signing a lease and moving in. “Asking a landlord about safety may seem awkward, but it could prevent you from living in a potentially dangerous property for the next  months. It’s vital that your new home is not a burden as you start your time at university.
