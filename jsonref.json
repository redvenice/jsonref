Smith, pictured here in 2001, promoted Australian-produced food at his supermarket chainMore recently, he founded the media firm Smith \u0026amp Nasht in 2010.In addition, Smith has  authored several books detailing his aviation ventures, including ‘The Earth Beneath Me’ in 1983, ‘Dick Smith Solo Around the World’ in 1992 and ‘Above the World: A Pictorial Circumnavigation’ in 1997.Who is Dick Smith’s wife?Smith’s wife is Phillipa Aird McManarney. The couple has two children together, Jenny and Hayley.Food company closureOn July 26, Smith announced the closure of his food company Dick Smith Foods in the wake of increased competition.\u0027It is my melancholy duty to inform everyone that after 19 years, I\u0027ve had to make the decision to close Dick Smith Foods.\u0027In two years’ time we will go out of business, so I\u0027m closing it down now when times are good.\u0027It\u0027s a decision forced on me because most people just want the cheapest prices and the cheapest prices will always come from overseas,’ the longtime businessman announced.Smith specifically blamed German supermarket giant Aldi, saying its practice of ‘extreme capitalism’ had ultimately ‘forced’ him to close the company he founded in 1999 as the only means of avoiding bankruptcy.          Smith specifically cited the German supermarket Aldi as to why his food store will be closingHowever, IBISWorld Senior Industry Analyst Bao Vuong said that there were many factors at play in the demise of the Australian supermarket, not just Aldi’s rapid expansion in the country as of late.He states: \u0027There\u0027s a lot of factors behind the downfall, it\u0027s not solely placed on Aldi. Coles and Woolworths and Aldi - they all had an effect on the downfall of Dick Smith Foods because consumers are price conscious.\u0027Vuong also believes that limited brand awareness hurt Dick Smith’s food company in particular, saying: \u0027It\u0027s the company itself, it\u0027s not a prominent or well-known company with Australian consumers. The lack of brand awareness contributed to the downfall over the decade.\u0027In addition, Vuong also noted that Dick Smith Foods’ higher prices compared to its competitors was a ‘large contributor’ to its closure.Despite his successful career as an entrepreneur for decades, Smith’s announcement of the upcoming shuttering of his food company wasn’t the only blow his Australian business empire has suffered in recent years.His oldest brand, Dick Smith Electronics, went into receivership in 2016.Jabong sale 2018: All you need to know about the Big Brand SaleEuroMillions results: Lotto numbers for Friday, July 27MoviePass was down because it ran out of money and couldn\u0026#8217t afford to pay for ticketsOrange Is the New Black: The crimes that landed the inmates in jail revealedWill Taylor Swift be invited to Karlie Kloss and Joshua Kushner\u0027s wedding? Mercury Prize: Nominations, date and moreMeghan Markle has to follow the Queen\u0027s bedtime rule when staying with herI Am Paul Walker documentary: All you need to know after trailer releaseWill Priyanka Chopra continue acting after her marriage to Nick Jonas? UK heatwave: How you can help the homeless in the hot weatherWhy Meghan Markle can\u0027t eat carbs at Buckingham PalaceGuru Purnima 2018: Everything you need to know Dick Smith\u0027s net worth revealed as Australian businessman closes food storesWho is Rocio Oliva?

Their new HBO show will premiere on August 28 LeBron James and lifelong friend Maverick Carter\u0027s barbershop-style talk show, \u0027The Shop,\u0027 is moving to HBO.James, who recently relocated to Los Angeles by signing a four-year, $154 million contract with the Lakers, had been doing the program on his website, The Uninterrupted. Now, according to The Hollywood Reporter, HBO has ordered a \u0027handful\u0027 of episodes, which began shooting in Los Angeles at West Hollywood\u0027s Barber Surgeons Guild last week.The show will premiere on HBO at 11pm on August 28.In one part of the preview, James can seen discussing the stress of parenthood: specifically watching his sons follow in his hardwood footstep. He also admitted to being an overly-competitive parent.  \u0027I didn\u0027t get into an argument with an AAU dad,\u0027 James said when talking about seeing his son, LeBron Jr., play youth basketball. \u0027I got into an argument with an AAU mom.\u0027James also confessed that he regretted giving his oldest son the \u0027Jr.\u0027 moniker, and gave a little window into his reasoning: \u0027When I was younger, obviously I didn\u0027t have a dad, my whole thing was when I have a kid, not only is he going to be a Jr. I\u0027m gonna do everything that this man didn\u0027t do.\u0027SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO            James (right) and New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. (left) on the set of The Shop  All hail The King! LeBron James is greeted with a standing...\u0027Never touch religion, politics or anyone against Kobe\u0027:...Share this article\u0027When I was a kid, being in barbershops meant listening to adults talk about sports, clothing, politics, music, everything happened in the shop,\u0027 James continued. \u0027It was so real and so candid no one had a sense of, Well, I can\u0027t be myself here. That\u0027s how The Shop became an idea.\u0027It\u0027s not yet clear how many episodes HBO will broadcast, or if James will appear throughout the series.          Snoop Dogg, a native of Southern California, will welcome James to the neighborhood on HBO  WNBA superstar Candace Parker (left) and Seattle Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett (right) will also appear in the early episodes of The Shop on HBO, which premieres in August           Jon Stewart asked  James how he deals with watching his children follow in his footsteps According to THR, James will appear in at least the first three episodes.Of course, James\u0027s availability next year will be determined by how far he and his new Lakers teammates get into the Western Conference Playoffs.\u0027We\u0027ll do it as frequently as the conversation warrants,\u0027 says Peter Nelson, executive vice president of HBO Sports. \u0027It\u0027s LeBron\u0027s baby, so he very much wants to do it. And he wants to do it as much as possible.\u0027          Another former Giants wide receiver, Victor Cruz, also made an appearance in the HBO trailer for the new show, \u0027The Shop\u0027 James\u0027s SpringHill Entertainment has several projects underway with HBO, including a multi-part documentary on Muhammad Ali, and something about student athletes, which will premiere on October 2 and focus on the NCAA\u0027s controversial rules regarding amateurism.The Shop gives the boxing-centric HBO Sports another avenue to reach new audiences.\u0027Sports for us is really about a lens into socioeconomic, political, cultural issues and ideas around virtuosity in competition,\u0027 says Nelson.\u0027The objective,\u0027 Nelson continued, \u0027is candor. On the one hand, the barbershop as a place historically of secular communion, and on the other hand of the athletes and artist who have achieved this certain level of excellence who want to get in a room and a setting to talk like that with each other because a dearth of forms like that where they can really feel porous and honest with one other. And so it\u0027s less about let\u0027s leverage these names and these relationships and can we get this person or that person. It\u0027s more about who has something to say.\u0027          James has appeared in the last eight NBA Finals as a member of the Cavaliers and the Miami Heat, but lost in three of the previous four meetings with Stephen Curry and the Warriors "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/27/03/4E9AF13C00000578-5997935-image-m-9_1532660359488.jpg","title":"Roseanne Barr says ABC broke contract firing 24 hours tweet","story":"    Roseanne Barr claims ABC broke her contract which guaranteed her \u002724 hours to correct any mistakes\u0027, in an interview with Sean Hannity on Thursday evening           Barr sat down with the Fox News host for her first interview appearance following her racist tweet and the axing of her show\u0027s reboot           She said: \u0027I want to tell you this.

A teacher, or a guru, is someone who is thought to be able to remove all the darkness from our lives.Today, it is still believed in Hindu, Jain and Buddhist teachings that the mother is the first teacher of a child and the guru becomes the second mother. A person is first born as a result of the union between their mother and father and is then believed to be born again when they are accepted by a teacher, who will teach them how to become a human being.The Kathopanishad states: ‘In order to learn the transcendental science, one must approach the bona fide spiritual master in disciplined succession, who is fixed in the Absolute Truth. Thus, it has been enjoined herewith that in order to receive that transcendental knowledge, one must approach the guru.’          Today, it is still believed in  Buddhist teachings that the guru becomes the second motherGuru Purnima usually falls on the day of Ashada Shukla Purnima in the Indian calendar, when Srila Vyasadeva, the son of Parashar Muni and Devi Satyavati appeared. The story associated with this celebration sees Parashar stopping by the banks of the river Yamuna while travelling one night.He stayed at the house of the fisherman chief Dusharaj and asked his daughter to ferry him to his next destination. Entranced by Matsyagandha’s beauty, which means one who smells like fish, he used his powers to give her a son.A boy with a dark complexion was born on an island and according to scripture, would then ide Vedic literature into four parts, Vyasa, which is why he was later named Krishna Dwaipayana Vyasa.After this, as the Srimad Bhagavatam states: ‘Thereafter, in the seventeenth incarnation of Godhead, Sri Vyasadeva appeared in the womb of Satyavati through Parashara Muni, and he ided the one Veda into several branches and sub-branches, seeing that the people in general were less intelligent.’Srila Vyasadeva is considered the spiritual master of all teachers of Vedic wisdom because he made all knowledge of the acharyas to the entire world. He went on to ide the original Veda into four: the Sama, Yajur, Rig, Atharva, which were there explained in different texts, such as the Mahabharata.          Guru Purnima usually falls on the day of Ashada Shukla Purnima in the Indian calendarAs Vedic language is difficult to understand, he then wrote appendices, now referred to as the Puranas and Upanishads, so that the everyday man could follow the teachings practically.Guru Purnima 2018Guru Purnima falls on Friday, July 27 this year on the day of Ashadha Shukla Purnima, which is also considered to be the day Lord Buddha gave his first sermon on the full moon day after five weeks of enlightenment sitting under the Bodhi tree in Sarnath, Uttar Pradesh and to this day, Buddhists worship him and his teachings on this day.In addition to this, the Hindu god Shiva is thought to have offered his knowledge of yoga to his disciples, of the ‘Saptarishis’, seven sages, on this day. The festival is celebrated in India, Nepal and other countries of Buddhist, Jain and Hindu influence.Teachers would be given gifts on this special day after visiting temples to offer their gurus respect and seeking their blessings. Jabong sale 2018: All you need to know about the Big Brand SaleEuroMillions results: Lotto numbers for Friday, July 27MoviePass was down because it ran out of money and couldn\u0026#8217t afford to pay for ticketsOrange Is the New Black: The crimes that landed the inmates in jail revealedWill Taylor Swift be invited to Karlie Kloss and Joshua Kushner\u0027s wedding? Mercury Prize: Nominations, date and moreMeghan Markle has to follow the Queen\u0027s bedtime rule when staying with herI Am Paul Walker documentary: All you need to know after trailer releaseWill Priyanka Chopra continue acting after her marriage to Nick Jonas? UK heatwave: How you can help the homeless in the hot weatherWhy Meghan Markle can\u0027t eat carbs at Buckingham PalaceGuru Purnima 2018: Everything you need to know Dick Smith\u0027s net worth revealed as Australian businessman closes food storesWho is Rocio Oliva?

The results fell short of Wall Street expectations as the company continues to grapple with privacy issues.Facebook\u0027s second-quarter results were the first sign that new European privacy laws and a string of privacy scandals involving Cambridge Analytica and other app developers are hitting the company\u0027s business.Wednesday in a call with analysts when they said profit margins would plummet for several years due to the costs of improving privacy safeguards and slowing usage in its biggest advertising markets.Chief financial officer David Wehner warned in the earnings call  that revenue growth had already \u0027decelerated\u0027 in the second quarter and would drop \u0027by high single digit percentages\u0027 in coming quarters.At one point during the call, Facebook shares were trading down as much as 24 percent, an unprecedented drop for a large firm. Until Wednesday, Facebook shares had been at record highs as investors seemed to shrug off fears about data protection and probes into the hijacking of private information by the political consultancy Cambridge Analytica. Facebook blocks InfoWars\u0027s Alex Jones for 30 days over \u0027hate...Share this articleFor the second quarter, profit was up 31 percent at $5.1 billion revenues rose 42 percent to $13.2 billion, only slightly below most forecasts. Ad sales in Facebook\u0027s second quarter rose 42 percent to $13.04 billion but the costs, bolstered by moves to improve content and security after the data scandal, rose 50 percent from a year earlier to $7.37 billion.           Mark Zuckerberg\u0027s fortune also took a $16 billion hit in the first five minutes of trading on Thursday as shares in his social media company plunged 19 percent to $175.30Facebook\u0027s monthly active user count was 2.23 billion, slightly behind the 2.25 billion forecast by analysts. Users in Europe dropped from 377 million to 376 million, partly as a result of the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules. The plunging share prices follows months of criticism leveled against the social media giant over its handling of several recent scandals, including the Cambridge Analytica data saga and Russian meddling in the US election. The Cambridge Analytica scandal prompted several apologies from Zuckerberg and generated calls for users to desert Facebook, which has grown strongly since launching as a public company in 2012.Industry experts had predicted, ahead of the announcement, that the number of active users visiting the social network would either drop or flat line.According to analysts, stalling numbers are likely the result of forcing Facebook users to consciously opt-in to having their information used for personal advertising - one of the key stipulations of the stringent GDPR rules.    GDPR, which came into affect May 25, stipulates that companies must explicitly request consent from their users in order to personal data for advertising purposes. Companies that do not comply with GDPR can be fined up to four per cent of their global revenue. To comply with the new regulations, Facebook rolled-out a security check-up to users worldwide which asked them to review what kind of personal information they consent to sharing for advertising targeting. Users were also asked to consent to facial recognition technology on the site. Analysts believe users may have been scared off by the explicit details about how their data is being used by the social network. It comes after shareholders tried to fire Zuckerberg as chairman of Facebook in a proposal filed on Wednesday by Investment company Trillium Asset Management.The company, who has about $11 million in Facebook stock, wants to break up Zuckerberg\u0027s role as both chairman and CEO, Business Insider reports.The proposal argues that shareholders are unable to check Zuckerberg\u0027s power given he holds roughly 60 percent of Facebook\u0027s voting shares as both chair and CEO.\u0027A CEO who also serves as chair can exert excessive influence on the board and its agenda, weakening the board\u0027s oversight of management,\u0027 the proposal states.\u0027Separating the chair and CEO positions reduces this conflict, and an independent chair provides the clearest separation of power between the CEO and the rest of the board.\u0027 The investment company says this oversight has contributed to Facebook \u0027missing or mishandling\u0027 several \u0027severe controversies\u0027 in past years, which they say increases risk exposure and costs to shareholders. The specific examples the shareholders used include: Russian meddling in US election, the sharing of 87 million users\u0027 personal data with Cambridge Analytica, proliferating fake news and social unrest in Myanmar and Sri Lanka.Chances of Zuckerberg\u0027s roles being split remain slim given Facebook has  rejected similar shareholder requests in the past. A proposal last year to oust Zuckerberg as chairman received 51 percent of the votes.Meanwhile, in addition to the financial woes, a promotional event for Facebook\u0027s new video feature descended into a shouting match on Wednesday, as reporters quizzed the social media giant\u0027s executives about its decision to allow Fox News and Infowars on the platform. Facebook will be featuring Fox News alongside other news organizations on Watch, while right-wing conspiracy theory site Infowars has a Facebook page that is followed by nearly a million people. The debate at the Television Critics Association\u0027s press tour in Beverly Hills began when Facebook\u0027s head of video was asked why Facebook still hosted Infowars when it peddled conspiracy theories including calling the Sandy Hook massacre a hoax.

So why is such a glamorous property at the centre of a controversy?One reason has to do with the owner himself, the notoriously combustible Gordon Ramsay (hence the culinary joke in the blurb) who has not always endeared himself to locals.Ramsay, it would be fair to say — a man who could start an argument in an empty room — is about as popular among some Cornwellians as the food served up at one of the sub- standard establishments featured in his Kitchen Nightmares TV show.Incidents such as the following encounter have not helped. When a resident spotted Ramsay in town and excitedly asked to have a ‘selfie’ taken with him, the irascible restaurateur is said to have pulled his cap down over his face and turned away in a hurry.‘He said he was on holiday and didn’t want to be disturbed,’ reveals a friend of the person who was left disappointed by his fleeting meeting with the celebrity chef.‘Fair enough, I suppose, but it wouldn’t have taken long to do a quick picture.’EXCLUSIVE: Hotshot Sydney recruiter is revealed as the man...Tana Ramsay reveals she has forgiven her father for hacking...Share this articleThere is a more fundamental reason, though, why, aside from his forthright manner, Ramsay is not flavour of the month with everyone in Cornwall. For a start, his luxury holiday home in the picturesque harbour town of Fowey, which is being rented out, is his third property in the county.Second homes provoke strong feelings in places like Cornwall. The invasion of wealthy middle-class second home owners from outside has been blamed for pushing up property prices, forcing locals out of the housing market in the process, and turning parts of Cornwall into Chelsea-on-Sea in summer and ghost towns in winter.So being a second home owner three times over is unlikely to win you many friends in this part of the world.One woman summed up the opinions of many in the local community when she said that Ferrari-driving Ramsay, fined £500 not so long ago for speeding on Bodmin Moor in his Range Rover, was just ‘showing off with his money’, adding: ‘Why do you need three places in Cornwall?’          Ramsay\u0027s first property, purchased for £4,400,000 in 2015, in the village of Rock          Ramsay bought this £4million beach house in Trebetherick in 2016 to stay in while work is carried out on his residence in Rock          The latest addition to his Ramsay\u0027s Cornish portfolio: Formerly Fowey’s last bank, Ramsay acquired the building for £1.9million last year and converted it into a stunning seaside retreatFather-of-four Ramsay, 51, has certainly splashed the cash around. His first property, purchased for £4,400,000 in 2015, was in the village of Rock, a favourite haunt of the young Princes William and Harry.He had this demolished, despite objections from neighbours — who are still furious with him — and got planning permission to replace the traditional beachfront home with a bigger ‘Grand Designs’ mansion currently under construction.The following year, Ramsay bought a beach house (also £4million) a few miles away in Trebetherick, simply to stay in while work is carried out on the Rock residence.The latest addition to his Cornish portfolio was formerly Fowey’s last bank but had closed before Ramsay acquired the building (for £1.9million) last year and converted it into a stunning seaside retreat.Potential customers are cordially invited to ‘breathe in the beautifully-scented sea air and soak in the calm’ by the agency marketing the rental property.Of course, this ozone comes at a price: £7,000 a week, to be precise, or £3,525 for a long weekend. There’s an extra £30 charge if you have a dog. This is a standard fee, apparently, in holiday rentals, charged by the cleaners for wiping up mucky paw prints (or worse).‘It’s mad money, but people seem daft enough to pay it,’ said Paula Trewick, steward of the Fowey Gallant Sailing Club, this week.  Jetsetters: Ramsay steps out with his wife Tana in sunny Los Angeles on WednesdayHad the old Lloyds bank been so profitable, it would probably still be open today. Instead, the income from the Fowey townhouse — which has received ‘lots of inquiries’ since recently coming onto the market — will boost Ramsay’s already fabulous wealth.His restaurant empire alone is worth in excess of £46 million. He also has homes in London and Los Angeles and owns no fewer than eight Ferraris.He rakes in a fortune from his many TV commitments — including a new deal with Fox and the Discovery Channel to make a ‘Bear Grylls meets Kitchen Nightmares’ type series, which will see Ramsay travelling to the ends of the earth on culinary adventures.‘Cornwall is the place where I see Gordon really relax,’ his wife Tana said in an interview with the Sunday Times last week. But how much time does he actually spend in Rock, Trebetherick or Fowey?‘The reality is that he spends most of his time in LA,’ a source close to Ramsay told us this week.‘When he’s not there, he’s either on the road filming or working and socialising in London. Cornwall comes a very distant fourth.’          TV chef Ramsay is not flavour of the month with everyone in CornwallIt’s a familiar story. More than a third of properties in Fowey (population around 3,000) are now second or rental homes. This has helped push the average price of a flat to over £300,000 and a detached house to more than £400,000.Yet, the typical wage across the county is less than £19,000 and household incomes are below 75 per cent of the EU average. Cornwall is among the poorest regions in Northern Europe — despite its image as a playground for the rich and famous.Only last month, residents in the fishing village of Mevagissey voted overwhelmingly to ban the purchase of second homes. The result, said councillors, proved people ‘want strong and positive local planning legislation to protect’ the area.The precedent for such a policy was set in St Ives. In 2016, the High Court ruled that St Ives could keep its ban on new-build second homes after the town voted to reserve new homes for full-time residents.The fact that Ramsay is also making a handsome profit out of the Fowey property, which shut as a Lloyds branch three years ago, has served only to inflame the debate.‘This is the sort of c*** which prices locals out of their own town,’ said Fowey resident Kerri Lee, in language Ramsay would probably recognise, on the Cornwall Facebook page. While Sarah Carter said: ‘He’s giving the impression only Hooray Henrys visit Cornwall and that simply isn’t the case.’Joseph Ryan, 18, who works in a chip shop in Fowey, believes the town is going the same way as neighbouring Polperro where ‘you can only see ten lights on in winter because all the other houses are second homes’.Second home owners are encouraged to make a donation to the Cornwall Community Foundation to help pay for affordable housing for locals.Among those to have contributed to the charitable scheme is Alex Polizzi, presenter of TV’s The Hotel Inspector, who owns a cottage in St Mawes. Gordon Ramsay indicated he would consider contributing after the scheme was launched two years ago. So did he? The Foundation declined to say when contacted this week.Second homes are also an issue in Rock but, over here on the north coast, Ramsay is embroiled in a more old-fashioned dispute.Neighbours were up in arms when they found out he was going to demolish the ‘historically impressive’ 1920s Arts and Crafts-style home he bought three years ago and build a modernist villa with white walls and a zinc façade, comprising a gym, pool, cellar and a guest annexe.In all, there were 17 separate objections. Among the fiercest critics was the tycoon who lives next door. Ironically, Andrew Nisbet, head of kitchen equipment firm Nisbets, is one of Ramsay’s biggest suppliers.Mr Nisbet’s views are spelled out in a legal letter filed at Cornwall County Council. In blunt Ramsayesque language (minus the use of the F-word), it describes the project as ‘inappropriate, unsympathetic and unneighbourly’.Mr Nisbet and his wife Anne took particular exception to the planned annexe, claiming it will compromise their privacy because the ‘window to window distance between the annexe and their residence is just 25 yards’.          Father-of-four Ramsay, 51, has acquired an impressive Cornish property portfolioThey also said that Ramsay’s plans to increase the height of the chimney will lead to smoke being blown towards their windows.Nevertheless, the original house has now been bulldozed and work has begun on a new main house and annexe.Until recently, at least, a sign on the site read: ‘Gordon Ramsay Construction.’ We were unable to establish if this was a genuine firm or whether Ramsay was just having the last laugh at his neighbours’ expense. Not surprisingly, you can cut the atmosphere with a (chef’s) knife in this corner of Rock.Annie Haynes, whose home overlooks Ramsay’s, said: ‘The house he bought was a wonderful place, but he has just stuck two fingers up to the concerns of those of us who have to live here all year round.‘The whole of Rock has changed in recent years. A lot of properties overlooking the estuary have been sold and more of them are being knocked down and new houses put up. Many are monstrous — all metal and windows.‘The old traditional homes no longer seem good enough for the people who come down here a couple of times a year. In winter, the place is deserted.’When the dispute first erupted, a spokesman for Ramsay said that ‘Gordon, Tana and the family are very much looking forward to spending time in their new home in Cornwall.

They are often looking at A-levels to see how able candidates are in comparison with other young people.’          An unconditional offer means students get their university place regardless of how badly they performOf 181 students given an unconditional offer at Kent last year, 44 per cent failed to achieve the standard entry requirement of ABB. The offers related to two departments – English and history. Of those given offers for English, who accepted, 2 per cent dropped seven grades. Kent University’s report said: ‘The discrepancy in grades between predicted and actual grades is a concern and one the department was more than aware of when entering into the scheme. There were a handful of students who would not have been made offers to study English with their actual grades if they had not been made an unconditional offer.’ A survey by this newspaper has also found other incentives are being offered to entice students.Universities are fiercely competing to attract students after the numbers cap was lifted, which has created an oversupply of places.At Queen’s University Belfast, students are offered tuition fee help, free flights home, sports membership, cinema passes and free bedding. It uses a ‘gif’ – or short video – of pop star Rihanna to advertise its incentive scheme.The revelations come after universities minister Sam Gyimah branded universities ‘irresponsible’ for focusing on ‘bums on seats’ rather than encouraging high A-level performance. He threatened to stop universities making offers before A-level results day unless they mend their ways.n The London School of Economics is way below average for student satisfaction despite promising to improve a year ago, with students claiming it cares too much about its international research reputation.A National Student Survey shows levels fell three points to 71 per cent – the average for all universities is 83. LSE director Minouche Shafik said: ‘Improving student satisfaction is our top priority.

Bold, determined, ruthless, Haddad was the founder of the far-Left Popular Front for the Liberation of PalestineLittle by little, he began to die. His Palestinian friends contacted the East German secret police, who flew him to a hospital in East Berlin. Ten days later, bleeding from every orifice, Haddad died in agony.The doctors were baffled. But back in Israel, Mossad congratulated itself on a job well done.What happened to Haddad, argues Israeli journalist Ronen Bergman in a riveting new book, was merely the most melodramatic example of what is now an enduring pattern.Israel, a country born in bloodshed, has become the world leader in assassinations.The numbers alone are extraordinary. Not only have Mossad’s secret agents killed more people than the agents of any other state since World War II, but the pace has rapidly increased, with some 800 operations in the past decade.Hugged by a monster: Syrian dictator Assad and his British...Israel\u0027s Defence Minister vows to build 400 new homes in the...Share this articleThe number of deaths will never be known for sure, but they are in the thousands.There is, of course, something irresistibly fascinating about the idea of the globe-trotting secret agent, moving through the murky world of Middle Eastern politics with a licence to kill. And some of Bergman’s stories do have the flavour of a Hollywood spy blockbuster.One operation in 1968 was directly inspired by the film The Manchurian Candidate, with Mossad hiring a Swedish-born psychologist to brainwash a Palestinian prisoner into murdering Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation.The psychologist picked a suitable prisoner and spent three months hypnotising him with the simple message: ‘Arafat bad. He must be removed’.The prisoner, known only as Fatkhi, was trained to shoot at pictures of Arafat, hidden in a specially prepared room.          Revenge: Ali Hassan Salameh (pictured) whose group murdered 11 Israeli athletes, was killed in a Mossad bombing,On December 19, 1968, a Mossad team smuggled Fatkhi across the River Jordan, from where he was supposed to infiltrate Arafat’s headquarters.Then they waited. Five hours later, news came. Fatkhi had wasted no time. He had gone straight to a police station and accused Mossad of trying to brainwash him. The operation was an abject failure.In recent years, however, Mossad has lived up to its reputation as the most efficient secret killing machine in the world. One operation in Dubai proves the point. In January 2010, a team of several dozen Mossad agents flew to the oil-rich emirate on false passports, wearing wigs and false moustaches.Disguised as tourists and tennis players — some of them even carried racquets — they broke into a room at the luxurious Al-Bustan Hotel.There they waited for their quarry, top Hamas operative Mahmoud al-Mabhouh. As soon as al-Mabhouh let himself into his room, they grabbed him and used a high-tech ultrasound instrument to inject poison into his neck without even breaking the skin.He died within moments. Four hours later, most of the team had already flown out of Dubai. Job done.          Revenge: Ali Hassan Salameh, whose group murdered 11 Israeli athletes, was killed in a Mossad bombing, pictured All this might sound swashbuckling or heroic. In reality, there is nothing glamorous about Bergman’s story.Indeed, the first man to die in his book is not some Palestinian terrorist or Left-wing extremist. It is a British policeman: Detective Superintendent Tom Wilkin, from Aldeburgh on the Suffolk coast.In the autumn of 1944, Wilkin was in Jerusalem, where he was in charge of cracking down on Zionist guerillas.At the time, Jerusalem was part of British-governed Palestine, where the authorities were struggling to keep a lid on the tensions between Zionists — who wanted an independent Jewish state — and their Palestinian neighbours.To the Jewish militants in the terrorist Stern Gang, Wilkin was not a man. He was a target. In September, 1944, as he was strolling down a street, a boy sitting outside a grocery store threw down his hat — a sign the target was in range.Moments later, two young Jewish men opened fire with revolvers. Wilkin ‘managed to turn around and draw his pistol,’ one assailant, David Shomron, recalled, ‘but then he fell face first. A spurt of blood came out of his forehead, like a fountain.’Shomron did not feel the slightest remorse. ‘Not even a little twinge of guilt,’ he said later. ‘We believed the more coffins that reached London, the closer the day of freedom would be.’  One operation in 1968 was directly inspired by the film The Manchurian CandidateThat terrible phrase — ‘the more coffins that reached London’ — captures the mood of Bergman’s book. For, as cold-blooded as this sounds, Shomron was proved right.Faced with a wave of killings, including the infamous 1946 bombing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, in which 91 mostly British officials were killed, Clement Attlee’s government decided to get out. The Zionists got what they wanted.But the blood that gushed from poor Tom Wilkin’s head would soon become a torrent.The state of Israel was born amid brutal ethnic cleansing, with Jewish and Palestinian neighbours slaughtering one another in their thousands, while the new country’s Arab neighbours tried to strangle it at birth. It is hardly surprising that, ever since, Israel’s leaders have been driven by insecurity. After all, Israel has always been surrounded by hostile states, most of which deny that it even has the right to exist.On top of that, no Israeli can ever forget the awful shadow of the Holocaust, in which six million Jews were slaughtered by the Nazis.          Former Mossad director Meir Dagan (pictured) who ordered hundreds of assassinations between 2002 and 2011, kept a picture of his Polish-born grandfather, on his knees and surrounded by German soldiers, moments before he was shot and thrown into a mass graveEven today, hatred of Jews remains a monstrous feature of Europe’s political landscape — as evidenced by the appalling goings-on inside the Labour Party, where leader Jeremy Corbyn and his friends have turned a blind eye to the resurgence of the most poisonous anti- Semitism. No wonder, then, that in the struggle for survival, Israel’s leaders have reached so often for the bomb and bullet.‘If someone comes to kill you,’ says the sacred Jewish text, the Talmud, ‘rise up and kill him first.’As Bergman argues, that has been the principle guiding Mossad, as well as Israel’s internal security service Shin Bet and the army intelligence agency Aman, since the state’s foundation 70 years ago.Former Mossad director Meir Dagan, who ordered hundreds of assassinations between 2002 and 2011, kept a picture of his Polish-born grandfather, on his knees and surrounded by German soldiers, moments before he was shot and thrown into a mass grave.The lesson, Dagan told Bergman before his death in 2016, was that ‘most of the Jews in the Holocaust died without fighting. We must never reach that situation again, kneeling, without the ability to fight for our lives.’Bergman’s own story, by the way, is fascinating. Although this book has earned him a reputation as a whistle-blower, he is the very antithesis of a simplistic, bleeding-hearted activist.Born in 1972 to parents who were both Holocaust survivors, he did his national service in the intelligence unit of Israel’s Military Police Corps, has a PhD from Cambridge and is now a senior correspondent for Israel’s largest newspaper.Based on 1,000 interviews and vast numbers of leaked documents, his book often reads like a John le Carre novel. But it took considerable courage for him to publish it.          The document taken by a Nazi officer was found in the camp after it\u0027s liberation on April 15, 1945. Hidden in Argentina, Eichmann was captured in a street of a Buenos Aires suburb by a team of Mossad and Shin Bet agents on May 11, 1960 and taken to Israel without being detected by Argentine authorities. Eichmann was tried, sentenced to death and executed in Jerusalem on May 30, 1962While he was working on it, the chief of the Israel Defense Forces accused him of ‘aggravated espionage’ and even asked the security services to take action against him.Why? The reason is that Bergman sheds an unsparing light on the human cost of Israel’s targeted killings policy. He shows, for example, that when operations have taken place overseas, Israel’s agents were, and probably still are, unforgivably casual about civilian victims.Perhaps the most chilling section of his book concerns an operation in 1973 — and which was about as far from the glamour and romance of a James Bond thriller as you could possibly imagine.That summer, Mossad was on the hunt for Ali Hassan Salameh, one of the most wanted men in the world. Salameh was chief of operations for Black September, the Palestinian terrorist group that murdered 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics.Mossad wanted him dead, but the trail had gone cold. Then came a miracle. In Lillehammer, Norway, an Israeli secret agent spotted Salameh in a cafe. Word went back to Tel Aviv and a hit squad was assembled. On July 21, as Salameh and his girlfriend got off a bus on their way home from the cinema, the assassins were waiting in a rented Volvo. They leaped out of the car, fired eight shots, jumped back in their car and screeched away, leaving their target in a pool of blood.It was almost the perfect hit, but for just one problem. They had killed the wrong man.It was not Salameh, but Ahmed Bouchikhi, a Moroccan waiter with a heavily pregnant wife.In the aftermath, Norwegian police arrested six Israeli agents. Five served time in Norway, though all were released quickly under a secret deal. When the five returned to Israel, they were greeted as heroes. Few questioned the basic morality of the operation it was just a shame, they thought, that Mossad had got the wrong man.But they did get him eventually. On January 22, 1979, Salameh had just left his Beirut apartment when a female Israeli agent, watching from her balcony, pressed a button and a gigantic car bomb ripped through the street.Eight bystanders were also killed, including a German nun and a British student, but nobody at Mossad cared. ‘You get used to killing,’ explains former security chief Ami Ayalon. ‘Human life becomes easy to dispose of. You spend a quarter of an hour, 20 minutes, on who to kill.’In a chillingly familiar phrase, Ayalon even calls this the ‘banality of evil’ — words borrowed from the German philosopher Hannah Arendt, who used it to describe the Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann. That tells its own story.And although Bergman shows why decent people can feel they have no choice but to take terrible decisions, he also shows the consequences of crossing the line between good and evil.In the early Eighties, for example, Israeli defence minister, and later prime minister, Ariel Sharon’s obsession with killing Yasser Arafat led him into one of the darkest chapters in Israel’s modern history. At the time, Israel was embroiled in a horrific civil war in Lebanon, which killed at least 120,000 people.There, on Sharon’s orders, his army colluded with the local Christian Phalange, a militia who murdered hundreds, if not thousands, of Muslims in a Beirut slaughterhouse, cut off their ears as souvenirs and buried their bodies in lime pits. Almost incredibly, Sharon did not stop there.Some of Bergman’s interviewees told him that on five occasions in 1982, Sharon seriously contemplated shooting down an ordinary civilian airliner when he heard that Arafat might be aboard.On each occasion the Israeli military refused to obey, sometimes deliberately dithering until it was too late. Had they not done so, hundreds of ordinary passengers would have died in what Bergman calls ‘an intentional war crime’.No doubt all this will be grist to the mill of Israel’s critics. On the Left, in particular, criticism of Israel has become an automatic reflex, often tinged with more than a hint of anti-Semitism.There are, of course, good reasons to be critical of Israel. I find it impossible to justify its harsh treatment of the defeated Palestinians, or its callous, cynical policy of expanding Israeli settlements on Palestinian land.Yet after all the Jews have suffered — pogroms, persecution and the unspeakable obscenity of the Holocaust — what reasonable person would begrudge them a homeland of their own?And who can blame them for fighting to defend that homeland from those who would destroy it?Ever since 1948, as Bergman himself points out, the threats to Israel’s existence have been only too real. One of his book’s most powerful images is a picture of an Israeli woman, drenched in her own blood, being carried away after a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv.Sharon used to show it to foreign diplomats whenever they questioned Israel’s targeted assassination programme. Given Israel’s bloody history and dangerous present, I understand why its agents feel they must act as they do.The question, though, is whether the killings are working. For the past 70 years, the deaths have piled up, yet still there is no peace. The blood flows, but still Israel is not safe.Its enemies, of course, deserve a large share of the blame. But perhaps killing has become so easy that Israel’s leaders have stopped looking for other solutions. Either way, the end is nowhere in sight — and so Mossad’s killings go on. Because of their secretive nature, they rarely make the headlines.But even as you are reading these words, someone, somewhere, is planning the next hit. Rise And Kill First: The Secret History Of Israel’s Targeted Assassinations, by Ronen Bergman, is published by John Murray, price £20. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/27/20/4EA0AC1B00000578-0-image-a-3_1532718332079.jpg","title":"Britain increasing foreign aid booming China oil rich Nigeria","story":"    Britain is giving ever-increasing amounts of foreign aid to booming China and oil-rich Nigeria, accounts have revealed (stock image)Meanwhile, Britain gave £92.6million to India – which also has its own space mission – despite promises by ministers to stop funding the fast-growing country.The spending comes as public services in Britain are crying out for cash.Many town halls say they don’t have enough money to deal with the social care crisis. Schools and care homes are also desperate for increased Government spending, while Theresa May has promised to find an extra £20billion for the NHS.Last night, MPs demanded a ‘root-and-branch’ reform of aid spending and a fresh review of Britain’s commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid. Silicon Valley spies: The murky web of Chinese tech workers,...Awkward moment Trump reaches out to hold EU chief Juncker\u0027s...Share this articleThe report from the Department for International Development (DfID) showed that while the department had stopped its aid programme to China in 2011, other Whitehall ministries continue to hand over large sums. These amounts contribute towards the 0.7 per cent target. Of the £46.9million handed over last year, 56 per cent came from the business department and 27 per cent from the Foreign Office.UK-funded schemes included a schools programme to encourage children to consume less salt, and improving dementia care in the port city of Qingdao. Britain has also underwritten a European scheme to help China plant trees to compensate for its contribution to global warming.Campaigners have been asking why the UK is still funding competitors whose economies are racing ahead.Only yesterday the Chinese shopping app Pinduoduo – valued at double the entire British aid budget of £13.9billion – was floated on the New York stock exchange.As the app debuted on the Nasdaq, its share prices soared by 35 per cent, giving the company a value of £26billion.China is so wealthy that it has its own aid programme. The superpower also spends millions on new airports and urban development.James Price, campaign manager at the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘Time and again we have been told by politicians across Whitehall that the unjustifiable sending of taxpayers’ hard-earned cash to countries with space programmes and larger economies than our own would stop. But it hasn’t. This is completely unacceptable and tantamount to lying.’ Meanwhile, Britain’s aid grants to oil-rich Nigeria have come in for criticism. Three years ago it was reported that the west African country paid nearly 24,000 salaries to non-existent government workers.The country’s space programme spent millions buying three satellites and plans to send a man into space by 2030.A study of one £230million British aid programme to boost schools in Nigeria found it had produced ‘no major improvement in pupil learning’. Researchers found teachers at subsidised schools frequently failed to turn up and children were left to play football all day.The Government pledged to end aid to wealthy India in 2012. Despite this, tens of millions are still pouring in. Last year’s total was more than £92million – although this was less than the previous year.Some 59 per cent of India’s aid was given by DfID and 21 per cent by the business department. Much of the money goes towards what DfID describes as ‘technical assistance’ programmes. Other departments fund private sector programmes that help the poor.The UK is now the only major economy in the world to hit the controversial foreign aid spending target.Tory MP Andrew Rosindell said: ‘There is little public support for this 0.7 ring-fenced, inflation-proof budget, when vital services are being cut back here in the UK. A root and branch review of DfID, its budget and operations is needed and ministers need to take control back from empire-building officials or risk a collapse in public support all together.’A Government spokesman said: ‘Our aid commitment increases Britain’s global influence and alongside our world class defence and diplomacy helps the UK to create opportunity, peace and prosperity worldwide... We have robust processes in place to scrutinise our projects to ensure that all UK aid is effective and represents value for money.’Although Nigeria is oil-rich, a third of its population is below the national poverty line. Since 2016, UK aid increased in light of the humanitarian crisis driven by the Boko Haram jihadists.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/25/23/4E91FAC500000578-0-image-m-21_1532557259228.jpg","title":"Two women leave dog car hottest day year","story":"    This dog was left trapped in a car in Exeter on the hottest day of the year while its owner went to the shops.

Users in Europe dropped from 377 million to 376 million, partly as a result of the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules. The plunging share prices follows months of criticism leveled against the social media giant over its handling of several recent scandals, including the Cambridge Analytica data saga and Russian meddling in the US election. The Cambridge Analytica scandal prompted several apologies from Zuckerberg and generated calls for users to desert Facebook, which has grown strongly since launching as a public company in 2012.Industry experts had predicted, ahead of the announcement, that the number of active users visiting the social network would either drop or flat line.According to analysts, stalling numbers are likely the result of forcing Facebook users to consciously opt-in to having their information used for personal advertising - one of the key stipulations of the stringent GDPR rules.    GDPR, which came into affect May 25, stipulates that companies must explicitly request consent from their users in order to personal data for advertising purposes. Companies that do not comply with GDPR can be fined up to four per cent of their global revenue. To comply with the new regulations, Facebook rolled-out a security check-up to users worldwide which asked them to review what kind of personal information they consent to sharing for advertising targeting. Users were also asked to consent to facial recognition technology on the site. Analysts believe users may have been scared off by the explicit details about how their data is being used by the social network. It comes after shareholders tried to fire Zuckerberg as chairman of Facebook in a proposal filed on Wednesday by Investment company Trillium Asset Management.The company, who has about $11 million in Facebook stock, wants to break up Zuckerberg\u0027s role as both chairman and CEO, Business Insider reports.The proposal argues that shareholders are unable to check Zuckerberg\u0027s power given he holds roughly 60 percent of Facebook\u0027s voting shares as both chair and CEO.\u0027A CEO who also serves as chair can exert excessive influence on the board and its agenda, weakening the board\u0027s oversight of management,\u0027 the proposal states.\u0027Separating the chair and CEO positions reduces this conflict, and an independent chair provides the clearest separation of power between the CEO and the rest of the board.\u0027 The investment company says this oversight has contributed to Facebook \u0027missing or mishandling\u0027 several \u0027severe controversies\u0027 in past years, which they say increases risk exposure and costs to shareholders. The specific examples the shareholders used include: Russian meddling in US election, the sharing of 87 million users\u0027 personal data with Cambridge Analytica, proliferating fake news and social unrest in Myanmar and Sri Lanka.Chances of Zuckerberg\u0027s roles being split remain slim given Facebook has  rejected similar shareholder requests in the past. A proposal last year to oust Zuckerberg as chairman received 51 percent of the votes.Meanwhile, in addition to the financial woes, a promotional event for Facebook\u0027s new video feature descended into a shouting match on Wednesday, as reporters quizzed the social media giant\u0027s executives about its decision to allow Fox News and Infowars on the platform. Facebook will be featuring Fox News alongside other news organizations on Watch, while right-wing conspiracy theory site Infowars has a Facebook page that is followed by nearly a million people. The debate at the Television Critics Association\u0027s press tour in Beverly Hills began when Facebook\u0027s head of video was asked why Facebook still hosted Infowars when it peddled conspiracy theories including calling the Sandy Hook massacre a hoax.          Ricky Van Veen, Head of Global Creative Strategy and Fidji Simo, Director of Product at Facebook, had combative exchanges with reporters at an event to promote Facebook Watch in Beverly Hills on Wednesday  Leonard Pozner (left with Noah) and Veronique Pozner\u0027s (right) six-year-old son, Noah, died in the December 2012 Newtown shooting massacre. They wrote a letter to Zuckerberg saying they were being harassed on Facebook by conspiracy theorists Other parents of Sandy Hook victims and people affected by other mass shootings, including the one that killed 17 people at a Florida high school, have made similar requests of Facebook, Twitter and other social media companies.Zuckerberg raised eyebrows in an interview with Recode last week when he said he finds denial of the Holocaust \u0027deeply offensive\u0027 but doesn\u0027t believe such content should be banned from Facebook. \u0027What we will do,\u0027 he said, \u0027is we\u0027ll say, \u0027Okay, you have your page, and if you\u0027re not trying to organize harm against someone, or attacking someone, then you can put up that content on your page, even if people might disagree with it or find it offensive.\u0027\u0027He also said in the interview that the claim the Sandy Hook shooting didn\u0027t happen is false.\u0027I also think that going to someone who is a victim of Sandy Hook and telling them, \u0027Hey, no, you\u0027re a liar\u0027 - that is harassment, and we actually will take that down,\u0027 Zuckerberg said.  Terms of Service Violation"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/27/18/4EA0D0DC00000578-5999787-image-a-50_1532712146116.jpg","title":"Nod Disneys 73 1B acquisition Fox entertainment","story":"    The Walt Disney Company and 21st Century Fox announced Friday that shareholders approved Disney\u0027s $71.3billion acquisition of Fox\u0027s entertainment ision, bringing blockbuster Disney properties like The Avengers franchise (above) together with Fox hits          The deal includes Fox blockbusters, such as Deadpool (above), as well as Fox\u0027s film and TV studios, its cable entertainment networks and 30 per cent share of streaming platform Hulu The shareholder vote caps a saga that began in December 2017, when Disney made its first offer for part of Rupert Murdoch\u0027s media conglomerate. It kicked off a bidding war with Comcast, which dropped its $65billion offer last week to focus on an attempted buyout of the European pay-TV operator Sky.The Fox deal will help Disney compete with technology players like Amazon and Netflix, as the deal would include Fox\u0027s 30 per cent stake in streaming company Hulu. The agreement is not expected to close for several months and still requires regulatory approvals.   While Disney might get a monopoly on blockbuster film franchises (Fox\u0027s X-Men and Disney\u0027s Star Wars, included), the deal does not cover Fox\u0027s sports assets, which are being spun offShare this articleThe Disney acquisition is not expected to be finalized for several month and still requires additional governement regulatory approvalIn June, the US Department of Justice gave its consent for the merger, provided Fox Sports\u0027 22 regional networks were not included in the deal.

So why is such a glamorous property at the centre of a controversy?One reason has to do with the owner himself, the notoriously combustible Gordon Ramsay (hence the culinary joke in the blurb) who has not always endeared himself to locals.Ramsay, it would be fair to say — a man who could start an argument in an empty room — is about as popular among some Cornwellians as the food served up at one of the sub- standard establishments featured in his Kitchen Nightmares TV show.Incidents such as the following encounter have not helped. When a resident spotted Ramsay in town and excitedly asked to have a ‘selfie’ taken with him, the irascible restaurateur is said to have pulled his cap down over his face and turned away in a hurry.‘He said he was on holiday and didn’t want to be disturbed,’ reveals a friend of the person who was left disappointed by his fleeting meeting with the celebrity chef.‘Fair enough, I suppose, but it wouldn’t have taken long to do a quick picture.’EXCLUSIVE: Hotshot Sydney recruiter is revealed as the man...Tana Ramsay reveals she has forgiven her father for hacking...Share this articleThere is a more fundamental reason, though, why, aside from his forthright manner, Ramsay is not flavour of the month with everyone in Cornwall. For a start, his luxury holiday home in the picturesque harbour town of Fowey, which is being rented out, is his third property in the county.Second homes provoke strong feelings in places like Cornwall. The invasion of wealthy middle-class second home owners from outside has been blamed for pushing up property prices, forcing locals out of the housing market in the process, and turning parts of Cornwall into Chelsea-on-Sea in summer and ghost towns in winter.So being a second home owner three times over is unlikely to win you many friends in this part of the world.One woman summed up the opinions of many in the local community when she said that Ferrari-driving Ramsay, fined £500 not so long ago for speeding on Bodmin Moor in his Range Rover, was just ‘showing off with his money’, adding: ‘Why do you need three places in Cornwall?’          Ramsay\u0027s first property, purchased for £4,400,000 in 2015, in the village of Rock          Ramsay bought this £4million beach house in Trebetherick in 2016 to stay in while work is carried out on his residence in Rock          The latest addition to his Ramsay\u0027s Cornish portfolio: Formerly Fowey’s last bank, Ramsay acquired the building for £1.9million last year and converted it into a stunning seaside retreatFather-of-four Ramsay, 51, has certainly splashed the cash around. His first property, purchased for £4,400,000 in 2015, was in the village of Rock, a favourite haunt of the young Princes William and Harry.He had this demolished, despite objections from neighbours — who are still furious with him — and got planning permission to replace the traditional beachfront home with a bigger ‘Grand Designs’ mansion currently under construction.The following year, Ramsay bought a beach house (also £4million) a few miles away in Trebetherick, simply to stay in while work is carried out on the Rock residence.The latest addition to his Cornish portfolio was formerly Fowey’s last bank but had closed before Ramsay acquired the building (for £1.9million) last year and converted it into a stunning seaside retreat.Potential customers are cordially invited to ‘breathe in the beautifully-scented sea air and soak in the calm’ by the agency marketing the rental property.Of course, this ozone comes at a price: £7,000 a week, to be precise, or £3,525 for a long weekend. There’s an extra £30 charge if you have a dog. This is a standard fee, apparently, in holiday rentals, charged by the cleaners for wiping up mucky paw prints (or worse).‘It’s mad money, but people seem daft enough to pay it,’ said Paula Trewick, steward of the Fowey Gallant Sailing Club, this week.  Jetsetters: Ramsay steps out with his wife Tana in sunny Los Angeles on WednesdayHad the old Lloyds bank been so profitable, it would probably still be open today. Instead, the income from the Fowey townhouse — which has received ‘lots of inquiries’ since recently coming onto the market — will boost Ramsay’s already fabulous wealth.His restaurant empire alone is worth in excess of £46 million. He also has homes in London and Los Angeles and owns no fewer than eight Ferraris.He rakes in a fortune from his many TV commitments — including a new deal with Fox and the Discovery Channel to make a ‘Bear Grylls meets Kitchen Nightmares’ type series, which will see Ramsay travelling to the ends of the earth on culinary adventures.‘Cornwall is the place where I see Gordon really relax,’ his wife Tana said in an interview with the Sunday Times last week. But how much time does he actually spend in Rock, Trebetherick or Fowey?‘The reality is that he spends most of his time in LA,’ a source close to Ramsay told us this week.‘When he’s not there, he’s either on the road filming or working and socialising in London. Cornwall comes a very distant fourth.’          TV chef Ramsay is not flavour of the month with everyone in CornwallIt’s a familiar story. More than a third of properties in Fowey (population around 3,000) are now second or rental homes. This has helped push the average price of a flat to over £300,000 and a detached house to more than £400,000.Yet, the typical wage across the county is less than £19,000 and household incomes are below 75 per cent of the EU average. Cornwall is among the poorest regions in Northern Europe — despite its image as a playground for the rich and famous.Only last month, residents in the fishing village of Mevagissey voted overwhelmingly to ban the purchase of second homes. The result, said councillors, proved people ‘want strong and positive local planning legislation to protect’ the area.The precedent for such a policy was set in St Ives. In 2016, the High Court ruled that St Ives could keep its ban on new-build second homes after the town voted to reserve new homes for full-time residents.The fact that Ramsay is also making a handsome profit out of the Fowey property, which shut as a Lloyds branch three years ago, has served only to inflame the debate.‘This is the sort of c*** which prices locals out of their own town,’ said Fowey resident Kerri Lee, in language Ramsay would probably recognise, on the Cornwall Facebook page. While Sarah Carter said: ‘He’s giving the impression only Hooray Henrys visit Cornwall and that simply isn’t the case.’Joseph Ryan, 18, who works in a chip shop in Fowey, believes the town is going the same way as neighbouring Polperro where ‘you can only see ten lights on in winter because all the other houses are second homes’.Second home owners are encouraged to make a donation to the Cornwall Community Foundation to help pay for affordable housing for locals.Among those to have contributed to the charitable scheme is Alex Polizzi, presenter of TV’s The Hotel Inspector, who owns a cottage in St Mawes. Gordon Ramsay indicated he would consider contributing after the scheme was launched two years ago. So did he? The Foundation declined to say when contacted this week.Second homes are also an issue in Rock but, over here on the north coast, Ramsay is embroiled in a more old-fashioned dispute.Neighbours were up in arms when they found out he was going to demolish the ‘historically impressive’ 1920s Arts and Crafts-style home he bought three years ago and build a modernist villa with white walls and a zinc façade, comprising a gym, pool, cellar and a guest annexe.In all, there were 17 separate objections. Among the fiercest critics was the tycoon who lives next door. Ironically, Andrew Nisbet, head of kitchen equipment firm Nisbets, is one of Ramsay’s biggest suppliers.Mr Nisbet’s views are spelled out in a legal letter filed at Cornwall County Council. In blunt Ramsayesque language (minus the use of the F-word), it describes the project as ‘inappropriate, unsympathetic and unneighbourly’.Mr Nisbet and his wife Anne took particular exception to the planned annexe, claiming it will compromise their privacy because the ‘window to window distance between the annexe and their residence is just 25 yards’.          Father-of-four Ramsay, 51, has acquired an impressive Cornish property portfolioThey also said that Ramsay’s plans to increase the height of the chimney will lead to smoke being blown towards their windows.Nevertheless, the original house has now been bulldozed and work has begun on a new main house and annexe.Until recently, at least, a sign on the site read: ‘Gordon Ramsay Construction.’ We were unable to establish if this was a genuine firm or whether Ramsay was just having the last laugh at his neighbours’ expense. Not surprisingly, you can cut the atmosphere with a (chef’s) knife in this corner of Rock.Annie Haynes, whose home overlooks Ramsay’s, said: ‘The house he bought was a wonderful place, but he has just stuck two fingers up to the concerns of those of us who have to live here all year round.‘The whole of Rock has changed in recent years. A lot of properties overlooking the estuary have been sold and more of them are being knocked down and new houses put up. Many are monstrous — all metal and windows.‘The old traditional homes no longer seem good enough for the people who come down here a couple of times a year. In winter, the place is deserted.’When the dispute first erupted, a spokesman for Ramsay said that ‘Gordon, Tana and the family are very much looking forward to spending time in their new home in Cornwall. They are committed to, and delighted to be investing in, the future of the Cornish community they will hopefully be part of for many years to come.’Ramsay, dressed in shorts and a T-shirt, is a regular customer at cafes and pubs in Rock.‘He has been very polite so far,’ said one local. ‘We get the feeling he is on his best behaviour because there has been a lot of anger about him knocking down the house. But that’s what the rich do around here. They buy somewhere for the view and tear it down so they can put something trendy up.’Ramsay thrives on controversy, though. Indeed, he has made a career out of it — both on and off camera.He was once inseparable from his father-in-law, Chris Hutcheson, who managed Gordon Ramsay Holdings, until they fell out when Ramsay accused Hutcheson of plundering £1.4 million from his business and sacked him.Hutcheson was jailed for six months last year after an expert hired by Ramsay discovered he had hacked into the company’s computer system following his dismissal.As someone who worked closely with Ramsay for many years says: ‘Gordon will go to great lengths to get what he wants and feel that he’s winning.’A fact which will undoubtedly fill his Cornish neighbours’ hearts with sorrow. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/27/11/4E9DE25C00000578-0-image-a-28_1532686890061.jpg","title":"Universities offering unconditional places harm level results","story":"    Students enjoying the sunshine in Russell Square, London. Almost half of students who get unconditional offers do not reach minimum A-level requirements for coursesStudents traditionally have been given university places on condition that they achieve certain grades – but an unconditional offer means they get their place regardless of how badly they perform.The statistics show students slack off in their exams once grades are no longer integral to going to university. It is a pattern likely to be similar at dozens of other universities which have been dishing out unconditional offers this year.A Daily Mail investigation has found elite Russell Group universities Birmingham, Newcastle and Queen’s Belfast all make unconditional offers as do Sussex and Lancaster. Female private school teacher, 35, who groomed and sexually...\u0027Your child is on track\u0027: Principal says C grades should be...Share this articleAcross all universities, more than a fifth of students received unconditional offers this year.Yesterday, critics accused universities of damaging students’ employment prospects by encouraging them to take their feet off the pedal in sixth-form studies.Alan Smithers, professor of education at the University of Buckingham, said: ‘Students with unconditional offers may not work to their fullest for their A-levels.‘Employers are increasingly unconvinced by degree classifications, as so many students are now leaving with firsts and 2:1s. They are often looking at A-levels to see how able candidates are in comparison with other young people.’          An unconditional offer means students get their university place regardless of how badly they performOf 181 students given an unconditional offer at Kent last year, 44 per cent failed to achieve the standard entry requirement of ABB. The offers related to two departments – English and history. Of those given offers for English, who accepted, 2 per cent dropped seven grades. Kent University’s report said: ‘The discrepancy in grades between predicted and actual grades is a concern and one the department was more than aware of when entering into the scheme. There were a handful of students who would not have been made offers to study English with their actual grades if they had not been made an unconditional offer.’ A survey by this newspaper has also found other incentives are being offered to entice students.Universities are fiercely competing to attract students after the numbers cap was lifted, which has created an oversupply of places.At Queen’s University Belfast, students are offered tuition fee help, free flights home, sports membership, cinema passes and free bedding. It uses a ‘gif’ – or short video – of pop star Rihanna to advertise its incentive scheme.The revelations come after universities minister Sam Gyimah branded universities ‘irresponsible’ for focusing on ‘bums on seats’ rather than encouraging high A-level performance. He threatened to stop universities making offers before A-level results day unless they mend their ways.n The London School of Economics is way below average for student satisfaction despite promising to improve a year ago, with students claiming it cares too much about its international research reputation.A National Student Survey shows levels fell three points to 71 per cent – the average for all universities is 83. LSE director Minouche Shafik said: ‘Improving student satisfaction is our top priority.

Not only have Mossad’s secret agents killed more people than the agents of any other state since World War II, but the pace has rapidly increased, with some 800 operations in the past decade.Hugged by a monster: Syrian dictator Assad and his British...Israel\u0027s Defence Minister vows to build 400 new homes in the...Share this articleThe number of deaths will never be known for sure, but they are in the thousands.There is, of course, something irresistibly fascinating about the idea of the globe-trotting secret agent, moving through the murky world of Middle Eastern politics with a licence to kill. And some of Bergman’s stories do have the flavour of a Hollywood spy blockbuster.One operation in 1968 was directly inspired by the film The Manchurian Candidate, with Mossad hiring a Swedish-born psychologist to brainwash a Palestinian prisoner into murdering Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organisation.The psychologist picked a suitable prisoner and spent three months hypnotising him with the simple message: ‘Arafat bad. He must be removed’.The prisoner, known only as Fatkhi, was trained to shoot at pictures of Arafat, hidden in a specially prepared room.          Revenge: Ali Hassan Salameh (pictured) whose group murdered 11 Israeli athletes, was killed in a Mossad bombing,On December 19, 1968, a Mossad team smuggled Fatkhi across the River Jordan, from where he was supposed to infiltrate Arafat’s headquarters.Then they waited. Five hours later, news came. Fatkhi had wasted no time. He had gone straight to a police station and accused Mossad of trying to brainwash him. The operation was an abject failure.In recent years, however, Mossad has lived up to its reputation as the most efficient secret killing machine in the world. One operation in Dubai proves the point. In January 2010, a team of several dozen Mossad agents flew to the oil-rich emirate on false passports, wearing wigs and false moustaches.Disguised as tourists and tennis players — some of them even carried racquets — they broke into a room at the luxurious Al-Bustan Hotel.There they waited for their quarry, top Hamas operative Mahmoud al-Mabhouh. As soon as al-Mabhouh let himself into his room, they grabbed him and used a high-tech ultrasound instrument to inject poison into his neck without even breaking the skin.He died within moments. Four hours later, most of the team had already flown out of Dubai. Job done.          Revenge: Ali Hassan Salameh, whose group murdered 11 Israeli athletes, was killed in a Mossad bombing, pictured All this might sound swashbuckling or heroic. In reality, there is nothing glamorous about Bergman’s story.Indeed, the first man to die in his book is not some Palestinian terrorist or Left-wing extremist. It is a British policeman: Detective Superintendent Tom Wilkin, from Aldeburgh on the Suffolk coast.In the autumn of 1944, Wilkin was in Jerusalem, where he was in charge of cracking down on Zionist guerillas.At the time, Jerusalem was part of British-governed Palestine, where the authorities were struggling to keep a lid on the tensions between Zionists — who wanted an independent Jewish state — and their Palestinian neighbours.To the Jewish militants in the terrorist Stern Gang, Wilkin was not a man. He was a target. In September, 1944, as he was strolling down a street, a boy sitting outside a grocery store threw down his hat — a sign the target was in range.Moments later, two young Jewish men opened fire with revolvers. Wilkin ‘managed to turn around and draw his pistol,’ one assailant, David Shomron, recalled, ‘but then he fell face first. A spurt of blood came out of his forehead, like a fountain.’Shomron did not feel the slightest remorse. ‘Not even a little twinge of guilt,’ he said later. ‘We believed the more coffins that reached London, the closer the day of freedom would be.’  One operation in 1968 was directly inspired by the film The Manchurian CandidateThat terrible phrase — ‘the more coffins that reached London’ — captures the mood of Bergman’s book. For, as cold-blooded as this sounds, Shomron was proved right.Faced with a wave of killings, including the infamous 1946 bombing of the King David Hotel in Jerusalem, in which 91 mostly British officials were killed, Clement Attlee’s government decided to get out. The Zionists got what they wanted.But the blood that gushed from poor Tom Wilkin’s head would soon become a torrent.The state of Israel was born amid brutal ethnic cleansing, with Jewish and Palestinian neighbours slaughtering one another in their thousands, while the new country’s Arab neighbours tried to strangle it at birth. It is hardly surprising that, ever since, Israel’s leaders have been driven by insecurity. After all, Israel has always been surrounded by hostile states, most of which deny that it even has the right to exist.On top of that, no Israeli can ever forget the awful shadow of the Holocaust, in which six million Jews were slaughtered by the Nazis.          Former Mossad director Meir Dagan (pictured) who ordered hundreds of assassinations between 2002 and 2011, kept a picture of his Polish-born grandfather, on his knees and surrounded by German soldiers, moments before he was shot and thrown into a mass graveEven today, hatred of Jews remains a monstrous feature of Europe’s political landscape — as evidenced by the appalling goings-on inside the Labour Party, where leader Jeremy Corbyn and his friends have turned a blind eye to the resurgence of the most poisonous anti- Semitism. No wonder, then, that in the struggle for survival, Israel’s leaders have reached so often for the bomb and bullet.‘If someone comes to kill you,’ says the sacred Jewish text, the Talmud, ‘rise up and kill him first.’As Bergman argues, that has been the principle guiding Mossad, as well as Israel’s internal security service Shin Bet and the army intelligence agency Aman, since the state’s foundation 70 years ago.Former Mossad director Meir Dagan, who ordered hundreds of assassinations between 2002 and 2011, kept a picture of his Polish-born grandfather, on his knees and surrounded by German soldiers, moments before he was shot and thrown into a mass grave.The lesson, Dagan told Bergman before his death in 2016, was that ‘most of the Jews in the Holocaust died without fighting. We must never reach that situation again, kneeling, without the ability to fight for our lives.’Bergman’s own story, by the way, is fascinating. Although this book has earned him a reputation as a whistle-blower, he is the very antithesis of a simplistic, bleeding-hearted activist.Born in 1972 to parents who were both Holocaust survivors, he did his national service in the intelligence unit of Israel’s Military Police Corps, has a PhD from Cambridge and is now a senior correspondent for Israel’s largest newspaper.Based on 1,000 interviews and vast numbers of leaked documents, his book often reads like a John le Carre novel. But it took considerable courage for him to publish it.          The document taken by a Nazi officer was found in the camp after it\u0027s liberation on April 15, 1945. Hidden in Argentina, Eichmann was captured in a street of a Buenos Aires suburb by a team of Mossad and Shin Bet agents on May 11, 1960 and taken to Israel without being detected by Argentine authorities. Eichmann was tried, sentenced to death and executed in Jerusalem on May 30, 1962While he was working on it, the chief of the Israel Defense Forces accused him of ‘aggravated espionage’ and even asked the security services to take action against him.Why? The reason is that Bergman sheds an unsparing light on the human cost of Israel’s targeted killings policy. He shows, for example, that when operations have taken place overseas, Israel’s agents were, and probably still are, unforgivably casual about civilian victims.Perhaps the most chilling section of his book concerns an operation in 1973 — and which was about as far from the glamour and romance of a James Bond thriller as you could possibly imagine.That summer, Mossad was on the hunt for Ali Hassan Salameh, one of the most wanted men in the world. Salameh was chief of operations for Black September, the Palestinian terrorist group that murdered 11 Israeli athletes at the 1972 Olympics.Mossad wanted him dead, but the trail had gone cold. Then came a miracle. In Lillehammer, Norway, an Israeli secret agent spotted Salameh in a cafe. Word went back to Tel Aviv and a hit squad was assembled. On July 21, as Salameh and his girlfriend got off a bus on their way home from the cinema, the assassins were waiting in a rented Volvo. They leaped out of the car, fired eight shots, jumped back in their car and screeched away, leaving their target in a pool of blood.It was almost the perfect hit, but for just one problem. They had killed the wrong man.It was not Salameh, but Ahmed Bouchikhi, a Moroccan waiter with a heavily pregnant wife.In the aftermath, Norwegian police arrested six Israeli agents. Five served time in Norway, though all were released quickly under a secret deal. When the five returned to Israel, they were greeted as heroes. Few questioned the basic morality of the operation it was just a shame, they thought, that Mossad had got the wrong man.But they did get him eventually. On January 22, 1979, Salameh had just left his Beirut apartment when a female Israeli agent, watching from her balcony, pressed a button and a gigantic car bomb ripped through the street.Eight bystanders were also killed, including a German nun and a British student, but nobody at Mossad cared. ‘You get used to killing,’ explains former security chief Ami Ayalon. ‘Human life becomes easy to dispose of. You spend a quarter of an hour, 20 minutes, on who to kill.’In a chillingly familiar phrase, Ayalon even calls this the ‘banality of evil’ — words borrowed from the German philosopher Hannah Arendt, who used it to describe the Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann. That tells its own story.And although Bergman shows why decent people can feel they have no choice but to take terrible decisions, he also shows the consequences of crossing the line between good and evil.In the early Eighties, for example, Israeli defence minister, and later prime minister, Ariel Sharon’s obsession with killing Yasser Arafat led him into one of the darkest chapters in Israel’s modern history. At the time, Israel was embroiled in a horrific civil war in Lebanon, which killed at least 120,000 people.There, on Sharon’s orders, his army colluded with the local Christian Phalange, a militia who murdered hundreds, if not thousands, of Muslims in a Beirut slaughterhouse, cut off their ears as souvenirs and buried their bodies in lime pits. Almost incredibly, Sharon did not stop there.Some of Bergman’s interviewees told him that on five occasions in 1982, Sharon seriously contemplated shooting down an ordinary civilian airliner when he heard that Arafat might be aboard.On each occasion the Israeli military refused to obey, sometimes deliberately dithering until it was too late. Had they not done so, hundreds of ordinary passengers would have died in what Bergman calls ‘an intentional war crime’.No doubt all this will be grist to the mill of Israel’s critics. On the Left, in particular, criticism of Israel has become an automatic reflex, often tinged with more than a hint of anti-Semitism.There are, of course, good reasons to be critical of Israel. I find it impossible to justify its harsh treatment of the defeated Palestinians, or its callous, cynical policy of expanding Israeli settlements on Palestinian land.Yet after all the Jews have suffered — pogroms, persecution and the unspeakable obscenity of the Holocaust — what reasonable person would begrudge them a homeland of their own?And who can blame them for fighting to defend that homeland from those who would destroy it?Ever since 1948, as Bergman himself points out, the threats to Israel’s existence have been only too real. One of his book’s most powerful images is a picture of an Israeli woman, drenched in her own blood, being carried away after a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv.Sharon used to show it to foreign diplomats whenever they questioned Israel’s targeted assassination programme. Given Israel’s bloody history and dangerous present, I understand why its agents feel they must act as they do.The question, though, is whether the killings are working. For the past 70 years, the deaths have piled up, yet still there is no peace. The blood flows, but still Israel is not safe.Its enemies, of course, deserve a large share of the blame. But perhaps killing has become so easy that Israel’s leaders have stopped looking for other solutions. Either way, the end is nowhere in sight — and so Mossad’s killings go on. Because of their secretive nature, they rarely make the headlines.But even as you are reading these words, someone, somewhere, is planning the next hit. Rise And Kill First: The Secret History Of Israel’s Targeted Assassinations, by Ronen Bergman, is published by John Murray, price £20. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c63334d15842e5e9c653a9db05b925f4f8ba2c2b/144_290_3248_1949/master/3248.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=753643899070a03dafb5bf1992d24f7e","title":"michael stipe volume 1 photographs","story":"The REM singer-songwriter is releasing the first in a series of publications focused on his multifaceted approach to art.

Authors and experts reveal tips and tricks for every age group • And if you need some inspiration, take a look at these modern classicsEach year when we went on holiday, my parents would treat us to a Summer Special comic. The Beano for my older brother, Blue Jeans for me. I can still feel the paper stiff with salt, the pages carrying the sweet coconut tang of Hawaiian Tropic. I didn’t care if the stories were seldom truly special, because something else was. Reading and pleasure went together in a way that they didn’t at any other time of our lives.Summer is the perfect time to encourage children to read. Books draw us into other worlds. A child who reads on holiday enters one new world inside another. But you don’t need to travel to make reading feel adventurous. Reading will build a new world anywhere. You can make this idea three-dimensional for younger children by creating a reading den.My children are seven and 10 and have yet to outgrow our shared story time. We always have a chapter book on the go, even if some weeks it goes more slowly than others. To keep things interesting, we change our reading spots. We have cowered from Cruella de Vil under blankets on the floor, and zipped ourselves inside a tent to read Frances Hodgson Burnett’s The Secret Garden. Switching the time of a shared story is another good way to make it transporting. Stories that are too scary for bedtime (The Machine Gunners by Robert Westall, Coraline by Neil Gaiman, for us) can seem brilliantly subversive in the daytime.A good way to start a long summer of reading is to take children to the library and sign them up for the Summer Reading Challenge. The children’s author and poet Joseph Coelho took part in a precursor to this initiative when he was 10, and still recalls the thrill of nudging his little spaceship counter along the Velcro backing, one notch for each book read. “It turned reading into a sport,” he says. And that turned him into a reader.The challenges of leading children to books alter as they age. But whether they are four or 14, the first rule of encouraging them to read is to read yourself. “When a parent says, ‘I can’t get my child to read’, the first thing we ask is, ‘Do they ever see you read?’,” says Sue Wilkinson, who founded the Reading Agency charity. It’s a good question. I tend to read at bedtime I’m pretty sure my children know I like books, but I’m less sure whether they actually witness me in the act. “They’ve got to see you hanging around the house with a book or a newspaper,” says novelist Claire Fuller. Writer Lara Feigel has a six-year-old son whose school advises that boys benefit from seeing male role models read. “And not on their phone,” Feigel adds. Even before her son knew his alphabet, she would give him a book and they would sit side by side on the sofa he would turn the pages “and pretend to read, next to me reading”. Reading thrives on intimacy.The second rule is to give a child freedom of choice. Stop trying to leave the book you wish them to read in strategic places. For novelist Ross Raisin, this approach is akin to “holding a book in front of a child as if it’s broccoli and telling them how good it will be for them”. He makes this mistake with his own daughter sometimes, “and she never reads those books”.And yet, how many of us have hovered in the bookshop or library while a child’s hands swoop to yet another book by the same author? “We’ve all been guilty of saying, ‘Pick something else!’” says Liz Pichon, author of the Tom Gates series. I have said those very words to my son when he has picked up yet another Tom Gates. But as Pichon says: “The way to suck the joy out of reading is to make them read something.” So let them choose. It’s the reading that counts.Build the bedtime story into a routine. Take it in turns to choose books: this gives a child free will, and you a chance to share your own favourites. Dramatise your reading: change the pace, the tone, the volume. Share out characters so everyone has a voice. Even readers as young as five can enjoy independence. “Let the child read on their own if they can’t get to sleep, allowing them to establish an independent, slightly rebellious intimacy with it,” novelist Diana Evans advises. For readers at the lower end of this age bracket, reading can be tiring. Feigel bargains with her son: they read alternate pages. For Raisin: “Oral storytelling is important too, and can excite an interest in stories that lends itself to more reading. In both my school groups and my own children’s beds, I try to encourage telling stories, making them up. That can be a bit of a challenge for the parent at the end of a day ... but if you involve your child, letting them take over at points, or adding ingredients, it doesn’t really matter if it’s a load of nonsense. Play is better than prescription – something the school system often ignores – so have fun with reading and let the child lead.”But some children still show fear around books. Coelho, who has spent years visiting schools with the Reading Agency, suggests a game can help. “Simple things, like finding the name of an illustrator, a certain coloured spine, or a book with more than 100 pages.” Use your bookshelves at home, or go to the library. This type of challenge helps “to make books themselves objects for fun”, Coelho says.After a reading session, I sometimes quiz my children: what was unusual about the baker’s feet? How did Emil keep his money safe? What plant grew around the door to the secret garden? Or halt the reading at a really exciting place in the narrative and invite each listener to guess what’s going to happen next.For children who love screens, show them the Reading Agency’s book sorter, which holds 825,000 recommendations from children. “Programme” the sorter, click the button and see what titles it serves up… Then go and find them in the library or online.Children at the lower end of this bracket can still enjoy a bedtime story. “It’s a bit like breastfeeding. It can go on much longer than people think,” Craig says. Let the reading evolve to accommodate a child’s changing life. Craig read to her son, who read less independently than her daughter, until he was 12. She searched for things they both enjoyed – “a lot of which was fantasy. The whole of The Lord of the Rings.”My children and I read together only a few times a week now. We snuggle up or lean on each other instead of sitting on laps. We take it in turn to read in different bedrooms. Sometimes I’ll read a few pages and they will read on alone, then we all catch up the next night. The bedtime story is morphing into a mini book club. Building a conversation around books means that reading plays a part in our lives even when we don’t have a book to hand. And occasionally my daughter, who is 10, reads to me. It’s lovely to listen you get to hear how the words sound to your child, which will not be how they sound to you.If a child doesn’t want to read at all, don’t try to foist books on them. “Sometimes it’s about meeting them at their level, and bit by bit widening their horizon,” Coelho says. The best way to reach a football-mad child may be to introduce him or her to the books of Tom Palmer (highly recommended), but if all books are flat-out unappealing, try sharing match reports of their favourite teams. This approach can work with children who love gaming too. “Pretty much every game has a downloadable manual,” Coelho says. “You can get them to read about how best to play the game. They are still learning the importance of reading.” From there, you might be able to lead them on to fiction inspired by computer games. And if they don’t want to turn the pages themselves, Pichon suggests an audiobook. This can also work well when a parent lacks the time or energy to read, and appeals across different age groups.By now your child is probably barely talking to you, so it can feel a tough ask to engage them on the subject of books. But try to keep the dialogue going. Fuller’s children are at university but she likes to ask, “‘What’s happened in your book today?’ My husband and I have that conversation at dinner every day. Perhaps the question will lead on to a discussion.”Recommendations from older siblings and non-parental role models hold huge sway in this age group. “They tend to reject what parents dangle in front of them,” says Craig, who says her daughter gave Suzanne Collins’ The Hunger Games to her son. “They need to feel that books are their own discovery.” It’s important not to judge your child’s taste.For Craig, overcoming a child’s reluctance to read “is a battle in which low cunning, as well as wild enthusiasm, must be deployed”. At the lower end of this age bracket, adult books can exercise an incredible lure. Craig, for instance, used to leave Mary Renault books lying around the house. “People forget that as well as being incredibly scholarly they have got a lot of sex in them. If you say to a 14-year-old boy, ‘I don’t know if you can read that yet because it’s got some stuff in there for adults’, they do, of course, go off and read it.”With so many competing demands for a teenager’s attention, it can take a hard line to make reading happen. “If all else fails, I’m afraid it’s so important that I would say, ‘Guys, we are going to have 20 minutes every afternoon or evening reading time’,” psychologist Linda Blair says. “You’re going to read, and I’m going to read, and that’s that. And they will.” Six weeks, she adds, is the time it takes to change a habit. But what if a child – near enough an adult now – refuses? “Bribe them,” she says. “That shocks a lot of parents. But I say to them, ‘Why do you go to work?’ Make it worth their while. Make reading contingent on a reward. ‘You can stay out later on Friday night.’ Whatever works for the family.” •"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/277234b736e3b563ce9d2f2d0bd5021fcbd5a513/0_224_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5fde415895dffde21e3609d2469f0899","title":"one man and his tesla an electric cars journey to edinburgh","story":"Erratic charging support led to some anxious moments on a long-distance run in a Model S“Oh, I rarely use those,” said Manoj Varathodiyil, gesturing at a pair of public electric car chargers at a West Midlands service station.Instead, the GP has plugged his car into a “supercharger”, one of a network built by US electric carmaker Tesla, exclusively for the use of the firm’s customers.Varathodiyil, who went electric because of concerns over air pollution and fossil fuels, is one of Britain’s vanguard of 160,000 early adopters learning to live with a plug-in car.But what about today? Is the road to zero riddled with potholes? To test the state of infrastructure now, the  embarked on a grand tour of Britain’s car parks, service stations and hotels by driving an electric car from Brighton to Edinburgh. Things started badly. Oil giant Shell recently branched out into electric car charging, so one of its petrol stations in Surrey, just 56 miles into the journey, looked like an ideal coffee stop. But the app could not start the charger. “No sir, I can’t help you from here,” helpline staff said, but insisted workers at the forecourt were “familiar with the procedures”. They were not. Thirty minutes wasted but a more reliable-looking Tesla site 70 miles north beckoned.Fortunately, the  had borrowed a Tesla Model S, which has the longest range of any electric car on sale in the UK, at 319 miles at 70mph, and a price that starts at £66,730 to match. But a closer charger might have been needed for more affordable models, such as the BMW i3 (124-mile range).Chargers are ranked with confusing labels on how quickly they can top up a car’s battery. Fast is better than slow, but rapid is faster than fast, and super is best of all.The Tesla chargers in a Northampton hotel car park were super ones, so half an hour provided another 121 miles of range. Next stop was one of the growing number of rapid chargers at motorway service stations. Signposting was poor but operator Ecotricity’s app was easy enough and, unlike some charging sites, this one in Nottinghamshire had toilets.A short 42-mile drive north ended in the electric equivalent of a satnav guiding you into a lake. The postcode of the charger was a residential road outside Doncaster that led to a dirt road and a dead end. While there are many charger maps – such as Zap Map, PlugShare, Open Charge Map – the postcodes and pins are not always perfectly accurate. Surprisingly, they are not built into Google Maps’s route-mapping.There are also a dizzying array of networks – 35, according to Zap Map. The Doncaster charging spot, newly painted in a hotel car park, was part of the Polar network run by Chargemaster, the UK’s biggest network and now owned by BP. Fragmentation, of networks, maps, payment methods and charging cables, is perhaps the biggest problem facing the electric revolution. Many drivers would like contactless bank cards to be accepted, which only some networks currently offer.Researcher and student Sam Earle called the fragmentation “chaotic”, while electric car driver Simon Canfer said: “Overall, I suspect it’s too fragmented for the mainstream.” Margarida James said: “It is a joke! Too many different companies, you need cards and apps for them all.”As other electric cars drivers noted, they need to plan more than those burning fossil fuels. But the next stop was Harrogate on a whim. Fortunately, a map app threw up a B\u0026ampB with a charger. “I get quite a few people coming for it,” said Tony Hay, who runs Shannon Court guesthouse and installed two chargers a year ago. It is a slow charger, so an hour’s charge added just 20 miles of range (fine for overnight use by guests, who get the electricity for free).After a brief rapid charge at a spa outside Durham – regular drivers said north-south is a “doddle” compared with east-west because there are so many rapids – the last stop in England is Berwick-upon-Tweed.The charger in a maternity ward’s car park was hard to find. Worse, the app did not work, the out-of-hours helpline went through to several people who could not help. They offered a mobile number, which promptly went to voicemail. So no charge for the final 58-mile leg to Edinburgh, a potential headache for an electric car driver with shorter range.Parts of the journey felt like a glimpse of the future, with extremely fast charging points where you can stop for a coffee until an app notification tells you to set off again. But, too often, it feels like being a beta tester, grappling with iffy mapping, broken apps, unhelpful customer support and endless forms.The trip ended with 72 miles of range at an Edinburgh hotel whose electric car point held out the salvation of an overnight charge. But no, the space was occupied by a huge diesel car and the hotel would not move it. had been “ICEd”, a term to describe the surprisingly common practice of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle owners blocking an electric car charger.

Often swinging between repentant and infuriated, she’s has made a number of excuses, apologies and denials about the incident. Here’s a timeline of them so far:On 30 May, a day after ABC had cancelled the show, Barr claimed that she had taken the drug Ambien before she sent the tweets. “It was 2 in the morning and I was ambien tweeting – it was memorial day too – i went 2 far \u0026amp do not want it defended – it was egregious Indefensible. I made a mistake I wish I hadn’t but ... don’t defend it please.” The makers of Ambien, Sanofi, responded by tweeting: “Racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication.”Barr appeared on the podcast of rabbi and longtime friend Shmuley Boteach. In the episode, she talked at length about her Jewish faith and her family and promised she wouldn’t make excuses for what she said. “I don’t want to run off and blather on with excuses,” she said. “But I apologize to anyone who thought, or felt offended and who thought that I meant something that I, in fact, did not mean.”On 19 July, Barr posted two video on her YouTube channel. In one, she speaks calmly to camera, and says she was “speaking without the filter of the biased media” – explaining that she thought Valerie Jarrett was white and said the only reason she was fired was because she voted for Donald Trump which is “that is not allowed in Hollywood”. In the other, she is asked questions by an off-camera interviewer and is seen screaming: “I thought the bitch was white.”Decade-old tweets from s of Galaxy director James Gunn resurfaced last week that included jokes about rape and the Holocaust. Many actors and members of the film industry came to Gunn’s defence, and said he shouldn’t have lost his job for tweets posted so long ago. Barr was horrified by what see saw as hypocrisy and, on 24 July, tweeted: “I’m disgusted to read all of the support for James Gunn’s pedophile jokes – as the same people supported blacklisting me for a joke they didn’t even understand.”On 27 July, Barr gave her first sit-down TV interview since the incident on Sean Hannity’s Fox News show. Hannity, who regularly speaks with Donald Trump and is by far the news host most loyal to the president, repeatedly urged Barr to apologise on air.

Since co-launching coffee company Method Roasters in 2013, the gourmet-entrepreneur has opened food truck-turned-LoHi-hotspot American Grind, two bars (the Way Back and Wayward) and the recently opened daytime diner, Wendell’s.So what’s delicious about Denver? “It’s starting to be taken seriously as a foodie city,” he says. “The food being served here is on par with any in the country. You’re getting high-quality stuff and people who really care.” City-wide, people are pushing to make local, sustainable food accessible to all. “It’s not just fancy farm-to-table restaurants or high-end cocktail bars,” says Gianinetti.  “Diners and neighbourhood restaurants are stepping up and creating really cool options that are supporting our local farms and a range of other local businesses.”And what’s on Denver’s menu next? “We’ve set groundwork for some of the most creative food and beverage offerings that we’ll see in any city over the next five years, with each neighbourhood boasting its own identity and personality and unique food scene.”Cart-DriverAnybody coming to town who wants to get a feel for what Denver is should do themselves a favour and go to Cart-Driver. The pizza is amazing. The atmosphere is great. Everyone who walks into the restaurant feels at home. Go-to order: the clam pizza.SpuntinoTheir food is incredible, but it’s super-passionate owner Elliot Strathmann’s knowledge of digestifs and aperitifs that makes Spuntino. He has a vintage collection of spirits, and if you’re nice enough to him he’ll let you sample some really old Italian amaros.Ratio BeerworksThis is an awesome microbrewery, with a beautiful patio right on Larimer Street. Rather than focus on fringe, crazy varieties, they make the sort of easy-drinking beers that Denver is really loving right now.Western Daughters Butcher ShoppeWhat sustainable, local food should be. If you’re looking to buy meat in Denver, I don’t think anybody does it better than Western Daughters. Owners Kate Kavanaugh and Josh Curtiss have some of the best connections in Colorado for beef, pork and poultry – they don’t compromise on where they source from and what they pay their farmers. And they sell house-made sausage.Hop AlleyChef and owner Tommy Lee knows what people like and delivers it in a really creative way. It’s traditional Chinese food served family-style, but he pushes people’s boundaries at the same time by the end of your experience, you’ve tried something new. It’s a really fun night out in Denver.Amethyst Coffee CompanyOwner Elle Taylor does a great job – her coffee shop is a representation of how she sees the coffee community and what she supports. She has a great following, and I’ve never had a bad cup here.Star BarA great, straightforward little e bar with top craft beers.

Aaron Millar lists his favourite watering holesDenver is known as the “Napa Valley of Beer” for good reason: more hoppy delights are brewed here than anywhere else in the country. Add to that five gold medals at this year’s World Beer Cup Awards (or the Olympics of brewing, as it’s known), more than 100 artisan tap rooms, and the simple fact that beer tastes better looking at the mountains, having climbed mountains or talking about going to the mountains tomorrow. Like a brew with a view? Here are some of Denver’s top hop spots: Tivoli Brewing Company Denver’s oldest brewery has been serving up frothy refreshments since the first settlers arrived in 1859. Check out their historic taproom for a glass of Tivoli Helles Lager, a favourite of the early pioneers, which is still poured to this day.Wynkoop Brewing Company Established in 1988, this is Colorado’s first craft brewpub, and still one of its best and most notorious. Try their Rocky Mountain Oyster Stout, brewed with its namesake (bull’s testicles to you and me the region has no oysters).Ratio Beerworks Set up by a trio of former 90s punk rock touring musicians, this industrial-style taproom in the hip RiNo (River North) Arts District has taken the Denver craft beer scene by storm. Expect slick brews, a sweet patio and one of the coolest live music, arts and event line-ups in the city. Their Dear You French saison is already a classic beer.Denver Beer Trail With four walking routes – each through a different downtown neighbourhood – covering 14 miles and 35 taprooms in total, this is the ultimate craft-brew pub crawl, a half-marathon of beer. Great American Beer Festival Held in Denver each October, this is the largest beer party in the country, with more than 3,500 artisan, classic and rare brews on show. Want a sip of each? Well, good luck: a 1oz sample of every brew on display adds up to 220 pints, or about three bathtubs’ of beer.Telluride Blues \u0026amp Brews The best blues musicians on the planet alongside the best craft beer in the state, all served up in one of the Rockies’ most beautiful towns. It’s every Coloradan’s favourite end-of-summer brews event, and with good reason.If you prefer your glass with a stem, then here’s something to celebrate: with 300 days of sunshine a year, low humidity, and crisp mountain nights, Colorado is overflowing with wine as well as beer. From rieslings and cabernets to wines made from peach, cherries, honey and plums, its high-altitude vineyards – the loftiest in the US – produce a unique regional style.For the best wineries and tours, head over to the Western Slope. Two Rivers Winery – found near the spectacular red rock canyons of the Colorado National Monument – and the award-winning vintages of Carlson Vineyards are two of the best.United Airlines offers a seasonal, non-stop service from London Heathrow to Denver on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner – complete with high-tech cabin lighting and smoother ride technology, plus flat-bed seats in Polaris business class.

Scientists say the global warming has contributed to on the scorching temperatures that have baked the UK and northern Europe for weeks.The hot spell was made more than twice as likely by climate change, a new analysis found, demonstrating an “unambiguous” link. Extreme weather has struck across Europe, from the Arctic Circle to Greece, and across the world, from North America to Japan. “This is the face of climate change,” said Prof Michael Mann, at Penn State University, and one the world’s most eminent climate scientists. “We literally would not have seen these extremes in the absence of climate change.”“The impacts of climate change are no longer subtle,” he told the . “We are seeing them play out in real time and what is happening this summer is a perfect example of that.”“We are seeing our predictions come true,” he said. “As a scientist that is reassuring, but as a citizen of planet Earth, it is very distressing to see that as it means we have not taken the necessary action.”The rapid scientific assessment of the northern European heatwave was done by Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and also colleagues in the World Weather Attribution (WWA) consortium. “We can see the fingerprints of climate change on local extremes,” he said.The current heatwave has been caused by an extraordinary stalling of the jet stream wind, which usually funnels cool Atlantic weather over the continent. This has left hot, dry air in place for two months – far longer than than usual. The stalling of the northern hemisphere jet stream is being increasingly firmly linked to global warming, in particular to the rapid heating of the Arctic and resulting loss of sea ice.Prof Mann said that asking if climate change “causes” specific events is the wrong question: “The relevant question is: ‘Is climate change impacting these events and making them more extreme?’, and we can say with great confidence that it is.”Mann points out that the link between smoking tobacco and lung cancer is a statistical one, which does not prove every cancer was caused by smoking, but epidemiologists know that smoking greatly increases the risk. “That is enough to say that, for all practical purposes, there is a causal connection between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer and it is the same with climate change,” Mann said.Other senior scientists agree the link is clear. Serious climate change is “unfolding before our eyes”, said Prof Rowan Sutton, at the University of Reading. “No one should be in the slightest surprised that we are seeing very serious heatwaves and associated impacts in many parts of the world.”It is not too late to make the significant cuts needed in greenhouse gas emissions, said Mann, because the impacts progressively worsen as global warming increases. “It is not going off a cliff, it is like walking out into a minefield,” he said. “So the argument it is too late to do something would be like saying: ‘I’m just going to keep walking’. That would be absurd – you reverse course and get off that minefield as quick as you can. It is really a question of how bad it is going to get.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f06413fdba42f4c7aefced1d29a3a8530bd593ff/340_371_2395_1437/master/2395.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e46c018dc7690f5ec0a1b8eebb801613","title":"country diary natures darkness creature has become ours too","story":"Stamford, Lincolnshire: Bats are opaque, darkly anonymous silhouettes into which humans project all manner of eerie ideasHere’s a flicker in the periphery. I notice it because of the way it moves it’s a sort of fast fidget – staccato and angular in movement and path, like a movie projected at the wrong frame rate. It doesn’t swoop like a swallow, or bumble like a moth. The bat moves like a bat, and like nothing else.I’m sitting near my home under some trees, watching the coming night deepen the navy sky. The day has been airlessly hot, and with nightfall relief creeps into the air like a balm. Animals are out – I can hear twitches in the bushes behind me. Young frogs hedgehogs maybe. Looking for water. Then I notice this bat. Seconds after I see it, I feel it pass so close that it makes my hair move, with it a split-second rustle of papery wings. I shiver.Bats are just flying mice, people say, except they’re not, at all. Worldwide there are two main groups: Megachiroptera, big-eyed, placid-faced, small-eared – almost anthropomorphic, a man-bat and Microchiroptera, the opposite.Nature’s darkness-creature has over time become ours, too. Their thorny outline is so conversant with the sinister that we nearly forget why. Light never catches them. They are opaque, darkly anonymous silhouettes into which humans project all manner of eerie ideas. Unwittingly, bats reinforce these with their habits. They haunt churches. Fly by night. Sleep subversively inverted. And the one far-flung species that feeds on blood bears the name “vampire” all too neatly.This solitary bat flies about me in rapid loops. This one is maybe a noctule, or a pipistrelle. Catching insects perhaps. I worry that it will hit me but it won’t. It sees by echoing its sounds off nearby objects like aerial sonar, and it’s an excellent way to navigate. Those sounds are too high-pitched for the human ear to detect, and so to us, other than those wings, the bat makes no sound. None at all. I watch it. Bats need to catch air under their wings to fly. They can’t lift off like birds: they must drop. Their flight is a fall, arrested again and again with each frantic flap. That’s why they don’t move like anything else. Except, perhaps, a human trying to fly.

There’s no way I could know in the two minutes I watched, but I inferred a light touch.

Liverpool would still have signed Alisson for a world-record goalkeeping fee had they beaten Real Madrid in May, Klopp confirmed.The Liverpool manager accused Ramos of deliberately targeting Salah and Loris Karius, who suffered concussion moments before gifting Karim Benzema the opening goal, and the referee Milorad Mazic of lacking the courage to dismiss the Real captain in such a high-profile fixture. Klopp had previously kept his counsel on the decisive incidents in Kiev but did not hold back when pressed again on Liverpool’s US tour, insisting Ramos’s history of controversy requires greater scrutiny.“We are opening that bottle again?” said Klopp, speaking before Saturday’s International Champions Cup game against Manchester United. “It is action-reaction-action-reaction and I don’t like that but – if you watch it back and you are not with Real Madrid – then you think it is ruthless and brutal.“I saw the ref taking charge of big games at the World Cup and nobody really thinks about that later. But in a situation like that somebody needs to judge it better. If VAR is coming then it is a situation where you have to look again. Not to give a red card but to look again and say: ‘What is that?’ It was ruthless.He added: “We are aggressive but I always use the word ‘legal as well’. Usually if you try something you will get punished. Someone will see it and ban you for four or five weeks. But in this example, no one. This ref should have had the courage to decide that game. In this situation we didn’t get it and, if you write this, people will say I am weak or a bad loser or a whiner. I am not. I accept it. It’s not like I wake up in the morning and think: ‘Ramos!’Klopp knew Liverpool would be accused of making excuses for defeat by disclosing Karius tested positive for concussion several days after the final but insisted the club had no option but to make the diagnosis public. However, he confirmed, also for the first time, that Liverpool would have pursued the £65m deal for Alisson irrespective of Karius’s display in Kiev.Liverpool inquired about the Brazil international in January and Klopp added: “We didn’t use the concussion as an excuse for one second but how can we not put it out as an explanation? The problem is only now that people still don’t believe it, and then we bring in a new goalkeeper and people think we don’t believe it as well, which is not true.José Mourinho has claimed there is a demand on Liverpool to win the title having spent more than £170m on new players this summer. The United manager also said it was funny Klopp had invested heavily having previously objected to extravagant transfer fees. “I heard he was smiling when he said it and he found it funny,” said the Liverpool manager, “so I am really happy that José is smiling. It doesn’t happen often.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db395978ad1bef6be6669cfdb44a7f3404226ea4/0_0_4000_2401/master/4000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d7191d7d497e289ecf55b6246e348002","title":"france croatia final trophy russia 2018 ends on high world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France’s World Cup final triumph over Croatia, another penalty, another controversial VAR incident, the tournament’s highs and lows and players taking shots to the conkers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/efe709cff879d4155f88a89dd96692cc9425ffcd/917_752_3696_2218/master/3696.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=714a4e41f3c7403d23e5be02c82cb816","title":"six of the best frozen desserts","story":"Cool down with summery treats such as refreshing plum sorbet, vegan frozen cheesecake or honey and ginger semifreddo500g whole, ripe dark plums, such as damson or blood plums100g sugarJuice of ½ large lemonRinse the plums and, without drying them, put them whole in a saucepan over a medium-low heat, add 60ml water, cover and bring to a simmer.As they heat, the plums will release their own juices.

When the syrup reaches 100C on a sugar thermometer, start whisking the egg whites and salt at a medium-high speed in a stand mixer. When the whites form soft peaks and the syrup has reached 121C, slowly dribble the syrup into the whites with the mixer running – avoid pouring syrup on the beater itself. Continue whisking until the meringue has cooled.In another bowl, whisk the cream to soft peaks then fold into the meringue, along with the remaining ingredients and praline.

What’s different about the things that children laugh at, and how can we help them laugh more? It’s well known that if you pull humour apart, you can kill it stone dead. But I’m going to risk a bit of a dissection in the hope that my personal angle into what tickles kids will help you create more laughter.I start here: children (whether they are much loved and also if they are not) experience the world as people with very little power. As parents, most of us tell ourselves this is all for the good, because we are wiser and more knowledgable than they are. The power gap is inescapable. But, of course, as we exert our power, telling children we are right, right, right, we say and do crazy, illogical things, inconsistent things and, sometimes, horrible things.In other words, we are a bit wrong, quite a lot wrong or totally wrong. What’s more, children quite often resist us, so that we are unable to exert that power. Then there are places that children can escape to – in their minds or with their friends – where adult power can’t reach.All this is fertile territory for making them laugh (the source, if you like): moments of authoritarianism gone wrong daft acts of resistance inappropriate line-crossing and taboo-breaking.If you want to discover how to make children laugh – and I truly believe all adults should, because children need laughter – the best place to start is with your own childhood. For me, the core memory is that we were a family that treasured hilarity.I was the youngest, and there was my mother, my father and my brother. They each had their own way of turning anything, from washing up an eggcup to a chase across the North York Moors to catch up with a train, into a comic account. I’m not sure why they did this but if, as Charlie Chaplin directs us, we should look for comedy’s origins in pain, then I can find some of that in my mother’s unspoken loss of a child, my father’s ever-absent father and my brother’s sense that he couldn’t live up to our own father’s expectations.I watched them playing this stuff out in everyday life but, alongside this, there were the books, films and plays that made us all laugh and that were then recycled and remixed into the family sagas and gags. All this made me happy then, makes me happy now and, sometime in the mid-1960s, made me think that I could join in: that I could have a go at writing and performing this stuff, too.As I began to perform – songs, poems, sketches or conjuring tricks – I began to learn what children run with and what they don’t. I discovered that, quite often, an element of surprise or absurdity might be the key to unlocking laughter. Perhaps the way I would say, “Mm?” or the way I played with my eyebrows. I started collecting these, almost as if I was collecting bits of costume. I added them to snatches of dialogue, real, invented, exaggerated or whatever, which if you perform them, get the timing right, seem to work every time.Here’s one that I do: “One time I got into trouble. You know the sort of thing… like… say… I’m in the bedroom and I’m sitting on my brother’s head for half an hour. My dad comes in and he shouts, ‘What do you think you’re doing?’ And I say, ‘I’m sitting on my brother’s head for half an hour.’ And he says, ‘I can see that!’ And I say, ‘Well, if you can see it, why are you asking me?’”When the laughter comes, I hear relief. The father here is trying to control the situation but is losing control. And a child-audience supports the child, asking: “If you can see it, why are you asking me?” The child has exposed the absurdity of what the dad just said.I think at the heart of this laughter is an anxiety born of that lack of power children experience. There are plenty of other areas to explore through this type of humour: worries about what we look like or sound like worries about achievement (perceived lack of) worries about “Am I good enough?” worries about family foibles worries even about illness and death.I found I could play on this anxiety and use it by assuming the role of a child (or the adult behaving like a child) who can’t stop himself doing daft things. This child (or daft adult) might be motivated by greed, ambition or the need to create fantasies at the very moment he should be keeping focused on what’s going on. When children laugh at this, they can feel superior to the silliness of the child I am playing. Again, this is relief: as if they are saying to themselves, “I am not as silly as that boy Michael Rosen was.” Or, “That’s the sort of thing I do thank goodness people are laughing at him for doing that, and not me.” Comedy can act like a lightning rod to channel the anxiety away.Some of the best moments come out of what we might call the transgressive anecdote from our own lives. Any encounter, any situation in which there was a confrontation between us as children and our own parents, or teachers, when we did something daft, can arouse amazement and delight in our children. There’s something wonderful about knowing that our own parents were fallible.People always talk about the timing of jokes, but in a family setup, it’s not so much the timing itself as the time you tell it. Persistent joke-telling is a bore. The trick is to hold the jokes you know for the moment when they will work. I collect joke books and cartoon books, and have always given them to my children. I’ve even written one. Hearing children reading jokes to each other is a treat.Making children laugh isn’t terribly difficult. You just have to understand where the laughter is coming from, and why it’s necessary in a child’s development. I’m no scientist, neurologist or psychologist, but I know it helps them find their way in life, because a child’s world is full of pomposity, rules, BS, notices, announcements, lists, predictable patterns of speech, people pretending to be certain when they’re not.And this is all quite apart from the whole barrage of spin, deceit, fakery and the overblown nonsense of advertising, self-publicity and political chicanery. It is our duty as adults to spend time redressing this power balance by puncturing all of it – with wordplay, inversions, bad puns, altered names and mashups.Enjoy.• How To Make Children Laugh, by Michael Rosen, is published by Quercus at £9.99.

Contrary to the front-page claim, only £3,300 of the payment was for unlawful detention, and al-Waheed was awarded £15,000 for being beaten after his arrest, and a further £15,000 for ill treatment.In its defence, the newspaper argued it had based the reporting on a three-page press summary of the 239-page judgment, combined with previous reporting on the case. Ipso rejected the Daily Mail’s explanation that it was reasonable for it to have relied on previous press coverage, which had referenced the “red-handed” claim, to provide context to the reporting.The newspaper said a major internal investigation was conducted following the decision to publish, and as a result, “strongly worded disciplinary notes were sent to seven senior members of staff”, which made it clear “that if errors of the same nature were to happen again, their careers would be at risk”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7869cd641701b7a72e5c54dee7099dd6d5437f6b/0_191_1452_871/master/1452.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f33615d58b4e1c4240be813a14044cfc","title":"lets move to weston super mare","story":"Banksy’s snarky Dismaland gave the fading seaside town a boost – now all it needs is a big ideaWhat’s going for it? Plans are afoot to magic Weston-super-Mare into Bristol’s Margate. In May, the chief executive of the Arts Council popped by to give the town the princely sum of £50,000, no less, to “build on” the so-called Banksy Effect. I’m no art critic, but I could have sworn there was some irony involved when Mr Banksy brought his Dismaland theme park to Weston in 2015. Little did he know he was actually the local council regeneration strategy: 150,000 people visited £20m poured into local coffers, apparently. Brad Pitt dropped in. The Arts Council called the town an “artistic and cultural dream”, which might be over-egging it a tad. But if by that it means affordable rent and property, delicious geography (three sweeping bays, dreamy views across Bristol Channel, and I do love an iron age hill fort) and a nice line in late Victorian architecture, then maybe they’re on to something. Come on, artists. Do your duty. Regenerate!The case against I sense it may take a little more than £50,000 to turn the town’s fortunes around.

As some asked: was this proof aliens were trying to contact us?The answer came soon enough. Follow-up observations from other telescopes failed to confirm the signal and researchers came to the conclusion that the source of the signal was far closer to home. The chances are it came from a passing plane or a person on a citizens band radio, or was down to a glitch in the telescope’s electronics.It was not the first time public excitement had been whipped up by signals that turned out to be proof of something far less exciting than an advanced extraterrestrial civilisation. And in expectation that more false signals will come, scientists have now created their own Richter-like scale to explain whether a finding is a damp squib or has truly seismic implications.The new scale allows scientists to rate interesting signals detected in searches for extraterrestrial intelligence from 0 to 10, where 0 is nothing to get excited about and 10 is equivalent to “an alien space probe orbiting the Earth or an alien shaking your hand,” said Duncan Forgan, who worked on the project, at the University of St Andrews Centre for Exoplanet Science.There are many alternative explanations that need to be considered when evaluating a potential extraterrestrial signal. “There could be a problem with your telescope or a radio frequency coming from something on Earth,” Forgan said. “You might think you found an alien but actually you found a taxi rank.”Known as Rio 2.0, the scale is a proposed upgrade of an existing Rio scale that is already used by the alien-hunting community. It assigns scores to Seti (“search for extraterrestrial intelligence”) signals by taking into account both the potential implications of the signal and the likelihood that it is genuine, rather than down to natural or human-made phenomena.“We are talking about extraordinary claims here and so you need extraordinary evidence to go with them,” Forgan said. “Ideally this means multiple observations from multiple instruments – as well as from different research teams using the same instruments.”Under the proposals, scientists could issue their own Rio scale number for any interesting signals they detect, but so could fellow academics who review their work for publication. The rating system is also being made available to the public.“It is clear from citizen science projects that the general public are able to complete similar classification tasks with relatively low amounts of training,” the scientists write in the International Journal of Astrobiology.There are an estimated 400bn stars in the Milky Way, and evidence shows that most have planets circling them. But with so many stars being observed, there is a constant risk of technical glitches or spurious signals masquerading as potential alien transmissions.In one of the most recent false alarms, the periodic dimming of a star led to speculation that an advanced extraterrestrial civilisation had built an “alien megastructure” around their star to harvest all of its energy. Thousands of headlines and closer observations later, the real cause turned out to be dust.Jill Tarter, a co-founder of the Seti Institute in Mountain View, California, and an author of the paper, said the new scale could be used like the Richter scale, which describes the severity of earthquakes. A signal is scored immediately and then continuously updated as new data arrives. More credibility will be given to discoveries with multiple independent Rio scores.Tarter, who was the inspiration for the alien-seeking Ellie Arroway in Carl Sagan’s novel Contact and the subsequent movie with Jodie Foster, spotted potential extraterrestrial signals three times in her career, but each time found mundane explanations for them. The group of astronomers behind Rio 2.0 say it could be tested on fictional scenarios such as the one in the film, as well as on historical “false alarms” such as the famous “Wow!” signal.Andrew Siemion, another co-author, and director at the Seti Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley, added: “We absolutely encourage wide assessment of the Rio scale for any purported discovery, particularly by independent scientists. It is critical in any scientific process to have independent review of methods and interpretation.”The new Rio Scale has been submitted to the International Academy of Astronautics Permanent Committee on Seti for official ratification."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8cd67d160dec6cb615f6004e9ad0861902999547/22_2_516_309/master/516.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e237bd1331cfa5585c3b3630533d5dc","title":"stop juul e cigarette from taking off among kids uk told","story":"Ultra-discreet Juul device accused by US campaigners of luring children into addictionAnti-tobacco campaigners are calling for the UK government to act to prevent a new kind of e-cigarette with a super-cool image from taking off among children, as it has done already in America.In the United States, where Juul has been accused of luring children into nicotine addiction, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has launched an undercover blitz to stop illegal sales of Juul products to children and asked eBay to stop all postings.The ultra-discreet device offers flavours such as mango and glacier mint, and campaigners say the vape pens are hugely attractive to teenagers whether or not they smoke. They warn of addiction to a drug that may be safer than tobacco but could have harmful effects on the growing brain.Juul, which looks like a USB stick, has just launched in the UK. It is the subject of three legal actions in the US, filed in New York and California against the San Francisco-based company, alleging that the device has been deceptively marketed as safe. The New York case is brought by the mother of a 15-year-old boy who, she claims, started using Juul in school because all the other kids did and is now addicted to nicotine. Matt Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, called on the UK government to take action to stop Juul becoming the phenomenon among kids in schools that it is in the US. “It is critical for adults to be aware of this and for adults to educate kids, teachers and others who influence them,” he said. “It is essential for the government to rapidly step in and prevent the sort of social media marketing that turned this into a fad.”Juul took off in the US under the radar, he said, depicted in a launch campaign and then on on social media “being used by young, attractive adults in social, sexual settings that made it look like the coolest new thing”.He added: “It was a phenomenon different from anything I have ever seen. Those of us at the national level became aware of it not through traditional government monitoring, but we began to see stories cropping up from school principals and parents in the media who suddenly discovered their kids were using it. It looks like a flash drive. It isn’t surprising adults missed it, at all.”There were hundreds of media reports recounting schoolkids’ experiences, he said. “The first couple of days it was ‘Juuling because it was fun’. Then it was ‘Juuling because I needed to’. Pretty shocking stuff.”Juul is unobtrusive, high-tech in that it is recharged from plugging into a laptop, and produces little vapour or odour, he said. The nicotine it contains is more palatable, coming from nicotine salts, which are also in dry tobacco leaves, rather than freebase nicotine. In the US, the dose has been high – Myers compares the hit to Marlboro cigarettes. But European regulations will restrict Juul to half the dose in the UK. Dan Thomson, UK managing director of Juul, said it had “a global mission to eliminate cigarette smoking” and hoped to help the 7.5 million people in the UK who still smoke. Ashley Gould, chief administrative officer, said the company had seen the stories of use by minors and was talking to the FDA, but said “there is nothing to indicate that the product was designed or marketed to children, because that has never been done”.Studies show vaping among teenagers in the US is not going up, she said. The company was undertaking work itself to establish how many children are using Juul. “It is obvious that some kids are using the product and that is not acceptable to us,” she said, adding that Juul was designed for adult smokers.“What is it that would not be appealing to an adult smoker?” she said. “It’s very easy to use – there are no buttons and no choices.” The launch campaign in 2015 featured models who were over 21 but who looked young, and bright colours were used. “That was a very short-lived campaign,” Gould said. “It did not help us reach our mission. It has not been up for a very long time.” The social media posts were not put up by Juul, she said, and it now has a team employed to find them and get them taken down.Public Health England (PHE) supports the use of e-cigarettes to help smokers quit. “The UK has much stricter regulations than the US,” said Rosanna O’Connor, the body’s director of drugs, alcohol, tobacco and justice.“Juul on sale here has much lower nicotine, print and broadcast ads for e-cigarettes are banned, and selling to or buying for under 18s is against the law. Regular vaping among young people who have never smoked is very rare, while e-cigarettes have become the most popular quitting tool for adult smokers. We will continue to monitor use very carefully but don’t anticipate Juul to change this pattern and hope our experience will be useful to others.”Steve Brine, public health minister said: “The promotion of any tobacco product to children is completely unacceptable. E-cigarettes including Juul cannot be legally sold to young people under 18 and our strict regulations are clear that it is unlawful to promote these products - including on social media platforms. Trading standards have the power to enforce this legislation.”The UK anti-tobacco campaigning group ASH agrees with PHE and welcomes the new arrival. “Juul could be an opportunity for public health,” it said in a statement. “If this product has the same mass appeal for adult smokers in the UK as it has in the US then it may move us closer to a smoke-free future.”But some scientists within the UK dispute the value of e-cigarettes. “The international evidence is now so strong that these products reduce the probability of quitting,” said Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. “I find the position of PHE utterly bizarre. Of course they are going to be promoted on social media. If you were to design a product to get children addicted to nicotine, this is exactly what it would look like.”Steve Brine, public health minister said: “The promotion of any tobacco product to children is completely unacceptable. E-cigarettes including Juul cannot be legally sold to young people under 18 and our strict regulations are clear that it is unlawful to promote these products - including on social media platforms. Trading standards have the power to enforce this legislation.”Does that mean they are harmless?No, they are not harm-free, but there is huge debate over how damaging they are or might be in the future. The main concern is addiction to nicotine, so nobody wants non-smokers to start vaping and get hooked – which could also lead them to start smoking cigarettes.There is some evidence of harm from nicotine itself. The World Health Organization said in a report in August 2016 that exposure to nicotine can damage the development of the foetus during pregnancy and “seems to be involved in the biology of malignant diseases”. It possibly has a damaging effect on the foetal and adolescent brain that could be linked to learning and anxiety disorders. E-cigarettes contain many other chemicals as well, including “glycols, aldehydes, volatile organic compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, tobacco-specific nitrosamines, metals, silicate particles and other elements”. Many of these substances have the potential to cause health harm. However, they are all there in tiny amounts.Is it legal to sell them in the UK?Yes. PHE would like to see companies get a licence for the use of e-cigarettes as medicinal products to help people quit smoking, but that’s expensive and needs a lot of trial data so no company has that sort of licence yet. But they can be sold if they comply with EU regulations, which lay down safety and quality standards and impose advertising restrictions.Can they be marketed to young people?Only to those over the age of 18, but just as kids would smoke behind the bike shed at school, they now try e-cigarettes because they are not supposed to. PHE says there is no evidence they are getting a nicotine habit – but of course there is no long-term data yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57eb14b57e026a56772d4acc823616b318983c4c/345_209_2687_1612/master/2687.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8db0d810461a2488a83d2d41d45877fe","title":"hull fc hull kr super league match report","story":"This was dubbed the most pointless Hull derby in over a decade by, of all people, the Hull KR chairman, Neil Hudgell – but even so it felt like a night where there would be plenty of lessons to learn about both these sides: and so it proved.Despite the fact they both already knew their upcoming direction in the Super 8s, this also emphasised what each can achieve over the next two months. For the hosts, who have now lost four games in succession, the play-offs look more unlikely than they have at any stage before this year.Realistically they must now win four games more than Warrington or Castleford in the final seven games to stand any sort of chance. On current form, that is unlikely. “We’ve got a lot of work to do,” their coach, Lee Radford, conceded.For Hull KR, had they discovered this sort of form a week or two earlier, they could easily be planning to meet Hull again in the Super 8s rather than preparing for the Qualifiers. This is now four victories in five games – not to mention a first derby win in eight meetings with Hull to boot.The Qualifiers bring a lot of uncertainty, as Hull KR know well they were relegated in 2016. However, with several players set to return for the start of the Super 8s, if they keep this form up, they should be a much safer bet to survive this year.Even more encouraging for Hull KR was the performance of their recruits. Ben Crooks and Craig Hall both made their debuts after joining from financially-stricken Leigh in the hours before kick-off – with Todd Carney also playing for the first time – and the duo caught the eye of their coach.“Neither trained with us before but were great,” Tim Sheens said. “I only met Crooksie today, before we got on the bus. We only gave him his training gear at the hotel.” It was Hall’s two tries, coupled with a penalty on half-time, which helped Rovers into a 16-0 lead that their play fully merited, Danny Tickle their other try-scorer.To Hull’s credit, they fought back impressively to level at 16-16 courtesy of tries by Jordan Abdull, Josh Griffin and Mark Minichiello. At that stage they were perhaps favourites – but an error from the kick-off following Minichiello’s try afforded the visitors the chance to go back ahead via the boot of Tickle.That settled Rovers and after Marc Sneyd spurned the chance to level the scores with a penalty of his own, Tickle settled Hull KR’s nerves once and for all with another penalty three minutes from time.Hull are sixth as a result of this defeat, with Huddersfield moving into\u0026nbspfifth after continuing their fine run of form with victory over Wakefield. Wigan secured second place for the Super 8s with a 25-20 victory over Catalans – while Leeds were beaten by Salford in the night’s other game."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c4f4c7baa47835903a5b16e7298bdb23edebc4e/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f38e7950d2b65da3279b1b16ad023aa","title":"inner city and community cricket","story":"“Will this actually do anything?” It is a sincere question posed by a senior member of the Lutonians Cricket Club but one that contains so much exasperation it may as well be rhetorical. Theirs is a story trying to avoid a bitter ending.Originally a cricket club associated with Vauxhall Motors, the closing of the factory 20 years ago meant that if members wanted to keep playing, they would need to find a new home as theirs was sold off. Finding it was not an issue – Luton council gave them a plot six years ago that hugs a roundabout on New Bedford Road, with banks emanating out of the earth from two sides furthest away from the road creating colosseum-like seating for spectators.The problem came when they applied for a grant from Sport England to improve their facilities. They have been rejected each time.Lacking the most basic training equipment, they punch above their weight in league and cup competitions. But this predicament, of non-existing nets and lousy support, contributes to the reality that the next generation is not coming through, let alone keeping up. A vicious cycle is gathering pace leaving even the most loyal servants concerned about the viability of the club they love.Their applications have been rejected because they are within a well-struck six of another team – Luton Town and Indians Cricket Club – who have most of the mod-cons. Despite being a different entity entirely, Sport England says Lutonians should use their facilities – a bit like a council throwing out your request to erect a shed because you could hop the fence and use your neighbours.’Luton Town and Indians and their 200-plus members are equally bemused by the assertion. Lutonians do not have the resources to rent the nets in any case because of a lack of money. The club will go in for funding again and again, until they get what they need or lose their will. The latter seems unlikely.But there are only so many times they can tell their story and plead their case. It is the first time we hear the anguished “will this actually do anything?” query during this deep e into the state of recreational cricket.Grassroots, inner-city and amateur cricket faces, at best, an uncertain future in the United Kingdom. Over the last two months of travelling the country for this article it was stark the variety of groups – races, classes, sexes and geographical spreads – who are either angry, worried, resigned or a mixture of all three when drawn on the prospects of the game and their clubs. Each has had their stories told in the past but too often that is where it ends. “We always get people coming asking about the problems,” said a near-lifelong member of Handsworth Cricket Club in Birmingham. “One day someone will come with an answer.”Handsworth is one of the last remaining Caribbean clubs in the Midlands. Over the last two decades, other such clubs have closed – a reflection of the drastic decline in Afro-Caribbean representation at amateur and professional level. At present, there are fewer than 20 active county cricketers from an Afro-Caribbean background, compared to almost a hundred around 40 years ago.While immigrants from the Caribbean brought over their love of the game to the UK, they have been unable to sustain it through the generations. Eaton Gordon has witnessed the decline in front his very eyes as he has grown up from a youngster taken to West Indies matches by his dad to his role now as the chairman of Handsworth and coach for the Warwickshire Cricket Board.The moment he puts it down to was when, during the late 80s and early 90s, there was a drive from the ECB to quieten crowds which, he believes, was aimed at West Indies fans creating an atmosphere for their team to thrive when playing in England.More stringent rules created a feeling that Caribbean fans and their ways were no longer welcome and triggered what has been an inescapable slide for the community. “Look at Twenty20 cricket now and the atmosphere they are trying to promote with music and drinking,” says Gordon. “That’s what we were doing with cricket back then.”Like many others, he believes a shot in the arm could come from a representative from the community making it all the way to the top and having the same effect as Moeen Ali and Adil Rashid have had on South Asian communities. While the number of black cricketers in recreational cricket dwindle, just 10 minutes from Handsworth, in Perry Hall Park, the South Asian scene is thriving.Perry Hall Park is a Hackney Marshes-style mecca of cricket with 15 pitches serving 68 teams of the Birmingham Cricket League across the weekend. The players, the majority South Asian, come from a variety of ages, with their own experiences of the English system. And what was fascinating to hear was that they all, to a man, believe the glass ceiling has been cracked.Players at the park had their own theory as to why so few played professionally. Some felt South Asians play under more scrutiny and are afforded a shorter grace period. Others simply felt that the game did not offer them any security, particularly to those from low-income families.However, it was the words of a 22-year-old who was looking to work his way into the county game that stood out to dispute the gloomier perspectives. “It’s down to you to go and get it if you want it,” he said. “Some people use being Asian as an excuse. But look at Mo and Rash – they’ve got to the top. It’s down to you as an inidual to make it work.”The punchiness was admirable. Moeen and Rashid have shown them the way. In this young man’s view, now it is down to the iniduals. But another aspect that came to the fore in the chat with him was that, more and more, second and third generation South Asians are more adept at juggling the challenge of dual nationality. In fact, juggling is probably not the right word because both tags are worn proudly. Young cricketers speak openly about being inspired by the likes of Virat Kohli or Mohammad Amir in a bid to represent England.As a sports-mad kid of the 90s, my loyalties were quizzed. The schoolyard jibes were not quite to Norman Tebbit standards – the Tory MP questioned the allegiances of the South Asian and Caribbean diaspora who did not support the England cricket team – but there was still a degree of cynicism, especially when other sports were raised.A question I was often posed was how I could wear a Sri Lankan cricket shirt yet support the England football team. It was never one I could respond to effectively because I was always searching for the “correct” answer. There is not one. Nor does there need to be and that is what, refreshingly, young British Asians now realise.Nothing summed this up better than the first England-India Twenty20 in Manchester at the start of July. Around two-thirds of the crowd were made up of India fans, the majority living in this country, cheering India to victory and then sticking around to support the England football team in their World Cup knockout match against Colombia which was shown on the big screen.The noise of the celebration that greeted Eric Dier’s winning penalty in the shootout eclipsed any other that day.Of the tentative leads that turned into something worthwhile during this investigation one thread linked them all: they all just want to play. The appetite for cricket is strong in most parts of the country. eastern European children were attending, having picked up the game from their friends of more traditional cricket regions. The country’s multiculturalism is such that such a move could improve the game’s problem areas, opening itself up once more to the working classes, rekindling that fire among young Afro-Caribbeans and girls to ensure cricket can move forward to reflect and be embraced by modern England. It is still not too late."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1eb9f347865547c9ead054180424200d668d8990/588_167_3182_1910/master/3182.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c0f7409a38333e83a805625dd7fbd9c","title":"valtteri bottas f1 hungarian grand prix","story":"Some say that Valtteri Bottas just does not have the aggressive, killer instinct required in Formula One given the levels of composure and control he shows in testing circumstances. But as this softly spoken, private driver prepares for what he views as almost a home grand prix in Hungary, he is insistent that the even temper he has displayed during a trying season should not be mistaken for any lack of passion or indeed, ambition.There are extra flights laid on from Helsinki to Budapest for the Hungarian Grand Prix as the Finns descend en masse to the Hungaroring. With no home race of their own, Hungary has become a popular stamping ground to support\u0026nbspKimi Räikkönen and his compatriot Bottas.Their aspirations for the latter have taken a beating this season with\u0026nbspthe 28-year-old Bottas plagued\u0026nbspby a sequence of bad luck, leaving him winless after 11 races, but with five runners-up spots, his hopes of challenging Lewis Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel for the title dashed. Nor has he just suffered ill-fortune: at the last round\u0026nbspin Germany, he was on the receiving end in a rare case of Mercedes employing team orders. These were circumstances he again took with equanimity.At Hockenheim he was crawling all over the back of Hamilton on fresher tyres after the final restart. The pair went wheel-to-wheel before Mercedes, fearing for their one-two, told Bottas to hold station. Mercedes renewed his contract for a further year last weekend and the Finn has always proved to be a team player yet for many his straight acquiescence raised question marks\u0026nbspover his determination. The contrast with Vettel’s disregard of\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspteam order when he sniffed a win against Mark Webber at Malaysia in 2013 was\u0026nbspcited.“Everyone is different I have always been like this,” he adds. “It\u0026nbspis who I am. I can be nice – I don’t need to be rude for no reason. I\u0026nbspknow\u0026nbspwhen I am in the car I am always doing my best.”Bottas won three races for Mercedes last season, so he is not trying to find the winning formula but he has repeatedly come close in 2018 only to be denied, most cruelly in Azerbaijan. At Baku he had gone long on his first stint and a\u0026nbsppit stop under the safety car ensured he had the lead and the win in his grasp. But he hit debris with three laps to go and the puncture put him out. It was a blow the Mercedes team principal, Toto Wolff, described as “brutal”.Bottas took it on the chin but admits he was disconsolate. “I felt very empty,” he says. “It was just heartbreaking, I felt like I had a good race – I felt really sad, empty.”It was not the only setback. In\u0026nbspChina he jumped race leader Vettel through the pit stops after superb in and out laps. He had the lead and likely the win until a safety car proved pivotal and Red Bull used it superbly to put Daniel Ricciardo on fresh tyres and take the win.In France, Bottas was hit by Vettel\u0026nbspat turn one on the opening lap\u0026nbspand could manage only seventh with a damaged car. Then in Austria\u0026nbsphis first pole of the year ended with a hydraulic failure on lap 14. In each case there was stoic disappointment rather than fireworks from the Finn.It has been difficult to take but he insists his passion for the sport is undiminished. “I love it as much as I did as a kid doing karts,” he says. “Every time I jump in the car I feel very happy. Racing is what I love to\u0026nbspdo and I am very lucky I can do it. It is my childhood dream and I still feel like that. If you want to be the best it is never easy.”Bottas began his F1 career\u0026nbspat Williams and Sir Frank described him as “simply one of the most talented young racing drivers I have come across”. His wins last year were impressive and although he was criticised for not being more aggressive against Vettel at the death\u0026nbspin Bahrain this season, has shown moments of breathtaking verve. Not least at Silverstone for Williams in 2014, passing Kevin Magnussen and Jenson Button around the outside at Stowe.There is then, a sense of unfulfilled potential which he acknowledges. “I feel there is a lot more to come,” he says. “I feel every year I am getting better since I joined Mercedes being a teammate of Lewis, working with new people. I have progressed a lot from last year to this year. If I keep working there is no reason my peak is not ahead.”He is careful to keep his private life private, using social media sparingly, but he does admit that with\u0026nbsptime off he likes nothing more than going to the beach, having a few\u0026nbspbeers with friends or simply doing the laundry.This is unsurprising for a grounded driver who had a down to\u0026nbspearth back-up plan: “I studied\u0026nbspto be a car mechanic. That was my\u0026nbspplan\u0026nbspB. Servicing cars and changing tyres in\u0026nbspFinland.”The contrast in character to Hamilton could not be greater and\u0026nbspthat perhaps is why the pair have found such harmony, but Bottas\u0026nbspis every bit as driven as the\u0026nbspworld champion. He has the focus and – for now – is keeping his cool\u0026nbspuntil\u0026nbsphe finally comes into some\u0026nbspgood fortune.Hungary has not been a happy hunting ground for Mercedes in the turbo-hybrid era however, with their car not at its best around the slow and medium-speed corners of the Hungaroring. Hamilton, who leads Vettel by 17 points in the championship, was fifth in first practice with Bottas sixth.Ferrari have been more successful with two wins for Vettel in the last three years, and they still look strong\u0026nbsphere despite their switch to a longer wheelbase – Vettel was in second in the first session. Red Bull have been eyeing this meeting hungrily for some time, as the track – like Monaco – should work to their aerodynamic strengths. Early practice suggested this was the case.Ricciardo topped the timesheets in the morning, with his teammate Max Verstappen in third. With the track rubbered-in for the afternoon session and some qualifying simulations run, Vettel had the advantage, in front of Verstappen and Ricciardo with Hamilton and Bottas once again fifth and sixth."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5512582b85df7d1b6f0406f230b0fb41370662a/70_161_2754_1653/master/2754.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f9247b449808749894ecd1e05925a216","title":"adil rashid yorkshire england red ball cricket","story":"Adil Rashid’s selection by England for the first Test with India has caused one hell of a stink. But until he and Yorkshire go public on the true reasons why he currently does not want to play four-day cricket for the club, so much of the criticism flying around will be ill-informed.Because let’s be honest, it’s pretty clear that this is not a case of Rashid simply not wanting to play red-ball cricket, given he’s accepted the call-up. It seems from the outside that he doesn’t want to play red-ball cricket for Yorkshire. There is a big difference here. Ed Smith, the national selector, is probably privy to the reasons why but perhaps the supporters and the pundits need to hear them too.Because right now there is mainly just speculation and in some quarters he is being painted as a guy who has betrayed the county he has been a part of since he was 10 years old.Knowing Rashid as I do – we were teammates for his first-team debut in 2006, before I went on later to become head coach – this will have hurt him a lot, hence he has since bitten back at some of it.When Rashid took the decision to specialise in white-ball cricket at the start of the year, he said it was down to losing some motivation as regards the longer stuff. This is not uncommon when players drop out of an international team and think there is no way back, as was\u0026nbspprobably the case when he returned from a reasonable winter tour to then be overlooked for first Liam Dawson and then, come a marquee Ashes tour, the inexperienced Mason Crane.But when a guy gets a sniff of a Test call-up and yet still declines a County Championship match – as Rashid did for the recent Roses fixture – it points to something a bit deeper and fundamental. Should he have played? Yes, skills-wise it would have been sensible. But for one reason or another, it appears he doesn’t want to be in that environment for extended spells, as opposed to dipping in and out for one-day matches.How this gets resolved is anyone’s guess and it is hard to envisage a way forward together, not least since the England and Wales Cricket Board has made it mandatory for international players to play the relevant format for their counties from next season. I genuinely hope the two parties can make peace however.In all likelihood the issues stem back to Rashid declining to play in the County Championship decider at\u0026nbspLord’s in 2016 in what was my final match as head coach. Now this was a huge occasion. Middlesex and Somerset had been battling it out all season at the top but a win for Yorkshire and we would have made it three titles in a row, despite having dipped a fraction from the previous two years.Was I happy at the time? Of course not. He’s a professional cricketer and to miss a game of that magnitude was hugely disappointing. But I will always defend him for the fact that he had flagged up a desire to rest and spend time with his family at the end of the season two months earlier, knowing he was likely heading on tour with England to Bangladesh and India soon after, and so stuck to his guns. We knew this was the situation for a good while, we just couldn’t change his mind.That match at Lord’s wasn’t to be for Yorkshire. But it was clear from that moment his relationship with the club changed. And it is a huge shame because personally I have always found Rashid good to work with and he is clearly a fine cricketer, hence I even took him with me to Adelaide Strikers for one season.He is his own man and I do think that becoming a family man, and his growing Muslim faith, have seen cricket change from being an all-encompassing passion to a career that puts food on the table. But that’s not a bad thing. As he has matured and gained this wider perspective, it has helped him to develop as a cricketer and person.If I am sympathetic to the player then this also extends to my old club and colleagues at Headingley, who keep seeing their plans ripped up by external events. Rashid could have timed his white-ball specialism better than late into pre-season, the impact of which was heightened when Liam Plunkett and David Willey left for the Indian Premier League at the 11th hour.Yorkshire have also seen Kane Williamson’s spell shortened by New Zealand, Billy Stanlake’s overseas spell for Twenty20 cancelled completely by Cricket Australia at the last minute and now it would appear that Rashid will likely miss a huge chunk of the campaign they thought they actually had him for.How Rashid goes against India will be fascinating to watch because taking 20 wickets is going to be the big challenge for England in what should be a ripping series. Virat Kohli’s record in this country may be pretty average but he is a serious player and should have a huge impact over the course of five Tests.The tourists may have lost Jasprit Bumrah and Bhuvneshwar Kumar for the first part but we had Ishant Sharma for two months at Sussex and he learned a lot about the Dukes ball and the lengths required. So look out for him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e12c885481bfcfd1aca56b18833bba6b5f59b04/256_0_3504_2103/master/3504.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22dc153803bf91941c5cb1fce7c98f6d","title":"love island stars fame series close itv","story":"ITV phenomenon has enriched the broadcaster and got young people watching live TV againLove Island will come to an end on Monday evening, marked by ostentatious weeping and much gnashing of whitened teeth.

And after that, who is able to best monetise their newfound celebrity.Alongside the aim of the programme – finding love – the £50,000 top prize is a further incentive.

In the process it has helped boost revenue at ITV, revive the channel’s ITV Hub catch-up service, and spawned an endless degree of spin-off enterprises as brands rush to get a piece of the action.A team of economists at the consultancy Frontier Economics concluded that contestants who last the full duration of the series can be expected to earn about £2.3m over the next five years, with a strong correlation between the time spent on screen and earning potential.Jack Fincham and Dani Dyer, the bookies’ favourites to win the series, could earnmore than £500,000 each in their first year outside the villa, based on what happened to last year’s winners, Kem Cetinay and Amber Davies.“Some of previous years’ contestants have managed to secure book deals and even spin-off TV series,” the consultancy said, recommending that contestants focus on avoiding too much trouble and staying on the show for as long as possible. “Even an ordinary ex-Islander who goes through life endorsing protein powder on Instagram can reportedly make close to a £1m a year.”The showrunners are understandably keen to capture some of this income. Producers have confirmed that contestant contracts entitle them to a percentage of their future earnings.

The motion said Avenatti had been running a “smear campaign” against Cohen. His lawyer, Brent Blakely, argued that Avenatti’s frequent interviews and near-daily tweets about Trump and Cohen could taint future jurors.“Like a small-town carnival magician who attempts to confuse the audience with smoke and mirrors, Avenatti attempts to somehow justify his conduct by pulling the first amendment out of his tiny bag of tricks while at the same time pointing his finger at others,” Blakely wrote in requesting the order.Otero said the constitution is “neither a trick nor an illusion” and told Blakely his request was “serious business”.The judge said he had some concerns about statements Avenatti has made about Cohen, but said the bar for a gag order was high and it did not seem Cohen had met that burden. He did not immediately issue a decision. The judge is also considering whether to continue delaying Daniels’ case because Cohen is under federal investigation in New York. Avenatti disclosed that he had additional clients at a community forum in West Hollywood, but would not provide additional details. Asked if he had evidence that the women had relationships with Trump, Avenatti said: “Yes.” He said he was “not at liberty to share” the evidence because he didn’t have permission from his clients. But Avenatti said the women, who contacted him months ago, were “paid hush money prior to the 2016 election”.He called on Trump and Cohen to come forward and disclose information about the women and their supposed relationships with Trump. “They should release the information to the American people now,” Avenatti said. “Enough with the games.” After the hearing on Friday, Avenatti tweeted: “We will not be silenced! I am pleased to report that all indications are that Michael Cohen and Donald Trump have failed miserably in their effort to prevent me from speaking the truth to the press and the public. They were almost laughed out of court.”He also spoke to reporters.Trump’s attorney, Charles Harder, would not comment on Friday. Cohen’s lawyer, Lanny Davis, declined to comment but cautioned against believing everything that a lawyer says in the heat of a legal battle. “Mr Avenatti is an aggressive attorney doing his job in the middle of litigation,” Davis said. “I have been there, done that. An attorney in litigation is just that, and until the litigation is over, I’m not going to comment on the words used.” Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, has said she had sex with Trump in 2006, when he was married, but Trump has denied it. Days before the 2016 presidential election, she was paid $130,000 to stay silent in a deal handled by Cohen. She is suing to invalidate the nondisclosure agreement. Daniels also sued Cohen last month, alleging he colluded with her former lawyer to get her to appear on Fox News and falsely deny a sexual tryst with Trump.

Often they tell us about concepts and ideas that we are missing out on in the anglophone world.As the northern hemisphere heads abroad in the coming holiday season, here are a few to be looking out for:You may have witnessed the ritual, knowingly or not, while on the hunt for a coffee or a cold beer towards the end of another long Spanish afternoon.Sitting clumped around tables inside restaurants or spilling out on to their terrazas, are friends, families and colleagues, preserved in the post-prandial moment like replete insects in amber.Lunch – and it is more usually lunch than dinner – will long since have yielded to the important act of the sobremesa, that languid time when food gives way to hours of talking, drinking and joking. Coffee and digestivos will have been taken, or perhaps the large gin and tonic that follows a meal rather than precedes it here.The sobremesa is a digestive period that allows for the slow settling of food, gossip, ideas and conversations. It is also a sybaritic time a recognition that there is more to life than working long hours and that few pleasures are greater than sharing a table and then chatting nonsense for a hefty portion of what remains of the day.The world may not have been put completely to rights by the end of the sobremesa, but it will seem a calmer, more benign place. Ask Mariano Rajoy. At the end of May, as it became clear that he was going to be turfed out of office in a no-confidence vote, the then-prime minister did something very Spanish: he and his close circle retreated to a private room in a smart Madrid restaurant. Lunch was followed by a seven-hour sobremesa, and, reportedly, a couple of bottles of whisky.After all, what does the loss of a premiership matter after a fine meal, a good cigar and some booze-soaked reminiscing? ¡Salud! Sam Jones in MadridIt feels almost counterintuitive to have to explain what espertoesperta means, a Portuguese word without true parallel in the English dictionary.There are words that come close, that encapsulate something of the spirit of this word – and the word itself is spirited. On the ball, quick-witted, with-it, canny, having common sense, intuitive, someone who gets things done: these all help shade in the space occupied by esperto.I grew up in Portugal and have always felt an undercurrent of admiration, almost affection, for the espertas.A Brazilian friend, Tatiana, though, warns of a negative sense. Someone esperto can, she says, use his or her instincts to take advantage of others to trap or fool them into trouble.Sometimes it’s easier to understand something by what it is not. Esperta is definitely not slow, dim, unimaginative. If these characteristics were on a spectrum, esperto would be at one end, with “plodding” at the other.If you understand it, you probably are. Juliette JowitBefore celebrating a confirmation in Sicily last year, my aunt breathed a sigh of relief when she saw that her British niece was dressed appropriately enough so as not to make a bad impression in front of the extended family. I was also relieved, as it meant I had not inflicted the curse of the brutta figura, which literally translates as bad figure, on my family. In pretty much all areas of life, whether it be in the way people dress, how they behave, how well their homes are kept or how impeccably a cake is presented and a gift wrapped, Italians strive to achieve the bella figura, or beautiful figure. Such importance is placed on keeping up appearances and the finer detail that for unwitting foreigners there’s a sense of being sized up in everything you do, even going as far as to what you eat and drink and at what time of the day you indulge in such activities. “What matters is not what you do but how you appear,” said an Italian friend, likening it to posting the perfect photograph on social media. It’s a tactic that enables people to get promoted at work and politicians to win over admirers while giving the impression that they are achieving something. “I call it ‘selfie and spot’,” the friend said. “For example, the politician takes a selfie against a beautiful backdrop, posts it on Facebook with a promise to do something, but then doesn’t follow it through. With a good selfie and a good spot, you can survive an entire career without doing anything.” Angela Giuffrida in RomeOne of the most misleading, but also most enduring, myths about German culture is that it values hard work over a good siesta. Northern Europeans, the legend goes, have a “Protestant work ethic” that means they get the job done even if it means staying in the office late into the night, while the southern Europeans wave it off with a mañana, mañana. Anyone who sincerely believes that to be the case has never tried to call a German office at one minute past five. When German workers say Ich mach’ Feierabend (“I am calling it a day”), it rarely carries an apologetic undertone but usually comes with the confidence of someone claiming an ancient right.Dating back to the 16th century, the term Feierabend, or “celebration evening”, used to denote the evening before a public holiday, but has come to refer to the free time between leaving the office and bedtime on any working day.The key to understanding Feierabend is that it isn’t time for going to the cinema or gym, but time for doing nothing. In 1880, the cultural historian Wilhelm Heinrich Riehl described the concept as “an atmosphere of carefree wellbeing, of deep inner reconciliation, of the pure and clear quiet of the evening”.Germany’s adherence to the Feierabend rulebook can frustrate when you are trying to make a work call on a Friday afternoon or buy an aspirin from a pharmacy on a Sunday (Sundays being a 24-hour celebration evening).But as a philosophy, it underpins the proudest achievements of the German labour movement and may just explain why the country has some of the highest productivity levels in Europe: to truly cherish the evening, you make sure you get the job done before five o’clock. Philip Oltermann in BerlinSisu is an untranslatable Finnish term that blends resilience, tenacity, persistence, determination, perseverance and sustained, rather than momentary, courage: the psychological strength to ensure that regardless of the cost or the consequences, what has to be done will be done.It originates from the word sisus, meaning “intestines” or “guts” Daniel Juslenius, author of the first Finnish-language dictionary in 1745, defined sisucunda as the place in the body where strong emotions live. In a harsh environment and with powerful neighbours, it was what a young nation needed. Sisu is what, in 1939-40, allowed an army of 350,000 Finns to twice fight off Soviet forces three times their number, inflicting losses five times heavier than those they sustained.More prosaically, it has helped Finns get through a lot of long, lonely, dark and freezing winters, building in the process one of the wealthiest, safest, most stable and best-governed countries in the world. It is not all good, of course. Sisu can lead to stubbornness, a refusal to take advice, an inability to admit weakness, a lack of compassion.It has become a bit of cliché in Finland – a brand name for trucks and strongly-flavoured sweets. Research shows it holds little appeal to the young. But ask a Finn to define the national character, and it’s the word most still reach for. Jon HenleyTa’arof is a Persian word that has no English equivalent, referring to the art of etiquette ubiquitous in everyday Iranian life. “You go first,” says Mr A as he meets Mr B at the doorstep, as they try to enter a building. “No, it’s not possible, you go first,” Mr B insists in response. Ta’arof dictates a ritual that may see them both waiting for a couple of unnecessary minutes before one steps forward to enter. It is an etiquette that is seen almost in all aspects of Iranian life, from hosts insisting on guests taking more food from the table, to the exchanges in the bazaar. “How much is this carpet?” asks Ms A after choosing her favourite in the shop. “It’s worthless, you can just take it,” responds the seller, quite disingenuously. Although Ms A in reality cannot take the carpet out of the shop without paying for it, the seller might insist up to three times that she should just do that, until the amount of the price is finally mentioned. The awkward exchanges may have originated out of politeness ultimately, they may work to the seller’s favour, as the buyer feels a certain obligation to respond to such deference with a purchase, even if the final price is more than she expected.Another example: you are walking with a friend and you end up doing Ta’arof, asking him to come to yours for lunch, even though you don’t have anything prepared and you don’t really want him to accept. The friend insists out of Ta’arof that he wouldn’t come because he knows you’re tired and doesn’t want to be a burden, even though deep down he really wants to have lunch at your place. “Oh, don’t Ta’arof,” you say in a Ta’arof asking your friend not to Ta’arof. He ends up accepting your reluctant Ta’arof. You’re a bit irked, but you’ll have to be all smiles. Not all Taa’rofs are insincere some are, some aren’t. You’d Ta’arof even if you badly want something, saying you don’t want it you’d Ta’arof if you really hate something, pretending you want it. Saeed Kamali DehghanLeave it to Russia to serve up the melancholy: toska translates as yearning or ennui. Except it doesn’t, because no English word can accurately reflect all the shades of the word, to paraphrase Vladimir Nabokov.What can toska (pronounced tahs-kah) mean? Spiritual anguish, a deep pining, perhaps the product of nostalgia or love-sickness, toska is depression plus longing, an unbearable feeling that you need to escape but lack the hope or energy to do so. Visually to me, toska conjures up an endless field of birch on the edge of St Petersburg, in the dead of winter when the clouds never part, and it’s only light for five hours a day anyway.Toska is the stuff of great literature. Evgeny Onegin, the foundational Russian novel-in-verse about superfluous men, unrequited love and duels? Loads of toska. Anton Chekhov wrote an entire short story called Toska about a cabman who recently lost his son and searches for someone to talk to about his grief. He ends up talking to his horse. All that broodiness in the great (and not-so-great) Russian novels? You get the picture. So why choose toska for this list of positivity? Because if the Russian soul s the place where great emotions reside, then toska pays the rent. Without toska there cannot be delirious happiness, endless heartfelt conversations at 4am at the kitchen table, boundless generosity at obvious personal expense. Toska is a sign that your emotions go beyond logic and that you are really, truly living your emotions. Perhaps you’ve felt toska and you didn’t realise it, but it’s a good thing: it means you’ve got a little bit of the Russian soul in you. Andrew Roth in MoscowAs inhabitants of an archipelago that is regularly struck by earthquakes and tsunamis, and – as recent events have tragically demonstrated – floods and landslides, it is little wonder that the Japanese have a well-developed sense of fatalism. Any verbal reflection on humans’ powerlessness to control nature’s most destructive forces often elicit the phrase shoganai.The expression, meaning, “it can’t be helped,” is Japan’s catchall response to any situation, large or small, over which people believe they have no influence. A more voguish translation might be “it is what it is”. A French person would immediately recognise it as a version of “c’est la vie”.It could be heard, delivered with deep reflection, amid the rubble of the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami and, in resigned tones, after Japan’s agonising exit from the World Cup in Russia.Shoganai, and its synonym shikata ga nai, are verbal coping mechanisms that apply equally to unwelcome developments in everyday life, from getting struck in a traffic jam to having to spend Friday evening at the office.With its roots in the Zen Buddhist belief that suffering is a natural part of life, it could perhaps be described as Japan’s version of the serenity prayer – a personal and communal recognition that, on occasion, passive acceptance of an unfortunate truth is far easier than trying to deny it.But resigning oneself to one’s fate with a muttered “shoganai” has its drawbacks. Some observers of Japanese culture note that it is too often applied in situations in which humans have more influence than they think.For much of the seven decades since the end of the second world war, there has been a general acceptance of the dominance of the conservative Liberal Democratic party, even among liberal voters. Some have pointed to its role in allowing the rise of Japanese militarism in the first half of the 20th century.Shikata ga nai is, then, partly to blame for weaknesses at the heart of Japan’s democracy, allowing one party to dominate even, as is the case today, when it is mired in scandal.In a country with few energy resources of its own, nuclear power was for decades the beneficiary of the shoganai mindset, one that accepted the construction of dozens of nuclear reactors along the coastline as a necessary evil.It took Fukushima to prove that Japan’s lauded sense of fatalism can sometimes be downright dangerous. Justin McCurry in TokyoHet poldermodel and its associated verb, polderen, derive from the Dutch habit of working together to reclaim parts of their country from the sea. Since the Middle Ages, everyone on the same polder, regardless of religion, politics, class and local rivalries, has had to cooperate in maintaining the complex but vital system of windmills and dykes that kept their land dry.The term, which has been defined as “pragmatic cooperation despite differences”, has been used since the mid-1970s to describe the kind of consensus political decision-making common in the Netherlands, which has been governed by coalitions for over a century, since no single party has ever held a majority.In policymaking, the concept is exemplified by a Dutch institution known as the Social-Economic Council, a tripartite forum in which government, employers’ federations and unions air their differences, generally reaching consensus on issues such as wage restraint, working hours, job creation and productivity. In politics, Dutch governments – the latest, a coalition between four parties with widely different views, took a record 208 days to hammer out – are the embodiment of the poldermodel, which has come in for increasing criticism, particularly from the radical right, since the financial crisis of 2008. Politicians such as Thierry Baudet of the nativist, right-wing Forum for Democracy argue the poldermodel has led to a “political cartel” in which endless compromise has robbed the major parties of all distinguishing features and left them incapable of taking essential decisions. Jon HenleyHow do we categorise or classify things, thereby imagining them as one thing and not another? Unlike French or German, gender does not provide categories in Chinese, which groups things by something else entirely: shape. Tiáo is one of at least 140 classifiers and measure words in the Chinese language. It’s a measure word for long-narrow-shape things. For example, bed sheets, fish, ships, bars of soap, cartons of cigarettes, avenues, trousers, dragons, rivers.These measure words embrace the ways in which shape imprints itself upon us, while playfully noticing the relationships between all things. The measure word kē 颗 (kernel) is used for small, roundish things, or objects that appear small: pearls, teeth, bullets and seeds, as well as distant stars and satellites. Gēn 根, for thin-slender objects, will appear before needles, bananas, fried chicken legs, lollipops, chopsticks, guitar strings and matches, among a thousand other things. “Flower-like” objects gather under the word duo 朵: bunches of flowers, clouds, mushrooms and ears. It’s endlessly fascinating to me how we attempt to group anything or anyone together, and how formations change. Philosopher Wang Lianqing charts how tiáo was first applied to objects we can pick up by hand (belts, branches, string) and then expanded outward (streets, rivers, mountain ranges). And finally tiáo extended metaphorically. News and events are also classified with tiáo, perhaps because news was written in long vertical lines, and events, as the 7th-century scholar Yan Shigu wrote, arrive in lists “one by one, as (arranging) long-shaped twigs”. Onwards the idea broadened, so that an idea or opinion is also “long-shaped news,” and in the 14th century, tiáo was used for spirit, which was imagined as straight, high and lofty. In language, another geometry is at work, gathering recurrences through time and space. Madeleine ThienWhat is your favourite word, concept or idea in the country you live in?

The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party had complained that its election chances were badly hurt long before polling got under way. More than 30 of its candidates left the party during the campaign and many alleged privately that they had been pressured by Pakistan’s ISI spy agency.After a meeting of six opposition parties on Friday Hamza Shahbaz Sharif, leader of the PML-N, said he would decide on Sunday whether or not to boycott parliament, stopping short of endorsing a demand for a re-election raised by five other smaller parties.The meeting was called to discuss opposition party leaders’ response after all claimed the vote had been rigged and that their polling agents – workers who keep an eye on the count – had been evicted from ballot booths by security officials.Sharif said he would discuss the call to reject the result with party leadership. In his speech, Gahler advised all parties to pursue rigging allegations through legal channels, saying that his team, which visited 582 of 85,000 polling stations, had seen no evidence of military interference.The PTI enjoyed success across the country, official results showed on Friday. With two seats left to count, more than a day after the result was due, the PTI had won 117 seats in the national assembly, the PML-N had taken 64 and the Pakistan People’s party 43.Khan will still need to form a coalition to become prime minister, which requires at least 137 seats, but a single party winning contests across the country – in the north, south and in Punjab – is rare in Pakistani politics.The ease with which the PTI can implement its policy agenda also received a significant boost from its strong performance in state-level elections.As well as forming the federal government, the PTI’s capture of 118 seats in the provincial assembly of Punjab, the largest and wealthiest province, means it has a good chance of evicting the PML-N from the state government there, a stronghold that its leadership had been desperate to protect.In a televised victory speech on Thursday, Khan struck a unifiying tone, pledging to lift up the poor and allow rigging claims to be investigated.Sharif, who founded the PML-N, told his family from the prison cell where he is serving a 10-year sentence for corruption that he considered the result “stolen”.Gen Asif Ghafoor, the army’s spokesperson, was criticised after tweeting: “You honour who You will and You humble who You will”, a verse from the Qur’an that was taken in some quarters as confirmation of the military’s support for Khan.The trickle of official results threw up surprises. Senior PML-N leaders performed worse than expected. The former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, who took up the role after the ousting of Sharif, lost the two constituencies he was contesting.The former finance minister Miftah Ismail posted on Twitter that he was “looking for work” after his defeat. Shahbaz Sharif, Nawaz’s brother and the new leader of the party, scraped into parliament after losing three of the four seats he contested.Also known as the Justice party, it is led by the former cricketer\u0026nbspImran Khan, and has had some success at provincial level but has never been able to convert it into national power. Khan has been accused both of lacking a coherent political philosophy and of sympathising with extremists. He has described the Taliban’s fight in Afghanistan as a\u0026nbspholy war, and accused “liberals” who support Nato’s war on the group of being\u0026nbsp“thirsty for blood”.Hopes to win control of parliament again, even though its leader, Nawaz Sharif, is in prison for corruption. Tried and\u0026nbspsentenced\u0026nbspin absentia, he returned to the country this month to serve his sentence, hoping to revitalise the campaign before the election.Now led by Sharif’s brother Shahbaz, the party is focusing on its economic success and promises of energy and infrastructure investment from China. However, efforts to increase tax revenues have faltered.Led by Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, son of the assassinated former prime minister Benazir Bhutto. The party lost ground after Benazir was killed in 2007 but the family name still carries considerable weight. The third-generation leader appears to be playing a long game, rebuilding support in its heartland with an eye on future elections. If it does well in this vote, the PPP could potentially serve as a junior partner in a coalition.Although Tehreek-e-Labbaik, a new far-right Islamist party dedicated to killing blasphemers, failed to win any national seats, its strong second place in many contests raised fears that it will influence the future of Pakistani politics.The political analyst Umair Javed told the  that the scale of Khan’s win across the country made the PTI a rare, “truly national party”. It won a two-thirds majority in the northern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the first since 1951, while at the other end of Pakistan, in the southern business capital of Karachi, the party vastly outperformed expectations to claim half the seats.That might reflect a shift away from ethnicity-based politics in both regions, said Javed.The former PML-N cabinet minister Khawaja Saad Rafique petitioned for a recount after his defeat to Khan in the Punjab capital of Lahore. He said the presiding officer at the polling station “rejected” many votes. At a party meeting on Thursday, the PML-N decided against boycotting parliament."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3578619.1532718520!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"north should prepare for possibility for united ireland says former dup leader","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFormer NI first minister Peter Robinson told   the MacGill Summer School in Glenties that the Republic’s relationship with the North  will never be the same again after Brexit. Photograph: North West NespixFormer Northern Ireland first minister Peter Robinson believes the North should prepare for the possibility of a united Ireland.Speaking at the MacGill Summer School in Glenties, Co Donegal, Mr Robinson said he does not think Northern Ireland will want to leave the UK but that is no reason it shouldn’t prepare for the eventuality.“I don’t expect my own house to burn down but I still insure it because it could happen,” he said.The former leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said he would accept the results of a border poll which led to Northern Ireland joining the Republic.“As soon as that decision is taken every democrat will have to accept that decision,” he said in response to a question from the audience.He said walking towards that scenario without preparation is madness and compared it to the decision to leave the EU.“I don’t believe Northern Ireland will want to leave the United Kingdom, but if it does happen we would be in a terrible fix because we would be in the same situation as leaving the EU where nothing was negotiated or decided about what was going to happen after.”Mr Robinson said he believed the unionist community in general would also accept the results of a border poll on unification but would want some “protections”, as the Nationalist community currently enjoys in the North.On the subject of Brexit, Mr Robinson said the Republic’s relationship with the North and with the UK mainland will never be the same again. He warned these relationships could become “toxic” if “the Northern Ireland Assembly, its Executive, along with the north-south and east-west institutions” are not restored.“Without each and all of those parts being in place, and working, relationships will suffer – perhaps drastically.”He warned the east-west relationship between the UK and the Republic “will struggle to maintain anything close to the warmth of their pre-Brexit affinity” no matter what deal is made.“At worst that relationship may become stony and staid and, in extreme circumstances, even perfunctory and fruitless.”He said he believes UK Government ministers see the Irish Government as “rigid if not antagonistic” and that this has “planted the seeds of regression in the relationship between the two countries.“Do not be fooled by diplomatic, understated Whitehall-speak. They are not happy with Dublin.”Mr Robinson said the Irish Government’s approach to Brexit has also been poorly received by the unionist community in Northern Ireland.“From a unionist perspective, it need only be stated to be accepted that there has been a rapid deterioration in their estimation of the Irish Government.“Unionists believe Dublin has been completely self-serving and unnecessarily bellicose during this process. I believe the absence of a working north-south institution has exacerbated the situation.”He continued: “Moreover, there is a feeling that at no point has there been any consideration of the effect and force of their words and actions upon the unionist population.”Asked by an audience member about the Renewable Heating Initiative (RHI) scandal, which led to the collapse of the Stormont Assembly, Mr Robinson said ministers must take many decisions every day.“I suspect that if any government decision, anywhere in the world, was put under the kind of scrutiny that the RHI decision is having, politicians anywhere might not come out too well.”He said there is no reason Stormont cannot get back on track while issues like the RHI and the Irish Language Act are dealt with in parallel and on a strict timeline.Asked about his DUP colleague Ian Paisley Junior, who has been suspended from Westminster for failing to declare two trips to Sri Lanka that were paid for by its government who we was lobbying for at the time, Mr Robinson said “the least I say about that matter the better”.“The House of Commons has investigated, he’s put his hands up, he’s recognised he did wrong, he’s apologised for it, and the party, through its own internal structure, will have its decision to take.”Discover more of the ideas debated in Glenties this year"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3577137.1532603376!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"male chauvinist ireland 5 things we learned from latest british state papers","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Charles Haughey and President Mary Robinson greeted by Lieutenant General James Parker, Chief of Staff, on arrival outside the GPO in 1991. Photograph: Jack McManusThe release of British Government files from the UK National Archives in Kew are often as of much interest to Irish historians as they are to British ones.They particularly illuminate a difficult time in the history of both countries when the Troubles in Northern Ireland were at their height. They also highlight the often puzzling and puzzled attitudes that British politicians exhibited at the time towards their Irish counterparts. Here are five things we learned from the files:1: British Ambassador to Ireland Nicholas Fenn called Ireland a “male chauvinist country” in relation to Mary Robinson’s presidential bid The election of Mary Robinson as president of Ireland in 1990 was a seismic event in Irish political life presaging a more tolerant, liberal society than the one that proceeded it.It was certainly seen as that before it happened by the British ambassador to Ireland Nicholas Fenn.In a memo to the British Foreign Office, he wrote: “This male chauvinist country will have elected a woman. This conservative country will have elected a militant liberal. This constitutional country will have elected a president determined to erode the constraints on the presidency and at permanent loggerheads with her taoiseach. An intriguing prospect.”After her election, Mr Fenn observed President Robinson behaving “for all the world like a queen” at a state reception in Dublin Castle.He also hoped that her election would help “disavow the gut anti-British instincts of her countrymen”.2: Charles Haughey’s “unsavoury reputation for money-making” was remarked upon Charles Haughey’s election as taoiseach in 1979 perplexed the then British ambassador Robin Haydon.Mr Haughey’s involvement in the arms trial of 1970 led Mr Haydon to conclude that he would be “no friend of Britain”.His election had “caused a number of undesirable figures from his past to emerge from the woodwork”, the ambassador observed.He noted that both Captain James Kelly and Belfast republican John Kelly were in the public gallery when Mr Haughey was presented to the Dáil as taoiseach. Both had been implicated in the arms trial.“These people obviously think that their hour has come. I hope they are wrong,” Mr Haydon stated.“In general Haughey’s history and background have shown him to be no friend of Britain. We must remember that he now wants to win the next election and it is this which will govern his action more than anything else. Similarly he is very adept in his handling of public relations: many of his closest advisers are public relations men (shades of Nixon!).”Mr Haughey’s early comments condemning IRA violence reassured Mr Haydon, but only slightly. He noted that Mr Haughey’s emphasis on the unification of Ireland will be seen in unionist circles as “counterproductive”.“If he continues in this vein, we are in for a rough ride,” Mr Haydon opined.He also observed that business people might welcome his elevation to the highest office, but others would be “uneasy at his somewhat unsavoury reputation for money-making”.3: Former British prime minister John Major was not too fond of Jacob Rees-Mogg’s father The British Prime Minister Theresa May might be tempted to conclude that her troubles with the arch-Brexiteer MP Jacob Rees-Mogg is history repeating itself.Her Tory predecessor John Major had similar troubles over the future of Europe. He famously described those who tried to undermine him on the issue of Europe as “bastards”.One of the “bastards” was William Rees Mogg, the father of Jacob, who had previously been the editor of The Times and in 1993 was a crossbench member of the House of Lords.He had taken a judicial review of the then-Conservative government’s ratification of the Maastricht Treaty.His judicial review failed. Major was privately delighted though he was warned not to make public his satisfaction as this might “provoke the Rees-Mogg brigade into a further Quixotic action”.In response to that, Major wrote to his private secretary: “Good. A full gloat is merited.”4: Margaret Thatcher liked a good nap in the back of her state car British prime minister Margaret Thatcher used to boast that she could run Britain on just four hours’ sleep a night.Official state papers reveal that Thatcher did not have quite the inexhaustive reserves of energy she claimed to have.Thatcher would often doze off in the back of her official car, an armour-plated Daimler, giving rise to security concerns.In September 1987, her bodyguard Bob Kingston in No 10 wrote to her private office: “I am concerned that, when the PM dozes in the official car, the design of the headrests is such that, far from supporting her head and neck, they cause her head to drop forward.“This is in itself hazardous, but when the car is braked or turned, or there is some other disturbance, she lifts her head very quickly, and this I am sure will one day cause at least minor injury.“I told the PM of my concern at Chequers last weekend. She agreed to the matter of a better design of headrest being pursued.”5: Denis Thatcher worked quietly behind the scenes for his wife Margaret Denis Thatcher rarely said anything about his wife in public. He famously opined that it is “better to keep your mouth shut and be thought a fool than open it and remove all doubt”.He preferred to work quietly behind the scenes on behalf of his wife who he regarded as “one of the greatest women the world has ever known”.He kept a mental note of all those who had supported his wife and also those who he had perceived to have insulted her.In 1988 he was presented with an exhaustive list of 229 iniduals who might be invited to a reception at Downing Street.Denis Thatcher graded them by placing ticks beside those he really wanted invited. Those included the entertainer Eric Sykes, who received four ticks, Ronnie Corbett, the songwriter Tim Rice and the golfer Peter Alliss.Those who incurred his wrath including Paul McCartney, Sir David Attenborough and the newsreader Jan Leeming. Question marks were placed after their names.The list was eventually wittled down to just 45 names and a number of government ministers."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Analysis: Poised to assume power, the question is whether Pakistan\u0026rsquos prime minister-elect will have the authority to leadFormer cricketer looks set to take over as PM within days despite concerns about electionDaniel Kimura took issue with reviews from visitors to Mount Koya temple in JapanElection on Sunday will see prime minister Hun Sen extend his 33-year run in officeWhite House hails repatriation as a significant step in Korean peace processScale of disaster in remote southern tip of Laos remains unclear after three daysElection victory marks culmination of two-decade long battle for political successDecades of dominance by political dynasties upended by former cricket captainIncrease in detentions among Muslim minorities as China cracks down on separatismPoison attack on Tokyo subway in 1995 killed 13 people and injured at least 5,800Abused granted 10 days of leave to allow them to leave partners and find new homesEarly tallies say former cricketer is on course for victory, as rival rejects resultsMore than 6,000 lose their home thousands more await rescue on rooftopsLahore Letter: How did Pakistani elite adopt institution symbolic of Empire\u0026rsquos worst excesses?Incident comes after concerns raised over country\u0026rsquos hydropower intentionsEx-cricketer perceived as army favourite for prime minister as polls show tight raceOfficials propose emergency measures as they urge citizens to stay indoorsPhotographs from new report show progress being made on pledge to President Trump11 members of boys\u0026rsquo team will be ordained in memory of all who helped in rescue effortAt Punjab\u0026rsquos brick-making kilns, workers are savagely exploited and horror stories abound"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3578475.1532708123!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"imran khan s long awaited victory has come at a cost","story":"Imran Khan was on track to become Pakistan’s new prime minister on Thursday, in an election that has been clouded with accusations of vote-rigging.

As prime minister his top challenges will be to strengthen institutions and stamp out corruption. Photograph: Aamir QureshiAFPGetty ImagesImran Khan doesn’t do self doubt. When the former cricketer claimed victory in Pakistan’s election in a live address to the nation, he appeared typically self-assured, more than ready for his long-awaited rendezvous with history. The controversial poll, he said, was the “cleanest” and “fairest” the country had ever held.After an election dubbed the dirtiest in years, it was a startling claim. But, if there’s one skill that Khan seems to have mastered in life, it’s the art of positive visualisation. Believe it and it shall be so. His 2011 autobiography, which charts a stellar sporting career that culminated in Pakistan’s against-all-odds 1992 World Cup win and his early struggles as a political outsider, is chock full of anecdotes about believing in the impossible.And it’s an approach that seems to have worked. To a point.For if Khan, leader of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, has finally won the battle of his life, it has come at a cost. This election – Khan’s fourth bid for office – saw the single-minded politician adopt a hard-headed realism in his bid to break the stranglehold of the country’s Bhutto and Sharif dynasties. By default or design, he was the military’s favourite candidate. The notion that he may have have been swept along by the hidden currents of the country’s deep state cast a shadow over his win.The election was lopsided from the get-go, set against the backdrop of an ongoing corruption crackdown on the Sharifs’ Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), which included the jailing of ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif on the back of revelations from the 2016 Panama Papers leak. For Khan, the timing was fortuitous. Critics railed against attempts to silence media voices and the mass defection of candidates from PML-N to PTI, allegedly engineered by intelligence agents.The recruitment of these so-called “electables”, party-hopping politicians with large vote banks, is a tactic that might have stuck in Khan’s craw in years gone by, when the pro-democracy crusader had a higher-minded, some might say naive, approach to contesting elections. Khan’s defence of the country’s controversial blasphemy laws served as a further enticement to these political mercenaries. It was a move that displeased elements of the party’s old guard, who were shunted aside to clear seats for the newcomers, according to PTI insiders.Politics in Pakistan is a treacherous affair in which only the ruthless prosper. Once Khan grasped this, it seems he never looked back. But to attribute his success purely to shady deep state tampering would be disingenuous. Critics’ defence of Sharif, a man who was enriched and elevated to power under the military dictatorship of Zia ul-Haq in the 1980s, certainly no stranger to dirty politics himself, failed to resonate with voters eager to try something new. Khan, at least, was untested. And, so far, untainted.“The army definitely supported Khan in some way or another, but that doesn’t mean he didn’t enjoy popular support,” says Mazhar Abbas, a former AFP bureau chief, now with Geo TV. “One of the positives of Khan is that he really brought out those people who normally don’t vote in elections, the women and young people. There are now a lot of expectations on him.”Poised to assume power, the question is whether Khan, whose PTI party fell short of a majority and is likely to call upon independents to make up numbers, will have the authority to lead. His top challenges will be to strengthen institutions and stamp out corruption, two endeavours that may bring him into a head-on collision with the fickle, self-interested electables in his own ranks, a group that includes landlords used to calling the shots in their rural power-bases.With the economy on the verge of crashing, Khan should soon be knocking on the doors of the International Monetary Fund. Azeema Cheema, a political analyst, believes his victory speech, which struck a moderate note on relations with the US and India, was the first step in inspiring the confidence of the international community. “The economy comes first and foremost. He will have to do some lobbying to make himself credible and that will be connected to the foreign policy decisions he will take.”It is precisely on foreign policy that Khan could clash with the military, whose popularity in the country is largely derived from depicting India as an existential threat. If Sharif fell out with the generals, it was because he was seen as being too cosy with India, challenging the military’s alleged backing of Islamist militants in Indian-held Kashmir and Afghanistan.Playing the populist card, Khan accused the West of maligning Pakistan’s army to strengthen India during his campaign, but in the aftermath of victory, he spoke of moving away from “the blame game” that has blighted the two nuclear-powered nations since partition.Relations with the US could also be tricky. In his first tweet of 2018, Donald Trump blasted Pakistan for its “lies \u0026amp deceit”, accusing the country of playing a double game on terrorism. This year, the US withheld $255 million (€220 million) in aid from Pakistan. Khan is fiercely opposed to the war on terror, claiming that 70,000 lives have been lost fighting a US war that has led to an upsurge in militancy. With Khan in office, relations between the two countries may require a reset.Diplomats will be watching closely to see if Khan will be able to wrest defence and foreign policy from the generals. Kamal Alam, a Pakistan expert at the Royal United Services Institute, a London-based think-tank, doubts that Khan will accept being dictated to by the army. “Apart from him, nobody else in Pakistan really understands international affairs,” he says. “He understands the Americans and the Brits.”No amount of positive visualisation can change the grimy realities of Pakistani politics. Nor, indeed, the circumstances in which Khan won power. But the nation is counting on his willpower to achieve the vision of strong institutions and social justice that captured the nation’s imagination. Looking at Pakistan’s bloody history, at successive coups interspersed with periods of dynastic rule in which looting the country became the norm, Khan’s arrival could signal a new era.As one party activist in Lahore told The , the hope is that Pakistan’s prime minister-elect will create a country where nobody needs the military and the electables to win power. An impossible dream?

Photograph: Simon Dawson\u0026nbsp“The Treaties shall cease to apply to the State in question from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal agreement or, failing that, two years after the notification referred to in paragraph 2, unless the European Council, in agreement with the Member State concerned, unanimously decides to extend this period.” – – Article 50 (3), Lisbon TreatyYes, the UK can seek an extension to its EU membership beyond March 31st to facilitate discussions on its stalled Withdrawal Agreement. If, that is, all the member states agree to such an extension.All this talk in Brussels and London of time running out, of insuperable obstacles like the Irish backstop, and the real possibility of a “no-deal” Brexit has given currency to the idea of an extension.The Taoiseach and Tánaiste have both suggested in recent days that they would be open to the idea, although London has preferred instead to talk of accelerating or invigorating the talks, as if a reluctant Brussels is responsible for negotiations foot-dragging. Ha!Many Brexiteers now say privately, however, that almost any concession by London on the Withdrawal Agreement (WA) – not including a border in the Irish Sea – should be contemplated just to get the UK out of the EU on March 31st. Freedom! So the idea of extending UK membership is likely to be politically toxic in the Tory party.It would certainly be portrayed as the first step in betraying the Brexit cause, an incremental remain.Another way of circumventing the backstop roadblock, London would say, would be to kick discussions on it out of the WA framework and into the transition period when the UK will have left the EU but talks on the shape of a future relationship will be getting under way. The Border issue, they have always argued, is more easily resolved in the context of an overall settlement of that relationship.But seductive as that transition option might be – it was apparently advocated by a Polish minister last week – it remains completely unacceptable to the Irish and EU negotiators. It might appear simply to be another version of the article 50 extension breathing space for talks, but in truth it is a horse of an entirely different colour.Removing the backstop issue from the WA, which has to be ratified by the member states and the European Parliament, would be necessary for the issue to be kicked forward to transition.That would represent both a formal repudiation of a key element of the joint accord reached in December between the EU task force and the UK, and, just as importantly, a dangerous backsliding on a previously agreed policy that would inevitably call into question all agreed outcomes in the talks.The corollary of the principle that “nothing is agreed until everything is agreed” is that the process can also not involve endless renegotiation of settled matters.Crucially, the separation of the backstop issue from the WA would remove important leverage on the EU side, fatally undermining its ability to safeguard the special position of Northern Ireland. The UK needs a WA to have any prospect of an orderly Brexit and the vital transition. That means it must now, not later, face up to hard choices – notably some controls on the Irish Sea – or lose everything in a painful no-deal, no-transition exit.That much was again made abundantly clear to the Poles at the ministerial meeting last week when, once again, many member states rallied round the Irish. It is believed that they would not, however, stand in the way of an article 50 extension.That, however politically unpalatable in London, would simply allow more time for the WA to be agreed, undermining none of the previously made undertakings. And none of the hard choices for the UK.For the time being, however, London is not asking. Two months of unproductive summer discussions, with an October summit deal in doubt, may well bring a different perspective.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

Photograph: AFP Skayhan OzerAFPGetty ImagesThey call it the Affenkäfig, the monkey cage: a dusty, inner-city football pitch behind a high green fence in the western Germany city of Gelsenkirchen.With weeds poking up through the gravel and abandoned shopping trolleys at the edges, it’s where local youths play ball and talk – often joined by older neighbours. This week, as so often, they were talking about Mesut Özil.Karl-Heinz Hassmann remembers watching Özil play here as a youth, honing his talent in six- and seven-hour stretches at a time to become one of Germany’s best footballers – and now its most notorious.“People were looking for a scapegoat for this affair and Özil fit the bill,” he said.The affair began in London last May when Özil met Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan at a charity event in London.When photos of the meeting were published online by the Erdogan election campaign, Özil – a media favourite and idol in the German-Turkish community – was accused by German politicians and journalists of endorsing an authoritarian leader weeks before a poll in which Turks living in Germany could – and did – vote for him en masse.A series of crisis meetings followed, including with the German president, but Özil declined to comment. His silence sparked further fury and overshadowed his disappointing World Cup.This week came from the player a remarkable 2,200-word statement attacking what he sees as racism, disrespect and double standards in the German football association (DFB) and German society. The statement ended with the announcement he would no longer don the German national jersey.“I used to wear the German shirt with such pride and excitement, but now I don’t,” he said.Özil said his decision to meet president Erdogan was a sign of respect for the Turkish head of state.“My job is a football player and not a politician, and our meeting was not an endorsement of any policies,” he said.He then let fly at the German football association (DFB) and the German media, accusing them of racism and double standards for singling him out for criticism.Former German World Cup captain Lothar Matthäus was not criticised for meeting Russia’s Vladimir Putin, he pointed out, while other national players like Lukas Podolski are not constantly confronted with their family’s foreign roots.“Does my Turkish heritage make me a more worthy target?” he asked. “Is it because it is Turkey? Is it because I’m a Muslim? . . . By being referred to as German-Turkish, it is already distinguishing people who have family from more than one country.”With his angry statement he was clearly venting years of pent-up frustration. It was also a masterstroke of PR reframing.Germans are no longer discussing whether they accept his reasons for meeting a statesman who has overseen a mass wave of firings and imprisonment of critics he dubs “terrorists”.\u0026nbspInstead Germans are talking about race and identity in an era of rising nationalism exploited by politicians, not least president Erdogan, around the world.After weeks on the back foot, the Arsenal footballer has kicking a primed grenade, with perfect precision, directly at an Achilles heel of German life: integration.In 1999 Mesut Özil was 11-years-old and probably kicking a ball around his neighbourhood pitch when, 500km to the east, the Bundestag passed a new law revolutionising German citizenship. Until then, people born here to non-German parents did not have an automatic right to German citizenship, even if they lived here their entire lives. People like Mezut Özil, whose grandfather came to Germany 48 years ago as a Gastarbeiter, a “guest worker”.The SPD-Green government changed the citizenship rules in 1999 to reflect the new reality: the “guest” workers had made new homes in Germany and were now and parents and grandparents. But the bureaucratic change was never matched by a campaign to change public attitudes.The Özil row has exposed as unresolved a dangerous gap between law and perception about who qualifies as German, and who doesn’t.The row has the potential to undermine the last dozen years of social peace since the German “summer miracle”, when millions of World Cup fans in Germany experienced a nation at peace with itself – not a given considering the ghosts of the past.The World Cup victory of 2014 sealed the deal with the trophy brought home by a team of young, fleet-footed multicultural players like Mesut Özil. The message was clear: it doesn’t matter if your surname has German or Turkish umlauts, if you play by the team rules, you’re welcome.After the World Cup disaster, crashing out in the first round, Özil says he was bombarded with hate mail. In the stadium after the World Cup match against Sweden, he said a German fan in the stands attacked him as a “shitty Turkish pig”.“I am German when we win, but I am an immigrant when we lose,” he wrote.Germany’s mixed feelings – and signals – on immigration are reflected in the the ruling Christian Democratic Union (CDU).Until a decade ago the party denied the obvious and insisted Germany was “not a country of immigration”. When that position was no longer credible, Angela Merkel switched to a new message: multiculturalism has failed. The people who the CDU once denied were there now must pledge unfailing loyalty to a state the CDU ensured denied their right to citizenship.That was why Özil, in his statement, said it was “unforgiveable and unforgettable” how DFB chief Reinhard Grindel, in his time as a CDU Bundestag MP, called multiculturalism a “lifelong lie”.Instead of the CDU acknowledging its contribution to a sense of alienation among Germans with migrant roots, Angela Merkel’s party backed a motion in 2016 to strip Germans with a second, non-EU passport, of their right to dual citizenship.The Özil debate also ided the CDU’s coalition partner, too: the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD).While SPD justice minister Katharina Barley heard “alarm bells” in Özil’s feelings of exclusion, SPD foreign minister Heiko Maas was dismissive.“I don’t think the case of a multimillionaire living and working in England says much about Germany’s ability to integrate people,” he said.The media is also ided. The left-wing Taz thanked Özil for forcing a debate on integration in Germany, while the Bild tabloid’s hypercritical coverage of the Özil affair climaxed in a front-page headline: “Whinging Retreat”.It’s clear Germany is already a house ided as it faces into a fresh round of its tortured integration debate – this time in a changed world.Even as Özil and his team-mates brought the World Cup home in 2014, Germany was in the middle of a migration crisis. Over one million people arrived in Germany in the subsequent two years. The initial warm welcome towards migrants has cooled, thanks in part to a series of violent attacks and murders carried out by migrants.The rise of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) means racism and xenophobia – implied or explicit – are no longer taboo in public debate.Testing his dog whistle a year ago, AfD leader Alexander Gauland suggested no German was interested in having as a neighbour anyone with a name like Özil’s team-mate Jerome Boateng.The remark sparked uproar, but not among all. Before this year’s World Cup, far-right groups posted sarcastic remarks on social media wishing well the 2018 side of players with names like Özil, Khedira, Mustafi, Boateng, and making sneering comparisons to previous national sides with more German-sounding players like Beckenbauer and Ballack.Until May 29-year-old midfielder Özil was the Wizard of Öz, a boy made good whose talent was a passport out of a city marked by structural decline. After playing for Schalke 04 in the Bundesliga he left Germany, first for Real Madrid, then Arsenal.For fellow Germans with Turkish roots still in Germany, his statement has struck a chord. Germany is no America, they complain there are no clear club membership rules and, no matter what effort you make, one slip will see you excluded.That in turn infuriates other Germans with Turkish roots like the young author and blogger Tubia Sarica.She fears Özil’s racism accusations will only magnify a victim mentality she sees in the Turkish-German community towards the “bad” Germans.“It’s easier to keep intact the image of the bad German because then you give away responsibility for yourself,” she said. “Erdogan has recognised this victim complex . . . and instrumentalised it for himself.”As the dust settles, it’s likely the final act has yet to play out in the Mesut Özil tragedy. In his family’s ancestral home in Devrek, a giant poster of the jerseyed player was replaced this week with the controversial photograph of him with Mr Erdogan.The Turkish president, in a phone call with the footballer on Monday evening, praised his “patriotism”.For the 29-year-old German citizen to retire from international football, it is a snub to his homeland, a disastrous signal for German integration and, for president Erdogan, a\u0026nbsppropaganda coup."},{"url":null,"title":"summer sun britons make heatwave pictures","story":"As Britain continues to bake in heatwave conditions, a young man jumps in to the sea from a wall opposite Brighton pier.Sunseekers took to beaches and beauty spots across Britain at the weekend, as the fine and dry weather looks sent to continue for at least another week.Here we look at how people across Britain are making the most of the scorching temperatures while they can.Kanye West says he \u0026#39identifies with Alexander McQueen\u0026#39 in comments about suicideUK blood moon: World looks to the skies for rare lunar eclipseBoxer Freddie Mills \u0026#39was murdered by the Mob\u0026#39, BBC documentary claimsComment: From orce to gender, our laws should not be changed on a whim\u0026#39Terrifying\u0026#39 tornadoes of flame leave 2 dead as inferno destroys Californian city of ReddingHow the smart meter roll out became such an expensive failure its own minister has thrown his outPosh grain-free dog food may be linked to heart disease, vets fearCEO of broadcast giant CBS Les Moonves investigated for sexual misconduct Police arrest man on suspicion of murder and sexual activity with child after body of girl, 13, found in woodlandLunar eclipse: How stargazers will be able to see Mars, Jupiter and the International Space Station tooUK blood moon: How to view the longest total lunar eclipse so far this century tonightBoy, six, dies after being \u0026#39shot by pellet gun\u0026#39 at great-grandparents\u0026#39 home in East YorkshireBear terrifies family at Woburn Safari Park when it attacks their carThe \u0026#39reserve parachute\u0026#39: Secret Brexit plan being drawn up by ministers in case Chequers deal is killed off by EUChristine Lampard\u0026#39s stalker who left her scared to leave home alone avoids jail Pakistan election results: Imran Khan wins but rivals reject the voteUK sends £10m of emergency food aid to starving Afghans facing worst drought in decadesChildren should be taught how to win and lose, says teacher behind three of Britain’s best sportsmenMacron plummets to new poll low after bodyguard scandal that forced him into bizarre denial of gay affairComment: An almighty mess, and then the breakthrough: how Donald Trump would negotiate BrexitWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

For students, they are killers of motivation. “A student given an unconditional offer can hardly be expected to work as hard as they would have for the second part of their a-level course. Even the best school may struggle to motivate that young person, or even get them to come to school.”The number of unconditional offers given to BBB students has soaredFigures from Ucas, the university admissions service, have revealed that almost one in four students - some 24 per cent - who were predicted to get three Bs were given at least one unconditional offer in 2017.This figure is far higher than that for top students, which stood at 4.6 per cent for those predicted to get three A*s. In 2010, just 0.9 per cent of students who were predicted to get three Bs were given at least one unconditional offer, but this has soared by 23.1 percentage points in seven years. Dr Stephen continued: “Unconditional offers can sometimes put a student at a disadvantage: if a young person has not mastered the demands of a-level, they may not be able to cope with what is expected at university. “They can be seriously damaging to a student who is unsuited either to the course or university itself, as the dropout rate suggests.”This was the fate of one student, Eden Scott. Miss Scott was predicted AAB but dropped one grade to ABB in her final examinations, a result she feels was down to her unconditional offer.The 20-year-old from London said: “I got an unconditional offer to study American and Canadian studies at Birmingham University but that 100 per cent made me stop trying as hard as I should have. “I didn’t even want to study there that much but I just went with the unconditional offer and ended up settling when I really wasn’t that bothered. “I think unconditional offers aren’t a good idea - I know that if I didn’t have one I would have got better grades and probably gone to a university I really wanted to. “Instead I settled for Birmingham and ended up having to pay £9,000 in fees after I dropped out at the start of my second year.”She added that such offers “encourage laziness” and meant “some students aren’t reaching their full potential.”Dr Stephen also raised concerns over the value of degrees which were handing out unconditional offers to their students. Media, technologies and arts courses give out a lot of unconditionalsHe said: “How impressed are employers going to be by a course that you do not have to work for to get into or reach any standard, but which you get into simply by filling in an application form?“The plain truth is that we have too many universities and we need to bring back the Polytechnics. “Nobody – students, schools, the economy – wins from the disgrace of unconditional offers, and a degree so easy to get into is likely to be as valuable as a shady Diploma bought off the internet  – except the latter won’t cost the student, and society, £50,000.”Yesterday the Office for Students confirmed that whilst it would not be appropriate to ban unconditional offers they will be looking to ensure the admissions process remains “fair and reliable” and would taken action if necessary. Kanye West says he \u0026#39identifies with Alexander McQueen\u0026#39 in comments about suicideUK blood moon: World looks to the skies for rare lunar eclipseBoxer Freddie Mills \u0026#39was murdered by the Mob\u0026#39, BBC documentary claimsComment: From orce to gender, our laws should not be changed on a whim\u0026#39Terrifying\u0026#39 tornadoes of flame leave 2 dead as inferno destroys Californian city of ReddingHow the smart meter roll out became such an expensive failure its own minister has thrown his outPosh grain-free dog food may be linked to heart disease, vets fearCEO of broadcast giant CBS Les Moonves investigated for sexual misconduct Police arrest man on suspicion of murder and sexual activity with child after body of girl, 13, found in woodlandLunar eclipse: How stargazers will be able to see Mars, Jupiter and the International Space Station tooUK blood moon: How to view the longest total lunar eclipse so far this century tonightBoy, six, dies after being \u0026#39shot by pellet gun\u0026#39 at great-grandparents\u0026#39 home in East YorkshireBear terrifies family at Woburn Safari Park when it attacks their carThe \u0026#39reserve parachute\u0026#39: Secret Brexit plan being drawn up by ministers in case Chequers deal is killed off by EUChristine Lampard\u0026#39s stalker who left her scared to leave home alone avoids jail Pakistan election results: Imran Khan wins but rivals reject the voteUK sends £10m of emergency food aid to starving Afghans facing worst drought in decadesChildren should be taught how to win and lose, says teacher behind three of Britain’s best sportsmenMacron plummets to new poll low after bodyguard scandal that forced him into bizarre denial of gay affairComment: An almighty mess, and then the breakthrough: how Donald Trump would negotiate BrexitWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"does 2018s scorching summer compare great heatwave 1976","story":"For weeks Britain has baked under sweltering conditions that have seen dire public health warnings issued, the army called in to tackle raging moor fires and hosepipe bans imposed on parts of the country.After the UK experienced one of the driest Junes on record the hot conditions have stretched into July with no end in sight.This week the Met Office warned people to try and stay out of the sun as temperatures could soar as high as 38C (100F) on Friday.

Its chief executive Mark Zuckerberg has been hauled in to testify at length before the US Congress,...To continue reading this articleStart your free trial of PremiumAccess all Premium articles then only £2 per weekAccess one Premium article per weekRegister for freeStart an annual subscription and receive a Fitbit Versa, worth £199View all subscription options\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp|LoginPlease review our commenting policyKanye West says he \u0026#39identifies with Alexander McQueen\u0026#39 in comments about suicideUK blood moon: World looks to the skies for rare lunar eclipseBoxer Freddie Mills \u0026#39was murdered by the Mob\u0026#39, BBC documentary claimsComment: From orce to gender, our laws should not be changed on a whim\u0026#39Terrifying\u0026#39 tornadoes of flame leave 2 dead as inferno destroys Californian city of ReddingHow the smart meter roll out became such an expensive failure its own minister has thrown his outPosh grain-free dog food may be linked to heart disease, vets fearCEO of broadcast giant CBS Les Moonves investigated for sexual misconduct Police arrest man on suspicion of murder and sexual activity with child after body of girl, 13, found in woodlandLunar eclipse: How stargazers will be able to see Mars, Jupiter and the International Space Station tooUK blood moon: How to view the longest total lunar eclipse so far this century tonightBoy, six, dies after being \u0026#39shot by pellet gun\u0026#39 at great-grandparents\u0026#39 home in East YorkshireBear terrifies family at Woburn Safari Park when it attacks their carThe \u0026#39reserve parachute\u0026#39: Secret Brexit plan being drawn up by ministers in case Chequers deal is killed off by EUChristine Lampard\u0026#39s stalker who left her scared to leave home alone avoids jail Pakistan election results: Imran Khan wins but rivals reject the voteUK sends £10m of emergency food aid to starving Afghans facing worst drought in decadesChildren should be taught how to win and lose, says teacher behind three of Britain’s best sportsmenMacron plummets to new poll low after bodyguard scandal that forced him into bizarre denial of gay affairComment: An almighty mess, and then the breakthrough: how Donald Trump would negotiate BrexitWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/07/27/TELEMMGLPICT000169337262_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqpVlberWd9EgFPZtcLiMQfyf2A9a6I9YchsjMeADBa08.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"emmanuel brigitte macrons hair make up costs 5200 month report","story":"The French President and First Lady spent €62,400 in a year on hair and make-up, budget review revealsBrigitte Macron keeps her golden locks looking good with the help of her husband’s official hairdresser, whose services to the presidential couple cost the French taxpayer a whopping €5,200 a month, a new report reveals.The Court of Accounts provided the figure in its annual review of the Élysée budget, but the lavish spending on the couple’s hair and make-up has not caused the outcry it might have in Britain, where David Cameron’s outlay of £90 for a trim raised eyebrows when he was PM.Instead French media focused on the fact that the first lady’s office cost the state €278,750 a year, lower than the annual €440,000 a year predicted by the government.But commentators did note that the report lamented that it could not provide an exact figure because of imprecise accounting practices by the first lady’s office and that the total might well be more.The handsomely paid hairdresser is required to be ready to jump in with his or her hairdryer and make-up kit in the Élysée Palace and during visits, according to the Court of Accounts, whose calculations make the total hair and make-up bill an annual €62,400.The identity of the Elyséé coiffeur has not been made public, but his or her monthly €5,200  for tending to the presidential hair compares very favourably with France’s minimum salary of €1,498.The lack of outrage at such seemingly high maintenance hair is all the more surprising given the extensive media coverage of Emmanuel Macron’s use of cosmetics last summer.It emerged last August that he spent €26,000 on makeup during his first three months as president.Le Point magazine reported then that his personal makeup artist - referred to only as Natacha M, who has since been replaced - put in two bills, one for €10,000 and another for €16,000.It may seem like a stratospheric sum for a president who has described his style as “Jupiterian” - lofty in the spirit of the God of Roman gods.But Le Point estimated the overall figure for make-up for Mr Macron’s predecessor, the Socialist François Holland, at €30,000 per quarter.Please review our commenting policyKanye West says he \u0026#39identifies with Alexander McQueen\u0026#39 in comments about suicideUK blood moon: World looks to the skies for rare lunar eclipseBoxer Freddie Mills \u0026#39was murdered by the Mob\u0026#39, BBC documentary claimsComment: From orce to gender, our laws should not be changed on a whim\u0026#39Terrifying\u0026#39 tornadoes of flame leave 2 dead as inferno destroys Californian city of ReddingHow the smart meter roll out became such an expensive failure its own minister has thrown his outPosh grain-free dog food may be linked to heart disease, vets fearCEO of broadcast giant CBS Les Moonves investigated for sexual misconduct Police arrest man on suspicion of murder and sexual activity with child after body of girl, 13, found in woodlandLunar eclipse: How stargazers will be able to see Mars, Jupiter and the International Space Station tooUK blood moon: How to view the longest total lunar eclipse so far this century tonightBoy, six, dies after being \u0026#39shot by pellet gun\u0026#39 at great-grandparents\u0026#39 home in East YorkshireBear terrifies family at Woburn Safari Park when it attacks their carThe \u0026#39reserve parachute\u0026#39: Secret Brexit plan being drawn up by ministers in case Chequers deal is killed off by EUChristine Lampard\u0026#39s stalker who left her scared to leave home alone avoids jail Pakistan election results: Imran Khan wins but rivals reject the voteUK sends £10m of emergency food aid to starving Afghans facing worst drought in decadesChildren should be taught how to win and lose, says teacher behind three of Britain’s best sportsmenMacron plummets to new poll low after bodyguard scandal that forced him into bizarre denial of gay affairComment: An almighty mess, and then the breakthrough: how Donald Trump would negotiate BrexitWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"everything life going wrong blaming mercury retrograde","story":"Mercury, pictured, is current retrograde, meaning it appears to be going backwards in the skyIf things aren’t quite falling your way at the moment the answer could lie beyond mere chance and circumstance and in the heavens. Well, more precisely, with a single planet: Mercury.For most of those acquainted with the phenomenon of the planet Mercury going retrograde, it is little more than a planetary optical illusion.It occurs when the closest planet to the sun appears to be going backwards in the sky, as it will for the next few weeks.But for the astrologically-minded it augurs an altogether more sinister interval where they need to be careful what they say and avoid starting serious undertakings.The period, which starts around today, is already causing consternation among some on social media who are wary of the baleful effects of Mercury going into reverse.As an astronomical phenomenon, a planet goes retrograde when it gives the appearance that it is going backwards.Planets cross the night sky from west to east, which is known as a prograde motion. The illusion that a planet suddenly reverses direction happens when a faster moving planet catches up with it.It is the planetary equivalent of a slower train appearing to go backwards to a passenger in a faster train as it passes by.Mercury appears to be going backwards when it is passed by a faster planetMercury goes retrograde three times a year and the illusion lasts for around three weeks.The planet derives its astrological significance from the Roman messenger god Mercury and thus represents communication and expression.When the planet goes retrograde, it can signal a time for the astrologically-inclined when miscommunications and disagreements will abound.More latterly, it has also been read as a generally inauspicious time to start any undertaking and one when important purchases or endeavours should be avoided, or at least carefully scrutinised.Essentially, for the next three weeks try to keep your counsel, don’t make any huge life decisions and this is definitely not the time to consider texting an ex.Astrologers warn that retrograde Mercury is a period to be careful with your communicationsSome are so concerned by this period that there is a website, ismercuryinretrograde, dedicated simply to telling people whether Mercury is retrograde or not.Astrologer Susan Miller has warned on her blog that a retrograde Mercury can be a harbinger of “pandemonium”.“Therefore, while Mercury naps, the activities that it governs don’t have the benefit of a well-functioning, wide-awake planet to supervise them. Expect a certain degree of pandemonium to ensue!She added: “Don’t make any important moves when Mercury is retrograde. Nothing will be settled successfully for the future during these periods anyway – you will find it nearly impossible to nail down a plan.“During a retrograde period, it is hard to get decisions from others. Even if a decision is made, it will be subject to change, either just after Mercury turns to direct motion or much later.”The practice of people trying to ine earthly developments from studying the stars goes back to the earliest human civilisations, with the first strong evidence coming from the Babylonians circa 2000BC.By the Classical period it had a mixed reputation, with some Roman emperors having an imperial astrologer at their courts but at other times it was viewed as a malign form of magic.The practice enjoyed a resurgence in medieval times when doctors often carried charts with them so they could check the position of the stars before making a diagnosis.An undated painting showing Christopher Columbus arriving at one of the Caribbean islands on his voyage of discoveryBut it has also periodically been a source of chicanery, as Christopher Columbus once used his knowledge of when a blood moon would occur to convince a tribe of recalcitrant Caribbean indians that their god was angry with them for not providing him with food.Meanwhile, the Aztecs read the celestial signs to mean that they had to regularly cut the beating hearts out of live sacrificial victims from neighbouring civilisations to appease the sun.It is estimated that as many as 20,000 prisoners were subjected to this excruciating death every year.Please review our commenting policyBoxer Freddie Mills \u0026#39was murdered by the Mob\u0026#39, BBC documentary claimsComment: From orce to gender, our laws should not be changed on a whimUK blood moon: World looks to the skies for rare lunar eclipse\u0026#39Terrifying\u0026#39 tornadoes of flame leave 2 dead as inferno destroys Californian city of ReddingHow the smart meter roll out became such an expensive failure its own minister has thrown his outPosh grain-free dog food may be linked to heart disease, vets fearCEO of broadcast giant CBS Les Moonves investigated for sexual misconduct Police arrest man on suspicion of murder and sexual activity with child after body of girl, 13, found in woodlandLunar eclipse: How stargazers will be able to see Mars, Jupiter and the International Space Station tooUK blood moon: How to view the longest total lunar eclipse so far this century tonightBoy, six, dies after being \u0026#39shot by pellet gun\u0026#39 at great-grandparents\u0026#39 home in East YorkshireBear terrifies family at Woburn Safari Park when it attacks their carThe \u0026#39reserve parachute\u0026#39: Secret Brexit plan being drawn up by ministers in case Chequers deal is killed off by EUChristine Lampard\u0026#39s stalker who left her scared to leave home alone avoids jail Pakistan election results: Imran Khan wins but rivals reject the voteUK sends £10m of emergency food aid to starving Afghans facing worst drought in decadesChildren should be taught how to win and lose, says teacher behind three of Britain’s best sportsmenMacron plummets to new poll low after bodyguard scandal that forced him into bizarre denial of gay affairComment: An almighty mess, and then the breakthrough: how Donald Trump would negotiate BrexitUK weather: Danger to life warning as intense storms halt Britain\u0026#39s heatwave We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/07/27/TELEMMGLPICT000169960719_trans_NvBQzQNjv4Bq6844extr6dIv-d8O8PIpPqbshHooRpJk-anXnRBzWKY.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"uk sends 10m emergency food aid starving afghans facing worst","story":"The aid package announced by Penny Mordaunt will help feed 441,000 people as part of a World Food Programme campaign, as Afghanistan faces a severe drought Britain has announced £10m of emergency food aid to Afghans facing starvation as a result of the country\u0027s worst drought in decades.An estimated 1.4 million are at risk after reduced snow and rainfall have seen agriculture collapse in parts of the country, raising fears of a massive displacement of people.Tens of thousands are being driven from their rural homes to cities and others are heading abroad.Penny Mordaunt, International Development Secretary, said: “The drought in Afghanistan is an unfolding crisis, with 1.4 million people’s lives at risk when this year’s harvest fails in only a matter of weeks.“The UK continues to stand by the government of Afghanistan and we have taken decisive action to step in early before the worst of the drought strikes to help prevent needless pain and suffering.”Officials said the aid package would help feed 441,000 people as part of a World Food Programme campaign.Afghan local residents pick up food packets of US humanitarian aid dropped by planes in a field near Khwaja-Bahauddin, anti-Taliban stronghold in northern AfghanistanRainfall is down by as much as 70 per cent this year in a drought blamed on the La Nina Pacific weather system. Previous dry years mean the water table is low and wells have run dry. The drought has struck 20 provinces, with the worst affected in the north and west.More than 50,000 have already been driven off the land to the city of Herat.Families fleeing the drought last week told the  the crisis was likely to drive more Afghans abroad to seek a better life.The drought comes on top of worsening violence in the country\u0027s long-running conflict and a struggling economy.Large numbers of livestock have died and families have little to eat, while the harvest is expected to fail totally in weeks.One farmer called Ghulam told the  he was facing catastrophe and would consider joining a militant group if it meant his son would not starve.“ I can assure you that some nights, none of these families have even bread to eat, and they go to sleep hungry.

and predicted the number will decline further.The decline in monthly users comes as Twitter contends with increasing fake spam accounts and dangerous rhetoric on the platform.Monthly active users are at 335 million in the current quarter, according to a statement released by Twitter on Friday, down from 336 million in the first quarter.Despite the decline, the number of users is up 2.8 per cent from the past year, but Twitter expects the numbers to continue falling as the crusade against spam accounts continues. \u0026nbsp“Our second quarter results reflect the work we’re doing to ensure more people get value from Twitter every day,” said Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey in a statement. “We want people to feel safe freely expressing themselves and have launched new tools to address problem behaviours that distort and distract from the public conversation.”According to Dorsey, the company’s machine-learning algorithms are identifying more than 9 million potential spam or fake accounts a week.The company also suggested the decline is in part due to stricter privacy rules in Europe and changes to the way the service is used through SMS messaging.Twitter reported net income for the third consecutive quarter, driving shares 79 per cent higher this year to\u0026nbsp$42.94 (£32.75)\u0026nbspat Thursday’s close. However, the company’s forecast for third-quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation of\u0026nbsp$235m (£179m)\u0026nbspis lower than the analyst average estimate of\u0026nbsp$268m\u0026nbsp(£204m).Although Twitter is confident that their efforts are in the best long-term interest of the platform, the declines have raised concerns among investors in the company.As President Trump’s favoured outlet of communication, the fear is that the platform will not be able to attract general audience users, according to Bloomberg.“Despite Trump being perhaps the most high-profile user possible, usage has not dramatically improved over the past couple of years,” Benjamin Schachter, an analyst at Macquarie Securities wrote to investors before the earnings were released.However, Twitter doesn’t measure success by monthly visitors - instead highlighting daily active users as the best measure, which has increased by 11 per cent from a year earlier.The increase marks the seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year increases, according to Bloomberg.The company’s recent product updates and changes, such as live video streaming, have also made a difference in revenue - as advertising is easier than ever on the platform.11 useful Twitter features you might not know about111 Turn on Night ModeTwitter’s dark blue Night Mode is a lot easier on your eyes than its regular, vibrant theme.

But when it comes to the Olympics, they are left out in the coldClick to followThe Independent OnlineThe Faroe Islands has long been fighting for Olympic recognitionIt was supposed to be one of the happiest days of his life.On Friday 5 August 2016, Pál Joensen and 119 other Danish athletes followed Caroline Wozniacki out of the bowels of the Maracanã Stadium and into the full glare of the world’s spotlight, as several thousand camera lenses flashed in unison like fireflies. The group moved slowly, squeezed between much smaller delegations from Cuba and Djibouti, pausing frequently to wave into the glare of the luminous crowd.Like the other men Joensen wore a smart navy Jack \u0026amp Jones suit despite the temperature, the only concession to the evening’s stifling heat a red and white striped tee in lieu of a button down shirt. Walking near the front of the group, he made a concerted effort to patiently drink in the splendour despite the blur of movement both before and behind him. Because, although this was his second Olympic Games, it was his first opening ceremony. In London, he had no time for such luxury, with the 400m freestyle heats inconveniently scheduled for the very first day of competition, ensuring he was tucked up in bed for an early night.But in Rio he had been gifted more time to prepare, more time to enjoy. He had waited years for this moment as had all those athletes who surrounded him: a lifetime’s yearning condensed into a slow, celebratory shuffle from one side of a stadium to another, a moment he had worked so hard to achieve and yet with the promise of an even greater achievement on the horizon. This was it. The distillation of his dream.Pál Joensen circled (Getty)And yet there was a problem. A few problems, in fact. For starters, the logo embroidered onto his breast pocket was not the logo of his Olympic federation. And the fluttering wisp of red fabric leading the congregation was not his flag. And the beaming athletes he walked among may have been his team-mates, but they were not his compatriots. Because — and despite all evidence to the contrary — Pál Joensen is not Danish.He was not born in Denmark. He had not grown up in Denmark. And he will never consider himself to be from Denmark. Joensen is instead from the Faroe Islands, an autonomous country located some 700 miles away, with its own language, culture and flag. And a country with its own Olympic federation, albeit one persistently ignored by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the non-governmental authority responsible for running the Games.Which rather begs the question: why? Why is a country that is a founding member of the International Paralympic Committee, one that sits closer to Scotland than Denmark and takes pride in its own recognised football, volleyball and handball teams, not recognised by the IOC despite the existence of an Olympic Committee since 1982? And why are athletes such as Joensen not allowed to represent their country of birth at the Olympics, despite competing with a Faroese flag on their chest at a multitude of other international tournaments?There is no easy answer, despite the IOC’s protestations otherwise. Which leaves Faroese sport in limbo and athletes from the country facing a stark choice: compete for a foreign flag or sacrifice your Olympic dream. Unsurprisingly the Faroese are desperate for this to change, this year launching a campaign to push the IOC into finally affording them Olympic recognition.“Thomas Bach speaks about the Olympic spirit being ‘for all and everyone’, but why does all and everyone not include the Faroe Islands?” asks Jon Hestoy, the Vice President of the Faroese Olympic Committee, on a visit to London at the start of summer. “We really feel that the Olympic spirit would be a reason to let us in and it’s not just a case of fighting for recognition to get on the gravy train. I just wish people could visit the Faroe Islands for themselves and see what it is this small country has to offer.”So, with less than two years to go until Tokyo 2020 and 35 years since the establishment of an exceptionally frustrated Faroese Olympic Committee, I caught the short flight from Edinburgh to the small village of Sørvágur to find out exactly what he meant.Tórshavn, the capital city of the Faroe Islands (AFP)It is a frigid Friday night in Tórshavn, the smallest capital city in Europe with a population around ten times smaller than the Isle of Wight. Not that you would know that on this particular evening, where the narrow roads that sharply wind from the port to the small administrative district team with people celebrating mentanarnáttin — or ‘Culture Night’ — in Scandinavia’s discombobulating midnight sun. A large group of teenagers sing traditional folk songs in the city centre. An even larger group mulls around to watch. And shopkeepers lean next to wide open doors, with customers languidly flitting from one to the next, pint glass or something warmer in hand.Over dinner on the harbour, Hestoy, my first port of call, holds court. The restaurant is an impressively gnarled old 18th-century warehouse: rough stone walls dimly lit, wooden tables made from the mast of an old sailing ship masted just outside, a menu containing all manner of extravagantly prepared fish. By the time the main course is brought out — melt in the mouth cod with brown butter and pumpkin seeds — Hestoy is already in full flow.In between mouthfuls of food, his palpable sense of frustration grows, as he explains to me how his small country came to be left out in the cold. “Everybody that we meet within the IOC knows of the Faroese problem,” he says. “And there is always an answer: you have to be independent. It is the mantra of the IOC. So our aim is to get people to ask: why? Why is it that the Faroe Islands are not recognised? Why are they part of the Paralympic movement? Why do we have this rule? And why can it not be changed?“We have been in close contact with the IOC for many years but the door to membership has been repeatedly slammed in our face. And taking on the Olympic movement is a big ask. We all knew this was going to be an uphill struggle, but it is increasingly feeling as though we are stood on the north side of Mount Everest gazing up.”Hestoy sighs. In his youth he was an outstanding swimmer himself, representing the Faroe Islands with distinction at numerous international events before retiring and moving into a series of administrative positions. First the president of the national swimming federation. Then a new role with the Olympic Committee. He even travelled to Rio in 2016 to help set up the 10k Marathon Swim Course. But navigating the murky waters of the Olympic movement is without a doubt his biggest challenge yet.On the surface, at least, the IOC’s argument is simple. The Faroe Islands have been a self-governing region of Denmark since 1948, ruling on all issues except for foreign policy and defence. It is not, therefore, an independent sovereign state, and isn’t considered as such by the United Nations. Factor in an Olympic charter change in 1996 — which ruled that NOC recognition can “only be granted after recognition as an independent state by the international community” — and it begins to look like an open-and-shut case. The Faroe Islands is not an independent state. Therefore the Faroe Islands is not entitled to an Olympic team.But as the dessert begins to be passed around, Hestoy contends this is an all too simplistic argument that fails to take into consideration a wealth of mitigating factors. Several countries — from Aruba to Bermuda, Guam to Puerto Rico — are in similar political situations to the Faroese and yet were recognised by the IOC prior to 1996, meaning they are free to compete. And then there’s the fact that Kosovo and Chinese Taipei both compete at the Games, despite limited international recognition. Meanwhile all sport on the island is entirely self-funded, with eight different international federations circumventing the IOC by recognising the Faroe Islands.And then there’s Denmark. You would be forgiven for thinking the country has little interest in seeing the Faroese obtain their sporting freedom given the potential political ramifications, as well as the added boon of being able to cherry-pick their best athletes every four years. But that couldn’t be further from the truth. The Danish Olympic Committee has repeatedly offered its support to their Faroese counterparts, while the Danish Prime Minister, Lars Løkke Rasmussen, has also spoken out on their behalf. “I would consider it quite natural and would welcome that also the Faroe Islands obtain recognition in the IOC on an equal footing with other members, which have similar status as the Faroe Islands,” he said on a recent visit to the islands.The next day, Hestoy leads me through the muddled streets of Tinganes — ‘The Thing’ — the historical core of Tórshavn since the Viking era and one of three oldest parliamentary meeting places in the world, along with Tynwald Hill in the Isle of Man and Þingvellir in nearby Iceland. And yet, as with most things in the Faroe Islands, its unassuming significance is easy to miss. We walk towards a small spit of rocky land jutting out abruptly between two harbours, where several blood red, turf-roofed buildings cluster together. The furthest away from us is Føroya Landssýri, the seat of the Faroese Home Rule government, where Poul Michelsen, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, is waiting for us.Michelsen, who turned 74 earlier this month, is slender, white-haired and oddly regal, in the way that those who have spent a lifetime in public service so often are. He was elected mayor of Tórshavn in 1981. In 1984 he was first elected as a member of the Løgting, the Faroese parliament. And in 2011 he even helped to form a new political party, the pro-Faroese independence Framsókn. But it is not to talk politics that Hestoy has led me to Michelsen. Quite the opposite.“This is not a political issue,” he says simply, sipping his coffee. (Like the rest of Tórshavn, Michelsen was out late cerebrating mentanarnáttin with his family.) “Whether you are unionist or republican does not matter when it comes to this issue, because everybody is united. And when we are in Parliament there is never a debate on whether we should push for recognition or not. The only debate is how much money we commit to the project.”Later, the Minister of Education, Research and Culture, Rigmor Dam, corroborates Michelsen’s claims that this is an issue of national importance that goes beyond politics. Dam, a social democrat who represents the centre-left Javnaðarflokkurin party, is a Unionist and yet reiterates that Denmark and the Faroe Islands are two entirely different nations.“This is not a political struggle between us and Denmark,” she says. “In regards to culture and sport we are an independent country from Denmark, we have our own language, our own culture, history and sports. We don\u0027t feel Danish at all in this way and they don\u0027t feel Faroese at all. So as a Unionist politician I can say that we are supporting this bid fully.”And yet despite this unprecedented level of co-operation across the political spectrum, as well as the full support of Denmark, the IOC still appear to be wary of the political backlash of handing Olympic recognition to the Faroe Islands. I ask Hestoy how frustrating this is given the united front of all Faroese lawmakers. “It is very frustrating for us, who have all worked hard on this campaign,” he nods. “But it is the athletes who most suffer. That is a question you need to ask them.”There are 37 different words for fog in the Faroe Islands. Slavtoka is a rainy mist. Mjørkabrúgv is a fog bank that sits on the horizon. Hjallamjørki is a thick belt of fog, above and below which it is tantalisingly clear. And fjallamjørki is a mountain fog, which descends from the heavens in a matter of seconds, covering the Faroe Islands’ small settlements like a burst of breath on a window pane.During my trip to Klaksvík I encountered at least two dozen of these different types of fog, or mjørki. The weather in the Faroe Islands changes endlessly, as dramatic microclimates form around the huge mountain peaks and steep sea-cliffs which rise suddenly from the teal Atlantic, and it is not uncommon to enter one of the country’s many tunnels struggling to see for fog, only to emerge a few minutes later into brilliant, blinding sunlight.Fortunately, however, when I arrive at Við Djúpumýrar, the football stadium of local team KÍ Klaksvík, the fog has vanished completely as if somebody had turned on a gigantic fan, only slightly out of sight. On an artificial pitch the first team are being put through a vigorous training session, while in a gymnasium next to the pitch two cleaners are tidying up after a handball match. However, it is to the small swimming pool around the corner that I am led to, to meet the next great hope of Faroese sport.Like the modest gravity of Tinganes, Signhild Joensen rather defies expectation. Still just 17 years old, she doesn’t look like much of a future international star, with a round youthful-looking face and quiet demeanour — a million miles away from the arrogant young sports stars we are accustomed to in the UK. But her talent is impossible to ignore. She competed in the 200m backstroke event at the 2017 World Aquatics Championships and has already achieved a qualifying time for Tokyo 2020. And all before she is old enough to vote.There is a catch, of course. To compete in Japan, she would need to secure one of the top two times in Denmark to win a place on their Olympic team. “It is definitely a bit awkward,” she says, as we walk around the sports centre. “Because we compete with them with our times but obviously they feel as though they should have first preference because it is their country, and we are foreigners who might take their spot.”Not that the awkwardness would be the worst thing about substituting the Faroese flag that currently decorates her blue training jacket for the red and white Scandinavian cross of Denmark. “My biggest dream is to compete at the Olympics, but it is also my dream to compete under my own flag. Competing for Denmark is not the same and makes us feel as though we do not have the same rights as everybody else.”Rather than attempt to solve the issue once and for all, the IOC has until now swept it firmly under the rug, leading to Faroese athletes being repeatedly stripped of their nationality as if they have done something wrong. “We competed at the 2015 European Games in Baku,” Joensen remembers. “And we were not allowed to use the Faroe flag. Instead we had to compete as LEN (Ligue Européenne de Natation) and were given tee-shirts with no flag, just plain blue with our name. And when we were introduced our name was read out with no nationality. It felt like a punishment because we wanted to show where we came from but we did not have the chance. We were from nowhere.”But not every athlete from the Faeroes is an athlete from nowhere, forced into a plain tee-shirt with no room for a flag, all cultural and national legacy stripped away like bark from a tree. There is a popular joke in the Faroe Islands: that the only way to proudly represent your country is to have a disability of some description. And after speaking with Joensen I meet with Tóra við Keldu, a resident of Klaksvík and former swimmer who won four medals across the 1988 and 1992 Paralympic Games. Crucially, she won them for the Faroe Islands.The country was a founding member of the International Paralympic Committee back in September 1989 and has sent athletes to every Paralympic Games since 1984, winning 13 medals in the process. Such success has, however, done little to bolster their campaign in the eyes of the IOC: along with Macau, an autonomous region on the south coast of China, the Faroe Islands are one of only two territories to compete at the Paralympics but not at the Olympics.For Keldu, there is no question that competing for the Faroe Islands augmented her Paralympic experience, helping her to extract every last drop of her talent in an attempt to win a medal. “Of course it influences you,” she nods. “The sport will always come first. But when you see and hear the people around the pool, and then when you stop after winning a race and hear the national anthem being played, it’s such an important feeling. It is important for us as a nation that, if we are called the Faroe Islands nation with our language, culture, scenery and flag, we also compete in sport.”Katrin Dagbjartsdóttir goes even further. A fellow Paralympic swimmer, Dagbjartsdóttir competed alongside Keldu at the 1988 Games in Seoul, winning a bronze in the 100m backstroke and silver in the 100m freestyle. Between them, the the two women are responsible for just under half of the all the medals the country has won at the Paralympic Games, and Dagbjartsdóttir brings both of hers to show me when we later meet for a chat.As Dagbjartsdóttir talks, she absent-mindedly fiddles with the scuffed dark blue box that contains both of her Paralympic medals, as well as numerous others from World Cups, European Cups and Nordic Championships. Fiercely passionate, she speaks plainly of how representing the Faroese flag inspired her to success in swimming meets across the world.“Seeing the Faroese flag when you compete at competitions is crucial for a Faroese athlete,” she insists. “We are not Danish at all. Training year in and year out is hard — and then to compete for the Danish flag? We should be competing against Danish athletes for our own country and under our own flag. That is how it is at the Paralympics but not at the Olympics, which is a huge mistake.”Dagbjartsdóttir is now a coach at the Tórshavn swim club — “as a swimmer I am almost a dinosaur but my results are still here, so I make a good coach” — helping the next generation of Faroese athletes to reach their potential. But every time she watches one of her swimmers set a new record time, or push that little bit harder in training, there is a worry. “Because of this rule I fear we will lose all of our best athletes to Denmark,” she explains. “And that is terrible for sport in our country.”But coaches like Dagbjartsdóttir do not only worry about losing their talented young athletes to Denmark. As their students grow older — and the demands on their time multiply and escalate — they also have to worry about the persistent influence of the most popular sport in the country, one which is largely immune from the difficulties caused by the lack of IOC recognition: football.Jens Martin Knudsen is stood in the centre circle of NSÍ Runavík’s home ground, wearing an Adidas Faroe Islands technical jacket from a few seasons back, with his face scrunched up to the heavens, remembering the past.“The one thing that everybody in the team was focused on was making sure that we didn’t lose by ten goals or more,” he says, thinking back to 12 September 1990, when he woke up feeling both giddy with excitement and sick with nerves. It would ultimately prove to be the defining day of his life. “When we all heard the national anthem I suddenly realised that there was a lot of pressure. Honestly, we felt like lambs going to the slaughter. But most of all I was just desperate not to lose 10-0 and feel like the biggest fucking fool in the world, picking the ball out of my net with a bobble hat on my head.”Ah yes, the bobble hat. It’s Knudsen’s calling card, not to mention the title of his autobiography. The story goes like this: Knudsen, a three-time Faroese gymnast champion in his youth, suffered a concussion aged 14 and was only allowed to return to the football field by his mother if he did so wearing a ‘protective’ woollen hat. Quite what a knitted bobble hat would have done to protect him from hulking great target-men lumbering after an errant back pass is anybody’s guess, but Knudsen didn’t dare go against the wishes of his mother, staying true to his word until — one day — he wound up wearing the beanie in the Faroe Island’s first ever competitive football match, against Austria.\u0026nbspBut the bobble hat didn’t mark him out as a fool. Instead, it became the stuff of legend. Public opinion had been well and truly ided when the Faroe Islands first approached Fifa seeking international recognition — “people were split half and half, some were proud and some where excited, but others thought we were crazy and would get stuffed every single match”, he admits — but against all the odds, the Faroe Islands would go on to beat Austria 1-0, with Torkil Nielsen scoring the winning goal and Knudsen pulling off a string of impressive saves. “After that there were no more doubters,” he smiles. “After that everybody was 100 per cent behind us.”Winning that match changed the entire sporting psychology of the country. Knudsen cannot help but glow at the memory. “You can imagine the euphoria on the island. This was before mobile phones and so on, and we were forced to play the game in Sweden because we had no grass pitches. I called home on an old corded telephone to tell my family what happened and there was a big parade when we arrived the day after, all the way from the airport to the capital. There was a big celebration in Tórshavn and then we went out and met all of the local communities. It lasted a full day.”Atli Gregersen, the current captain of the Faroe Islands national team, remembers watching the game as an excited eight-year-old around his grandparents’ house, the entire family hunched around a flickering screen. And then, disaster. “We couldn’t see the first ten minutes of the game because the electricity across the whole of the Faroese went, and there was obviously no internet. We were all like ‘fuck, when the picture comes back on is it going to be 10-0 already?’ And I remember the picture came back on and the score was still 0-0, and we all danced around the house like we had won.”Expectations have changed a lot since those black-and-white days. Gregersen — who enjoyed a brief spell at Scottish side Ross County and now plays for title-winning local team Víkingur Gøta — has captained the Faroe Islands through their most successful ever era. As recently as 2007, the national side was ranked 195th in the world, one place below war-torn Somalia and only three places above Bhutan, now officially the worst team in the world. Currently the Faroese are up to 90th, finishing above both Latvia and Andorra in their recent World Cup qualifying group. “And we would have won a point against Portugal,” Gregersen is quick to add, “only some bloke called Cristiano Ronaldo decided to turn it on.”Gregersen, who is dressed identically to Knudsen albeit in this season’s Macron branded kit, is a footballer through and through: confident, charismatic and with a wisecrack primed for every possibly eventuality. He also speaks with a curiously Scottish twang, his answers peppered with ayes, aboots and wees. And he is justifiably proud of how far the national team has come in such a short period of time.“It’s different now, everything has changed,” he tells me in between sips of coffee, having joined us in the middle of the pitch. It’s now early evening and yet, through breaks in the fog, the sun still shines as bright as ever. “We no longer get looked down upon by teams and we get the recognition we deserve, although it doesn’t do us any favours. So the ambition is to qualify for Euro 2020. And we think we can do well in the new Uefa Nations League project, too.”But the success of the Faroe Islands football team may have come at a price. Both Gregersen and Knudsen are well aware of it. “When you’re 14, if you’re at good at several sports and you end up having to pick the one you want to stick with, you will always pick the one with the most opportunities,” Gregersen says. “And for a very, very long time in the Faroe Islands, that meant that you stuck with football.”This is a key part of the Faroese argument with the IOC. The potential to compete internationally has seen football in the Faroe Islands flourish, not only on the international stage but at grassroots level. A total of 22 synthetic pitches serve both semi-professional and youth clubs, while Fifa has invested in over 100 concrete pitches dotted around the country. Consider that the total population stands at just 51,000 and the depth of the Faroese love for football becomes clear.But for other sports in the country — starved of international recognition and therefore starved of investment — life is not as easy. Talented youngsters therefore face a choice: to stick to their sport of choice but resign themselves to only competing domestically, or, alternatively, switch their focus to football. The only other option? To switch their nationality from Faroese to Danish.Gregersen is convinced this has to change. “If we get the recognition that we need and deserve, it would give a major lift to all of the other sports in this country. It would be a little difficult for football, sure, but we’re ready for that. It’s not fair that people who are better at table tennis or handball end up choosing football, only to fall short and then miss out on their opportunity to become internationals. It’s really not fair, but it’s inevitable.”This is not the fight of the Faroese football team. But the Faroe Islands is a small country, where everybody knows everyone and local ties run deep. “We are football men so we don’t feel the frustration quite as much,” Gregersen says. “But for other sports the dream just dies as soon as a kid hits 14. They are not allowed to compete and if only on a human level, that is very sad. It honestly hurt me a lot to see Pál Joensen swimming for Denmark.”Beside him, Knudsen nods his bobble-less head gravely. “We want to create something here,” he adds. “How can we do that when our very best athletes, like Pál, are forced to represent a totally different country?”Tórshavn (Getty)It would be impossible to write anything about this country’s long fight for Olympic recognition without sitting down with Pál Joensen. Now 27 and with a young family settled in — of all places — Denmark, he is not confident of his chances of competing in Tokyo in two years time. But he remains every inch the national hero.“He is our greatest ever athlete and the most humble person you could wish to meet,” Hestoy told me the night before I met Joensen. “The entire country stopped to watch him race in London and Rio, and everybody felt so proud.” He’s not kidding: “We have 18 swimming pools in the Faeroes including one Olympic sized pool, which we named after Pál. It was built after the 2010 European Championships in Budapest, when he won a silver medal in the 1500m free.”But unusually for a national hero revered by all, Joensen’s two Olympic Games ended in bitter disappointment. First London, where he had a TV crew and two radio stations follow his every move at the Aquatics Centre, only to finish ninth in the 400m freestyle and a disappointing 17th overall in the 1500m. He was seen as a major medal contender in both. ‘Joensen’s Olympic dream lasts only 500m’ ran one particularly cruel Daily  headline. And then Rio. Again, Joensen entered the 1500m free as one of the favourites for a spot on the podium, as everybody back home in the Faroe Islands stopped whatever it was they were doing to watch him race. And again, he performed beneath himself. His time of 15:18.49 saw him place 30th.At both Games, he swam for Denmark.Not that the results have diminished his standing back home in the Faeroes, which is clear to see when meeting him back in Tórshavn. Tall, powerfully built and dressed down in chinos and a knitted jumper — even in the middle of summer, temperatures in the country rarely climb above 11°C — Joensen is stopped regularly by people eager to say hello. He is softly spoken, self-effacing and impossibly laid back. In short: he couldn’t be more Faroese.Pál Joensen, representing the Faroe Islands, in 2014 (Getty)Apart from those two Olympic-sized windows when he suddenly became Danish, of course. I pester Joensen with questions on how strange it must have been: did it negatively impact his performances in the pool? Did it cost him his chances of winning a medal? Was it, ultimately, to blame for all the disappointment, all of the hurt? Joensen doesn’t want to say so. But it could have been.“I was tremendously disappointed with my results at both the 2012 and 2016 Games,” he says without hesitation. “I went into both as a strong contender for a medal and really believed that I could win. I don’t want to come up with excuses because a lot of other factors are involved — including the pressure of competing at an Olympics as well as training changes that were not beneficial to me. But, yeah, thinking about this issue took up a lot of my time and energy and occupied a lot of my emotions. It certainly wasn’t beneficial to me and it affected my focus.”Any professional athlete will tell you of the importance of visualisation: the psychological process of creating a mental image or intention of what you want to happen or feel in reality. But for Joensen both Games proved something of an alien experience, a befuddling scrabble into the unknown.He squints at the memory. “It was hard to describe. I’m used to the blue jumpsuit with the Faroese flag. So going in the full Danish kit from Jack \u0026amp Jones, a good Danish brand, it felt kind of odd. Plus people obviously knew me in the swimming world, but did not necessarily know that I had this issue. So people were coming up to me all the time and asking: ‘Why are you wearing Danish clothes?’“It was just so weird to represent a country I had never lived in at the time, a country I absolutely did not associate with. And it’s funny because I remember at the start of my career saying that I was never going to swim for Denmark. So I had to ask myself a question: how much am I selling out my nationality and my people? It was extremely difficult because the Olympics cannot be bypassed as a swimmer, they count for everything, and I knew that I couldn’t just bypass them.”Later that day, we visit a traditional rowing festival. Kappróður is the national sport of the Faroe Islands: the narrow wooden boats have an unmistakably Viking design, with the crews ided into different age, gender and boat size categories. The festival is a celebration of shared history — for hundreds of years boats such as these were the chief method of transport between the eighteen islands — but the racing remains fiercely competitive. From the shore, parents in traditional dress scream as their children row furiously, their wooden oars carving into the delphinium-blue water.Every single race is competitive. And the relief when the junior rowers cross the line is clear to see: when they compete the course of 1000m they slump backward, the untended boats drifting aimlessly into the billowing fog. Tradition is important here, Joensen tells me. “We are a very proud nation and my dream was always to compete for the Faroe Islands. And I was always determined to help change how the outside world sees us, to show what we can achieve even though we are from this very small country.”So does he reflect back on his Olympic experience — the training, the opening ceremonies, the competition — with pride? “I have tremendous pride that I came from my kind of background to represent the Faroe Islands on the international stage. And I tried very hard to be proud of representing Denmark.” He pauses, before adding: “But it is not where I came from. And it is not where I had all my support. Ultimately, this is an issue that has to be resolved.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Vice magazine did a piece about it, and MBSA went viral as both an exemplar of the city’s mordant humour and a plea against gentrification.“My hometown is becoming an extension of London, and losing its crappy edge,” wrote Vice’s Angus Harrison in a bittersweet excoriation of Bristol’s new-found glossiness.\u0026nbspMBSA might have been a one-off valedictory howl, but in an act of synchronicity, other “Shit Again” activity arrived.In Peckham, the southeast London district previously known for being the location of Only Fools and Horses and latterly for being a hipster hotspot, a “Make Peckham Shit Again” landed\u0026nbspin March, as did a Twitter account called “Make Frome Shit Again” along with a few MFSA hashtags of the same vintage.\u0026nbsp(In an odd circularity, much of Only Fools and Horses, although set in\u0026nbspPeckham, was actually filmed in Bristol.)\u0026nbspBristolStreetWearUK)Then, this spring an international brigade of “Shit Again” warriors\u0026nbspin Los Angeles in the form of “Make Venice Shit Again” (Venice the hippyish LA district, to be clear, not the Birmingham of Italy).Such was its clout that Hollywood actor Josh Brolin sported a MVSA baseball cap, part of a local atmosphere so heightened that a recent LA Weekly story found cause to lament that in Venice, “You’ll sooner find a $200 (£150) wool poncho than a $12 pair of flip-flops.”\u0026nbspSo the “Shit Again” tag somehow hit the mark, both as a lament to the new and deracinated world of overpriced and socially exclusive development, and as a great merchandise idea in its own right. So there’s a MBSA hat, T-shirt and even “laptop skins”, while MVSA baseball caps retail at $30 and MPSA baseball caps a snip at a tenner.\u0026nbspAs Tumbleweed Parker puts it (not his real name) his Make Peckham Shit Again hats were a response to Trump’s MAGA cap as well as a way to protest the gentrification of Peckham, which has deep roots but has gathered pace in the last five years as a domino in what you might call the “de-shitting” of London.“Before Trump I’d been thinking about doing some merchandise to kick back against all the happy-clappy local pride movements that seemed to spring up after the London riots in 2011,” says Parker.Peckham-based rockers Fat White Family (centre) wears a ‘Make Peckham Shit Again’ cap with siblings Sasha and Vida Adamczewski (Morbid Books)“It’s delusional to think London’s the best place in the world when its homegrown youth are so desperate to burn it down, and Sadiq Khan’s idiotic marketing of London is used to sell it off to developers.”Moreover, he adds, “people can’t afford to live in this so-called paradise”. So in its own way, the hats and T-shirts are a kind of Situationist protest or, as he puts it, “a barricade against the unhelpful narrative that Peckham is, was, or ever could be a great place for property speculators. I think it’s important that we say, it’s actually not that great.”So is this ‘Shit Again’ activity really a hankering for the days of shuttered high streets without good coffee: a kind of “Fings Ain’t What They Used to Be” for disgruntled millennials? Possibly: the creator\u0026nbspof Make Bristol Shit Again, Bristolstreetwear, bears the legend “Say no to sourdough” on its website, and certainly, there’s a sense of loss about gentrification’s march through the neighbourhoods: the sticky-carpet pubs turning into homes, the chain stores pushing out independents, and £3-a-cup flat whites and avocado-on-spelt ousting the chipped mug of tea and sausage sarnie.Frome\u0026nbspis known for its independent shops and cobbled street\u0026nbsp(Shutterstock)The protestors are also needled by endless proclamations of arrival, such as Frome’s topping the charts as a good place to move, and Bristol winning The Sunday Times’ “best place to live in the UK” gong: the kind of boosterism that gives some locals the impression their towns are forgotten backwaters just itching to be discovered.It’s rattled further by development that piggybacks on existing “bohemian” infrastructure, such as Stokes Croft in Bristol, where the loss of artist-occupied warehouses and office blocks like Hamilton House have sparked long battles.Yet perhaps there’s something else afoot too: a nostalgie de la boue for the old townscape of sticky boozers and crap shops where people supposedly felt a sense of belonging.The term “gentrification” was minted in 1964 by British sociologist Ruth Glass with reference to Islington, then attracting the middle classes into areas full of multi-occupied late Georgian and early Victorian houses, where they set about losing the net curtains and exposing the floorboards, hence the contemporary jibe, “stripped pine-eers”. Indeed, today’s neo-gentrifiers still like their decoration “raw”, although these days it’s more about bare bricks, old shops and and cocktails in jam jars. And there has long been a missionary-like flavour about the process, whereby gentrifiers comes into an unreconstructed urban district, “discover” it anew and turn it into a mirror of their own taste.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspWoodage  Twitter)But the idea of what gentrification constitutes has shifted, says Loretta Lees, a professor of human geography at the University of Leicester and author of several books on the matter, including Planetary Gentrification. “I’ve noticed that anti-gentrification has become more performative in the last two to three years,” says Lees. “The traditional class aspect of it has given way to a more complicated scenario, full of internal conflict, where critics of gentrification are often gentrifiers themselves and where the discussion is more about consumerism more than class.”The 2017 book Gentrifier by John Joe Schlichtman, Jason Patch and Marc Lamont Hill also works this theme with a look at how gentrification\u0026nbspis now commonly used as a means to describe clothing choices, food and art, often centred around the cipher-like figure of the “hipster“ and part of a battle for the authentic soul of a place.Shoreditch (Jamie OsmanTwitter)“Imagined realities and physical realities collide in gentrification,“ they wrote. This aspect became apparent in 2015, when a demonstration against a branch of the Cereal Cafe in London’s Brick Lane bought a sense of pantomime to the debate, while in 2016 Montreal’s local government introduced a by-law that no more than one in six businesses can be a restaurant: a move that has been seen as a way of moderating gentrification.\u0026nbspAlamy)So the new symbols of gentrification – the cortados, chachka shops and themed restaurants – began to seemingly represent a force that was making Bristol want to be shit again, as well as rippling out anxiously to other corners of the country. It’s a phenomenon that Lees says has seen “gentrification move on from key world cities to rural areas, market towns and ‘edge cities’ – places on the margins of urban areas”. One of the key differences between the Ruth Glass era and now is that gentrification has been globalised and also exists in miniature.\u0026nbspTenants’ lives ‘at risk’ after government fails to act on safety rulesDonald Trump has been scared off by a big balloonLondon to get first permanent LGBT+ homeless shelterAs for Frome becoming “shit again”, she says that the actual long-term locals want a post office, a good supermarket and a Peacocks: all things that\u0026nbspmight not be the grails of a “down from London” person’s eye.\u0026nbspThere’s also a streak of self-deprecation that runs through a certain British mentality, as seen in Crap Towns, the 1990s hit, bringing the “declinism” of the 1980s up to date. Then, things could only get worse. And surely gentrification can sometimes be good? Lees draws a moral distinction between the “gentrification that displaces people, and the good regeneration that keeps people in place”, but struggles to think of a good example of the latter.In 2015, research from the US magazine City Lab concluded that gentrifying neighbourhoods don’t actually lose low-income residents at a substantially lower rate than any other neighbourhood. Plus, it should be said, there’s nothing gentrifiers scorn more than other gentrifiers. It’s fun to have a pop.\u0026nbspPerhaps “shit again” means affordable housing and a regaining of convivial civic life, or perhaps it’s an aesthetic of urban decline. Whatever, a “shit again” cap is the perfect self-abnegating gift for an uncertain age. “It seems to be resonating with a lot of people who feel alienated by the discourse of positivity around urban redevelopment, which is most people I know,” says Parker. “Even the local estate agent ordered one. I hope he wears it when he hangs himself.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Whatever the answer, it’s clear the public imagination is still holding out for a heroClick to followThe Independent OnlineMark Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathedHe was providing protection to Tom Cruise at the time. Summer of 2002, in Rome. Time off from shooting The Last Samurai. He had mapped it all out, talked it over with the paparazzi beforehand, so it was no sweat. They would pause for a minute or so in front of the Excelsior, the snappers would politely keep their distance, and then he and Cruise would sedately enter the hotel. Everyone would be happy. And the plan went completely to plan. They stopped. The paparazzi took their pictures. Box-office star plus bodyguard gracefully two-step in the direction of the hotel. No drama. Until the point where they’re about to go through the door.\u0026nbspMark “Billy” Billingham spots this blue streak coming towards them from the right out of the corner of his eye. Instinct honed by years of training, he simultaneously wraps a protective arm around Tom Cruise and grabs hold of the blue streak with the other one. And all three of them tumble into the foyer of the hotel, with Billingham wrestling both of them to the floor. Then Tom says, “Billy, you can let me up now. I want to introduce you to my girlfriend.” Penelope Cruz – Cruise’s then partner – was the blue streak.She was impatient to see Tom. Maybe she should just have warned his bodyguard before popping up unscripted.Another time he was escorting Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie down the backstairs of the Waldorf in New York. Everyone was waiting for them at the front. Billingham’s simple plan was to take them out the back down the service stairs. What could possibly go wrong? He was leading them from the front. Ready for anything. Then he tripped and fell down the stairs, knocking himself unconscious. Pitt and Jolie rushed down and held his head and nursed him till he came around. He was seeing stars in more ways than one.It probably wouldn’t happen in Mission: Impossible. In reality everything always goes wrong and you just have to adapt. Billingham has been an A-list bodyguard to Michael Caine and Russell Crowe and he hasn’t lost anyone yet. He says the main difference with\u0026nbspCrowe is that “you spend a lot of your time trying to stop him picking fights”. Now one of the stars of the rugged Channel 4 show SAS: Who Dares Wins, he is an ace sniper and served in the SAS for nearly two decades. Earned an MBE for leading a hostage-saving mission. Tracked down, acquired\u0026nbspand delivered mass killers to the War Crimes Tribunal. And is even now planning to take on human traffickers and slavers around the world. He has paid his dues. He is probably about as close as you can get to a real-life hero. One who is still breathing, that is.Billingham with Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt and their children\u0026nbspin Chicago in 2007 (Rex)The “hero” is the ultimate myth, the “monomyth” as Joseph Campbell would say (in The Hero With A Thousand Faces), going all the way back to the Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, through The Odyssey and The Aeneid, and all the way up to Mission: Impossible and Jack Reacher. The “hero” – whether engraved in stone or encoded in digitally enhanced celluloid – never dies. Real heroes always do, ultimately, but some live long enough to tell the tale. Here we run into the major dilemma for the hero: can he be the narrator of his own story? Can he speak in the first person of his own exploits in war? And is he necessarily a “he” anyway?DH\u0026nbspLawrence (aka Lawrence of Arabia) pulled it off in his autobiographical Seven Pillars of Wisdom. So too, more recently Andy McNab, also ex-SAS, in Bravo Two Zero, and Tom Marcus in Soldier Spy. But there is a grand tradition of the unsung hero. A decent working definition of the hero is: someone who says nothing (or not much) and confines himself to pure doing. He acts and then keeps his mouth shut. A hero needs a Homer. This is only partly because, more often than not, there is a legal gag on telling tales. He is subject to the Official Secrets Act or the equivalent. But he is also constrained by the code of modesty. The hero, if he says anything, is always self-deprecating. Thus Mark Billingham’s funny, oblique, mock-heroic stories above.On the other hand Billy is very good at swearing. His daughter reckons he has a touch of Tourette’s. “I’ll try not to swear too much, I really will,” he tells the audience at Prince’s Hall in Aldershot for An Evening with Mark Billingham, “but I’ll probably f***ing fail.”Rambo (in David Morrell’s First Blood, immortalised by Sylvester Stallone) set fire to an entire town because he couldn’t find the words to express his post-Vietnam sense of guilt and horror. Thus the reality of the hero is that he has to say something. Self-repression leads straight into PTSD. Hero turns anti-hero. Billingham was inspired to join up by tales of veterans returning from the Falklands. Now 53, then a teenage rebel, troublemaker\u0026nbspand discontent. Brought up on a council estate in the Midlands, he became an artful dodger, going about stealing hats from old guys, until one old guy ran after him, caught him, and persuaded him to go to his gym and learn to box.\u0026nbspHe thought of joining the Marines, but ultimately signed up with the Parachute regiment because “they sounded wilder”. He’d never been out of Walsall and suddenly he found himself jumping out of planes in places he’d hadn’t even heard of. Billingham is above all a survivor. He says it’s “90 per cent luck and 10 per cent\u0026nbspskill – or maybe it’s 100 per cent\u0026nbspluck, I don’t know”. Billingham has become a talisman because – almost miraculously, as if blessed by the gods – he has been able to walk through shot and shell, IEDs and landmines, and come out the other end, more or less unscathed. “I can survive in bad places,” as he puts it. The most time he has spent in hospital has been with a dose of cerebral malaria.\u0026nbspThe true hero is vulnerable, mortal. Not a Marvel superhero. The army prizes the hard man. Maybe we all do. Which is why we sign up for SAS: Who Dares Wins or the adjacent “Break-Point Prime Evolution” regime, devised by Ollie Ollerton. We want the abs bordering on armour plating, like a shield or suit of armour. So the bullets will just bounce off. Unbreakable. That is the myth, at any rate. But Billingham tells a story of one of his comrades in Belize, a man who was famously “hard as nails”. The toughest guy in the whole regiment. He marches off into the jungle one day and not long after they hear him screaming. A group of men, led by Billingham, go trooping off after him, assuming he has been taken captive, and is almost certainly being tortured. They locate him quickly enough. No sign of the enemy. But the guy has a thorn in his ear and it’s killing him. Sometimes the worst thing about being a hero is you get dirty and sweaty and you can’t get a shower.25 new films to look out for in 2018 that aren\u0027t sequelsCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonCast: Ethan Hawke, Amanda Seyfried, Cedric the Entertainer825 The Miseducation of Cameron Post1025 City of Lies1325 The House with a Clock in Its Walls1625 Bad Times at the El Royale2525 Holmes and WatsonBut the big news about SAS: Who Dares Wins is that the fourth series, now in preparation, will have women recruits as well as men. No reason why they can’t jump out of helicopters or rappel down a mountain. You don’t necessarily have to look like Bruce Willis or Arnie Schwarzenegger.\u0026nbsp“Hero” is now both masculine and feminine. You can’t plausibly say “heroine” any more. It sounds too much like a weepy sentimental movie or a damsel in distress.Women fight in the front line. The Kurdish Peshmerga (which translates as “those who face death”) includes a lot of women fighters. Asia Ramazan Antar was one of the fallen in the fight against Isis so too was Anna Campbell, from Lewes. On the more mythic side, we have Wonder Woman and X-(Wo)Men. This is the age of the rogue female.\u0026nbspI spoke recently to Ruth Shackleton: distant relative of the Antarctic explorer, she spent 20 years in the RAF, rose to squadron leader, did tours of duty in all the usual hellholes, and orchestrated the Red Arrows. She totally denies ever being a hero. She reckons her most heroic moment was when, with Scud rockets from Baghdad raining down, she helped a comrade (who had temporarily lost it) put on her chemical protection suit. Which demonstrates grace under pressure.Do heroes need to be less modest? The ancient myth of the hero was largely to do with defining and asserting masculinity. Aeneas dumps Dido. Theseus uses Ariadne and her thread to negotiate the labyrinth – where he slays the Minotaur – and then sails away. Ian Fleming’s James Bond follows the same pattern. The contemporary woman hero is fighting back, mainly against patriarchy. “This is the thing about bad guys,” says Stephanie Broadribb, author of Deep Down Dead (shortlisted for the International Thriller Writers’ Best First Novel award at ThrillerFest in New York, the winner of which is announced today). “They are generally guys.” She is a skilled horsewoman who trained as a bounty hunter to provide authenticity for her ass-kicking protagonist. And wields a mean taser. “I knew when I created Lori Anderson, a woman action hero, that she would never have to be rescued by a man.” She was influenced by Thelma and Louise, re-runs of The Saint, but above all by The Avengers (the TV series) in which Emma Peel is on a par with Steed when it comes to karate.There are other variations on the hero archetype, Carrie Gracie of the BBC for one, or the suffragettes or Stella Rimington, ex-head of MI5. I would propose Sofia Helin, who plays Saga Noren in The Bridge, but is also one of the extremely modest leaders of the Swedish #MeToo movement (“SilenceAction”). But it still comes down to being able to outfight, outwit, or outgeneral the opposition. And being prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice. Billingham sees no reason why women can’t get into the SAS itself: “If you can pass the test, you’re in.”I was brought up on a diet of highly heroic post-Second World War comics, like Valiant and Victor (who could forget Captain Hurricane?) But at a certain point I decided the hero was uncool. Was he not, after all, a flag-waver for the military industrial complex? Verging on imperialist? Behind every Aeneas there is an Augustus or a Caesar. Winston Churchill is liable to be co-opted by every tub-thumping would-be dictator (as per Boris Johnson with his sub-Kipling rhetoric of “sending our vanguard into battle with the white flags fluttering”.) The hero, like Napoleon, can become a tyrant. And yet the hero deserves resurrection.Why Now That’s What I Call Music still has a place in pop culture‘Spiderman’ who scaled flats to save child begins job as firefighterHumiliation: The pain of character assassination in the public eyeAt one level, maybe nobody is a hero (who can coincide with a myth?). At another, maybe everyone is, or would like to be (sometimes just getting out of bed in the morning is an act of heroism). Perhaps Gareth Southgate and the England football team all are. Anyone on a quest or a mission. Most of my personal heroes are surfers (take a bow, Ted Deerhurst). We haven’t yet given up on knight errants, Shane-style lonesome cowboys, and Liam Neeson. Lee Child, creator of the globally bestselling Jack Reacher series, says of vigilante loner heroes – who, like the ronin, are wandering samurai that have no lord or master and don’t belong to any conventional force – that “we invented them tens of thousands of years ago because we desperately wanted them to exist.\u0026nbspWe continue to reinvent them in flimsily disguised forms because we need them to be there, as a matter of catharsis and consolation.”Peshmerga recruits, some of whom are volunteers, aim their AK-47s as they take part in military training (AFPGetty)Paul Hughes reckons we need them more than ever. He is a multilingual ex-RAF intelligence officer turned forensic scientist (and CEO of PH Interim) who goes about the country inspiring young people in schools with his non-fictional tales of bravery – not least in dealing with challenges they might face at school. Hughes says that “if you ask anyone who their hero is these days, they are more likely to answer Ed Sheeran or one of those characters from Love Island”. He argues that we are apt to think, just because we are sitting on a sofa and watching television, that the world is a safe place. It isn’t. “Today’s teenagers were born after 911. They haven’t seen Srebrenica or the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. People forget so quickly – they need to be reminded.”I’ve often said (mostly to others, sometimes to myself), “Don’t be a hero!” Which is fair enough, mostly. Avoid pointless heroics, if possible. Jaw-jaw not war-war. But the hero, of whichever gender, Billingham or Bond, Thelma or Louise, remains rooted in the collective unconscious. Maybe it’s just as well. So long as we have enemies, we will still need heroes.Andy Martin is the author of ‘Reacher Said Nothing: Lee Child and the Making of Make Me’\u0026nbspand teaches at the University of Cambridge.

They help Ates organise weekly prayers, give tours to school groups and hold seminars on democracy, love and the concept of an open, tolerant interpretation of Islam and a forgiving God.Religious groups join together for interfaith collaborationHere\u0027s a reminder of what Donald Trump said about Muslims in the past When is Eid al-Fitr and how do Muslim people celebrate it?During Eid, it\u0027s important to reflect on Islam in BritainThree years after a wave of more than 1 million, mostly Muslim, migrants arrived in Germany seeking asylum, culture wars over religious identity and the possible threat posed by Islam have led to a rise in nationalist, populist movements.The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel was nearly brought down this week over a dispute with the Bavarian sister of her conservative party, which sought to turn back refugees at the border.The Bavarian conservatives of the Christian Social Union joined the far-right party Alternative for Germany in promoting a narrative that refugees pose a threat, after several highly publicised killings and sexual assaults in the country led to charges against Muslim migrants.The party ordered that crosses be displayed in all public buildings in the state, and Merkel’s new interior minister, Horst Seehofer – also a Bavarian – declared: “Islam is not a part of Germany.”Against the backdrop of these debates, Ates sees the survival of the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque, which recently celebrated its first anniversary, as proof that Muslims living in Germany need and are open to an interpretation of Islam that reflects the values of the Western society in which they live.Tombs in the centre of Tarung village serve as handy laundry driers on a sunny Sumba morning.Each tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) represents massive expense in terms of ritual sacrifices for local families who observe the ancestral Marapu religionCatholic imagery on a tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) shows how imported religions seem often to have blended almost seamlessly with the ancient Marapu religion.In an effort to minimise economic strain the law stipulates that only 5 buffalo can be sacrificed at funerals - in reality many more are often killed and a big buffalo with a wide horn spread will often fetch close to $4,000.A royal tomb in Pasunga village is flanked by the smaller tombs where servants were buried (sometimes buried alive!) alongside their master.Village dogs - currently s but, more than likely, part of some future feast - on tombs in Pasunga village.A horse - another part of Sumba\u0027s ancestral warrior heritage - grazes among the tombs in Pasunga village.A more humble modern style tomb stands next to the kings burial place in Galu Bakul, Anakalang.A village dog relaxes on a tomb in Prai Ijing village.While still considered sacred the tombs very quickly become part of normal village life.

The Arabs will never allow it,\u0027” she said. Instead, hundreds of people from across Germany, Europe and abroad have visited or attended services.Those most committed to its survival have made donations, some as much as €500, Ates said, emphasising that the mosque receives no public funding.“Even atheists come here and appreciate this place, as a spiritual place, a place of peace,” she said recently, standing barefoot on the pale carpet of the mosque. “I had hoped, but never dreamed, that so many atheists would be interested. That was a positive surprise.”The criticism and rejection, in its fierceness and intensity, less so. Even before the mosque opened, her personal Facebook page and that of the mosque were flooded with derogatory messages and even some death threats.“May Allah put you on the right path, or destroy you,” someone writing under the name Xalo Bero said, in one of the friendlier remarks.Protection provided by the police and paid for by the city government, in place since she published the book Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution\u0026nbspin 2009, was increased to a personal security detail after the heightened threats on her life.Days after the mosque opened, Dar al-Ifta, an influential arm of the Egyptian Justice Ministry that issues religious verdicts, denounced the mosque and declared that allowing men and women to pray alongside one another violated Islamic law.Turkish news outlets reported that the mosque was a terrorist organisation with links to the Islamist cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blames for a coup attempt in 2016 against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Despite a video message in which Ates states that the “the Rushd-Goethe mosque has nothing to do with the Gulen movement”, the rumours have persisted.She blames them for the fact that few Turks have joined the congregants, although they make up the vast majority of the estimated 4.5 million Muslims living in Germany.Despite the demands of running the mosque, she takes Arabic classes and continues to work as a lawyer. She considers achieving a degree in Islamic theology important to her recognition in the Muslim community.“I want to understand the words and know the meanings so no one can say, ‘She’s just a lawyer,\u0027” she said.Born in Istanbul to a Turkish mother and a Kurdish father, she emigrated with her parents to what was then West Berlin in the late 1960s, part of the first large wave of Muslim immigrants who came to fill the blue-collar jobs needed to rebuild the German economy after World War II.Ates was 6 when she and her four siblings moved into a one-room apartment with their parents.As she learned German and excelled in school, Ates says, she came to understand that it was not the crowded living conditions that she found suffocating, but the realisation that because of her gender, she was not afforded the freedoms of her non-Muslim peers.“I was a girl,” she wrote in 2007 in Zeit Online. “I embodied the family’s honour, and my hymen – for a long time I didn’t even know what that was – was more important to the whole family than my brain.”At 17, she fled her home, graduated from high school and started studying law at the Free University of Berlin. To support herself, she worked as a counsellor in a women’s centre.In September 1984, she was speaking with a client when a man wearing a trench coat entered the centre, pulled out a pistol and fired three shots. One hit the client in the stomach, killing her the other struck Ates.She survived to see the suspect, a Turkish bricklayer, acquitted for lack of evidence, which enraged her. For years, she struggled with the psychological fallout of the attack.Violent clashes leave ’86 dead’ in NigeriaFrench far-right group arrested over alleged plot to attack MuslimsShe returned to her faith, but was again alienated by Berlin’s traditional, conservative mosques, where women were forced to pray behind a curtain.

With an orbit of 16 years, they knew it would return close to the black hole in 2018.Over 20 years, the accuracy of their instruments has improved and so in May 2018, they were able to take extremely precise measurements in conjunction with scientists from around the world.This showed the star\u0027s orbital velocity increasing to more than 25 million kph (15.5 million mph) as it approached the black hole.The star\u0027s wavelength stretched as it sought to escape the gravitational pull of the supermassive black hole, shifting its appearance from blue to red, Odele Straub from the Paris Observatory said.The scientists now hope to observe other theories of black hole physics, she said.This is the first step on a long road that the team has done over many years and which we hope to continue in the next years, MPE\u0027s Reinhard Genzel, who led the international team, said.Additional reporting by agenciesEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/13/20/roger-stone.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/13/20/roger-stone.jpg","title":"julian assange ecuador embassy removal asylum latest london","story":"Created with Sketch.President says nobody should remain under asylum \u0027for too long\u0027 as he reveals discussions with BritainClick to followThe Independent OnlineAssange will be removed from London embassy \u0027eventually\u0027, Ecuador saysThe president of Ecuador says Julian Assange must leave his country’s London embassy “eventually”, revealing discussions are underway with British authorities to end his asylum.Lenin Moreno cast doubts over how much longer the WikiLeaks founder’s six-year stay\u0026nbspat the embassy could last after he announced talks had resumed\u0026nbspto facilitate his exit.Ecuador granted Mr Assange asylum in 2012 in order to avoid his extradition to Sweden to face questioning over sex assault allegations, which he has always denied.The case has since been dropped, although the Australian-born programmer would still be arrested by British police for breaching bail conditions.He also fears\u0026nbspextradition to the United States, where he could be tried for the leaking of classified US state department documents.Mr Moreno said nobody should remain under asylum “for too long” and Mr Assange would “eventually need to leave” the embassy.He added any eviction would come as the result of negotiations involving all sides and hinge on whether Mr Assange’s life could be guaranteed.The president also insisted he had no sympathy for Mr Assange’s political agenda as a leaker of confidential documents.“I have never been in favour of Mr Assange\u0027s activity,” he said, speaking at an event in Madrid where he met with King Felipe and prime minister Pedro Sanchez, following a three-day trip to London.When asked if he had spoken to British authorities about Mr Assange’s situation during his stay, he said the countries remained in constant contact over the matter.“The only person I have never spoken to is Mr Assange,” he added.UK news in picturesThe scene on the A96 between Huntly and Keith in Moray where a five people have died and five more were injured after a crash between a minibus and a car.Anti-Brexit campaigners parked a removal van outside the Foreign Secretary\u0027s official home in central London in protest of former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson\u0027s continued residence thereLabour leader Jeremy Corbyn during his visit to HS2 trains bidder Bombardier in Derby, following the launch of the party\u0027s new Build it in Britain campaignGreat Britain\u0027s Geraint Thomas cleans his eyes after tear gas was thrown at the pelaton during a farmers\u0027 protest who attempted to block the stage\u0027s route, during the 16th stage of the Tour de France, between Carcassonne and Bagneres-de-Luchon.

border","story":"Created with Sketch.UK making a deal \u0027impossible\u0027 with lack of proposals to solve borderClick to followIndy PoliticsEuropean parliament says it will veto Brexit deal over Theresa May ‘backsliding’ on Irish borderThe European parliament has dramatically upped the stakes in Brexit talks by threatening to veto any deal unless Theresa May comes up with new plans for the Northern Ireland border.The legislature’s Brexit steering group, made up of MEPs from across its parties, accused Theresa May of “backsliding” on the issue despite committing to prevent a hard border in December, and again in a letter in March.But the body, chaired by Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt, said the UK has failed to\u0026nbspcome up with a workable way to prevent a hard border and that by its actions it was making a deal “impossible”.“As recognised by the prime minister in her letter to President Tusk of 19 March 2018, the ‘backstop’ must avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, protect the Good Friday Agreement and safeguard the integrity of the single market, customs union and common commercial policy,” the group said in a statement on Friday after the meeting.It adds: “The Brexit steering group\u0026nbspreiterates that in relation to the withdrawal agreement\u0026nbspit will accept no backsliding from past commitments, notably those entered into in the joint report of 8 December 2017”Despite the focus in the UK on the future trade relationship after Brexit, the Northern Ireland issue is the most likely to torpedo Brexit talks into no deal.\u0026nbspThe Brexit steering group stresses that without a credible, genuine and operational ‘backstop’, it will be impossible for the European Parliament to give its consent to the withdrawal agreementThe EU has said it would\u0026nbspnot agree to a withdrawal agreement without an “all-weather” backstop policy in place to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland, but the UK says it will never accept a different policy being imposed in Northern Ireland to Great Britain and that any backstop must also be time-limited.The UK has said it hoped\u0026nbspto remove the need for a border by negotiating a future relationship that eliminated\u0026nbspthe need for checks on frontiers, but the Chequers white paper with this proposal\u0026nbspwas shot down by EU negotiators, who branded it unworkable.The UK has also proposed a “temporary customs arrangement” for the Northern Ireland border but the EU says it would not prevent a hard border.British diplomats have confirmed\u0026nbspthey currently have no plans to come up with extra proposals to prevent a border and that they hoped the Chequers white paper and temporary customs arrangement\u0026nbspwould together be acceptable to the EU.AFPGetty)Theresa May has dug her feet in on the issue and said “no UK prime minister” could accept a backstop.\u0026nbspShe is severely constrained in Westminster by the DUP, staunch unionists on whom she relies for a majority in the Commons, and Eurosceptics in her own party, who believe the EU proposals amount to an attempt to “annex” Northern Ireland.

Independent’s Brexit petition in just over 24hrsReaders’ view: The Independent’s campaign for a Brexit referendumAs Ms May and her cabinet ministers began a charm offensive across European capitals, officials from across the continent voiced scepticism about her plan.The embattled prime minister met Austrian chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, and Czech counterpart, Andrej Babis, in Salzburg on Friday afternoon in\u0026nbspan effort to build alliances before the March 2019 Brexit date.But hours earlier, Ales Chmelar, Czech state secretary for European affairs, warned there was a “clear problem with the fact that the EU will not have a mechanism to control its borders and it would be delegated – without any EU control – to a third country, which would be Britain after March”.He suggested the UK proposals on single market regulations lacked “a certain balance between the rights and obligations” and urged Ms May to avoid “trying to find loopholes in the EU position”.Sources familiar with the French position told the UK that officials in Paris were “puzzled” at why the EU would be expected to accept a British customs plan that was so complex, risky and burdensome for it and its businesses, to no benefit.Nathalie Loiseau, France’s European affairs minister, insisted there was “no difference between what Michel Barnier says and what we would say inidually, each and every member state”.The European Parliament also dramatically upped the stakes\u0026nbspby threatening to veto any deal unless Ms May comes up with new plans for the Northern Ireland border.Speaking after the Salzburg meeting, Mr Kurz said his focus would be on avoiding a “hard Brexit” but added that he was hopeful a “solution” could be found.It comes as a poll revealed that 72 per cent of voters do not have confidence in her ability to strike a good deal with Brussels.Only\u0026nbsp29 per cent of those surveyed said Ms May’s contentious Chequers blueprint for future UK-EU relations would be a good thing for Britain, with 47 per cent suggesting it would be bad and 19 per cent saying they did not know.Earlier this week the European Commission’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, rejected a key part of the prime minister’s Chequers blueprint – the agreement that has already caused huge rifts within the Conservative Party.During a week of cabinet ministers outlining preparations in the event of no deal – including stockpiling supplies of medicines and basic foodstuffs – the international trade secretary Liam Fox also said he would prefer such an outcome rather than prolonging negotiations with Brussels.Describing any extension of Article 50 as\u0026nbspunacceptable and a “complete betrayal” of voters in an interview with news website Business Insider, Dr Fox accused the EU of putting “political ideology” before the economic prospects for ordinary people with their uncompromising stance in the negotiations.“The public have told us, it wasn’t a consultation, to leave the EU, and the public already wonders why it’s going to take more than four years after the referendum for us to fully remove ourselves from the EU,” he said.Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP

The odds had fallen to 3-1 prior to the Prime Minster’s Chequers summit, called to thrash out a negotiating position with cabinet ministers.Majority of students would support a vote on the final Brexit dealEuropean Parliament says it will veto Brexit deal over Irish borderEven Brexiteers are now turning towards the single market and the EEAThe plan that emerged from it prompted multiple ministerial resignations and has since been all but killed off by the EU, with its lead negotiator Michel Barnier ruling out its proposed customs arrangements. British ministers have fanned out around Europe in an attempt to sell the plan.But Mr Barnier has been proven to have the backing of the leaders of the EU27.This is what has led the odds to contract further, and according to betting data site bettingexpert, some 89 per cent of all bets placed in the referendum market since the start of June are on a second poll taking place.The data was released to The Independent just a day after bookmaker Paddy Power cut its odds on a second referendum to 94 from 3-1.Betting exchange Betfair quotes a best available 2-1 for a poll to take place before 2020, with 11-1 available on it taking place before the end of this year.However, it should be pointed out that bookies believe it is still unlikely to happen. Odds of 2-1 equate to a 33 per cent chance.Should a second referendum get called, the odds of the UK voting to remain are also at record low of 18, with 41 offered on another Leave vote. That compares to 13 remain 21 leave at the start of the year, and 15 remain 31 leave before Chequers.Paddy Power makes Remain the overwhelming favourite to succeed (17) with Leave the rank outsider (41) although the bookie opined that\u0026nbsp “we’ve heard that before”.Theresa May\u0027s odds of quitting have similarly hit record lows: it\u0027s evens she steps down this year, or 64 in 2019.Overall, betting volumes on Britain remaining in the EU and a second referendum being called have hit their peak since 2016 - estimates suggest over £500,000 has been placed on a range of pro-EU markets since the start of 2018.But punters have also heavily backed Britain crashing out with no deal amid reports of the government stockpiling food and drugs and preparing to close a motorway in Kent for the purposes of turning it into a huge lorry park.In the deal or no-deal market, bookies now make the latter the 12 favourite, a huge tumble from the 52 at the beginning of the year. The UK is 52 to apply to rejoin the bloc by the end of 2027, assuming it quits.Betting markets are viewed by some as more reliable than pollsters, because people’s willingness to stake money on a market shows how they really feel.However, the bookies got the last referendum just as wrong as the pollsters did.

Mr Grewal is Sikh.Dennis Malloy and Judi Franco, who host a conservative-leaning talk show every day from 10am to 2pm on New Jersey 101.5 FM, will be off the air for 10 days, the station announced.We take these comments seriously and echo Dennis and Judi\u0027s sincere apology to Attorney General Grewal and his family, as well as the Sikh and Asian communities, Ron deCastro, the station\u0027s president, said in a statement posted on its website. Dennis and Judi are known for their plainspoken brand of humour, but in this case, the language used was clearly demeaning and inappropriate.Mr Grewal, a first-generation American who grew up in Essex, New Jersey, became the country\u0027s first Sikh state attorney general when he took office earlier this year. Mr Malloy and Ms Franco were discussing his recent order to suspend marijuana prosecutions in the state when Mr Malloy said he would never know Mr Grewal\u0027s name and would just call him the guy with the turban.Yeah, turban man, Mr Malloy said. And listen if that offends you, then don\u0027t wear the turban, man. I\u0027ll remember your name.The comments drew strong rebukes from Governor Phil Murphy, Senator Cory Booker and the state\u0027s ACLU chapter, which tweeted: Racism isn\u0027t cute. It\u0027s just racist.Outraged by the abhorrent and xenophobic comments mocking @NewJerseyOAG on The @DennisandJudi Show, Mr Murphy, a Democrat who appointed Mr Grewal, wrote on Twitter. Hate speech has no place in NJ, and does not belong on our airwaves.Mr Grewal responded as well.My name, for the record, is Gurbir Grewal, he wrote on Twitter. I\u0027m the 61st Attorney General of NJ. I\u0027m a Sikh American. I have 3 daughters. And yesterday, I told them to turn off the radio.Sikhs in the United States have been the target of slurs and hate crimes and are sometimes confused with Muslims. Men who follow the religion typically wear a beard and turban.Mr Grewal also shared a video from a speech he gave at the Asian Pacific American Institute for Congressional Studies in which he talked about the ways racism had affected his political career.Scroll through any of the online comments about my work or my office or any news story, it can really be stomach turning, he said, noting that he\u0027d been receiving death threats since he became attorney general. I have been called a towel-head, a raghead, a terrorist.In an interview with the New York Times last year as he prepared to take office, he spoke about how he was harassed after September 11 by a stranger who would wait outside of his office and shout, I\u0027ve found him, I\u0027ve found bin Laden!Mr Malloy issued an apology to Mr Grewal and the East Asian community in New Jersey on Thursday afternoon.Speaking on behalf of Judi and myself today in offering our heartfelt apologies to the attorney general of the state of New Jersey, who is a man who certainly deserves more respect than our comments reflected on Wednesday, Mr Malloy said in a video apology. I made a mistake on Wednesday in saying something that was out of bounds and it was wrong.The station\u0027s parent company, Townsquare Media, declined to comment.Family of murdered Sikh man blames Trump policies for \u0027racial hatred\u0027Sikh community saves Fourth of July fireworks display with $10,000Racist Snapchat story targeting Sikh man on flight sparks outrage Sikhs ask for hate-crime probe after man told \u0027go back home\u0027NYPD to allow Sikh officers to wear turban on duty According to NorthJersey, the two hosts are known for their blunt talk on everyday issues with a conservative slant. They have defended President Trump and made fun of National Public Radio and former 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, while mixing in light-hearted banter and talk about the mundane aspects of everyday life, according to the website.Multiple callers phoning into the station during Mr Malloy and Ms Franco\u0027s slot on Thursday defended the hosts\u0027 remarks, according to NJ.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Why has there been an upsurge in violence?At the heart of the latest escalation is 16 weeks of Palestinian protests that have taken place at the border fence between Gaza and Israel. \u0026nbspSince 30 March, hundreds of thousands of Gazans have marched each week on the heavily fortified border\u0026nbspdemanding the right to return to lands they fled and were forced from after the 1948 war, which resulted in the formation of Israel.Palestinians, who have suffered for over a decade under a crippling blockade, have said they are\u0026nbsppeacefully demonstrating during the Great March of Return marches, which is their right. But Israel has accused Hamas, the proscribed militant group that runs the enclave, of encouraging protesters to be violent towards their soldiers, to cut the border fence and to launch raids inside Israel.\u0026nbspThe Israeli military has responded with live fire, leaving more than 140 Palestinians dead, and many more with life changing injuries, in moves described by the UN General Assembly as excessive, disproportionate and indiscriminate”.\u0026nbspAt the same time, protesters say, in frustration, they have taken to launching burning kites and balloons laden with incendiary devices across the border, setting alight to over 2,600 hectares of Israeli farmland and causing hundreds of thousands of pounds of damage.\u0026nbspThe Israeli army, that said its citizens near to Gaza are in danger, subsequently tightened an 11-year-old blockade on the strip, closing Kerem Shalom, the sole goods crossing between Israel and Gaza, and strangling Gaza’s fishing zones to just three nautical miles, a third of what it was before the protests. Israel said earlier this week that it would allow fuel and gas to be transferred via Kerem Shalom, and widen the fishing lanes, partially lifting the restrictions, should a shaky ceasefire hold.\u0026nbspNeither side to date will back down, saying their respective responses are fair and legitimate. This has created a cycle of violence that has reached boiling in the last week, with warnings from the UN that a war could break out.Q. Why is the UN fearful there could be another war? \u0026nbspOn Friday, 20 July, Israeli Staff Sergeant Aviv Levi, 21, was killed by what the Israeli army called a “violent raid” during the protests.\u0026nbspIt marked the first time an Israeli soldier was killed by Palestinian gunfire near Gaza since the last war in 2014 and so crossed a definitive red line. Israel said that gunmen had shot at and lobbed grenades at its soldiers. It responded by bombarding Gaza with tank and air fire, and said its forces struck 60 “military sites” run by Hamas.Four Palestinians were killed that day. Palestinian health officials said that at least one was a civilian. Earlier in the month, there was the most intense exchange of fire between Gaza militants and Israel since the 2014 war - largely due to the border protests.\u0026nbspEgypt has intervened several times enforcing ceasefires which keep being broken.\u0026nbspGazans protest as US embassy moves to Jerusalem – in picturesPalestinian mourners carry the dead body of Mukhtar Ebu Hamas, 25, killed by Israeli forces in Gaza on 14 MayA Palestinian woman flashes a victory sign during a protest near the border fence Israeli soldiers guard on top of a watch tower along the Israel-Gaza borderPalestinian demonstrators react to fired tear gasPalestinian demonstrators run for coverUS President\u0027s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Senior White House Advisor Jared Kushner arrive for the controversial inauguration of the US embassy in Jerusalem.

He said it was “imperative” both Israelis and Palestinians abide by the ceasefire.On Monday,\u0026nbspZeid Ra\u0027ad Al Hussein, the UN’s human rights chief, called for an investigation into Israel’s actions at the border calling the most recent killings “shocking”. He said it was also vital to address the root causes of the Gaza demonstrations which would continue, as living conditions under Israel’s blockade are “grossly inadequate”.\u0026nbspPalestinians in Gaza, including the armed factions, say the Israeli security forces have used live ammunition against peaceful protesters, and launched devastating airstrikes on the strip, killing dozens of people. They said that Israel has also exacerbated a humanitarian and economic crisis within the enclave by adding the new restrictions.\u0026nbspIsrael maintains Hamas, that it regards as a terrorist group, has incited violence and endangered the lives of Israelis near the border. It says the fires caused by the burning kites have caused significant damage to farm land.Q. Who are the protagonists?The main protagonists are Israel and its army, and the myriad armed factions within Gaza, that answer to a central operations room that is ostensibly led by the militant arm of Hamas – called the Qassem Brigades. Within that are vastly different factions, with anything ranging from small far-left Marxist armed groups like the National Resistance Brigades to Islamic jihad’s al-Quds Brigade.\u0026nbspQ. What is at stake?For this region, everything. In the last war more than 2,200 Palestinians, and 73 Israelis, were killed. Gaza took several years to recover and still has not been fully rebuilt. More fundamentally is the moribund Middle East peace process, which is arguably dragging into its eighth decade. A new devastating war would only put another nail in its coffin.\u0026nbspEgypt, that has long held a position as mediator in the Israel-Palestine conflict, has reportedly intervened multiple times in the past few weeks to broker a ceasefire. Last week\u0026nbspHamas said it once again stepped in and brokered a truce but it keeps being broken.\u0026nbspMost recently on Wednesday, Israel fired a barrage of tank and artillery shells at what it identified as military targets within Gaza, after one of its soldiers was injured during an earlier cross-border exchange of fire. Three Palestinians were killed during the tank fire,\u0026nbspHamas\u0026nbspconfirmed the dead were members of its group.\u0026nbspQ. What is going to happen now?Both sides of the conflict, as well as civilians, have repeatedly expressed an interest in stopping the current escalation from tumbling into a full-blown war. Further deaths will only worsen the situation.Q. But if neither side wants war why does the violence continue?\u0026nbspHamas is in a tricky position. Gaza is experiencing one of the most severe economic crises in its recent history. There are many reasons, including the Israeli blockade, new sanctions from the Palestinian Authority which is dominated by Hamas’ secular political rival Fatah and a massive shortfall in International aid funding.\u0026nbspIn a bid to force Hamas to relinquish power over Gaza, last April the PA ordered early retirement for nearly a third of its 60,000 Gaza employees as well as restrictions on electricity access to Gaza. In May it slashed salaries to its civil servants in the enclave by at least 20 percent, piling on more pressure.\u0026nbspCash-strapped Hamas, that once relied on taxing goods smuggled through tunnels to Egypt, has also been unable to pay its own 40,000 employees in full.Meanwhile the United Nation’s refugee agency UNRWA said it is suffering from an “unprecedented” £164 million funding shortfall, after the US said it was slashing more than 80 percent of its \u0026nbspfunding to the agency. This has only exacerbated\u0026nbspthe problems. This week UNRWA\u0026nbspannounced it was getting rid of\u0026nbsp250 jobs in the Palestinian Territories, including more than 100 in Gaza.\u0026nbspThe 1.8 million residents\u0026nbspof Gaza, who are\u0026nbspalready suffering from one of the highest jobless rates in the world, cannot sustain further devastation and many are increasingly frustrated with their own leaders.\u0026nbspMembers of Hamas’s Palestinian political rivals in Gaza have told The Independent that Hamas wants the focus of Gazans\u0027 anger to be directed towards Israel, which it regards as an occupier, rather than at local government and themselves.\u0026nbspAnd therefore, the protests at the border cannot stop.\u0026nbspIsrael, meanwhile, is facing a potential war at its northern border as well as its frontier with Gaza. \u0026nbspOver the last months, Israel has been increasingly concerned by Iran’s attempts to build permanent military infrastructure near Israel in Syria, where Tehran is backing Syrian President Assad and the rebels. Iran and its allied forces have fired into Israel.\u0026nbspMembers of the Israeli army and government have told The Independent they have no interest in fighting a war on two fronts. But at the same time Israel is facing pressure from its own people to stop the burning kites and violence at the border.\u0026nbspIt all depends on whether the Egyptian-brokered truces can hold.\u0026nbspGreat March of ReturnEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Oh, let me count the ways. And believe me, it goes waaaay past ten.In fact, there are so many I feel it easier to group them together under various categories. So here goes.Eat with their mouths open stop an interesting group conversation to tell a dull, long-winded story with no point to it are overweight but claim they barely eat anything are thin but claim they eat everything pepper every, like, sentence with, like, the word “like” (Exhibit A: Anyone on Love Island) noisily slurp drinks in the cinema don’t pick up their dog’s poo make every sentence sound like a question litter the countryside don’t control their children in public places barge on to a train while you’re trying to get off read over your shoulder put bags on seats park in disabled bays when they’re clearly not live in a trillion quid mansion but claim to be socialist are glued to their mobile phone while their kid hurtles towards a road junction on its micro scooterupload ALL their holiday photos on social media, even the really crap ones say “aaah” loudly after drinking something.Aaaaaargh!Passengers who applaud when a flight lands parents who allow their kids to continually kick the back of your seat for the duration of a flight airport/rail managers who fail to boost staff numbers at peak times of the year oncoming drivers who push their way down a narrow road when you’re already three­quarters of the way along it train passengers who talk loudly on a mobile phone or think everyone else wants to listen to their ghastly music too people who cough on a crowded Tube/train without covering their mouth tailgaters drivers who don’t say thank you when you let them in middle lane hoggers packing hand luggage for a quick exit and being forced to put it in the hold.Head lice (so pointless) “Smart” TVs that make you feel anything but when trying to use the damned things novelty ringtones printed signs with spelling errors (use a pigging dictionary)online sites that won’t accept your usual password because it doesn’t have 48 squillion characters in it packaging that Harry Houdini would struggle to open roadworks with no one working on them spam emails automated phone systems immovable price stickers.Passing waiters who, when you ask for something simple like a spoon, reply: “Hang on, I’ll just get your waiter for you” shop assistants who stalk you around the rails as if you’re about to nick something fellow shoppers who start turning the rack of cards while you’re still looking at it hairdressers who chat incessantly through the supposedly “relaxing” head massage bit waiters who automatically hand the bill to the man queue-pushers at the bar bags “for life” that break the second you leave the supermarket assistants who carry on their social chat while you stand at the till waiting to be served cashiers who comment, “Ooh, are you having a party?”when you’re buying your own weekly wine supply shoppers who abuse the “ten items or less” aisle. Unless it’s me, of course.Believe me, I’m just scratching the surface here.Send me your irritations and I’ll print the best next week.Meghan Markles unpleasant half-sister Samantha is at it again – this time berating her understandably estranged royal relative for paying tribute to Nelson Mandela.“How about you pay tribute to your own father?” she ranted. “Enough is enough.Act like a humanitarian, act like a woman.If our father dies, I’m holding you responsible, Meg.”What a Grade A nasty.Meanwhile, last week Meghan’s father Thomas spent his 74th birthday picking up a Happy Meal from fast-food joint McDonald’s.Which, considering he’s just had heart stents fitted to help clear clogged arteries, suggests that if he dies any time soon, the only person responsible would be him.High-end designer ­Burberry junks £28million of unwanted products each year.A Burberry source has denied claims that they don’t donate it to charity because they don’t want the “wrong people” ­wearing it, saying that the destruction is actually to ­protect the brand against counterfeiting. Hmmm.The fakes ­market will always ­flourish irrespective of how many originals are pulped.So why doesn’t ­Burberry donate the items to upmarket charity ­auctions where people can bid a lot of money for something they might have bought anyway and have the extra thrill of knowing their cash will go to a deserving cause?Model David Gandy says he was once chucked out of a Hugo Boss catwalk show “because I couldn’t fit any of the clothing”.But luckily for the legion of Mr Gandy’s female fans, he can clearly still squeeze his, ahem, lardy self in to a teeny tiny pair of ­Y-fronts.Nope, still not going to wear them.Former Olympic showjumper Lizzie Purbrick has been telling her side of the story after being convicted of criminal damage for spraying her former lover’s home with several litres of pig’s blood.As you do.Lizzie, 63, says that initially, her relationship with Tory peer Lord Prior was “bloody marvellous” after they “met at a dinner party in Norfolk – the hotbed of sex – and I moved in with him four days later.”Whoa. Hang on, rewind that. Genteel Norfolk a hotbed of sex?And lo and behold, two days after this revelation, a survey by our sister paper The Sun on Sunday revealed that the nookie capital of Britain is…drum roll…Norfolk.So quite what they’re putting in the water up there is anyone’s guess.But something tells me house prices are suddenly set to rise.Charlie, 45, told his brother Matthew on the phone: “I’d really like to go out for a bottle of wine. I’ve been let out for a cigarette but I’m very bored.”We’ll take that as a no, then.Activity badges for Guides, Rangers and Brownies have been revamped for the 21st Century.You’ll be relieved to know Moped Mugging isn’t one of them, but there’s “Mixology” which involves designing a menu of non-alcoholic cocktails, “Festival Goer”, Vlogging, Mindfulness, Human Rights, Conscious ­Consumer and Media Critic (everyone’s a bloody critic.) Cripes.During my brief time as a Brownie in the late Sixties, I only achieved the “Hostess” badge, which entailed making a cup of tea for some visiting dignitaries at our local community centre and helping an elderly woman across the road.She didn’t want to go but, hey, a badge is a badge.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The 27 EU states, or most of them at any rate, might individually want good relations with us.But, in Brussels, there are plenty of officials who would rather see all sides suffer than watch Brexit succeed.If their view prevails, the implications go well beyond Brexit. For 70 years, Britain has been a European power.Although we kept our military ties with the other English-speaking democracies, our focus was the defence of Europe. It still is.There are, for example, British soldiers patrolling the borders of Poland and Estonia.The RAF is, to all intents and purposes, acting as Romania’s air force, responding to incursions into that country’s airspace. And so on.In intelligence and security, rather as with the Common Fisheries Policy, Britain puts a lot more than its share into the common pot.We have done so cheerfully because we saw European states as our allies, and felt that we had a stake in their security. But what if that feeling is no longer reciprocated?Visiting Germany on Monday, Jeremy Hunt, the Foreign Secretary, pointed out in measured and polite language that the EU could not expect to treat Britain aggressively without consequences.Now Mr Hunt is no Little Englander. He is an entrepreneur who made his money from language courses, is married to a Chinese woman and, after some soul-searching, came down on the side of Remain.But what he said is impossible to argue with. If the EU chooses to treat Brexit as a hostile act, the basis of European security will be undone — at the very moment that Donald Trump has made it clear that America is no longer interested in defending Europe.In almost every European speech since the referendum, Theresa May has said that she wants Britain to be the EU’s closest friend and strongest ally.But when have you ever heard those good wishes returned?The PM keeps saying she wants the EU 27 to succeed. EU leaders keep saying they want Brexit to fail.They mean it. Eurocrats are not offering Britain the kind of deal that they have with neighbours such as Norway and Switzerland.They think UK will just swallow what’s offered.If we want to remain in the single market, says chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier, then, unlike those countries, we’d have to give Brussels 100 per cent control of our trade policy — an impossible condition.But neither are they offering the kind of simple free trade deal that they have with, say, Canada and Japan.If we want a straightforward trade deal, Barnier says, we’d have to leave Northern Ireland under EU rules — an equally impossible condition.In other words, Britain won’t be allowed the friendly relations with the EU that other democracies take for granted.It is not for a lack of willingness on our side. In February, Theresa May told a Munich audience: “Europe’s security is our security. And that is why I say that the United Kingdom is unconditionally committed to maintaining it.”The EU’s response? To exclude us from the Galileo satellite programme on grounds that we could no longer be trusted.Well, fine. I never saw much point in the Galileo system, which was pushed by French leader Jacques Chirac to challenge the “technological imperialism” of America’s GPS system.Britain should now either go in with the Americans or create its own satellite system, possibly with friendly states such as Australia and Canada.But the point is, the EU’s logic goes well beyond satellites.If Brussels no longer sees us as an ally, we can hardly carry on behaving like one unilaterally, so to speak.While we talk of trade and co-operation, EU negotiators talk of border queues and grounded flights.Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, even threatens to close his airspace.If such thinking wins out, we shall have no choice but to leave Europe to itself and turn our faces, as our ancestors did, to the open seas.That is not an outcome anyone should want, but we shall be ready if it comes.Understandably enough, you might say, given what feeble negotiators we have been so far. But Britain has a bad habit of switching from vague amiability to sudden resolve when it is almost too late.Such a moment is upon us.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

OK, later you might find a hash brown stuck halfway up your bottom, but it’s worth it, just for the pleasantly cool sensation.It’s been a lovely summer, the best that I can remember since 1976. That summer was the happiest time of my life. But this hasn’t been bad, has it?But there are downsides to the driest and warmest spell we’ve had for years.Public transport isn’t always much fun, especially if you’re crunched up on the Tube next to a large bearded lady who last washed when hula hoops were all the rage.If you live in the country, there are mosquitoes — I’ve got bites in ­places I ­forgot existed.Work can be a bit of a chore. And if you’re a smoker, the pub gardens are suddenly full of tossers who waft their hands around if the smoke goes anywhere near them.Where were you when it was snowing, huh? I was there, lighting my Superking in a blizzard, while you were tucked away inside.But the hot weather is very good for us.There’s a link between clear, sunny days and good health — mental as well as physical.People feel better about themselves and tend to spend more money, which is good for the economy.OK, crime rates tend to increase when the weather is hot — more precisely, when the temperature ­hovers between 28C and 32C, according to psychologists.But on the whole, this summer — a proper summer, at last — is something to be enjoyed, cherished and remembered. We don’t have them very often.We can admire the women walking around with not many clothes on and laugh at the men dressed in toddler shorts with beer bellies hanging down to their knees.We can relax with a beer and forget about bloody Brexit for a while.The authorities think of nice summers as altogether something very different.For them, nice summers are a crisis.That’s why those tiresome drongos at the Met Office put out an amber alert when the temperature rose this week.“Don’t go out! Stay in your homes! Or you will die — DIE, I tell you.”Oh, with the greatest respect — f*** off!We’ll go out when and where we please, thank you, so you can stuff your advice where the sun isn’t shining.And, of course, the climate change ­monkeys are in full voice.“This is it! The end of the world! Look at the incredible temperatures and those wildfires in poor Greece. We told you!”Give it a rest. I think there is something to global warming. I am not a denier. But I remember the last few ­summers we’ve had — rainy and cool — and the climate change monkeys saying THAT was a consequence of global ­warming, too. You can’t have it both ways.And there have been wildfires in hot, dry areas for the past 100,000 years.So enjoy this wonderful heatwave while you can. Because someday, quite soon, it will be gone and the rain and the cold will be back, and the Christmas adverts will start appearing in supermarkets.And this summer will just be ­something you talk about in years to come. Remember the summer of 2018? Wasn’t it brilliant? If only we could have it again.Carlos Delacruz was in court in Scotland accused of having sex with two women with something other than a penis.The lasses THOUGHT it was his todger. But then, the lights were off.And the sad truth is that Mr Delacruz does not have a penis. Not even a small one.The women complained the sex was painful. So what was it, then?It was referred to in court as an “unknown object”.Here are my guesses:Incidentally, the prosecuting lawyer was called Ms Cockburn.No kidding, love.NO sooner has the World Cup finished than the domestic football season is about to begin.And with it the endless round of transfer speculation.If you’re still wondering why England didn’t win the World Cup, check out how many top foreign teams are trying to buy our players.None. None whatsoever.All the sides we played against in the final stages had players at Juventus, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich etc.That’s because they are very good players.But none of the top European clubs wants Harry or Dele or Raheem.We are a lot further behind than many people think.LABOUR MP and fervent Brexiteer Kate Hoey received the following email from a man called Robert Crangle.“I have never written to an MP before. I just want to say that you are a f***ing disgrace for helping to keep the Tories in power. I hope you die soon.”Lefty Remainers are a lovely bunch, aren’t they?IS it actually the law that all pop musicians must end up skagged out of their heads and taken to hospital?And then, if they survive, check into some poncey rehab clinic and tell their fans they are “fighting my demons”.And then come out of rehab and get skagged out of their heads again.The latest is Demi Lovato.I must admit I’m not a huge fan, but still.First time we knew anything was amiss was when she forgot the lyrics to one of her songs. The track was called Sober.So let’s wish her a speedy recovery from whatever foul substance laid her low.And remind pop singers that nobody looks cool in a pine box.THE Palestinian Authority has just revealed that at least half of the money it receives in aid goes to funding vile acts of terrorism against Israel. One Hamas bomber even pocketed £100,000.Please, think carefully and do your homework before giving money to charities working in Palestine.The British Government has already stopped aid to the Palestinian Authority. It’s time these Islamist thugs had the plug pulled on their slush fund from naive Westerners.LATEST news from the front line of scientific research on . . . crows.Apparently these birds are fond of a bit of necrophilia.Experts Dr John Marzluff and Kaeli Swift professed themselves “surprised” to seeing crows trying to have sexual intercourse with dead members of their species.The pair put this down to confusion caused by hormonal imbalance.I am not so sure. I have watched crows. And I can tell you that if I were forced to have sex with them I would much prefer it if they were dead.They would make that awful cawing noise if they were alive, and probably try to peck at your bits.Crows, I think, feel the same way.JUST a short word of congratulations to Jeremy Corbyn’s favourite country, Venezuela.The socialist paradise will soon experience an inflation rate of ONE MILLION PER CENT. That’s a pretty astonishing achievement.Most addled old Marxist dictators manage to keep inflation down to the low thousands.Meanwhile, Venezuela’s people are starving and every so often murdered or arrested by the foul Corbynista government.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But what sort of relationship do they want with us after all this is over?Talking about, and planning for, no-deal is not the “bravado” sneered at by Simon Coveney, deputy to pipsqueak PM Leo Varadkar. It is a vital precaution we should have begun two years ago.Leavers do not fear it, despite the panic Remainers are now deliberately stoking.Nor is it a bluff. It simply looks more likely every day. Especially on days when Irish politicians are wheeled on to pressurise us to shift even further towards Brussels’ fixed position.We have compromised far too much already. The EU must now cross some red lines. Why not? No country has left before. The situation is unprecedented. The EU’s response must be too.Ireland will be hit hard if no deal is struck.It should be pleading with Brussels. It can see Theresa May has no ­further room for manoeuvre without her Government imploding.And no, Mr Coveney, Britain doesn’t need “more time”.We need the EU to finally accept we aren’t changing our minds — unlike ­Ireland over the Lisbon Treaty and despite the Remainer clamour to do so.That way lies permanent servitude, global humiliation and political chaos.HOW can anyone guarantee a convicted paedophile or rapist is safe enough to be taken off the sex offenders’ register?The number of criminals winning that right since a law change six years ago is 1,230, including 632 child abusers.They no longer report to police or tell them if they are away from home.Even some put on the database “for life” can apply after 15 years to be removed. A thriving legal industry helps them do it.Decisions are simply at cops’ discretion. But how stringent are their tests when approval rates vary so wildly?We know “life” sentences in prison mean nothing. Now we cannot even trust “life on the sex offenders’ register”.Public safety must always come before the rights of potentially dangerous perverts.SOMETIMES we despair at our cops.They couldn’t be bothered looking into shoplifting at John Keppie’s sweet store. But they snapped into action with a warning over “data protection” when he put up CCTV pictures of the suspects.What is he meant to do?

But there are various things you can do to minimise the risk.Richard has also caught rats that are twice the size of a normal brown rat, particularly on farms where they break into the bags of high-protein food given to pigs to make them larger for meat.Now, the main issue facing pest controllers is the fact that some rats have become resistant to poisons used.Normally, exterminators use poisons called anticoagulants which are mixed with the food used as bait and take around 12-18 hours to kill the rodent.However, rats in some places - including Central London and the Welsh Boarder - have developed a genetic mutation that has left them poison resistant.Andy says this is down to the fact that the shop-bought products people tend to use arent normally strong enough to kill a rat.If a pregnant rat consumes it and her and her babies survive, the litter can be born with a resistance to the poison as the bacteria in their bodies will change to make it less effective - similar to when humans take antibiotics too often.Now pest controllers are having to use traditional traps instead of poison to ensnare rats.The process is much more time-consuming and some rats have even developed the ability to avoid traps.Its hoped that when the heatwave comes to an end the numbers may finally start to dwindle - but with temperatures predicted to reach 37C today, that doesnt show signs of happening any time soon.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

People have places to be, things to do.We can’t just delay by a day or two. Have some respect for paying passengers.”The heat meant speed restrictions were imposed on lines with hundreds of services cancelled or delayed elsewhere and even affected those through Eurotunnel.By mid-afternoon the Met Office had issued an amber alert for thunderstorms and warned of a danger to life, sudden flooding and power outages.It remained in place until 8pm for East Midlands and the East of England.The Environment Agency echoed the flood warnings, especially for East Anglia and Lincolnshire.Caroline Douglass, flood duty manager, said: “Heavy rainfall on dry or compacted ground may run off quickly, causing river levels to rise rapidly and bringing a risk of localised flooding.”The rain failed to stop wildfires breaking out in Dorset, Hertfordshire, North Wales and Hampshire.More than 40 firefighters were called to a blaze at Wanstead Flats, North East London.The smoke was so thick it could be seen from The Shard more than six miles away at London Bridge.Firefighters begged people not to drop matches and lit cigarettes or discard glass on tinder-dry areas.Despite yesterday’s storms, water levels in two-thirds of Britain’s rivers remain lower than normal.Six — the Derwent, the Eamont and the Lune in Cumbria, the South Tyne in Northumberland, the Great Ouse in Cambridgeshire and Norfolk and the Torridge in Devon — were regarded as exceptionally low.Only the South Tyne was in this category a month ago.Will Lang, chief meteorologist at the Met Office, said the stormy weather “heralds a more changeable and windy weekend”.Its been a struggle to stay cool for many Brits as the temperature skyrockets.The last few weeks have seen the mercury rise to uncomfortably high levels as the UK is gripped by a number of heatwaves.As we near record-breaking temperatures and health warnings are issued, we have pulled together some handy tips to stay cool:Temperatures will drop today with a high of 77F (25C) expected. They are likely to dip even further tomorrow to 71F (22C).The heatwave will return next week with at least 86F (30C).And experts believe heatwaves will become more frequent because of climate change.Dr Friederike Otto, of the University of Oxford, said: “What was once regarded as unusually warm weather will become commonplace — in some cases, it already has.“So this is something that society can and should prepare for.”THOUSANDS of holidaymakers endured a second day of chaos on the Eurotunnel yesterday after tickets were cancelled.Passengers were left in limbo after the cross-Channel rail operator tore up bookings amid delays caused by faulty air conditioning units.They were blocked from travelling if they were due to return the same day or today.It comes after thousands of passengers sweltered in 6½-hour queues on Thursday as trains were pulled from service."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT0004231918526.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"family shocked snake scunthorpe garden","story":"Lisa Pell, from Flixborough, Scunthorpe, had just returned home from work when she spotted the snake draped across the pagoda.The mum of three, who has a phobia of snakes, said: Ive never seen a grass snake before so to spot this outside my kitchen window, hanging from the pagoda was terrifying.Ive no idea where it came from, we live in a small village and our garden is surrounded on all four sides, so I dont know how it got in.After noticing that it had an audience, the snake then decided to explore their garden further, finally finding a resting spot in a pile of wood further into the yard.Lisa, who runs her own t-shirt printing business, said she had desperately called the RSPCA and her local vet for help on July 19.But the family tried to take matters into their own hands, with Lisas son, Scott, attempting to capture their scaly visitor.The 24-year-old said: Im a bit of a nature person and thought I’d be able to get hold of it easily, but as I went to pick it up from the wood pile it hissed at me and jumped up as if it wanted to bite me.It was scary and at that point I thought, nope, this is not for me.On his return from work, Lisas husband Richard, 48, was then tasked with catching the snake - which is normally found on the other side of the world in Southeast Asia, particularly Taiwan.Richard eventually managed to catch the snake by getting hold of its head and tail to keep it under control.Praising his dads efforts, Scott said: Hes very cool, calm and collected in these sorts of situations and luckily he managed to keep everything under control.The Pells then took the snake to the Old Registry Vets in Scunthorpe where the snake was identified as a Taiwanese Beauty Rat Snake.A spokesperson for the vets said: the snake was very agitated and quite stressed out.We dont usually deal with this sort of animal here and we dont think it would make an ideal pet snake really its a quite fast species and is known to be wild and pretty aggressive.No one has come forward to claim the snake yet but a friend of one of the vets has agreed to foster it as the vets dont have the correct facilities to look after it.They can grow to be up to 6ft long and can live for up to 15 to 25 years."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000423236171.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"feckless mum left baby trapped in sweltering car on 33c day while she went off to drink margaritas","story":"Rachel Vanwagner, 26, stopped by the Cazadores Mexican Grill in Arlington, Tennessee, in the early evening for a drink.But members of the public walking through the car park heard her daughter bawling for attention in the 33C heat and called 911.Sheriff’s deputies found the baby in the back seat of the Ford, whose windows were partially left open with the doors unlocked.First responders removed the baby from the car and gave her medical treatment.One man who heard the screaming, told Fox 13: ‘When you walk outside you don’t expect to hear a baby in a car and when you do, immediately as a parent you perk up.‘The child was hot.

And they hope the message will make EU leaders more likely to compromise - but it is set to be controversial in both the UK and Ireland.Fresh from a roasting by Brussels, the PM yesterday met the leaders of Austria, Estonia and the Czech Republic in a bid sell her dented Brexit blueprint to fellow EU leaders.Ahead of her summer break in Italy Mrs May, was hosted by Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz at the Salzberg Festival and held talks there with the other leaders on the fringes of the opera gathering.Both the Austrian and Czech governments have been critical of aspects of EU policy, particularly on migration, and Mrs May is determined to exploit internal divisions within the EU to push for a more flexible approach from Brussels.But in a blow last night Czech Europe Minister Ales Chmelar insisted there was unity behind Michel Barniers approach to the talks.The EU chief negotiator Mr Barnier all but rejected a key plank of her Brexit strategy on Thursday.Central to the PM’s plan is her facilitated customs arrangement under which tariffs charged at the border would be passed on to either the Britain or the EU depending on the destination of imported goods, but Mr Barnier made clear that was not acceptable to Brussels.And Mr Chmelar gave his backing to Mr Barniers position, saying: There is a clear problem with the fact that the EU will not have a mechanism to control its borders and it would be delegated - without any EU control - to a third country, which would be Britain after March.The fact that we are maybe critical of some aspects of EU policies, be it in migration or be it in other areas, does not meant that we wouldnt stand behind a very strong position on the integrity of the single market.”Sebastian Kurz was slightly warmed to Mrs May on her arrival in Salzburg, but also backed the Brussels hardliner.He said: “I think that the negotiations are going quite well” but stressed the importance of “avoiding a hard Brexit”.He added: “We will support Michel Barnier and also you and this way.”Last night Henry Newman of the think tank Open Britain warned Brussels was making the same mistakes that led to Brexit: “Member states need to give the British decision to leave a little more sober reflection – perhaps when David Cameron came asking for flexibility during his renegotiation it might have been better to give a little more.He added: “They need to look beyond the details of customs arrangements and participation in this or that agency, important though they are, to the bigger canvas: the future shape of this continent.”After all, Theresa May sold it to the country terribly.Predictably, the EU slapped down our offer. They will not allow Britain to enjoy frictionless trade as a non- member. So what happens next?EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier wants us to stay in the customs union, ending our freedom to strike global trade deals. But Mrs May would not survive breaching her own red line on this.Going back on her word would spark more Brexit ministers resigning from Government, making her position untenable. So what then?If Barnier and the sozzled Jean-Claude Juncker don’t like our proposal and insist on continuing to punish us then they leave us with no choice.No-deal is the only logical next step.Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab insists that we will be prepared for Brexit “come what may”. Good.We don’t want a hard border in Ireland. Nor do the Irish. But if the EU won’t budge, it may be unavoidable.Irish PM Leo Varadkar’s cosying up to Brussels and his anti-Brexit sabre- rattling is grossly misplaced.His country will be hit badly in the event of a no-deal.Let’s see how the Irish like that.EU leaders are due to meet in Salzburg on September 20 for an informal summit that could be used to discuss Brexit developments amid claims German Chancellor Angela Merkel believes there has been drift in the talks.NEARLY half of voters think Theresa May’s soft Brexit Chequers plan is a dud, a poll revealed.IPSOS Mori found fewer than one in three think the vision is a goer, and 47 per cent would not support it. And it showed confidence in Mrs May’s government had plummeted since the walkout of Cabinet ministers David Davis and Boris Johnson.Mrs May’s satisfaction ratings among Tory voters also slumped from 68 per cent to 50 per cent, according to the Evening Standard survey.Jeremy Corbyn’s approval ratings fell from 31 per cent last month to 28 per cent. Over half think Labour should send him packing before the next General Election. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Things are said.” While one Cabinet minister remarks: “It is not a great surprise. He’s been saying no all along.”This minister’s view is that it is now “up to the member states” what happens next.But they aren’t likely to come to the rescue of May’s customs plan. I understand just a handful of them are interested in it.Most of them don’t want to let the UK collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf or to have to collect tariffs for the UK ­themselves. The sheer bureaucratic complexity of the scheme doesn’t make it appealing.So, what happens next? Well, as May has told the Brexit Inner Cabinet, Barnier’s real aim is to keep Britain in a customs union with the EU.His calculation is that faced with a choice between a customs union and no deal, Britain will buckle.The attraction to the EU of keeping the UK in a customs union is that it will keep the pattern of trade much the same as it is now.There won’t be any free trade deals that cut the cost of, say, Australian wine and reduce European producers’ share of the UK market.But Barnier is making a dangerous assumption in thinking Britain will accept a customs union in the end.May has repeatedly said that she doesn’t want one. In the unlikely event of her changing her mind on this, more ­ministers would resign from her Cabinet (two are already on the verge of quitting, according to their colleagues) and more letters would go in demanding a vote of no confidence in her.It is hard to imagine her surviving this. Brexiteers would argue that if the EU won’t accept May’s proposal, the UK should turn to the “max fac” customs plan.This doesn’t eliminate all checks at the border, but uses technology to hugely reduce them and speed things up.The EU, though, will say that this doesn’t solve the Irish ­border problem and match what May committed herself to in December. It was this worry which led to her rejecting “max fac” in the first place.Some ministers are now beginning to whisper about whether, in these circumstances, some separate arrangements for Northern Ireland would be so terrible. But May herself would never go for this.One Cabinet minister warns a separate deal for Northern Ireland would bring down the Government, “I can’t see how the DUP would accept that and we can’t govern without them”.This minister says that May has made a “bold and fair offer to the EU” and if they won’t work from that “we’re not going to end up with a deal with them”.There is a strong sense among ministers that the UK can’t carry on with Barnier saying no and the Government offering up concession after concession. In the words of one, “we shouldn’t sell the soul of the nation to have a deal with the EU”.Is no-deal the most likely outcome, then? Well, not yet.Some in Government believe they can reverse the EU’s threat — pointing out that if there is no deal there will be a hard border in Ireland. They hope this message might make the EU more amenable either to May’s customs plan or to a “max fac”-style solution.What’s for certain is that May’s meeting with other EU leaders in September is ­shaping up to be crucial. But May must make sure she goes to that meeting with a plan B.If Merkel, Macron and Co want more and more ­concessions on Chequers, May must simply change course and ­propose a Canada-style free trade deal.She should tell EU leaders — and Ireland’s Leo Varadkar in particular — that the choice is between that and no deal, with all it would mean for the Irish border.But MPs who are back in their ­constituencies  are telling me that they are getting  even more stick  than they  expected about her proposals.One  Tory predicts that time spent  in the constituency will “put a fire underneath MPs before they  come back, rather than calming them down”.THERESA MAY’S fundamental flaw as a politician is on display again. She is simply not very good at selling things.This was her problem in the General Election campaign and it is her problem now as she tries to persuade a sceptical public of the merits of her Brexit plan.Her trip to the North East this week was a case in point. Here was a chance to try to sell the deal directly to voters. But May failed to take it.She didn’t come with anything new to say, she didn’t ask voters to put themselves in her shoes or make a charismatic case for it. As one Cabinet minister laments: “She’s uncomfortable with ­people, including her own ­colleagues.”But May needs to sell this plan. If she cannot turn public opinion on it around – at the moment only 12 per cent of voters think it would be good for Britain – then she won’t be able to get it through Parliament.As May goes on her summer hols, she should be thinking about a big address to the nation in September where she makes the case for her plan. It could be her last best chance to save it.THE most alarming thing about Labour’s anti-Semitism scandal is that the extent of concern across the Jewish community about how Labour is dealing with the issue hasn’t been enough to make the party change course.It is now hard not to conclude that Labour’s refusal to simply accept the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of anti-Semitism is worryingly sinister.It is tempting to put this all down to the Brexit effect, and that is – obviously – part of it.But what is striking is how volatile politics is right across the Western world. In the EU, the new populist Italian government will announce its budget in September, which could cause major problems in the eurozone.In Germany, a regional election could further destabilise the coalition there.While Spanish politics is about to be riled by it becoming the new centre of the migrant crisis.Meanwhile in America, August promises to be the most dramatic month yet in the presidency of Donald Trump  as his own lawyer appears to have turned on him.None of these situations is exactly the same.But there is a common root to this volatility: The aftermath of the financial crisis and the challenges posed by the fact it has never been easier to try to move from the poor world to the rich world.Until Western governments come up with answers to these questions, politics will be extremely volatile.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The beleaguered Prime Minister’s blueprint for quitting the EU had already been rubbished by Brussels and now the UK public have dealt a fresh blow to her waning authority. Just 30% of adults are satisfied with her performance - a five-point fall compared with a month ago, a survey revealed. The new score is the lowest net satisfaction score of her Premiership of -32, according to the Ipsos MORI poll for the Evening Standard.  Nearly half of those polled believed the Chequers deal will be bad for Britain, with just 29% expecting it to be good. Her ratings among Conservatives dropped from 68% to 55% as the public digested the proposal, which triggered the resignations of Brexit Secretary David Davis and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. Amid mounting pressure, Mrs May tonight held talks with Austrian counterpart Sebastian Kurz in Salzburg. Backing EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, Mr Kurz called for the sides to find ways to avoid a “hard Brexit” and strike a deal. But the PM, who lost two senior Cabinet ministers in the aftermath of the Chequers agreement, is battling to keep control of her top team. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox sounded the latest warning as he said extending Brexit negotiations would be a “complete betrayal” of Leave voters.  Keeping the UK in the EU beyond March 2019 could offer extra time to unlock stalled talks. But Dr Fox told Business Insider: “To attempt to extend our membership even longer, many voters would regard as a complete betrayal by the political class, and I think they would be right.” Former Brexit Minister Steve Baker claimed the EU was pushing Britain towards a choice between leaving without a deal or “capitulation”. He said: “Chequers was bound to be the beginning of the EU pushing the UK to the unacceptable combination of EEA (European Economic Area) and customs union membership. “On this road, eventually we will reach a fork between final capitulation or exit with no agreement.”   Meanwhile, supermarket chiefs ridiculed a call by new Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab that they should stockpile food in the event of a no-deal scenario.  One executive told the Financial Times: “It’s ridiculous. It’s scary because it shows how far the Government is from the reality of how things work. It’s genuinely worrying.” The British Retail Consortium said: “Stockpiling of food is not a practical response to a no-deal on Brexit, and industry has not been approached by government to begin planning for this.

A combination of austerity and incompetence has left the prison and probation services on their knees and the latest statistics should be a matter of national shame. Assaults on prison officers are at a record high, more than 15,000 mobile phones were found in England’s jails and drug abuse is rife. One in 10 prisons is now rated “a serious concern.”  If this were not bad enough, the Government is having to spend millions bailing out the privatised probation service.

Chantelle Murphy, 26, tried hair removal cream for the first time but it burned the skin on her face. Her friends have been jokingly comparing her to the men in the 118 118 advert and Looney Tunes\u0027 Yosemite Sam because she was left with a red moustache shaped mark. Chantelle had spotted the Nair Moisturising Hair Removal Cream for the bargain price of 99p. Thinking it would be a time saver, the mum-of-two smothered the hair remover cream on her face on Sunday evening and waited for it to work. But when the cream started burning her lip, Chantelle quickly scrubbed it off. She was mortified to see it had left her with an embarrassing burn the shape of a handlebar moustache above her lips. Despite struggling to cover the burn with make-up to go to work, Chantelle was able to see the funny side. And after sending a picture to pals, she was told she should get a razor next time.  Chantelle, from Bridgend, South Wales, said: It had to happen to me. Basically I\u0027d never, ever tried any hair removal cream before. I just thought, oh, you know what, I\u0027ll give it a go. After two, three minutes at most I just felt it getting really warm. I thought maybe this is normal because when you dye your hair sometimes you can feel the heat on your skin. After another 30 seconds I thought I need to get it off. As I was wiping it off you could see the red appearing and it was getting worse and worse. I\u0027ve got quite a professional job and I didn\u0027t really want to go in looking like that. My friends thought it looked like the 118 guys. It was obvious what I had tried to do as well. It wasn\u0027t just a little bit red, it was full on the shape I\u0027d applied it to. Above my mouth was red. They were saying oh, try gillette next time. Somebody said it looked like Yosemite Sam. It\u0027s quite lighthearted and funny. I wasn\u0027t too upset. I was just thinking \u0027this had to happen to me, didn\u0027t it?\u0027 and wondered how I was going to go to work tomorrow.  Luckily Chantelle, who works as an independent living officer, was able to soothe the burn enough to disguise it with makeup the next day. But the mum claims she\u0027ll never use facial hair removal cream again. Chantelle said: I would absolutely not use face hair removal cream after this. I think I will just stick to waxing from now on. It\u0027s such a private thing to do, hair removal cream on your upper lip, and it\u0027s backfired. I tried loads of aloe vera stuff but when I woke up on Monday morning it was still quite red, but it was enough for me to cover to go to work. But because it was stinging on my face it was burning as I was applying makeup.  She added: It has pretty much gone now but it is a bit itchy where the skin is peeling around it. While the skin is healing I\u0027ve had to avoid wearing fake tan. It was the first time I\u0027d ever applied it before. I just wish I\u0027d applied it to my legs first because if I\u0027d had that sort of reaction on my legs I\u0027d have been like \u0027woah, no more now\u0027 and I could have hidden it.

Locals have even started breeding their donkeys with stronger mules so it is easier for them to carry fatter tourists. The animals have traditionally been used to carry visitors up the hundreds of cobbled steps and steep hills on the popular cruise ship stop-off. But campaigners claim they are being forced to carry ever-heavier loads, causing spinal injuries and open wounds from ill-fitting saddles.  A spokesman for charity Help the Santorini Donkeys said: “They’re having to resort to using cross-bred mules, as the donkeys just aren’t strong enough. “It’s recommended animals carry no more than 20% of their body weight. “Obese and overweight tourists com\u0026shy\u0026shybined with the lack of shade and water, heat and cobbled steps is what’s causing such a problem.” He added: “There should be a weight restriction. With donkeys it should be no more than eight stone, but how would that be imposed?”  In summer, up to five cruise ships a day bring swarms of 1,200 tourists. Witnesses claim donkeys make four to five journeys up the 500-plus steps to capital Fira town. Santorini Animal Welfare Association founder Christina Kaloudi, 42, moved to the island from Athens 10 years ago.

Ross, a digital marketing MD, said: “It was jaw dropping.  “I was walking to the car when it started and had one hailstone ping off the top of my head. “It stung like hell. I have never seen anything like it in the UK before, the size of them ranged from garden peas up to golf balls. “The larger ones had even lost their round shape and become jagged and spikey. “Overall, the deluge lasted for 90 minutes, coming it three spells. “Less than 20 minutes after it had stopped though, there was sunshine, and the ice was all gone.” "},{"url":null,"title":"half uk students thinking studying","story":"NewsHalf of UK students are thinking of studying abroad due to \u0027extortionate\u0027 tuition fees and Brexit fearsA poll of 750 students aged 16 suggests that more youngsters than ever think going abroad for a degree or further studies is a good optionShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByRob Knight18:26, 27 JUL 2018Updated18:57, 27 JUL 2018NewsHalf of UK youngsters are considering going abroad for their studies, research shows (Image: Getty)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHalf of students are considering studying abroad - due to ‘extortionate’ UK tuition fees, research has revealed. A study of 750 students aged 16 and over found seven in 10 think the cost of higher education at home is ‘too high.’ And three in five are concerned Brexit could increase the cost of UK tuition fees even more. Amid this, the poll commissioned by foreign exchange specialists, Caxton, found four in 10 believe studying overseas is likely to lead to a higher paid job upon graduation. In comparison, just 14 per cent are confident studying in the UK would set them up for financial success in the future.  Edward Gott, head of premier clients at Caxton, said: “It’s clear that an education overseas can offer a wealth of benefits, bringing financial rewards as well as opportunities for significant cultural enrichment. “Although it might at first appear a daunting investment proposition, Brits can in fact save thousands of pounds by looking overseas to further their studies and reap the rewards as a result.” The research found the USA is the most popular choice for those who would like to study abroad, followed by Spain and Germany. But exchange rates would play a part in deciding which country to study in for 54 per cent, with one fifth more inclined to move abroad if foreign exchange rates were more beneficial towards the pound.  Researchers also polled 1,000 parents and found more than half would support their children should they decide to study abroad. Almost half believe it would enable their kids to have ‘new and exciting experiences’, while 45 per cent think it would provide them with important life skills. Despite this, 44 per cent of mums and dads admit they would be worried about financing their child’s studies overseas. But should they decide to pursue further education abroad, parents would most like to see their kids head to the USA.  Edward Gott added: “We’re working closely with a number of our Premier clients who fund children at overseas universities, as well as retired or mature students looking to study abroad. “Living in a foreign country presents a number of challenges – from making regular payments for tuition fees and living costs, to working out a savings plan and managing unexpected currency fluctuations. “All clients like to budget and manage costs and we take time to understand their needs, hedge their specific currency exposure and set up the transfer of funds to work like clockwork. “It takes the headache away and allows them to focus on the fun stuff.”  To find out more about Caxton Premier click here or call 080 8278 3839.

It\u0027s actually the most likely time of the year that your vehicle will run into problems. But the good news is there\u0027s plenty you can do to prevent a problem before it occurs. Below we\u0027ve pulled together everything you need to know to try and get around some of the most common issues, from where not to drive to what you need to check today.  We already know that summer can cause problems with your car battery , sapping it of essential fluids and running performance into the ground.   But you can get that checked with a Halfords Car Battery Fitting Service where in-store experts can fit a new one if necessary, with prices for a Halfords Car Battery starting at \u0026pound58.   When am I most likely to break down?    Department for Transport figures have revealed that in 2016, August was the peak month for breakdown incidents, with 17,777 cars needing the help of a breakdown service.  In the years, 2014 and 2015, July was the peak month, with 20,129 and 18,588 incidents recorded. The figures also reveal that Friday is the day most cars end up on the hard shoulder of England\u0027s motorways. And while the month varies across years, Friday was a constant in being the day most likely for cars to breakdown.  Which road is a breakdown blackspot?  The M1 is the undisputed leader in breakdowns. Between 2014 and 2016 there were 78,672 reported incidents. The M25 was a close second (71,933 breakdowns) and the M6 third (71,134 incidents).   One way that you can avoid additional stress on your engine (not to mention delays), is by avoiding heavy traffic. Using a sat nav like the Garmin Drive 51LMT-S with UK and Ireland Maps 5 Sat Nav - now \u0026pound88 (save \u0026pound31.99) is a great way to prevent hitting jams as it offers alerts when there are delays on your route.   Pair it with a dashcam to film everything that happens in front of you on the road - such as the Nextbase Dashcam 412GW , now \u0026pound103 (save \u0026pound26). You might find this gives you additional piece of mind. The device boasts QUAD HD 1440p High Definition recording at 30 frames per second to capture a 140\u0026deg viewing angle to capture the entire road ahead. This helps to provide you with instant evidence to support insurance claims in helping prove an accident was not your fault.   How to prevent a breakdown   A modern car is a marvel of engineering. For the most part you can be sure it will give you years of reliable service. However, your tyres, battery and engine oil levels should also be regularly checked. In the summer, engine oil gets hotter, making it less viscous. This can put a strain on the components in your engine and could lead to a serious problem.  Not having the right level of oil in your car will make this worse, so check regularly and top up with a good quality oil. Pop into a local Halfords store (no appointment needed), and trained experts will check your engine oil levels and top it up if needed. They can also advise on the best engine oil for your car.   Not everyone has the time to get under the bonnet, so a Free Car Check performed by Halfords experts will put your mind at rest and help to prep your car for longer journeys.

The three dresses were created by designer Kate Tabor and took her over three weeks to make, using 20 metres of wetsuit material and 12 litres of foam.  Tabor took inspiration from the structural designs of Alexander McQueen and renowned haute-couturier Iris Van Herpen in creating the lip-smacking gowns.  The Couture creations were commissioned to celebrate the launch of Costa Coffee’s new Whipped Milk, which gives iced coffee drinks like the Iced Flat White and Cold Brew a silky mouth-feel while topping them with an elegant meringue-like appearance.  Kate Tabor, designer said: “Each dress is bespoke from a flirty minidress to an edgy asymmetric design and a classic, full-length bridal number all were inspired by the texture of Whipped Milk and the way it is poured. “I’ve created innovative costumes for everyone from David Bowie to The Chemical Brothers, but I’ve never designed anything as challenging or unique as Costa Coffee’s Whipped Milk Couture.” Designer Kate, who has created awe-inspiring costumes for music videos for the likes of Katy Perry and Kylie Minogue, began the process by sketching designs, then experimenting with delicate foams ahead of crafting robust neoprene shells, which supported the overall structure of the dresses. The painstaking application process took three hours per gown. The Whipped Milk creations mark the reinvention of Costa Coffee’s Iced Flat White and Iced Cappuccino drinks this summer.  The addition of Whipped Milk, an aerated skimmed milk foam topping, also forms the finishing flourish on summer menu items such as refreshing Cold Brew and in Costa Coffee’s new range of Milk Whips. Gennaro Pelliccia, Costa Coffee\u0027s Master of Coffee, added: Whipped Milk is Costa Coffee’s must-have summer drink addition, inviting coffee-lovers to enjoy their favourite hot choices as refreshing chilled drinks, perfect for the scorching weather we’ve been enjoying. “Coffee fans don’t even have to wait for Whipped Milk to make it from the catwalk to the high street, it’s already whipping up a storm in store now!” The Iced Flat White is expertly handcrafted by Costa Coffee\u0027s skilled baristas using the purest extract of the coffee bean.  In the same way the traditional ‘hot Flat White’ that fans know and love is finished with texturised milk so too is the iced version using the chilled Whipped Milk to recreate the luxurious silky texture. Cappuccino drinkers can enjoy the Iced Cappuccino made with either a double or triple extraction of espresso and topped with the delicate chilled milk foam. For a twist on your favourite Costa Cold Brew, try the Cold Brew with Whipped Milk. The meringue-like Whipped Milk floats beautifully on top of the Cold Brew and is a great way to add milk to the drink without diluting the coffee flavour and adding visual and sensorial excitement to the coffee drinking experience.

Gweneth Lee, 46, jetted off for a weekend in Paris in which she and her mystery man stayed at a \u0026pound15,000-a-night hotel, dined in a three-star Michelin restaurant and went on a \u0026pound17,000 shopping spree. The date culminated in the widow taking part in a \u0026pound10,000 Fifty Shades of Grey themed erotic photoshoot alongside the city\u0027s most famous landmarks including the Pont Alexandre III bridge and the Eiffel Tower.   Hotel guest BITES bridegroom after claiming someone from wedding was romping with his girlfriend behind door  Businesswoman Ms Lee, of Chelsea, West London said: My lover is like a real-life Christian Grey with a string of businesses ranging from tech to property. But he is real interest is sex and the kind of kinky games that Christian enjoys in the Fifty Shades of Grey books and films. He loves erotic imagery and it was his idea to hire one of Paris\u0027s finest erotic photographers for the shoot. We went from landmark to landmark and my lover choreographed all the shots.   Charles Bronson\u0027s wife says she\u0027s eating humble pie about divorce after notorious inmate releases statement  My favourite is the one next to the famous Pont Alexandre III bridge that crosses the Seine connecting the Champs-Elysees with the Eiffel Tower. It is one of the most romantic locations in the world but also highly erotic. We went straight back to the Ritz afterwards and made love while we chose the most smouldering shots for the shoot. I will always cherish the pictures we shot in Paris because they are a permanent reminder of one of the best weekends of my life.  Ms Lee has been dubbed Britain\u0027s most prolific mistress after dating at least 100 married men who treat her to expensive holidays all over the world. She got a taste for the high-life when she was married to her late oil executive husband Robert, who died from cancer ten years ago.  They were both having affairs on IllicitEncounters - a dating website for married people - and she simply carried on using the same site to meet more lovers after his death.  She says she prefers dating married men because they are wealthy and they just want no-strings fun and sex. During her weekend away in Paris, she was taken to the city by private jet and stayed in the \u0026pound15,000-a-night Imperial Suite at the Ritz Hotel. The couple dined at the three-Michelin starred Arpege restaurant where their dinner for two was \u0026pound4,000 due to the champagne they consumed. Other treats in the Paris weekend included a \u0026pound10,000 shopping trip to the Dior boutique in Avenue Montaigne and \u0026pound3,000-worth of erotic lingerie from the Carine Gilson boutique in Rue de Grenelle.  Ms Lee added: The trip to Paris was \u0027Christian\u0027s\u0027 little to treat for me to celebrate five years of dating. He lives in London and has a fairly detached relationship from his wife who is busy bringing up their two teenage children and doesn\u0027t share her husband\u0027s love of the kinky stuff. She is French and accepts that he will have affairs as long as they don\u0027t interfere with family life and I am one of several women he sees. I know one of his other lovers, a beautiful PA in her late 20s, because our dates overlapped once and he introduced us. I will always cherish the pictures we shot in Paris because they are a permanent reminder of one of the best weekends of my life. It was a weekend I will never forget where no expense was spared to ensure we had the time of our lives. The highlight was the unforgettable photoshoot in many of the most famous locations in Paris shot by Santillo, who specialises in the finest erotic photography. The only way we were able to do it was getting up at dawn so we got the very best light and could shoot without being swamped by tourists and over-inquisitive gendarmes.  Miss Lee and her lover travelled to the \u0027date\u0027 on his private jet. She said: People boast about turning only want to \u0027turn left\u0027 when they fly, meaning walking to the first class seats. But that is nothing compared to a travelling by private jet. My lover goes everywhere on his, even taking his beloved black labrador dog with him. Thankfully the dog skipped the trip to Paris but he\u0027s flown with us on other trips. You can join the Mile High Club any time you like on a private jet and not worry about the air stewards banging on the door.

Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0027s romantic story has enchanted the masses, with people following every development in their relationship.  But the former Suits star isn\u0027t the first American to charm a member of our royal family. Baltimore-raised Wallis Simpson met Edward, Prince of Wales when she was 34 - the same age Meghan was when she met Harry. And the similarities between the two women don\u0027t end there.  Wallis, like Meghan, had already been married before meeting her prince. This caused controversy for Edward - who went on to become King Edward VIII - as royals were not allowed to marry divorcees at this time. Eventually he opted to abdicate his throne, so he could marry the love of his life. Subsequently, Wallis became a duchess - the Duchess of Windsor.  The two duchesses can also be seen to share similar tastes when it comes to their style. It is reported that Wallis\u0027 favourite designer was Hubert de Givenchy, the same fashion house which Meghan selected to design her wedding dress. Meghan\u0027s wardrobe also appears to be reflecting some of Wallis\u0027 style choices, with both preferring muted tones, stepping out in shades of beige, navy and taupe.  A close look at photos of the two will reveal that Meghan also often wears her hair in a middle parting - just as Wallis did. If that weren\u0027t enough, the car in which the Duchess of Sussex was driven to her wedding in, is believed to be the same model which took Wallis to the funeral of her husband over 40 years ago. However there is one big difference between the two women. "},{"url":null,"title":"summer 76 like long holiday","story":"NewsopinionThe summer of \u002776?

Something to do with the sun, \u0026shyapparently. And how it refuses to go away, leaving us red, sweaty and worried about the dog. It’s given commentators a chance to contrast then and now, with some right-wingers declaring that life was much worse in those dark, pre-Thatcherite days when it took the GPO weeks to install a phone, inflation was 17% and unions held the country to ransom. Which is a load of Space Hopper-sized balls. As the New Economics Foundation concluded 14 years ago, 1976 was the best year on record for equality of incomes and quality of life. We had a sense of community and \u0026shyfairness back then. We invested in public services so you could get seen quickly at hospitals and borrow books from libraries, there were untouched parks and school playing fields and councils filled in potholes. University education was free, with maintenance grants paid to poorer kids, houses were affordable for first-time buyers, and most families could get a council home to rent. People worked fewer hours in more secure jobs and were offered decent pensions.  There was Taxi Driver on at the pictures, Rising Damp on the telly, every kind of music from Abba to The Sex Pistols and it cost as little as 70p to watch the best football teams. I’m not saying everything was hunky-dory. Homophobia, racism, sexism and police corruption went unchecked, and due to under-investment, poor industrial relations and the after-effects of the global oil crisis, the economy was slumping. But compared with today, 1976 seems like a long holiday spent in a hot tub with Charlie’s Angels. In 2018, we are a bitterly divided nation with a directionless government talking about stockpiling food and \u0026shymedicines in case a no-deal Brexit pushes us off a cliff. A Resolution Foundation report has just warned that eight million “just about managing” families are no better off today than in 2003 due to income stagnation marking the largest rise in poverty since Thatcher’s era. We work longer hours in far less secure jobs, the NHS is in crisis, there are hordes of homeless on the streets, childhood obesity and diabetes are at epidemic levels, students are smothered in debt, the young can’t afford to leave their parents and underfunded police have given up chasing many criminals. Worst of all, greed at the top has gone off the scale and wealth disparities have never been more glaring. In 1976, the average British CEO earned 20 times what his average employee did. Today the average FTSE chief executive earns almost 400 times more than a worker on the National Living Wage.

Ava Wilkinson, from Preston, Lancs, was playing on her slide on Monday afternoon when it toppled over on an uneven paving stone, sending her crashing to the ground. And Ava\u0027s mother, Laura Cook, 29, said she feared for her daughter\u0027s life after seeing pools of blood and a massive hole in her forehead that left the toddler\u0027s skull exposed. Stay-at-home mum-of-two Laura said: Ava\u0027s dad, Darren, was cutting the grass and had moved all the toys, including the slide, onto the patio.  There were some uneven paving slabs on patio and when Ava got onto the slide it toppled over and she smashed her head on the stones. I just heard this almighty scream. Darren reached her first and there was blood everywhere. He was crying his eyes out and I started to panic but I didn\u0027t want to get upset in front of Ava. It all happened at once and I didn\u0027t know what to do. You could see her skull through the hole in her head and I knew it was bad. We wrapped a tea towel around her head to try and stop the blood but she started getting drowsy. I tried to keep her awake because I knew if she lost consciousness then it would be difficult to wake her up. My worst fear was that her skull had cracked and the hole had gone deeper, affecting her brain.  Ava\u0027s dad, Darren Wilkinson, 40, a furniture up-cycler, immediately phoned an ambulance and within 15 minutes paramedics arrived at their Preston home to assess the little girl\u0027s injury. Deciding that the hole was too big to treat at the scene, paramedics called the North West Air Ambulance Service to take Ava to Alder Hey Children\u0027s Hospital in Liverpool, some 40 miles away. Laura said that if it wasn\u0027t for the quick responses of NHS Ambulance staff, her daughter could\u0027ve been left with a fractured skull, brain damage, or worse. Doctors took Ava in for surgery the following morning, where she was given general anaesthetic so they could operate.  Luckily, the wound only required stitches but staff at the Liverpool hospital said the two year old would be left with a huge scar which may need cosmetic surgery later down the line. Ava was allowed to go home on Tuesday afternoon and Laura said her daughter is now on the mend. The mum said: The staff in the helicopter were brilliant they kept Ava awake all the way to the hospital by playing with her and letting her mess around with their visors in order to distract her from the pain. And when we got to Alder Hey there were a team of nurses and doctors waiting for us they rushed Ava into the emergency room straight away.

Photographs have emerged showing crowds sheltering from the rain under umbrellas as it falls in London after a long spell of dry weather. People ran for cover in Brighton as the heavens opened at around 4pm this afternoon. Parts of the country, including East Anglia and the South East have seen no widespread rain since May 29, the Met Office told . But now torrential downpours are possible, with as much as 30mm of rainfall in one hour and 60mm in three hours, while large hail, frequent lightning and strong, gusty winds will be additional hazards, forecasters warned. Heavy thunderstorms could cause danger to life, sudden flooding and power cuts as forecasters upgraded a weather warning. The Met Office issued an amber alert for parts of England - a step up from yellow - with intense storms looking set to bring the British heatwave to an end. Although it’s been drier than normal everywhere, there have been spells of rain at various times in Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and the North of England, the Met Office said. But from June 24 there were 16 consecutive days where somewhere in the UK reached 28C. And today Brits are going wild as they cannot believe the rain has finally returned.  Thursday saw the highest temperature recorded in the UK since 2015, with Wisley in Surrey hitting 35.1C, and the mercury could still soar to a stifling 37C on Friday. The hot weather and very high afternoon temperatures have led to an amber warning for thunderstorms from 2pm to 8pm in the East Midlands and East of England today. The yellow warning for thunderstorms is in place until 2am on Saturday and covers London and the East of England. Those in the areas covered by the warnings can expect flooding of homes and businesses, which could happen quickly, with damage to some buildings from floodwater. Fast flowing or deep floodwater is likely, causing danger to life, the Met Office said of the areas covered by the amber warning.      Delays or cancellations on transport, difficult driving conditions and power cuts are also possibilities. Yellow warnings for rain have also been issued for Northern Ireland on Saturday, with thunder possible. Will Lang, chief meteorologist at the Met Office, said temperature records could still be broken. If conditions all come together, there\u0027s a 50% chance that we will break the July record temperature and a 20% chance of a new all-time UK record high, he said. A temperature of 36.7C (98F) at Heathrow on July 1 2015 is currently the record for the month of July, while the all-time record in the UK is 38.5C at Faversham on August 10, 2003.  Tony Wafer, RNLI community safety manager, said: If you are heading to the coast this weekend, please find out where your nearest lifeguarded beach is and ask the lifeguards for advice on conditions, especially if you are going in the water. RNLI lifeboats and lifeguards have had four times as many rescues of inflatables so far this summer than they did last year. Cross-Channel rail operator Eurotunnel has cancelled thousands of tickets after extreme temperatures caused major disruption to services. The company took the unprecedented decision to stop passengers travelling today if they were due to return on the same day or Saturday in a bid to ease long queues. On UK trains, passengers were urged to avoid travelling on London North Eastern Railway (LNER) on Friday after lightning damaged the signalling system.

People all around the UK have been eagerly waiting in vain to see the stunning lunar eclipse. It has been sighted this evening in locations all around the world including in Kenya, Italy, Pakistan, Greece, Egypt and Israel. Beautiful photographs have been shared, with the bright and shining moon tinted a striking orange-red colour. But it was no-where to be seen in Britain. People had set up camp outdoors, in high spots towering over cities to get the best view - but clouds largely obscured the celestial phenomenon.  Social media users took to Twitter to vent their frustration. One said: Been clear skies for 2 months and now the clouds decide to come out + it’s raining.(sic) Another wrote: Aww com\u0027on rain \u0026amp cloud pls disappear so I can get some photographs of the night\u0027s blood moon and lunar eclipse.(sic). Others seemed angry about missing out.  One wrote: As usual the UK  weather f**** any chance of seeing a blood moon.  And another said: Can\u0027t see the Blood Moon in Manchester UK Tonight Thank you Mother F***ing Nature for The Clouds.(sic)           But it wasn\u0027t bad news for everyone. In Nairobi, Kenyans watched as the moon darkened. This is what life is all about: Magical moments like this, said Teddy Muthusi as he watched from Uhuru Park in Nairobi. It\u0027s just beautiful. It\u0027s well worth it. On the banks of India\u0027s Ganges, temples were closed ahead of eclipse. In Singapore, enthusiasts watched through telescopes at the Marina South Pier.  Hundreds of people in Australia paid to watch the eclipse from the Sydney Observatory before sunrise. When the moon moved into the conical shadow of the earth, it went from being illuminated by the sun to being dark. Some light, though, still reaches it because it is bent by the earth\u0027s atmosphere. It\u0027s called a blood moon because the light from the sun goes through the earth\u0027s atmosphere on its way to the moon, and the earth\u0027s atmosphere turns it red in the same way that when the sun goes down it goes red, Andrew Fabian, professor of astronomy at the University of Cambridge, told Reuters.

Chris Ingham, 34, is the beanie-wearing star of The Ingham Family, a YouTube channel that documents the amusing but chaotic life of his family alongside wife Sarah and his three young daughters Isabelle, Esme and Isla. Two teenage fans have now come forward with accusations that Mr Ingham sent them seedy texts on social media – including one 16-year-old who he asked to sneak out of her mum’s hotel room and meet him in the middle of the night Another claim contends that Ingham sent a leering message to a 19-year-old by requesting she send a nude photo after promising to make her a star.  Chris and the family have strenuously denied these claims and said they are “entirely without foundation.” 16-year-old Jess Simpson, from Sussex, discovered that she was staying at the same resort as Ingham while visiting Florida’s Disneyland Resort with her family last October. After contacting her idol to say they were staying at the same location, Jess was bombarded with inappropriate messages on Twitter from Chris Ingham.   In a detailed Twitter post, Jess revealed how he called her “mega-pretty” and told her “I bet I can make you feel a lot better about things”. He later asked if she wanted to go “skinny dipping” and said “If you can sneak out without waking anyone then deffo come meet me!” The two never met in person but Jess later told her mother who contacted police over the unwanted messages.   A Sussex Police statement to The Sun read :  The person who made contact with her was also believed to be a British man. The contacts were of a sexual nature, however they did not meet in person. As the girl was over 16, no offences have been committed. In another incident, 19-year-old Bella Fear, from Staffordshire, claims the YouTuber sent her unwanted messages after the pair met at Alton Towers where she was working. He told her she had a “banging bod” and promised that he could make her a star in the entertainment industry. One lurid private message from the YouTube star asked that she ‘drop her towel’ in a selfie.

So when Colin was replacing the floor joists in the Plymouth home, he decided to have a little dig down to see what was going on and was amazed to discover a well. The couple had three young children at the time, so decided to cover it up so it was safer for them. But after Colin retired from his job in the civil service, he decided it was time to have another little look. He soon found the hole was a lot bigger than he first thought, and with the help of a friend has now managed to dig down 17ft.  He said: The hole was full of earth, but with the help of a neighbour, we have managed to get about 17ft deep. I always wanted to dig it out to see if I could find a pot of gold at the bottom, so when I retired that\u0027s what I did. I was quite surprised really, I would have preferred it to be in the garden where I could have got at it a little easier. Using a ladder and a bucket on a pulley system, it took them around six months to get to the depth it is at now.  Colin said: We think it\u0027s a bottle well. It\u0027s 30 inches wide now and could go down another 5-6ft. I thought I\u0027d found a sword around 4ft down - it was a wooden thing that must have had a leather sheath on it as you can see stitch holes. That\u0027s why I want to get to the bottom. Who knows what\u0027s down there. We have no idea when it was built. There could have been a couple of cottages here or it could have served a farm. I\u0027d like to find something down the bottom, something to give me an age. I wish I had a Tardis to go back in time and see what was here.

The strange five-inch long specimen resembles a sausage with a long thin tail and it has baffled social media users across the country. A fierce debate erupted online when Bex posted footage of the alien-like creature. The strange specimen is believed to be a larger than normal rat-tailed maggot, which will eventually turn into a drone fly.  The woman described it as moving like a worm but much larger in size, with a long, thin tail but without a face or legs. Her friends were quick to offer their insight into what they believe the creature could be. One said: That thing is absolutely gross! I\u0027ve never seen something so disgusting! OMG get rid of that please. Others could barely look at the video, which they said creeped them out. Some people even thought the creature was an alien. Rat-tailed maggots are often less than an inch long but the tail can be as long as six inches when completely extended. These are the immature stage of flies that resemble honey bees.

Four armed hunters are patrolling the perimeter of the grounds in Yakutia region, the coldest area of Russia. The “wily” mother bear has been sending her two cubs to raid the kitchen rubbish skips far-flung Bereg Druzhby camp, say reports. Security has been stepped up after an outcry from parents.  Initially officials at the state-run summer retreat drafted in an 83 year old hunter to provide security - but he failed to scare away the bear, leading to fury from parents over the safety of their children . Since then three more professional hunters have been deployed on a round the clock watch. The hunters have had the cubs in their sights but not shot at them - because the mother would become enraged and unpredictable.  Head of the Aldan district Severin Pozdnyakov said: ‘There are bear traps set all around the camp. “Four hunters are on 24/7 patrol. “We will not kill the bears unless there is direct threat. “This is not an unusual situation for us. “We live in the taiga, this is part of our life.” Camp director Alexander Mekhedov admitted the cubs, one a baby and the other one year old, “keep roaming the camp”.  He said: The cubs don’t walk about the whole camp site, they just run towards the kitchen area, quickly grab bags with rubbish and flee. “They are easy to shoot, but we won’t do it. “The territory is properly fenced, the animals won’t break through. “There is no need to start evacuation, everything is under control.”  Igor Sakhno, deputy head of Aldan district who is in charge of the camp, was accused of complacency by the local media after saying he did not see anything “big” to worry about with the bears prowling the vicinity. The mother circles around the camp, but has not herself entered the territory, say local reports. Currently there are 200 children at the camp, aged from seven to 15. Some children at the holiday centre are in foster care while others are handicapped.

From a player who hasn’t played for a year you can see he can get about the pitch and he’s only going to get better.“I’m quite excited about him and I’m pleased he got on the scoresheet.“That opened it up because Peterhead worked really hard to try and limit us chances.“We’ve been working on that actually over in Portugal, midfielders coming from deeper positions into that area and he finished it well, too.“It was a comfortable finish, he didn’t rush it, though he did with one later in the game.“The over-riding feeling is we’re quite pleased to come away with three points because we were quite disappointed on Sunday.”Dundee went on to seal the three points in stoppage time as another new face found the net as Jean Mendy made it two goals in three games.Neil added: “I was pleased, clearly Peterhead were going to make it difficult.“They dropped everyone right off the ball and sometimes had 11 players in the last 40 yards of the pitch. That denies us space and it was difficult.“However, I thought we were patient enough and scored two really good goals.“We created a lot.

The first is my collections of jewellery which I design and make to be distributed to the shops that stock my designs up and down the country.“The second is my bespoke pieces.“This is where someone comes in with a design in mind or with a piece they want to be remodelled.“With my bespoke designs it is much more fun as I can be a bit more creative.“It can be a big responsibility as a lot of the time someone is grieving over the loss of a loved one and they want a piece to remember them by or they want a piece of their loved one’s jewellery reworked.“You can’t change it back, so it can be quite nerve-racking.“I have also incorporated people ashes into designs, so it can be a very emotional journey with my customer.“It is lovely that I can really help customers after the passing of a loved one with a piece that is incredibly sentimental.“The third part is teaching.“I have held workshops since the beginning. I think it makes the pieces more sentimental when someone has made the ring themselves.”After taking the plunge to work on her business full time only a year ago, Scarlett has urged anyone else in the same position to take that leap into self employment.“This business is my life and I love it. It is hard and scary to take that step but I am so glad I did it. I can really put my heart and soul into my pieces now.“I should have done it way sooner.”Scarlett’s workshops allow couples to have a personal touch at their wedding.A growing number of couples are visiting her studios to create their wedding rings – and some of those ready to get down on one knee are even coming to create a bespoke engagement ring for their other half.Scarlett said: “The workshops are incredibly popular and weddings are becoming a lot more DIY with couples wanting to be more hands on.“I love being part of the love story of making their rings.“We also hold hen parties a lot and brides love to come in and make matching silver rings with their bridesmaids.“It is a lot of fun.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people solicitors move up at law firm","story":"\t\t\t\t\tScottish law firm Thorntons has promoted 11 solicitors this month.Two have been promoted to associates and nine have been made senior solicitors across the Dundee, Fife, Perth, Angus and Edinburgh offices.The two new associates are Lynne MacIntyre and Stuart Mackie, and the senior solicitors are Steven Drake, Joanne Clancy, Lynsay McFarlane, Thomas Redpath, Neil Falconer, Megan Sweeney, Chris Gardiner and Anneli Spence.Chairman Colin Graham said: “Training and development is a core part of our growth strategy.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people spar customers raise cash for good causes","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe Spar store on Ballindean Road in the Douglas area of Dundee has been raising funds for a number of local good causes, including Brown Street Kennels, The Crescent in Whitfield and seven-year-old Garvie Winter, who is being treated for leukaemia.Kirsty Laing, from the store, said: “We do quite a lot of different things in the shop to raise money.“We sell a lot of books, mostly for 50p, which are really popular and we also get a lot of little things from customers who want to sell them to raise funds too.

He has fantastic pace and loves to run at defences. He is strong on both feet, and I believe he will excite our fans,” said Csaba.After an unsuccessful spell in the Turkish second tier, Loemba is keen to get going in Scottish football.“I am happy to be with Dundee United, I am excited to play in Scotland and want to bring joy to our fans,” he said.Vastic comes in as United look to complete the final part of their rebuilding process since the end of last season.While Csaba is pleased to have secured the services of strikers Nicky Clark and Craig Curran earlier in the summer, he wants more height in his attack. At well over six feet, the former Blackburn and Bayern Munich kid fits the bill on that score.And, over the next few days, the coaching staff will see if he is up to scratch in terms of his all-round striking ability.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united duo face fitness checks ahead of elgin city clash","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCraig Curran and Callum Booth will face fitness checks before Csaba Laszlo decides his line-up for Dundee United’s Betfred Cup trip to Elgin today.Injury means the pair, regarded as among the most significant of the Tangerines’ summer signings, have hardly been seen in the games played so far.Curran’s only public appearance to date was in the friendly at Brechin earlier this month and he’s been struggling to shake off a dead leg.But Csaba remains hopeful he’ll be ready for next week’s Championship opener with Dunfermline.And, if he’s fit enough to manage 45 minutes at Borough Briggs, it would be a major step in the right direction.Booth, meanwhile, took a knock in the defeat at Ross County last week and that ruled him out of the home tie against Alloa.While the former Partick Thistle full-back’s condition is not causing concern, United would like him to get another game under his belt before the league.In line for debuts could be latest recruits Paul Watson and Yannik Loemba.Watson, who arrived from Falkirk last week, is likely to partner Frederic Frans at the heart of the defence, while wide man Loemba is could be on the wing.Having not played since the turn of the year, the 28-year-old is likely to need a few weeks to get his fitness up to scratch.With qualification out reach for both, all that’s at stake today is avoiding the wooden spoon.Csaba sees this as vital preparation for next week.“Especially before the season begins, I say always this is the most important game for the confidence, just to win,” said Csaba.“You do and you know you can score goals.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee united hand trial to former bayern munich and blackburn rovers star","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo will have a look a player with a strong football pedigree as he tries to add to his attacking options at Dundee United.Today will see Austria Vienna reserve striker Toni Vastic arrive for a trial with the Tangerines.Now 25, Vastic spent time with both Blackburn Rovers and Bayern Munich’s second team in his younger days and also has experience of top flight football in his native Austria.And his father Ivica, though born in Croatia, won 50 caps for Austria between 1996 and 2008 as well as starring for the likes of Strum Graz and Austria Vienna, for whom he is now a youth coach.Csaba did not confirm Vastic is the player he was bringing over but did concede it was a striker from Vienna who is strong in the air and there is no doubt Vastic is that man.It was through the manager’s contacts in central Europe that the deal to bring him over for a tryout was done.“We are working to bring players in. I don’t make any secret that we are bringing someone in from Austria Vienna, a big striker, I can have a look at,” said Csaba.“We are talking with one other player and hope the signings can be made, the deals are done.“I hope by next week we will have a complete team.”United also hope to be boosted by the sight of another new striker, Craig Curran, making his debut when they complete their Betfred Cup campaign at Elgin City this Saturday.Curran was due back in training today after the dead leg that’s sidelined him for the past two weeks.If he completes his work over the next couple of days without suffering a reaction, he will be on duty up north and back on course to be ready for the league kick-off against Dunfermline next week.“We have been working on Craig and, if he is OK, he can get 45 minutes against Elgin and that would be good news.”Defender Callum Booth is another who has been in the wars but could be back on duty at the weekend.The former Partick Thistle man picked up a knock at Ross County last week and missed out against Alloa but could be ready over the next couple of days.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2015/10/glamis-castle-by-John-Ireland-of-Barry-Downs-by-Carnoustie.JPG.jpg ","title":"local castle to mark 40 years of film classic grease with outdoor screening","story":"\t\t\t\t\tGlamis Castle will be celebrating the 40th anniversary of hit movie Grease in style by holding a special outdoor screening.The film – starring John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John – will be shown on an 8x4ft inflatable screen next month.Fans can snap up tickets at £8 for adults and £4 for children and relive the classic movie that first hit the big screen in 1978.Organiser Blue Monkey Events has advised cinema-goers to bring their own chairs.Food and refreshments will be available.Grease, which has grossed $400 million worldwide, follows the trials and tribulations of the T-Birds and the Pink Ladies in the 1950s.The event has already generated a lot of interest as Glamis Castle will be turned into Rydell High for the night.

If we’d played 80 minutes we are the winners,” he said.“It sounds stupid but true. Against Arbroath, after 82 minutes if we put the ball out we keep one zero but we don’t and lose a goal.“In the next game (Ross County), for 80 minutes we made a good game and if we score from our penalty we win. We don’t score from the penalty, then they score and win but we had played a good game.“Then we controlled the game against Alloa but lost a goal, again in the last 10 minutes. So people say we are a bad team. We are not and not everything has been bad.”While he’s confident United will show that in the months ahead, Csaba doesn’t hide his frustration over being out of the Betfred.“We created pressure for the club, for the management, for the players and from the fans.“And we lost a lot of money, let’s be honest. So, I am really unhappy, but I can’t turn this back.“We have to do better. When we have 10 minutes to go and we are in the front, we have to win the game.”Any pressure the past three games has put on him does not, he’s stressed, match the pressure he puts on himself for every outing.“I always have pressure because when we lose I think why did we. For me, there is always the pressure that this is not OK. I think about it all the time and we have to find the solution tactically.”For the manager, that solution lies in getting the right mix between the passing style he prefers and a more direct Scottish approach.“Some people tell me I play too much continental football, we have to play Scottish football, kick the ball more off the front.“We’ll mix, keep the ball down and try to kick the long ball as well but just the long balls won’t be enough.“With Craig Curran injured we have had to use Paul McMullan as a No 9, up beside Nicky Clark sometimes.

It has completely blighted the community and many homes are now unsaleable.\"He said the proposed expansion would bring the substation boundary within 30 yards of the nearest property, and 75 yards of his home.He added: \"SSE refuses to acknowledge any fault or offer compensation of any kind.\"There appears to be no clearly established legal obligation for SSE to compensate, but there is a moral one, considering the substantial financial loss suffered by the residents and the spoiling of a peaceful rural atmosphere.\"He added that the planning authority, Highland Council, has expressed little interest in helping them.Mr Lanning said that in February he was forced to take his house off the market after a year because he could not sell it at \u0026pound40,000 below the market value.The substation began growing to accommodate the Beauly to Denny power line and the new renewable energy sources in the surrounding hills.Pensioner Mr Lanning, who has lived in the glen for 11 years, said: \"The substation has been enlarged about four times.\"There are liaison meetings but they are simply PR exercises.\"This is not just about me.

guards to undertake more of the work done by the porters, and vice versa.\"Equally, nursing is going to be expected to call upon the security guards less frequently and, therefore, do more themselves.\"She added: \"Police Scotland will be looked upon as a resource but their new triaging system will prevent this.\"Portering is literally run off its feet.\"It is covering an average of

complete the lengthy application process in time or find the \u0026pound559 required for a public entertainment licence. She said: \"Everything for kids is so expensive nowadays, I thought we could have some good old fashioned fun on the beach and bring a few families together.\"The idea was for the kids to have an hour

told her she would have to provide formal first aid cover and explain fully how the event would impact other beach users.As Mrs Cowie-Mcinnes had advertised the event on social media and circulated flyers around the town, she was worried she might have to call the whole thing off: \"I was panicking when I got the email through, thinking I might need to cancel it and the kids were already excited.\"There is too much red tape and so many barriers to get through to run an event, people will end up giving up.\"Unsure of how to save the event, she took to the Nairn Rocks social media page to ask people for advice.And as a result, Fochabers firm Saltaire Security offered their services for free and provided a copy of their own public liability insurance certificate to Highland Council.There were also offers to provide lifeguard cover and Nairn Business Improvement District also came forward to say it would help.In the end, Highland Council agreed to waive permission fees.\"It couldn\u0026rsquot have gone ahead without the security company and everyone else who is helping for free,\" said Mrs Cowie-Mcinnes, who has also been delighted at the offers of prizes from local businesses.Weather permitting, the event will now go ahead on Sunday with registration taking place from 10am at Nairn Links for categories ranging from pre-school through to teenagers and

like to see there, and Inverness College UHI design students had input on the concept.She said: \"Children were very involved along with students at the university. Children love jumping from stone to stone and guddling about in water.\"It has all been looked at from the safety point of view, but let\u0027 face it, if you take children to the beach they jump from stone to stone. I think it is a good project and if necessary I will be the first to dip my toe in the water there.\"Inverness city manager David Haas said: \"This has had youth engagement all along and I think it is something that is going to sit well in the environment of a place that will become even more popular as people engage with the river.\"Masterminding the project is Bespoke Atelier, a Glasgow-based design studio.Its design statement, which will be discussed at a planning meeting later this summer, explains the lades and weirs already around the River Ness were used as inspiration. The stones would be patterned, partly to minimise slips and also to reflect foliage patterns from trees growing on the islands.A report from Inverness City Artworks Group states: \"While it was preferable to use natural stone, the cost might prove prohibitive and alternative materials might need to be considered.\"It was also minuted that if concerns were raised regarding the cost of this feature, the high cost of \"providing basic play equipment should be highlighted.\"The group was given assurances that the design would, when completed, look like part of the landscape, and members were told that Bespoke Atelier was confident that all aspects of the design could be met within the available budget.Path improvements in the vicinity are included in the application.Company director Yvonne Elliot-Kellighan said the stepping stone forms envisaged were inspired by the shape of the Ness Islands, and the stones themselves could be engraved with botanical patterns \"creating a ow and connection between stepping stones\".The children\u0027 feature is not far from MY Ness, a \u0026pound300,000 centrepiece which was unveiled as a concept in May and has still to receive planning permission.The River Ness Public Art Project is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).At a time of heightened concern about public spending, Highland Council has stressed that the vast majority of the money for the projects comes from third parties and cannot be used for other purposes, and the council\u0027 \u0026pound106k is from capital investment and not revenue spend.Saturday 28 Jul 2018 6:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116757.jpg","title":"Plans lodged for Inverness Airport hotel","story":"\u0026nbspA NEW hotel just five minutes from Inverness Airport will set the stage for a business boom, it has been claimed.Proposals for a 130-bedroom development to be run by a \"well-known international hotel chain\" on the site of the Inverness Airport Business Park (IABP) have been lodged with Highland Council, months after the idea appeared to receive a somewhat muted response.It was\u0026nbspreported last November how an online video promoting the hotel vision by IABP had attracted barely 300 views over the course of a month.Chairman James Campbell, however, insisted there was a strong case for additional hotel accommodation across Inverness.As the plans were unveiled this week, he said: \"This planning application is further proof of the strength of the local economy and sets the stage for us to welcome more major businesses to IABP.\"The proximity of IABP to Inverness Airport allows businesses to benefit from the airport\u0027 excellent connectivity and international trade routes.\"With record traffic and passenger figures in recent years, Inverness Airport continues to go from strength to strength. A new hotel will play a key role in supporting the local economy\u0027 continued growth.\"Construction work is set to be undertaken by international firm Polcom Developments.Managing director Ross Morrow said: \"The proposed hotel, which will be branded by a well-known international hotel chain, will provide accommodation, meeting and fitness facilities for airport users, overseas visitors and local businesses.\"Polcom Developments has extensive experience in developing airport hotels, having recently been involved in the construction of a 250-bedroom hotel at Luton Airport.\"The firm also recently completed a 160-bedroom Marriott hotel on the Heriot Watt University campus, just a few miles from Edinburgh Airport.A design and access statement submitted to council planners places the hotel within the context of a wider masterplan for the development of the business park which Inverness Chamber of Commerce chief executive Stewart Nicol previously said was \"more slow burn than anybody would want\".It had secured just two tenants between 2011 and last year, before the Co-op also confirmed construction of a new distribution facility there.The site planned for the hotel is currently unoccupied but was previously used for agricultural grazing.Said to be five minutes\u0026rsquo walk from the airport, a new access road will have to be created as part of any development.Inverness economist Tony Mackay previously queried the viability of a hotel at the airport after Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) tendered for a similar development at its Inverness Campus.This week he acknowledged that the fall in the value of the pound after the Brexit vote was continuing to fuel a tourist boom in the Highlands.\"There have been plans for a hotel at Inverness airport for many years but none of them has gone ahead yet,\" he said.\"I think that most of the hotel operators prefer locations in or close to the city centre rather than out at the airport.\"However, it seems that IABP have now found a hotel operator willing to take the risk of the airport location.\"Inverness Airport has done very well in recent years and the hotel investment and jobs should be an excellent addition to the facilities there.\"Inverness Central councillor Bet McAllister also welcomed the plans.\"I think it will be good for tourists and those from further north who need to catch a late or early flight,\" she said.Saturday 28 Jul 2018 6:35 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116838.jpg","title":"Positive buildings discussions","story":"\u0026nbspTALKS with Highland Council about possible changes to the regime of building inspections have been \"very positive\" an MSP has said.Labour Highland member David Stewart is pushing for a change in the law to require building owners to regularly survey their properties.He is being backed by former Inverness provost Jimmy Gray as both raised concerns after incidents across the city including masonry falling from a building in Church Street during strong winds and glass panels shattering above retail park walkways.Mr Stewart said: \"Although councils can act if buildings are deemed dangerous and go on to recoup money from owners if they carry out work, there\u0027s more that can be done to bring in more preventative measures.\"Cllr Gray added: \"It has been obvious to most people involved in building conservation and maintenance and also the wider public that the present legislation is completely inadequate and has created a situation whereby some of our buildings are in a dangerous condition, exposing the public to unacceptable risks.

must score in the Europa League return at Turf Moor on Thursday if they are to progress.The Reds were closing in on a memorable Euro victory over Premier League Burnley until they conceded a late goal.Yet McInnes reckons his squad have the confidence and character to get a result in the second qualifying round second leg.And the Reds gaffer pointed to the 1-0 win over Premiership winners Celtic at Parkhead last season for inspiration of what can be done.He said: “There is a feeling that we can score down there as we had enough good moments in the game to suggest that can be the case.“If we score down there it is game on.“The onus is on us to score obviously but we have scored away from home against good teams before.“We won 1-0 at Celtic Park last time out in front of 60,000 in a high-pressure game.“I have the players who have the confidence and personality to take the challenge on and try to win the game at Turf Moor.“Normally when we have played good opponents in Europe we have had to score that away goal“We created enough and had enough good moments to suggest we can do that again.“We are still in the game.”Aberdeen have secured memorable away victories over Siroki Brijeg (Bosnia), RNK Rijeka (Croatia) and Groningen (Holland) to progress in Europe under McInnes.The Battle of Britain was Aberdeen’s first competitive game of the season and McInnes admits they ran out of steam late on.However he reckons his squad will be even fitter and sharper for the return leg.He said: “The players will take confidence from that performance but they will also be a bit sharper and stronger through the legs for having had that game.“We ran out of legs a wee bit. “That is nothing new because when we have played in Europe, in that first game it is difficult to sustain that levels.“Last season against Siroki we ran our race after about 70 minutes.“Out there (in Bosnia) we were so much better physically because we had that game time in the first leg.“That game against Burnley is worth two weeks of training as you cannot replicate that through friendlies or training.“We will be that step closer in terms of fitness and where we want to be.”The Red Army honoured Gothenburg Great Neale Cooper, who sadly recently passed away, with a magnificent display and banner before kick-off.McInnes said: “You saw Aberdeen in its full splendour.“A packed Pittodrie with a great display for a great man at the start of the game.”McInnes revealed he had to pitch new signing Tommie Hoban in at left back at short notice after Andy Considine was ruled out through sickness less than three hours before kick-off.Hoban had only completed a loan move from Premier League Watford on the eve of the Burnley clash.McInnes said: “Tommie Hoban did brilliant considering he was told at 5 o’clock he was playing left back as Considine was ill.“These sort of things are there to test us but we equipped ourselves very well against a very good team who I have a high regard for.”Aberdeen took an early lead through a penalty converted by Gary Mackay-Steven and were closing in a vital victory.However Welsh international Sam Vokes came off the bench to net a leveller with 10 minutes remaining.“We set out to win the game and I am disappointed we didn’t when I see the effort the boys put in,” said McInnes.“For our first competitive game the standard of play was really good from us and we had organisation and carried a threat.“Burnley were excellent in terms of asking questions of us in the second half.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"1300luxury living for the

squirrels has been ongoing in the UK ever since our ancestors introduced the grey species from North America in 1870s.With the species competing for resources and the greys carrying squirrel-pox virus, which is harmless to them but lethal to reds, the contest seemed to be tipped in the greys\u0026#8217 favour.But in nature such rivalry is likely to be influenced by more complex interactive networks than just two species. Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

His problems did not end there, though, as injury also ruled out Gordon Whyte, Thomas Whyte and Dunky Kerr although the latter was stripped as Kyles only substitute, while Robbie MacLeod was unavailable.Caberfeidh manager Jodi Gorski had Ally MacLennan back but he was also short of players, with Jamie Matheson and Colin MacLennan among his absentees and they lined-up with the Cabers with the second team.Kyles settled into the game with a goal on four minutes. There was a scramble in the goal area where Colin MacDonald fought for possession with Caberfeidh keeper Ewen Pilcher and defender Blair Morrison, and it was actually Luke Thornton who got the final touch to put the hosts ahead.Luke Thornton got Kyles and his second on eight minutes. Sandy MacKenzie played the ball across from the left wing forward position to Luke Thornton who smashed a shoulder-high volley past the Cabers keeper from 15 yards.Kevin Bartlett made it 2-1 on 13 minutes when he latched onto a loose ball in defence and carried the ball forward before thumping it past John Whyte from a central position.However Kyles restored their two-goal cushion on 42 minutes to make it 3-1 at the break. Former Skye Camanachd player Neil MacVicar, playing in attack, switched play from right wing forward to Sandy MacKenzie at left wing forward and he rifled the ball past keeper Pilcher from 18 yards.Grant Irvine got in on the act on 55 minutes. A ball forward from midfield was brought out of the air by Colin MacDonald, who slipped it out to the right wing forward position to the onrushing Grant Irvine, who swept the ball across the keeper into the right-hand side of the net.Sandy MacKenzie put gloss on the win with a rather fortuitous effort on 62 minutes. MacKenzie turned full back Blair Morrison and as keeper Pilcher came out to clear the ball, it rebounded off MacKenzie into the net.Donald Irvine was superb for Kyles, while Grant Irvine was an instrumental figure at full centre.Caberfeidh did not perform at the levels seen when they took shinty’s top flight by surprise in the earlier part of this season.\u0026nbspMarine Harvest South Division 1Title hopefuls the Kyles Athletic second team march on, beating Ballachulish 1-0 at the Jubilee Park.Balla’s Cain MacPhee was free of a one-match ban, while Kyles were without Luke Thornton who was on first team duty.The only goal of the game came on 19 minutes and it was a superb strike from Martin MacFadyen whose 25 yard piledriver from the middle of the park gave the keeper no chance.Balla’ had the chance to level on 35 minutes when referee Callum Duff awarded them a penalty, penalising a \u0026#8216kick\u0026#8217 inside the D.Lorne Brown took the penalty and he struck the ball well enough but his effort was superbly saved by Kyles keeper Douglas Nicolson. It was one of a number of great stops by the Kyles custodian.Kyles have a five point lead on second place Bute although they have played a game more.Bute 4 Bute scored three times in the final third of the game to defeat Aberdour 4-1 in their 12.30pm throw up at The Meadows.Bute’s Craig MacKay was unavailable as he served the second game of a two-match suspension.Aberdour travelled without Cameron McCue and David McDougal.James Craig gave Bute the lead after just five minutes and that proved to be the only goal of a tight first 45 minutes during which Bute goalie Kevin Queen saved well from David MacKenzie, tipping his effort over the bar.Referee Robert Baxter pointed to the penalty spot when Ruairidh Reid was wiped out inside the D, taking a stick across the knees, when he looked set to equalise. Angus Thorburn struck the penalty well but Kevin Queen made a brilliant save to keep his side in front.The visitors were awarded a second penalty shortly after when Roddy MacColl was felled inside the box. Angus Thorburn stepped up again but this time he did not catch the ball as he would have liked and his effort went past the post.The penalty misses were a blow for Aberdour and Bute took advantage and, with some good running and quick passing, they went on to score three more times.Robert Walker made it 2-0 on 65 minutes and Iain McDonald added a third with 15 minutes remaining.Chris Lawrence made it 4-0 on 80 minutes, although there was some consolation for Aberdour when Ruairidh Reid finished well a couple of minutes later. Angus Thorburn battled to get the ball to Reid and his powerful strike from just outside the D gave the keeper no chance.Bute were sharper on the day and they deserved the win but the final scoreline was a little harsh on Aberdour in what was only their second league defeat of the season.Bute now leap-frog Aberdour into second place in the league on goal difference and the Islanders have a game in hand.Kilmory 1 MacRae Park was in perfect condition to host the local derby between Kilmory and the Inveraray second team.A large crowd gathered to watch two teams filled with youth and experience.Kilmory started with top scorer Alister MacArthur in defence and they had young Andrew Innes up-front, supported by the more experienced Hal Jones.Inveraray went with a mature forward line which included Euan McMurdo, John MacKenzie and Neil Campbell but their back five were all aged under 18.But it was across the centre line where all the action happened in the first half.Referee Alex MacVicar had a busy afternoon and David Macpherson was first into the book for a cynical challenge on Sandy Leiper.It wasn’t long before Leiper joined him, yellow carded for a late swing on his fellow winger, young Ruaraidh Graham.Duncan MacBrayne was next to fall foul of the official for persistent fouling.In-between all the yellow cards, Alister MacArthur was dictating the play from the Kilmory defence, with young Hamish MacLennan doing the same for Inveraray and the first half ended scoreless.Inveraray came out the traps the quickest in the second half. A long range effort from David Macpherson was easily saved by the Kilmory keeper, but Neil Campbell was quickest to react and slot the rebound home to open the scoring on 48 minutes.Inveraray added a quick second following a well-worked set-piece routine on 56 minutes. Euan McMurdo’s free-hit found Campbell Watt, whose movement caused the Kilmory defence problems all afternoon, and he made 2-0 with fine finish.The goal sparked life into Kilmory who pulled one back on 65 minutes when Hal Jones blasted home an unstoppable shot from the edge of the penalty area to make it 2-1 and it was game on.After getting themselves back in the game, Kilmory’s discipline let them down soon after, with both Duncan MacBrayne and Sandy Leiper receiving their marching orders from referee MacVicar within minutes of one another.Inveraray capitalised on their two-man advantage and former Kilmory player David MacAllister scored his first goal for his new club on 69 minutes to make it 3-1.Euan McMurdo finished the day’s scoring off with a well-constructed goal to make it 4-1 with 15 minutes remaining.Inveraray will be happy with their league first win of the season, while Kilmory will be disappointed with the result and the fact that they will be missing two influential players over the weeks to come.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"graham love is leaving macpool","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/07/18, 2:20 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowGraham Love is moving on from Lochgilphead\u0026#8217s MacPool at the end of July.MacPool will be looking to recruit a new pool manager after the summer.

Entrants will then head east towards the village and then north on the A83 before turning left at the junction with the B8024 on to a single track road.This is where the fun begins, with a steady climb for about 2kms before the fast descent into Achahoish and the beginning of wonderful scenery as the loop continues along the shores of Loch Caolisport.The breathtaking views to Jura, Islay and Gigha demand a quick stop for a photograph. There will be a feed station at approximately the half way mark.The route continues through Kilberry, heading east, with some short sharp climbs and sweeping descents, before following the coast of West Loch Tarbert north, passed the Tarbert Golf Club, before a left turn at the junction with the A83 and back to Tarbert and the finish.The loop is suitable for road bikes  the road surface is variable but generally reasonable, and there are a few steep descents, so some caution is required.The club spokesperson continued: \u0026#8216We are hopeful we\u0026#8217ll get more than 50 entrants on the start line, so please sign up.

It was difficult to hold the bottom at times, however, we managed to hook into dab, plaice, grey gurnard, haddock and a good haul of thornback rays to bring our species tally for the day to five.All in all a decent day’s fishing given the rough conditions. We returned to harbour a tad battered and soaking wet.Day two was almost as windy as the first day, however the rain kept away which was a bonus.Conditions were still far too rough for fishing the deep so we started off on the soft ground for flats but the spurdogs had other ideas. Everywhere we went \u0026#8211 singles, doubles, trebles \u0026#8211 there was just no getting away from them despite Robbie’s best efforts.I have never seen so many chunky spurs, with the best of the day tipping the scales at 14lbs 8oz.Needless to say a fair number of rigs were wrecked, leads snagged and lost on the rough ground, and quite a few fish dropped. On the plus side there were a few PBs and a couple of new club records set.In between the spur attacks, we picked up a few decent dab, plaice, cod, grey gurnard, red gurnard and coalfish (coalies) to take our species count for the day to eight.Despite the rough and tumble we enjoyed the trip and the opportunity to catch some decent fish. Hopefully the weather will be kinder next year and we’ll get to drop a line out in the deep water marks which hold so many more species.The combined scores over two days:Nikki Thompson 185%***********************It was no surprise to find ourselves fishing in the pouring rain yet again. We don’t seem to have much luck weatherwise, but at least it was relatively calm out of Oban with only the slightest breeze.We headed out on board the ‘Laura Dawn’ in search of fresh bait but despite several drifts the mackerel eluded us.With the big tides, skipper Ronnie suggested we fish the rough ground and reefs for pollack and coalies. The plan was to play around here until the tide eased off enough to drop the anchor.It was pretty desperate though with only a few miniscule whiting to show for our efforts. The incredibly rough ground and fast drift were challenging to say the least and most of us left a fair amount of tackle and lead stuck fast to the seabed.Enough was enough, so we decided to head for deeper water and anchor up even though the tide was still pretty strong, resulting in some horrendous tangles.It proved to be a sensible move from a fishing point of view though, with reasonable sized spurs hooked on the very first drop. More spurs, spotty dogs and a couple of bonus thornbacks were taken throughout the afternoon.It was nip and tuck right to the end with just one fish separating the top three placing.Final scores:\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"rock from rest and be thankful be reused in new project","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 26/07/18, 12:26 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA new innovative method to help mitigate against potential landslips is being rolled out in Glen Kinglas near the Rest and be Thankful.The ongoing £1.84 million catch-pit works at the Rest and be Thankful involve digging and constructing three large ‘pits’ at the bottom of the slope that are designed to collect materials and run-off from a potential slip. The project has produced around 18,000 tonnes of usable rock, which has been stored temporarily, and designs have now been completed to reuse this material as additional protection for the A83.The material will be used in the construction of landslip mitigation bunds above streams along Glen Kinglas, some three to four miles from the Rest and Be Thankful. These bunds will form a constructed embankment of material initially across six individual water channels next to the roadside that geotechnical engineers have assessed to have the potential to deposit debris onto the trunk road should a landslip occur. The bunds will reduce the risk of debris reaching the roadside.The bunds will be up to 10 metres high in some sections and have the combined capacity to contain over 1,000 tonnes of debris should a landslip occur.Teams from BEAR Scotland have been working closely with the landowner and specialist sub-contractor to develop this sustainable approach to protecting the A83 for the long-term benefit of users of this important route.This sustainable method allows BEAR Scotland to maximise the benefit of the material being excavated from the Rest and be Thankful while minimising the overall cost of these works to the public purse via these projects which are being funded by Transport Scotland and the Scottish Government.As the works are focussed initially within six watercourse channels there will be short lengths of traffic management for approximately two to four weeks in each location. The A83 will remain open but it will be necessary for temporary traffic signals to be in place for the safety of road workers and road users.  The project will move in phases along this stretch of the A83 as the works progress.Real time journey information is available from Traffic Scotland on their website: trafficscotland.org\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert golf club is looking for players","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 26/07/18, 12:32 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowSort that swing because Tarbert Golf Club is holding its James Mundell Memorial gents open.On Sunday August 5 players will compete at Glenralloch for various gross and net prizes between £20 and £60 and, of course, for the coveted James Mundell Memorial trophy.So book your place for a chance to win.Tee off times are 7.50am to 9.10am, 10.45am to 12.05pm or 1.40pm to 2.50pm.To book, call 01880 820565 and entry fees are £15.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"teenie takes the title in myargyll","story":"\t\tSandy NeilUpdated: 26/07/18, 9:24 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA competition capturing #myargyll has been won by Teenie Wilson, an amateur photographer on the Isle of Lismore, who took this stunning image before an evening’s fishing at Port Ramsay, as the sun set over Glensanda quarry in Morvern.The competition, run in in association with Wyvex Media and Argyll and the Isles Tourism Co-operative, sought to recognise why you think our region is such a fantastic place to live, work and visit through photography, video and prose.Teenie, who runs the Lismore Post office and shop with her husband David, took up the hobby, which they share, two years ago.‘I love it,’ she said: ‘It gets me out.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kilmarnock man who lifelong alcohol","story":"NewsKilmarnock man who has had lifelong alcohol struggle shares heartbreaking story and says: \"I don\u0027t want my grandson seeing me drunk every day\"At his worst Andrew from Kilmarnock could drink a bottle of vodka per day, on top of 10 or 15 pints of beer.Share\u0026nbspByDavid Wren12:25, 27 JUL 2018NewsAndrew has struggled with drink his whole life (picture posed by model)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email“I’ve got a daughter and a grandson, I don’t want them seeing me drunk everyday,” says Andrew, who has struggled with alcohol for most of his adult life. At his worst, the 59-year-old from Kilmarnock – who has asked for his surname to be withheld – could drink a bottle of vodka per day, on top of 10 or 15 pints of beer. His situation was desperate, with the alcohol numbing the pain of crippling mental health issues he has suffered from for years. Andrew spoke out after it was revealed in last week’s Kilmarnock Standard that there were 48 alcohol-related deaths at Crosshouse Hospitalin 2017/18, an increase from 38 in the previous year. Illnesses and injuries related to alcohol which have been treated at the facility have also gone up, with NHS Ayrshire and Arran aiming to tackle the problem.  Andrew said: “I’ve been drinking repeatedly for 25 years. I used to drink a litre of vodka a day and roughly four litres per week. “I’d maybe have 10 or 15 pints of beer a day as well. I sought help from various organisations which didn’t help. “I’ve been struggling with my mental health over the years too. The main reason I’ve been hitting the drink is because of my mental health and I can’t get any help.” His battles with drink and mental health have led Andrew to dark places and he has attempted suicide twice. A chaotic lifestyle where he has had brushes with the law over the years also played a part in his mindset, as well as an incident in his late teens where a gun was put to his head. The terrifying ordeal, Andrew says, “wasted my head” and he continues to have flashbacks. It started off his spiralling issues with anxiety and depression which have plagued his life and repeatedly led him back to alcohol. After one suicide attempt, Andrew said that he was told to quit his vodka habit and did so overnight. But the consequences of going cold turkey led to a mild stroke the following day. Battles with his health have continued over the years, meaning he is now on 17 tablets a day just to help his body function. Andrew doesn’t consider himself an alcoholic, but admits he has struggled with drink for most of his life. He also claims that he’s struggled to access help for his mental health issues. He said: “I’ve been to various organisations and they hunt me. “They take the name and address, say they’ll contact you – then nothing.  “So I go to drink and that solves the mental health problems. “But it actually triggers it. Sometimes it eases me and it’s a bit back to front. “These mental health organisations have no money, no funds and the NHS is in a terrible state. “The only people I can rely on are the Ayrshire Council on Alcohol down in Ayr. “I’m not an alcoholic, I’ve just got a problem with drink. “I don’t like being called an alcoholic, I’m just a normal guy that needs help.” The Ayrshire Council on Alcohol have helped him work on his problem with drink. Although on a long road to recovery, Andrew’s drinking has decreased. But, even though the alcohol counselling helps, he admits he’s desperate to tackle his mental health issues. He said: “I’m down to drinking four days a week now, before I would have been seven. The ACA have helped me, I would recommend them to anybody. “They explain the circumstances and give you a target to achieve over a period. They don’t want you to come off of it straight away. “It maybe goes from seven days to five and so on.” He continued: “In a day I’ll maybe drink 15 pints. That used to be every day but now I’ve cut it down to four. “It’s a lot of beer. It’s very hard to say the effect the alcohol has on me. “My main issue is the mental health, the anxiety and depression, my head’s wasted.” Having been in the habit of drinking every day for so long, Andrew removes himself from the dangers of binging when his days away from alcohol come around.   He goes on day trips across Ayrshire to keep him away from the lure of  the pub, which Andrew admits he would struggle to resist if he was just hanging around Kilmarnock town centre.  Although he lives himself, Andrew says he doesn’t drink in the house and bottles of booze stay untouched in his home. The social aspect of the pub, he says, is the lure for him as he seeks the company it brings. Andrew believes he can quit drink – but admits his mental health constantly brings him back to square one as he looks for a life away from alcohol. He says the ACA is saving his life with their support and he hopes continued work with the organisation can help him to live a healthy life. “At times I was just desperate, thinking ‘why live?’” said Andrew. “But I’ve got a grandson now, a daughter, so it gives me something to look forward to in the future. “Hopefully one day I can come off the drink. “Never say never – it’s my ambition.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrKilmarnockAlcoholCrosshouse"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"mayboles christmas celebrations in jeopardy","story":"NewsMaybole\u0027s Christmas celebrations in jeopardyThe community association organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day.Share\u0026nbspByAyrshire Post11:18, 25 JUL 2018NewsMaybole Christmas lights switch on (Image: David Kiltie)Get daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThe town’s Christmas celebrations will be in the ice box this year after a community group agreed to freeze itself for six months. Maybole Community Association will not meet again until January, by which time the festive fun will be over. The group organises a Christmas lights switch-on ceremony, as well the summer gala day. But members could not form a committee at an extraordinary general meeting (EGM). A statement issued after the meeting states: “Following the EGM held by Maybole Community Association on Thursday, July 12, 2018, regrettably no one came forward at the meeting prepared to be an office bearer, knowing that the present committee were standing down. “The decision was therefore made at the meeting for all activities of the association to be frozen and put on hold for a minimum period of six months and a maximum of 12 months and will be reviewed again at that time. “No business will be conducted during that timescale. This decision means that there will be no Christmas lights switch-on and potentially no gala next year.” Outgoing chairperson Senga Mason had been in her role for three years and took over after a similar committee crisis.  She said: “People didn’t come forward for the main committee roles and there’s far greater pressures on people’s time now than there was 40 years ago.” Mrs Mason’s connection to the group, founded in 1975, goes back to 1978. Maybole Gala Days in days gone by featured lorry floats and impressive bunting displays across the High Street. But Mrs Mason pointed out: “Health and safety rules meant the end of using lorries, which in any case are normally needed 24/7 by operators. “Even for simple things like bunting you need permits and a cherry picker to put it up. “Rules are in place for a reason and we have to abide by them.” Community association members are also upset at what they saw as unfair criticisms made on social media following this year’s Maybole Gala Day on June 9. A switch-on ceremony in Maybole can only now be saved if another group of volunteers steps forward. If the community association decides to wind up in January its assets - cash, tables, chairs and gazebos - would be dispersed to other groups in the town.

And, of course, the youngsters enjoyed being pictured with Ayr’s own sporty star Michael, who brought along the League 1 trophy.

And reader Brian Cassells snapped this image of the creature from the deep. “I’d never seen anything like it before,” said Brian, who was out walking with wife Julie and their two small pet dogs. “At first I thought it must be part of a fishing net, or some kind of rope from a boat. “But then, looking closer at it, it was more like a giant version of those little bones you see when you open a tin of salmon.” Aircraft mechanic Brian, 55, also noted what looked like the remains of a large fin on the sea monster. The carcass was in the water when he first spotted it. But he got a better look on a return walk, two days later. “It had started to break up a bit,” said Brian. “But I got a chance to pace out a rough measurement on dry land.  “And I reckon it was at least 20 feet long.” The Post passed on Brian’s pictures to Girvan-based David Bova, a retired Marine Scotland scientist. David, 61, said: “The images suggest the remains of a basking shark. “Shark skeletons are cartilage rather than bone, and this looks to be the case here.” David explained that basking sharks tend to be seasonal visitors to the Firth of Clyde, feeding on plankton bloom. The gentle giants can grow to over 30ft long, and weigh several tons. “I haven’t seen one so far this summer,” said David, who is regularly out on the waters around Ailsa Craig. Brian was interested to hear David’s opinion, and agrees with his view that the skeleton was more like cartilage than bone. “We kept Daisy (Bichon Frise) and Millie (Cavachon) well away anyway!” he joked.

And United proved that underdogs can upset the odds by finishing sixth and leaving Aberdeen, Dundee United, Dundee and St Johnstone in their wake. It was a stunning effort but McSherry, who was signed by Ally MacLeod on a free from Kilmarnock, reckons Ayr can once again confound the pundits and enjoy a great season. United kick off the league at home to Partick Thistle on August 4 and midfielder turned publican McSherry expects them to be up for the challenge. He said: “Consolidation should be the aim but there is no reason why Ayr can’t rise again and enjoy the good times that we enjoyed in the 70s.” An old team picture that surfaced in McSherry’s Wee Windaes got punters rewinding the years and reliving past glories. It was taken at the start of season 1975-76 and showed Ayr in their change kit of Barcelona strips. Proudly standing tall are, back row – Davie Wells, Alex McAnespie, Ally MacLean, Hugh Sproat, Rikki Fleming, John Murphy. Middle row – Alex Ingram, Gerry Phillips, Johnny Graham, Johnny Doyle, Hugh Cameron, Jim McSherry. Front row – John Dickson, Danny MacDonald, Davie McCulloch.   Jim recalled: “No one could work out why the team weren’t in their usual black and white if it was an official  team picture.  “We were also puzzled why there were 15 players in it, including two goalkeepers. “Then one of my regulars, Stephen Robb, came up with the answer – it was taken before a pre-season friendly.  “We wore it in a 7-2 defeat at home to Celtic and it was never seen  again. I think it was binned as a bad omen.  “These were good times at Ayr and the team was loaded with some great players. “We were the only part-time team in the Top Ten and were quoted at 66/1, which seemed about right given the teams we were up against. “I remember Ally signing me on the wall at Central Station and then telling me to look out my passport. “He told me ‘You’re going on tour to Canada next week’. It was quite a start to my Ayr career.” Only three months into that season, Ally was lured to Aberdeen and replaced at the helm by Alex Stuart who quickly appointed McSherry as captain. Ayr sealed safety with a last-day 2-1 win over Motherwell, who were bossed by Willie McLean and Craig Brown. Gerry Phillips got a dramatic late winner to spark euphoric scenes at a packed Somerset. The second season of top-flight football saw Ayr again more than hold their own.  They finished eighth in the table on 30 points, three ahead of Hearts and a distant 13 more than rock-bottom  rivals Kilmarnock.  Season 1977-78 marked Ayr’s third campaign in the top flight, a remarkable achievement considering they stayed part-time. Robert Connor, Ian McAllister, Derek McCutcheon and Iain Sim were called up from Ayr United Boys’ Club. But Ayr were always up against it and their life in the Premier League ended when they finished second-bottom on 24 points and were relegated along with Clydebank. Now as a new league season beckons with renewed optimism and a totally full-time structure, it’s time to dream again.

Ayr United head to Firhill to take on Partick Thistle today knowing that a win will be enough to top the group and put them into the hat for the knockout stages. The Honest Men beat Morton 3-1 in their first group game before beating Albion 2-0 on Saturday. McCall’s side then hammered Stenhousemuir 5-0 at Somerset Park on Tuesday. And McCall, who will head to his old stomping ground on Saturday, said: “It’s a good game against a team in the same league as us. “They are fancied to be challenging for the league title, so it will be a good gauge for us to see where we are at. “I don’t think the game will have any similarities to the league opener though, but if there is a place up for grabs in the last 16 then we are going to go for it.” The Betfred Cup format has come under scrutiny from a number of players and managers involved in the game.  But McCall has gone against the grain and offered his support for the group stage style. He said: “I think it’s good and I like it. “I like the games that actually mean something, rather than meaningless friendlies which I hate. “With this format it means you only need three pre season friendlies. “And we have done well in the opening couple of games so that momentum will hopefully stick with us going into the league campaign.” Ross Docherty has been back in full training for the past week, with Chris Higgins set to join back up with the squad next week. •The Ayr United open day will take place this Sunday from 12pm. Fans are welcome to join the party at Somerset where they can meet their heroes amidst a whole host of fun events. The players and managers will be there along with a Stagedoor BBQ, Mancini’s ice cream and a kids v adults match to soak in, plus plenty of more fun activities.

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

roads last year \u0026ndash a 7.7% rise from 29,692,300 in 2013.\nThe organisation has warned that England is facing a \u0026ldquogrowing congestion crisis, with \u0026ldquoroad space increasing by just 0.6% (1,119 miles) over the same period.\nThere are now 170 vehicles per mile of road, compared to 158 five years ago, it said.\nCouncillor Martin Tett, LGA transport spokesman, said: \u0026ldquoEngland\u0026rsquos roads are currently gripped by a growing congestion crisis.\n\u0026ldquoVery few journeys begin and end on a motorway or trunk road, yet government funding on the strategic road network is 52 times higher than for local roads.\n\u0026ldquoSpending more on improving our national roads will only serve to speed vehicles up between increased delays and congestion on local roads.\nThe LGA, which represents 370 councils in England and Wales, said UK drivers wasted an average of 31 hours in rush-hour traffic last year, at a cost of \u0026pound1,168 to each motorist.\nIt is calling on the Government to reinvest two pence per litre of existing fuel duty for local roads maintenance and to help deal with a \u0026pound9.3 billion backlog of repairs.\nMr Tett added: \u0026ldquoCouncils are working hard to combat traffic and congestion but need to be able to do more to tackle this growing problem.\nEarlier this month, it was revealed that motorists were attempting to avoid gridlocked urban roads by switching to longer, rural routes.\nData from the Department for Transport found that traffic levels on Britain\u0026rsquos urban A roads had fallen by 1%

More of the same please.It was a good day for the Argyll favourites. A positive start which should continue at Kintyre Park against Pollock under 19s tomorrow with a 2pm kick off.

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.  The reporter is due to visit Cockenzie on Monday as part of her investigation into the application."},{"url":null,"title":"the-rahs-make-waves-across-the-world","story":"  The band, from Prestonpans, released their latest single Survival through their independent platform EH32 Records last week and have been thrilled by the response it has received.

Walter, who lived in Prestonpans with Janet, was just 60 when he died. He had been diagnosed with the disease only 29 days earlier.

Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.  Michael Johnson of Nottinghamshire created \u0026lsquoThe Mussel\u0026rsquo with input from local schoolchildren, and its installation was recently highlighted in the Courier. He has been making artworks for public places since 1991 and has now completed more than 180 commissions for both rural and urban sites throughout the UK and Ireland.

East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Arts Service formed a working group to select and commission artists to create the new public artwork. The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.

The early proposals, which will be unveiled to the public later this year, show about 300 homes, with a quarter of those being affordable.  Included in the plans are provision for roads and drainage infrastructure, off-site road improvements, as well as land being set aside for play areas and open space.  The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.  The public exhibition will give both housebuilders the opportunity to share their proposals for the development with members of the public and other interested parties, and for feedback to be passed to the developer.  A detailed planning application is expected later this year.

Now her sister Susan Gibson, along with daughters Laura Burgess and Elaine Macrae, will be joined by nieces Clare Furze and Kara Wallace and granddaughters Ciara Burgess and Isla Burgess in the running-themed fundraisers.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.

The trip, which costs about $50,000, is an eight-day creative expedition and will result in experiences, observations and documentation transformed into an exhibition in 2020.

The announcement comes after another incident at the park saw goalposts broken and scorch marks left on the 3G and 2G pitches.  The park, which is home to various football teams, has been the victim of numerous attacks but the latest, earlier this month, led to calls on social media for security to be tightened up there.  Two summers ago the park was hit twice by vandals in two weeks, again during July, with the \u0026lsquopie hut\u0026rsquo broken into and items stolen, as well as damage caused to the pitches and surrounding area.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoBoth the council and enjoyleisure are in talks about the possibility of introducing CCTV at Foresters Park so a decision will be taken on that in due course and local councillors will be kept updated.  \u0026ldquoWe are aware that Foresters Park has unfortunately suffered some vandalism so the council\u0026rsquos Safer Communities Team continues to ensure that patrols cover the area regularly.  Earlier this month it was claimed on social media that young female players had been subjected to harassment from males as they trained at the park however, no formal complaints about any incident have been made to the council or police.  A council spokesperson added: \u0026ldquoWhile we are aware of vandalism issues, we have not been made aware of allegations of female players being harassed during training. If this is the case it would obviously be of concern so we will look into this as a matter of urgency.  Police Scotland said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove been made aware of a number of incidents which have taken place in the Foresters Park area of Tranent recently, including vandalisms to the football pitch and break-ins to a catering facility.  \u0026ldquoThis behaviour is completely unacceptable and local officers are committed to working with East Lothian Council and enjoyleisure to prevent further incidents and deter anti-social behaviour.

The plans went before by the council\u0026rsquos planning committee in March last year but members agreed to delay a decision while consideration was given towards improvements being carried out at the junction of the A199 and B1407.  But the developer opted to go straight to appeal and Christopher Warren, a reporter appointed by the Scottish Ministers, gave an indication that the plans would be approved towards the end of November last year.  Now he has issued a final decision, which allows 93 houses and 20 flats to be built on land beside Orchardfield.  Gerry More, managing director of Stewart Milne Homes Central Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThe sensitively designed new homes planned for East Linton will have a mix of 19 individual home styles, with house prices set to appeal to a wide range of buyers, from first-time buyers through to growing families.  \u0026ldquoOur vision is to create a series of new communities in East Lothian that incorporate traditional values and features from historical East Lothian towns and villages.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos encouraging that this vision is being shared and supported by the local authority.  \u0026ldquoWith substantial investment planned for landscaping, design and placemaking, The Orchard in the market town of East Linton is set to be a prime example of Stewart Milne Homes\u0026rsquo innovative approach to creating unique, sustainable and aspirational communities.  Thirty-one objections were lodged with the council\u0026rsquos planning department ahead of councillors considering the plans last year.  Dunpender Community Council raised concerns that the development was \u0026ldquotoo large-scale and building so many new homes at once would \u0026ldquoput undue pressure on existing services and infrastructure both within East Linton and in the wider area.  Ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire, who is also the chairman of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee, said: \u0026ldquoObviously we as a council support the development \u0026ndash it is part of the Local Development Plan. However, we did have concerns regarding the entrance into East Linton and we had hoped to have made improvements to that entrance.  \u0026ldquoHowever, Stewart Milne Homes have now got consent.  \u0026ldquoWe can still try to negotiate with the company to see if improvements can be made to the entrance.  \u0026ldquoMy preference would be a roundabout, like we have on the eastern side of East Linton, but that might be difficult now they have got consent but we will still negotiate to try to make improvements for access in and out of East Linton.  \u0026ldquoIt is a fast road and cars come down that hill and try to make a left turn into East Linton.  The councillor added: \u0026ldquoI think there is potential for an accident blackspot.  Mr Hampshire described East Linton as \u0026ldquoa very attractive village and noted the development would fund an extension to its primary school.  Of the 93 houses, 64 would be detached, 16 semi-detached and 13 terraced.  In terms of size, two of the proposed 93 houses would contain two bedrooms, 33 would contain three bedrooms, 36 would contain four bedrooms and 22 would contain five bedrooms.  Eighty-five of the houses would be for sale, with 28 affordable housing units, which would be a mix of two different house types and one and two-bedroom flats."},{"url":null,"title":"whats-on-at-scotlands-national-airshow-2018-on-saturday","story":"  Final preparations are under way for the event, which will see the acrobatic squad perform a new Centenary Split manoeuvre, specially introduced into their 2018 display to mark this year\u0026rsquos 100th anniversary of the RAF.

However, his former employers at BAE, which owns the yard, dropped the idea as the UK Government scaled back and slowed down a much-mooted order for the Royal Navy\u0026rsquos next generation of frigates.  Now Mr Sweeney says new thinking on shipbuilding in Whitehall could see the structure built after all.  The MP - citing anonymous briefings - said the \u0026ldquoaspiration of officials would be to have two main UK production centres for fighting ships, each with a long-term commitment of orders.  The first such base would be the Clyde, which would be expected to churn out vessels - both complex Type 26 frigates already on order and a future replacement of T ype 45 destroyers - using the same basic hull.    Scotstoun yard where frigate factory was planned  Such a long-term commitment, he said, should enable BAE Systems to invest in the kind of covered dock hall where such vessels could be made away from Glasgow\u0026rsquos rain and wind for decades to come.  Mr Sweeney said: \u0026ldquoIt is important that BAE seeks that sort of long-term commitment from the MoD that would give it the confidence to look at investment in a facility like the so-called frigate factory.  A single factory - as opposed to the current arrangements across both the Scotstoun and Govan yards - should cut the unit costs of every ship it makes. It would also create new capacity on the Clyde for other work.  The MoD this week shelved a competition for another, cheaper kind of frigate, a type 31 for which the Upper Clyde yards cannot compete because of capacity issues.  Rival bids for this work - originally assumed to be heading to the Upper Clyde - would include potential multi-site manufacturing in England and Scotland.  Mr Sweeney said\u0026nbspType 31s could be made at sites such as Cammell Laird at Mersey or Rosyth on the Forth. Such vessels are designed for what the navy calls constabulary duties - fighting pirates or providing aid - rather than a full-on war with the navies of a modern state. But they nevertheless \u0026ldquopack a punch, said Mr Sweeney and have export potential.  But Type 31s may well end up being sold as \u0026ldquonearly new after a few years of service in the Royal Navy, meaning a buyer state would avoid any snagging issues.  He said: \u0026ldquoThat would maintain a constant production of the 31e. So the aspiration is to continuously produce two standard classes of ships for the Royal Navy.  Mr Sweeney, however, remains concerned that what he described as Tory \u0026ldquocutthroat competition for orders between yards would scupper a revival.    Paul Sweeney congratuled as he is elected in 2017  Britain currently has 19 major fighting ships. It needs 24 to meet its international and domestic commitments, according to current thinking.  BAE did not comment on whether it could renew its frigate factory plan. The company did, however, echo MOD messaging that Type 26 orders secured shipbuilding on the Clyde for 20 years."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/7441974.jpg?type=article-full","title":"donald-campbells-bluebird-to-fly-again-in-scotland","story":"  But now the Bluebird K7, which propelled the adventurer Donald Campbell to seven world records, is to take to the water once more.  After a 17-year project to restore the jet-engined hydroplane after lifting in from the depths of Coniston Water in the Lake District, engineer Bill Smith will bring the Bluebird to the Isle of Bute for trials next week.  It is the first time the superspeed craft has been put back into action since it was raised in 2001, and more than half a century since Campbell\u0027s final, fatal attempt to break the world water speed record.  The daredevil, the only person to hold both the world land and water speed records simultaneously, lost his life on 4 January 1967 when the Bluebird crashed during his second attempt to break his own record, flipping over as it reached speeds of 320 mph and sinking beneath the waves.  The craft was eventually recovered in 2001, and it has taken almost 20 painstaking years and a small army of dedicated volunteers to restore the Bluebird to her former glory.    The Bluebirn in full flight on Coniston  From 4th to 16th August, the iconic craft will undertaking crew training on Bute\u0027s Loch Fad, although it will be moving at a considerably slower pace than it did in its creator\u0027s day.  Project leader Mr Smith has had a love of Bute since fishing trips as a teenager and then later as a diver. He said: \"Loch Fad is perfect for this crew-training exercise.  \"It\u0027s just long enough for Bluebird to get moving and just deep enough that it won\u0027t be too difficult for divers to retrieve any dropped tools.\"  \"It\u0027s pretty exciting for us right now because we\u0027ve just ground-tested Bluebird and all her systems are running beautifully. When she\u0027s put in the water at Loch Fad next week, it will be the first time in 50 years that Bluebird\u0027s engine will be started while afloat.\"  The bluebird suffered catastrophic damage in the crash which cost Campbell his life, and was hidden by the murky waters of Coniston for decades, although the location was pinpointed by a group of divers from the Royal marines shortly after the crash, but kept a secret.  When it was rediscovered by Mr Smith, there were moves to have it left in situ, but it was eventually raised to stop it becoming a magnet for souvenir hunters.  The body of Donald Campbell was located two months later, still in the green jumpsuit he wore during the final run. An inquest later found he had been decapitated by the Bluebird\u0027s plastic windshield.    Bill Smith with the wreck of the Bluebird  Mr Smith, said that there would be \"no goosebumps\" when he sees the famous hydroplane take to the water again.  Around a dozen different crew members will be required to get the Bluebird moving again, and it will be piloted by professional hydroplane pilot Ted Walsh.  The Bluebird was raised mostly intact, but the team were forced to start over again because the original structure was made half an inch adrift.  Companies in North Shields, where Mr Smith is based, also helped with its restoration. Rolls-Royce Controls and Data recreated the original 1967 fuel system from plans found in archives.  Mr Smith only plans to aim for speeds of around 65mph for demonstrations purposes.  He said: \"It\u0027s taken us 17 years to get to this point. But it\u0027s not the end of the journey. The trip to Scotland is get the crew prepared for the final trials we hope to do in Cumbria. It\u0027s another step in the road.\"  Mr Smith said that he fully expects things to go wrong during the trials. In fact, having everything be plain sailing would be counter to the way Donald Campbell approached his record-breaking runs.  He said: \"The Bluebird was always a work in progress and Campbell was always making changes to the design. If he hadn\u0027t crashed he would have been back for another go having made alterations and adaptions to the craft.  \"We\u0027ll have to fix little problems and hope that nothing major cocks up. There will be holes that need filed with silicon and bits that need fixed down, and lots of small snags to smooth over and get everything shipshape. But we\u0027re confident that the Bluebird will work as it should.\"    Campbell began started his career using his father\u0027s old boat, the Bluebird K4, but after a structural failure at 170 mph in 1951 he developed the Bluebird K7.  He championed British engineering his entire life and saw the Bluebird, and his land speed records, as a national foil to the feats of the space race being undertaken by the US and the USSR at the time.\u0026nbsp  He first broke the record in 1955 with a speed of 202mph.\u0026nbsp That rose to 260mph by 1959. By 1966, his record stood at 276mph.  Although he reached a speed more than 300mph in the fateful 1967 attempt he did not smash his previous record as he failed to complete the journey.    The fatal crash  Mr Smith believes that Campbell would by proud to see the Bluebird fly again, adding: \"Donald Campbell was a bit of a showman and he used to say that there\u0027s no such thing as bad publicity.  \"He talked a good job and did it very well at drumming up publicity. He would have loved this.\"  Mr Smith said: \"When we raised the Bluebird his wife, Tonia, was beside me on the boat and I looked over at the shoreline and there was 200 reporters and TV cameras and satellite trucks lines up.  \"I asked her \u0027do you think Donald would have liked this?\u0027, and she just laughed and said that he would have absolutely thrived on it.\""},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-mays-brexit-customs-plan-could-create-1bn-smugglers-paradise-claims-pro-eu-group","story":"  After Michel Barnier, the EU\u0027s chief negotiator, blew a hole in the Prime Minister\u0027s key customs proposal - the Facilitated Customs Arrangement - making clear the EU27 would not allow a non-EU member to collect its tariffs, the People\u0026rsquos Vote also picked fault with the UK\u0027s customs blueprint.  It claimed, given there would be no border checks, then smugglers would be free to transport goods in and out of Britain without controls on whether or not duties had been paid.  Consequently, the campaign said false claims about the final destinations of goods could enable smugglers to import into Britain without paying tariffs and then transfer those goods to the EU, thus evading duties that applied there.  \u0026ldquoThe Government is already in a total mess over its fantasy customs plans and this shows the serious consequences that the Brexit chaos has for our country, declared Labour\u0026rsquos Wes Streeting, a leading supporter of The People\u0026rsquos Vote.  \u0026ldquoThe UK has a proud track record in tackling organised crime. For Brexit to make it easier for people to illicitly smuggle goods across our border and not pay their way is simply unacceptable, insisted the London MP.  The backbencher added: \u0026ldquoNobody in Britain voted for the return to a golden age of smuggling. As new facts about Brexit come to light every day, it is clearer than ever that people need to be given a vote on the final deal.  The People\u0026rsquos Vote calculated the \u0026pound1bn Brexit bonanza figure by listing various goods and foodstuffs, which have varying EU tariffs, contrasting them with a zero-rated UK tariff, and then working out how much smugglers could potentially save.  For example, if EU tariffs were evaded: the \u0026pound1bn EU import value of men\u0026rsquos and boys\u0026rsquo shirts from China would produce a \u0026pound132m Brexit bonanza \u0026pound4.6bn of footwear also from China a \u0026pound506m bonanza \u0026pound324m beef from Argentina a \u0026pound41m bonanza and \u0026pound1.8bn of coffee from Brazil a \u0026pound109m bonanza. With other items, the campaign group calculated the total could be \u0026pound1.07bn.  Meanwhile, Lord Price, the former International Trade Minister, warned that a no-deal Brexit would put up the cost of basic foodstuffs \u0026ldquopretty significantly.  Mrs May told farmers and food producers at the Royal Welsh Show in Powys on Thursday that Brexit offered a \"real opportunity\" for Britain\u0026rsquos farming industry.

Noting how 80 per cent of vegetables consumer in the UK came from Europe, the Conservative peer, who left the Government in September, said: \"What you will see is rather than a pinch on supply - although that is highly likely - is a pretty significant increase in the cost of fruit and veg, the cost of meat and the cost of dairy products.\""},{"url":null,"title":"major-fringe-venue-creates-new-contracts-with-employees-after-discussions-with-workers-union","story":"  The union and Summerhall, a privately run arts complex in the south of Edinburgh, have agreed to a \"landmark\" pay and conditions agreement which the union says is the first of its kind in the capital.  Now Unite want to enter discussions with other key venues Underbelly and The Pleasance.  Last night Underbelly said it has no zero hours contracts, and pays the enhanced national living wage.  The treatment of staff has become a major issue in the Fringe in recent years.  The Unite union has a Fair Hospitality standard, which they say is otherwise only met by venues The Stand and New Town Theatre.  All staff will be entitled to breaks which will be written into contracts and all training shifts will be paid.  Sam Gough, general manager of Summerhall, said: \"We are delighted to be recognised for the work we have done, and continue to do to make Summerhall a fair and safe workplace.  He said: \"We are pleased that Summerhall have stepped-up as the first major Fringe employer to support the aims of the Fair Hospitality Charter and recognise Unite as the union for their staff.\"  \"We hope that this sends a clear message to other Fringe employers that they can and should mark themselves out as a decent employer willing to reward their hard-working staff accordingly.\"  Unite wants venues to pay the living wages, give rest breaks, equal pay for young workers, have no zero hour contracts, end unpaid trial shifts, implement anti-sexual harassment policies, pay for transport home after midnight, get 100% of tips, and allow union access.  Anthony Alderson, who runs the equally key Pleasance venue, said: \"We are delighted that Summerhall is being able to take the steps they have done this week.  \"Pleasance are committed to offering the very best opportunities to the many people who come back year on year to take part.  \"It is important to recognise that there are several different models and one size does not fit all.\"  The Pleasance has a team of 200 volunteers at the Fringe this year.  They receive a subsistence grant of \u0026pound680 and, if they require accommodation, a bedroom in premises nearby.  He added: \"We have taken advice from several organisations including Unite and Volunteer Edinburgh to establish the very best opportunity for our volunteers.  \"We are delighted that they are positive about our scheme.\"  A spokeswoman for Underbelly said: \"Underbelly is really proud of our hard working and dedicated team who make Underbelly at the Edinburgh Fringe.  \"We believe they, and all staff across the Fringe, deserve safe, fair and respectful working conditions and we positively engaged with the Fringe Society\u0026rsquos work in this area.  \"We have no zero hour contracts, we pay staff for training and tips go to staff.  \"Underbelly also pays enhanced national living wage or more to all staff regardless of age.\""},{"url":null,"title":"johnston-press-investor-drops-alex-salmond-as-prospective-chairman","story":"  The BBC has reported that Norwegian investor Christen Ager-Hanssen, who owns 20 per cent of the company shares and previously announced takeover plans, said the former first minister was \"a great guy, but I decided that [would be] too politically infected\".

The writers are part of a campaign run by Scottish PEN, the freedom of expression group, in parallel with the The Herald\u0027s own Freedom of Speech campaign.  They remain concerned that unreformed laws are having a chilling effect on investigative journalists, scientists and - especially - local bloggers trying to expose wrongdoing by the rich and powerful. England and Wales have moved to bring their defamation laws i n to line with the internet age. Scotland has not followed suit.  The writers, who also include\u0026nbspSara Sheridan, Zoe Strachan, Philippe Sands, Karen Campbell, Christopher Brookmyre, Ron Butlin and Louise Welsh, said that \u0026ldquoprotecting free expression cannot wait any longer\".  They added: \"Every moment reform is delayed, writers, academics, scientists, journalists and social media users remain at risk from being threatened by legal action on the most minor of issues.  The Scottish Law Commission produced a draft bill in December 2017, which included an English-style \"serious harm\" threshold to prevent trivial cases or those brought solely to silence criticism. The Law Commission also proposed created a statutory defence of publication on a matter of public interest and a single publication rule to ensure the time period within which a defamation action can be brought does not restart every time a link or post is shared or viewed online.  Nik Williams, Project Manager of Scottish PEN said: \u0026ldquoIt would be a missed opportunity for the First Minister to ignore the work and opinions of the Scottish Law Commission and the hundreds of people who took part in the public consultations to delay reform until September 2019.  \"Scotland\u0026rsquos defamation laws are already significantly out-of-date and wholly inadequate for free expression in the modern age and any delay in reforming defamation law will continue to stifle public discourse and the ability of people to hold the powerful to account.  Poet and novelist, James Robertson added : \u0026ldquoThe law of defamation in Scotland has not been revised in any significant way since before the Scottish Parliament was established, while in the same period the context of news media, public expression and communication has changed beyond all recognition.  \"We need the law to recognise this new world, protecting both freedom of expression and reasonable rights of privacy, both key areas of a fully-functioning democracy.  Actual defamation cases in the Scottish courts are rare. However, evidence from the National Union of Journalists and newspaper employers suggest threats of expensive legal action - or fears of threats - are blocking investigations.  Ms Sturgeon in April told a Scottish parliament committee that some of the English-style reforms, including a serious harm test, were \"controversial\", suggesting a potential delay.

Most likely such notions were planted in the US President\u0026rsquos mind during that one-to-one session in Helsinki with his Russian counterpart. It\u0026rsquos long been no secret that Moscow by hook or by crook did all it could to prevent Montenegro becoming the latest Nato member, even though the little Balkan nation finally succeeded in doing so last year much to the Kremlin\u0026rsquos chagrin.  Working therefore on the basis that Mr Putin has had remarkable success in inducing Mr Trump to promote the Kremlin\u0026rsquos interests and parrot its agenda, it\u0026rsquos probably fair to expect another small Balkan country to become the subject of both men\u0026rsquos ire in the coming months.  I\u0026rsquom talking of course about Macedonia, or to give it its proper name as known at the United Nations, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (Fyrom).  Names matter here, indeed in \u0026ldquoMacedonia\u0026rsquos case what the country is actually called is already impacting on its future political direction of travel and will almost certainly bring it opprobrium from the Kremlin and therefore de-facto Mr Trump.  But before looking at such a prospect, it\u0026rsquos first necessary to rewind back to where the contentious issue of Macedonia\u0026rsquos name comes from and an agreement it signed last month with Greece.  It was in 1991 in the wake of the break-up of the former Yugoslavia that Greece\u0026rsquos northern neighbour called itself Macedonia.  For its part Greece was none to pleased and objected to the name, fearing territorial claims and ambitions on its eponymous northern region that includes the country\u0026rsquos second city, Thessaloniki.  The fledging Macedonia did little to defuse Greek anger with among other gestures calling its main airport in its capital Skopje after Ancient Greek hero Alexander. All this though is itself now history, given that after years of bickering, protests and talks the two neighbours have now reached an agreement.  Under the deal, signed on June 17, Macedonia agreed to change its name to Republic of North Macedonia. In return Greece has agreed to end its long-standing blockade of Macedonia\u0026rsquos membership of Nato and the EU.  As so often happens in the Balkans though, not everything is that straightforward.  For starters if the deal is to be fully implemented, then Macedonians must show their support in a referendum and likewise the Greek parliament must be on side.  For the moment it\u0026rsquos the first of these domestic political hurdles that is proving the trickiest.  For just as Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev and his ruling social democrats (SDSM) pushes hard for the renaming referendum to take place in the Autumn, so one of two main opposition groups in the country, the VMRO-DPMNE party has pushed back. Its supporters see the deal as little more than a shameful capitulation to Athens, something Mr Zaev has condemned as backward looking.  \u0026ldquoInstead of boarding the train bound for the EU and Nato, he chose to stay on the dark side of history, Mr Zaev was recently quoted as saying of opposition leader Hristijan Mickovski\u0026rsquos reluctance to move forward with the renaming vote.  Despite the obvious acrimony between the two sides, many remain confident the name change ballot will still take place, opening the way for the new Republic of North Macedonia to become part of the Nato and EU fold.  Should things move in this direction then cue Mr Putin\u0026rsquos full efforts to thwart Macedonia\u0026rsquos Nato aspirations in much the same way he did in Montenegro. That much was already evident last month when according to authorities in Athens, Russia tried to pay off Greek clerics and officials to oppose the Macedonia-Greece deal.  The meddling prompted the Greek government of prime minister Alexis Tsipras this month to expel two Russian diplomats and deny entry to two others, while accusing the Kremlin of \u0026ldquoconstant disrespect for Greece.  It was an extraordinary move by the normally Russophilic Greek government that has been one of Russia\u0026rsquos best European friends.  Moscow in turn responded by cancelling a planned visit to Athens by foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, and the two countries continue to trade angry statements.  In Macedonia itself, meanwhile, evidence suggests that Russia\u0026rsquos GRU military spy service is already using the sensitive mood in the country to stir up nationalist and anti-Western resentment, and so hindering Macedonia\u0026rsquos referendum route to Nato.  A few weeks ago Macedonia interior ministry documents seen by the local partner of the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) reportedly revealed one key source of payments to opponents of the renaming referendum.  According to the group\u0026rsquos investigative journalists, Ivan Savvidi, a Russian billionaire living in Greece who was formerly a member of the Russian parliament and United Russia party, made payments worth at least \u0026curren300,000 to recently created radical nationalist organisations willing to foment unrest in the country. A similar Russian role was also uncovered in neighbouring Greece.  Intelligence service watchers say that what has been unfolding in Macedonia is almost a carbon copy of what happened in Montenegro, though in the latter, Russian intelligence operatives were also involved in plotting a violent coup that would have ended in the assassination of Montenegro\u0026rsquos pro-Western leader, Milo Djukanovic.  Much of course might still happen that could derail Macedonia\u0026rsquos renaming referendum and accession to Nato and EU membership.  If one thing is certain though, it\u0026rsquos that undaunted by his failure in Montenegro, Mr Putin is again pulling out the stops and sending forth the spooks and dirty tricks brigade to make things difficult in a country Russia insists as being within its sphere of influence.  It would come as no surprise too if all of a sudden, Mr Trump again suddenly discovers yet another small Balkan country on the map called Macedonia and joins the Kremlin\u0026rsquos chorus of mischief making."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8125371.jpg?type=article-full","title":"how-slavery-shaped-edinburghs-new-town","story":"  Yet behind the grandeur of Edinburgh\u0027s New Town there lurks a dark and sinister past, with the greed and injustice which gave rise to its splendid terraces carefully hidden from view.  But now the forgotten history of one of the country\u0027s most celebrated marvels is beginning to be told, thanks to a new exhibition which raises awkward questions about the role the slave trade played in its foundation.  Leading Jamaican-born academic and human rights campaigner Sir Geoff Palmer, Emeritus Professor in the School of Life Sciences at Heriot-Watt University and also Scotland\u0027s first black professor, has given stinging critique in an interview with The Herald on how \"slavery is the history of the New Town\", down to how it shaped individual homes.    He said James Craig and Robert Adam\u0027s streets were partly owned by slave plantation owners or funders, with often hundreds of slaves in their keep.  He said: \"After emancipation in 1833, people were given compensation (for the loss of slaves) because officially the slaves were property.  \"If you look at the New Town, on the compensation list you will find various areas like India Street, Albany Street, Forth Street and nearby Rodney Street.  \"For example, when you look at one building you would think it is just an ordinary house.  \"But when you look at it carefully, which I have - and it is on the compensation list - the person there who received money for their slaves is the only house that has a balcony.\"  He said:\u0026nbsp\"If you go to another, also on the compensation list, it has two doors to the one house.  \"It is not just that a lot of the houses in the New Town are on the compensation list, those which are on the compensation list have got appointments (fittings), have got differences - so having slaves made your house different.\"  The compensation list includes 320 Edinburgh addresses belonging to 148 individuals.  One in Forth Street was compensated \u0026pound277 for nine slaves in Tobago, another in Albany Street received \u0026pound1,996 for 104 \u0026ldquoenslaved\" in Jamaica, and one Dundas Street home-owner got \u0026ldquo\u0026pound2,956 15s 6d for 194 slaves in St Ann, also Jamaica.  In all, the British government paid out \u0026pound20m to compensate about 3,000 families that owned slaves for the loss of \"property\" when slave-ownership was abolished - the equivalent of around \u0026pound16.5bn today.  Prof Palmer said much of the management of slave funds would have come under the head of one of the biggest banks, the former first Lord of the Admiralty - who is commemorated on the 150ft plinth in the city\u0027s St Andrew Square, itself the subject of discussions on adding a plaque outlining his slavery connections - Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville.  He said: \"The one we all know about is Dundas, because he was a politician, but he is significant because he controlled and managed the people who would have had property in the New Town.  \"He was the governor of the Bank of Scotland. He was funding slavery. He was the great patronage giver.  \"Dundas proposed that slavery should be gradually abolished.  \"Dundas did that in order to counteract those people who wanted immediate abolition.  \"Some historians said he wasn\u0026rsquot a bad guy because he wanted to do it gradually so that was better.  \"It\u0026rsquos not. It was a deception.  \"This was how he protected the people who lived in the New Town.  \"My view - and I know the present viscount - is that I don\u0026rsquot want the statue to be taken down or damaged, because once you start removing things, that\u0026rsquos removing the evidence, and you remove the deed.  \"I would like to see the truth of what was done on the plaque, that he was the proponent of gradual abolition of slavery that kept the trade going for 15 years longer than it should.\"  He added:\u0026nbsp\"What that means was 42,000 slaves who were transported each year by Britain would not have been.  \"That is the history of the New Town.\"  Henry Dundas was ultimately impeached over misappropriation of public money.    The Edinburgh World Heritage Trust, said the Tron Kirk exhibition, which also highlights Scotland\u0026rsquos other five World Heritage Sites, sets out the formal reasons for the city\u0026rsquos Unesco inscription, but also \"challenge residents and visitors to think differently about the city and consider some uncomfortable questions\".  These also include the absence of women in the city\u0026rsquos many grand statues and monuments and whether the trust doing enough to conserve the authenticity of the site.

Her comments come at a time when there is an increasing focus on research as a way of boosting the income of universities.  University rankings, which are seen as crucial to the recruitment of students both at home and overseas, are also heavily weighted towards research output.  Ms McDougall said the skills required to be the best researcher were not the same as the skills required to be a great educator.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe journey to becoming an academic is very focussed on research skills with the pressure to publish and remain active in research, but there is not the same focus on educational skills.  \u0026ldquoIt is not surprising that many do not excel at teaching unless they have a natural ability and, given a number of undergraduate courses are taught by graduate teaching assistants, many of whom are only a few years ahead of the graduates they\u0026rsquore teaching, means we cannot expect them to be naturally gifted educators.  Ms McDougall, who was speaking at a teaching excellence summit at Glasgow University run by the Times Higher Education magazine, called for universities to spend more time developing academics.  She said: \u0026ldquoWe require primary and secondary school teachers to undergo intensive training before we allow them into the classroom, but we don\u0026rsquot expect the same from academics and I don\u0026rsquot really understand why there is a general assumption that academics can teach without dedicated training.  \u0026ldquoThere needs to be a lot more time invested by universities in developing academics as educators. That would help students feel more valued.  \u0026ldquoSometimes there is a risk for undergraduate students to feel sidelined by research activity in a university and we are all very aware of the tensions that exist for academics between splitting their time.  \u0026ldquoSometimes there is a tendency for undergraduates to feel secondary - an afterthought - to the main activity of research in a research-intensive university.  Mary Senior, Scotland Official for the University and College Union, which represents lecturers, said teaching was of a high quality, but could be affected by staff contracts which were often insecure.  She said: \u0026ldquoAccredited teacher training courses and qualifications should be accessible to all members of academic staff, and flexible enough to reflect major disciplinary differences within higher education.  \u0026ldquoThe real issue is teaching-only contracts can mean the exploitation of staff on casual contracts, and the fact that, although students often don\u0026rsquot realise it, most of them will be taught at some point by people on insecure casual contracts.  A spokesman for Universities Scotland, which represents principals, said: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos been a long-stated position of our members that research informs teaching and there will also be a fine balancing act to ensure that students and academics get the most out of both elements."},{"url":null,"title":"kevin-mckenna-we-must-to-stand-up-to-this-new-breed-of-right-wing-hard-men","story":"  I first encountered the phenomenon as a teenager in the early 1980s when neighbours and older relatives returned to ours for drinks after Saturday night parish fund-raising dances. The talk then was of Margaret Thatcher as third generation Labour voters sought to convince each other why they had chosen to loosen their family\u0026rsquos ties to the party that had redeemed them. Many were the first in their families ever to own their own home and, newly-inducted into the property classes, felt they owed a debt of gratitude to Mrs Thatcher. Others felt that the \u0026ldquopower of the unions had to be \u0026ldquobroken and that the Iron Lady had done just that by facing down the miners.  You wanted to point out that none of them would be sitting there sipping Blue Nun and talking about avocado bathroom suites and their new Granada Ghias if Labour and the unions hadn\u0026rsquot emancipated their families from low incomes and bad outcomes in health and education. But your own theories were still forming and anyway you would be chided affectionately for spending too much time among university beer hall Communists and not enough of it at lectures.  You wanted to tell them too that Mrs Thatcher had waged a doctrinal and cultural war on the miners. She had done this as a means of destroying the trade union movement, the biggest obstacle separating her from her dream of society driven purely by market forces and where the worth of a person was measured only by their ability to turn a profit. In vain, you sought to appeal to their robust Christianity and the story of the money-changers in the temple and the Good Samaritan, only to be told that Mick McGahey and Arthur Scargill were God-hating Communists.  Looking back, you wished you had possessed the information gained many years later. Thus you would have been able to tell them that MI5 had infiltrated the National Union of Mineworkers to disseminate the lie, aided by Robert Maxwell and the Daily Mirror, that Mr Scargill was on the take. You could have shown how coal-mining was still a profitable industry when the last remaining pits began to shut and that Mrs Thatcher had spent \u0026pound7 billion paying off working miners and making wastelands of their communities. Thus billions more were lost in productivity, unemployment benefits and the increased pressure on local health services and that you lot would be next up against the wall when Mrs Thatcher\u0026rsquos bell tolls again.  You could have told them about the McCrone Report and how Mrs Thatcher and her successors all conspired to conceal the true extent of Scotland\u0026rsquos oil wealth and how she had used tax revenues from it to fund her dismantling of Britain\u0026rsquos old and still productive industries.  Ah, but what about the right to take ownership of our own council houses? And then you could have asked them who they thought benefited most from that. What a boon that was to the financial services industry: millions of new customers clamouring for easy mortgages at crippling rates and the certain knowledge that unemployment, an unforeseen economic corrugation, sudden health issues and divorce would inevitably result in sweet multitudes of repossessions and the creation of the money-laundering state. In 2008 we learned how that turned out.  Another lie is being prepared which feeds on the curious outcomes of the last presidential election and the EU referendum. It\u0026rsquos currently marinading nicely in Britain\u0026rsquos chardonnay estates and where flaneurs gather to display their knowledge of the political tides which are changing the direction of our lives. As with all best-laid lies there is a degree of truth attached. This one states that the far-right\u0026rsquos new band of Armani demagogues and tribunes are now truly representative of the working classes. It floats on the multitudes of voters in North America\u0026rsquos rust belt who turned out for Donald Trump in 2016 and on the blue-collar vote in Britain that is sweeping the country out of the EU.  In the US it\u0026rsquos permitted President Trump and his chief propagandist Steve Bannon to proclaim that they are standing up for \u0026ldquothe little man and all those who have felt locked out or otherwise disenfranchised from Washington\u0026rsquos decision-making. Nigel Farage and his lickspittles in the UK Conservative Party have propagated a similar fiction.  On the day after the EU referendum I visited Hartlepool, a solidly-working class town on England\u0026rsquos North Sea coast which had just voted 70-30 to leave the EU. This is traditional Labour territory but fuelled by a sense of despair and resentment that its old car manufacturing and fishing industries had been allowed to run down and that nothing meaningful had replaced them. Each of the dozen or so local people who talked to me cited immigration as the principal factor in their decision to vote Leave. There didn\u0026rsquot seem to be that many immigrants in Hartlepool but decades of anti-immigrant stories in the English red-tops and the richly-funded lies of the Leave campaign had found their mark here.  The affluent extremists who have annexed Conservative policies across Europe and the US despise the blue-collar communities whose vote they kidnapped. They despise their Hicksville concerns their beer and reality television addictions their Three Lions and their barbecue complexions. They are valuable only as fodder to help Trump, Bannon, Boris Johnson and Farage attain power and thence to deploy it to bring about an 18th century society where the weak and the poor know their place where women are chattels and where minorities are marginalised.  The trick is to avert their gaze by making enemies out of other nations other cultures and colours and blaming them for their ills.

Most likely such notions were planted in the US President\u0026rsquos mind during that one-to-one session in Helsinki with his Russian counterpart. It\u0026rsquos long been no secret that Moscow by hook or by crook did all it could to prevent Montenegro becoming the latest Nato member, even though the little Balkan nation finally succeeded in doing so last year much to the Kremlin\u0026rsquos chagrin.  Working therefore on the basis that Mr Putin has had remarkable success in inducing Mr Trump to promote the Kremlin\u0026rsquos interests and parrot its agenda, it\u0026rsquos probably fair to expect another small Balkan country to become the subject of both men\u0026rsquos ire in the coming months.  I\u0026rsquom talking of course about Macedonia, or to give it its proper name as known at the United Nations, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (Fyrom).  Names matter here, indeed in \u0026ldquoMacedonia\u0026rsquos case what the country is actually called is already impacting on its future political direction of travel and will almost certainly bring it opprobrium from the Kremlin and therefore de-facto Mr Trump.  But before looking at such a prospect, it\u0026rsquos first necessary to rewind back to where the contentious issue of Macedonia\u0026rsquos name comes from and an agreement it signed last month with Greece.  It was in 1991 in the wake of the break-up of the former Yugoslavia that Greece\u0026rsquos northern neighbour called itself Macedonia.  For its part Greece was none to pleased and objected to the name, fearing territorial claims and ambitions on its eponymous northern region that includes the country\u0026rsquos second city, Thessaloniki.  The fledging Macedonia did little to defuse Greek anger with among other gestures calling its main airport in its capital Skopje after Ancient Greek hero Alexander. All this though is itself now history, given that after years of bickering, protests and talks the two neighbours have now reached an agreement.  Under the deal, signed on June 17, Macedonia agreed to change its name to Republic of North Macedonia. In return Greece has agreed to end its long-standing blockade of Macedonia\u0026rsquos membership of Nato and the EU.  As so often happens in the Balkans though, not everything is that straightforward.  For starters if the deal is to be fully implemented, then Macedonians must show their support in a referendum and likewise the Greek parliament must be on side.  For the moment it\u0026rsquos the first of these domestic political hurdles that is proving the trickiest.  For just as Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev and his ruling social democrats (SDSM) pushes hard for the renaming referendum to take place in the Autumn, so one of two main opposition groups in the country, the VMRO-DPMNE party has pushed back. Its supporters see the deal as little more than a shameful capitulation to Athens, something Mr Zaev has condemned as backward looking.  \u0026ldquoInstead of boarding the train bound for the EU and Nato, he chose to stay on the dark side of history, Mr Zaev was recently quoted as saying of opposition leader Hristijan Mickovski\u0026rsquos reluctance to move forward with the renaming vote.  Despite the obvious acrimony between the two sides, many remain confident the name change ballot will still take place, opening the way for the new Republic of North Macedonia to become part of the Nato and EU fold.  Should things move in this direction then cue Mr Putin\u0026rsquos full efforts to thwart Macedonia\u0026rsquos Nato aspirations in much the same way he did in Montenegro. That much was already evident last month when according to authorities in Athens, Russia tried to pay off Greek clerics and officials to oppose the Macedonia-Greece deal.  The meddling prompted the Greek government of prime minister Alexis Tsipras this month to expel two Russian diplomats and deny entry to two others, while accusing the Kremlin of \u0026ldquoconstant disrespect for Greece.  It was an extraordinary move by the normally Russophilic Greek government that has been one of Russia\u0026rsquos best European friends.  Moscow in turn responded by cancelling a planned visit to Athens by foreign minister Sergei Lavrov, and the two countries continue to trade angry statements.  In Macedonia itself, meanwhile, evidence suggests that Russia\u0026rsquos GRU military spy service is already using the sensitive mood in the country to stir up nationalist and anti-Western resentment, and so hindering Macedonia\u0026rsquos referendum route to Nato.  A few weeks ago Macedonia interior ministry documents seen by the local partner of the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) reportedly revealed one key source of payments to opponents of the renaming referendum.  According to the group\u0026rsquos investigative journalists, Ivan Savvidi, a Russian billionaire living in Greece who was formerly a member of the Russian parliament and United Russia party, made payments worth at least \u0026curren300,000 to recently created radical nationalist organisations willing to foment unrest in the country. A similar Russian role was also uncovered in neighbouring Greece.  Intelligence service watchers say that what has been unfolding in Macedonia is almost a carbon copy of what happened in Montenegro, though in the latter, Russian intelligence operatives were also involved in plotting a violent coup that would have ended in the assassination of Montenegro\u0026rsquos pro-Western leader, Milo Djukanovic.  Much of course might still happen that could derail Macedonia\u0026rsquos renaming referendum and accession to Nato and EU membership.  If one thing is certain though, it\u0026rsquos that undaunted by his failure in Montenegro, Mr Putin is again pulling out the stops and sending forth the spooks and dirty tricks brigade to make things difficult in a country Russia insists as being within its sphere of influence.  It would come as no surprise too if all of a sudden, Mr Trump again suddenly discovers yet another small Balkan country on the map called Macedonia and joins the Kremlin\u0026rsquos chorus of mischief making."},{"url":null,"title":"cornerstone launch town centre project","story":"        The wraps have come off an impressive new Peterhead hub for a Scottish charity.

Yvette Harrison, Manager of Mackie’s 19.2 in the city’s Marischal Square, said: “In some ways it’s sad to say goodbye to the peanut butter tap. It really did create a buzz online and off and gave customers an extra special element to top their desserts with.        “It’s one of those naughty treats that actually has health benefits, and fans were going nuts for it when it launched in March.“However, we have chosen to replace the tap as we want to ensure that enjoyment of the parlour is available to all. When we learned that it was putting off some of those with severe nut allergies we made the decision to phase it out and replace it.”The Willy Wonka-style tap, which dispensed warm, smooth peanut butter for topping waffles, ice cream and crepes was a hit with customers looking to add a savoury element to their sweet treats.Viral videos of the UK-first tap racked up nearly 3million views on the likes of LADBible and UNILAD.

Fifteen 1,000-litre bowsers have been issued and filled by the council, which will be refilled as required. There are more than 7,500 private water supplies in Aberdeenshire – the highest number in thecountry.Given the limited capacity of the council, priority is being given to elderly, disabled or ill occupiers and householders may have to augment the supplies the council provides with water from other sources.

Significant rainfall over a prolonged period is required to replenish some supplies, but this is not expected in the near future. There are warnings that when rain does fall, private supplies could become contaminated and users should be wary.Users of untreated supplies should ensure they boil water before drinking, cooking and brushing teeth. Those using such supplies may be eligible for grant funding towards treatment – contact the council’s environmental health team for information.Long-term, the council is providing advice on future solutions to improve water security, such as support to help connect to the mains. If that is not possible, improvements to the current source or forming a new supply can be considered and grants may be available for some of this work.Environmental health team manager, Louise Cunningham, said: “Most people will be well aware of how recent weather conditions have been affecting the country, but those with private water supplies in Aberdeenshire are acutely aware of the impact it’s having.                                                                                                        “Clearly we all have to use water wisely at times like this, but around 11,500 properties in Aberdeenshire are served by private water supplies, by far the highest number of any local authority in Scotland, and difficulties for these residents could be pronounced.“We are assisting where we can and would encourage anyone who is having issues with their private supply to get in touch with us, both about short term solutions and thinking about the longer term.“When rain does come, users of private supplies should be aware that following an extended dry period the water will not be absorbed by the ground quickly and has the potential to run over ground for longer, potentially contaminating some supplies.”If you need assistance in relation to water supplies, please contact the council by phoning 01467 539539 (during office hours) or by emailing: environmental@aberdeenshire.gov.uk Some useful advice from Scottish Water is also available online: http://bit.ly/2K1CQ7s                                                                    "},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116798.jpg","title":"Caithness estate with links to royal family to be sold at auction","story":"A CAITHNESS estate with links to the royal family and rock and pop stars is to be sold at auction next month.The Dunnet Head Estate, comprising 1800 acres of land and the House of the Northern Gate, was initially put on the market in February for \u0026pound925,000.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA spokeswoman for Auction House Scotland, which is dealing with the transaction, yesterday described the price reduction as \u0026ldquoone of our biggest ever.She said: \u0026ldquoSince the latest reduction on Friday the amount of interest in the estate has increased tenfold with enquiries coming mostly from the UK.Asked why the estate is being sold, she replied: \u0026ldquoThe current owner has had it for a long time and felt it was time to sell up and move on.The estate includes six lochs, a beach, approved planning for 10 timber lodges and a detached house as well as the 10-bedroom House of the Northern Gate.It was owned by Commander Clare Vyner and his wife Lady Doris Vyner, who was the Queen Mother\u0026rsquos close friend and lady-in-waiting.

When it then went on the market, the rock band Led Zeppelin looked at it with the aim of turning it into a recording studio although the plan did not come to fruition.Stuart \u0026ldquoWoody Wood from the Bay City Rollers also showed interest as a buyer but it was purchased by a clothes manufacturer before he sold it to the current owner\u0026rsquos family in the mid-1980s.The house \u0026ndash built between 1895 and 1908 \u0026ndash was also said to have been used as the backdrop for a horror film in the 1970s.The property is in need of refurbishment but could be developed as a hotel, as serviced apartments, as a bed-and-breakfast business or as a family home, according to the auctioneers.The 1800 acres of land is suitable \u0026ldquofor sport and grouse shooting, while the six lochs are said to be ideal for brown trout fishing. It also has planning approval for 10 timber lodges which could be built and rented out or leased to a holiday letting company, the auctioneers say.There is also approval for a new-build detached house.\u0026ldquoThe estate enjoys a spectacular setting on a peninsula of the most northerly coastline of the Scottish mainland, overlooking Dunnet Bay to the west and over the Pentland Firth and towards Orkney to the north, the promotional material says.Asked why the property is being sold at auction, the spokeswoman explained it can help maximise the price and \u0026ldquomake a more secure sale.She said: \u0026ldquoWhen the gavel falls the sale is legally binding.The auction of the estate is due to take place at St Vincent Street in Glasgow on August 16.Saturday 28 Jul 2018 6:43 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116795.jpg","title":"Mey Highland and Cultural Games to be bigger and better","story":"Event chairman Captain Richard Otley said that the Mey Highland and Cultural Games 2018 will be \u0026ldquobigger and better this year and \u0026ldquowill surely put Caithness on the map.The 2018 event is the first Highland games to include para-athletes\u0026rsquo events.

Its expertise is thought to have formed part of the case for siting the facility at the Moine, which is about 40 miles west of Dounreay.Cavendish Dounreay Partnership (CDP) and its subsidiary Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd (DSRL) have invested resources in the spaceport proposal as part of its bid to identify and develop new jobs after the closure of the plant.Mr Craig said: \u0026ldquoEvery single one of us here at Dounreay recognises the importance of seizing opportunities like these to create new job opportunities, not just for this generation but the one that follows when Dounreay is gone.He added: \u0026ldquoOur skill sets in engineering, environmental science, programme management and a range of technical disciplines are easily transferable to industries such as the space sector and I am committed to working closely with the developer and operator to make the most of this amazing opportunity for our people.CDP chairman Simon Bowen said: \u0026ldquoDecommissioning a complex nuclear site like Dounreay is about more than getting it into a state that is safe for future generations \u0026ndash it is also about securing the social and economic prosperity of future generations.\u0026ldquoThe UK vertical launch facility is a key priority, with the potential to deliver high-value employment and supply chain opportunities.Sutherland was one of three potential spaceport locations to submit outline business cases to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) earlier this year.

This means 42 per cent of all eligible LFASS 2017 claims have now been paid, with more payments to follow in the coming weeks.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Given the pressures that farmers and crofters continue to face, due in part to the extreme weather conditions during the winter and summer periods, I’m glad to see these important payments starting two months earlier than last year.“Earlier in the year we provided a loan option for farmers in advance of these payments, to help provide cashflow and financial certainty. Farmers are the backbone of Scotland’s rural economy and the Scottish Government is committed to supporting them wherever possible.\u0026#8221On behalf of the Scottish Farmers Union, NFU Scotland, LFA Committee Chairman, Robert Macdonald, welcomed the news saying: “The news that LFASS payments will be reaching farmers and crofters is welcome, particularly for those who did not apply for or receive an LFASS loan of 90 per cent through the LFASS loan scheme. The current prolonged period of extraordinary weather, and the economic impact that it brings, once again underlines the importance of these payments to business stability.“As we look ahead its vital that support for the less favoured areas, for hill farms and crofts, continues. NFU Scotland continues to press the Scottish Government for a timetable for payments, delivered in a timely manner to allow farmers and crofters to efficiently plan their cashflow.“Whilst these payments will bring relief for some, NFUS continues to highlight to farmers and crofters the importance of planning ahead for straw and feed supplies with three key messages — Plan ahead, Be flexible and collaborate.”\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It has been credited with helping some people to turn their lives around.Confirmation that Mr Harper, who has also sold on the streets of Inverness, had found a successful new niche for himself came when he was handed a Scotland\u0026rsquos Top Seller accolade.Mr Harper, who has overcome major health challenges, averages around 160 copies a week. He has been selling the magazine on and off since it was launched back in 1991.The secret to his success is fairly straightfoward, he believes: \"I speak to everybody who walks past me.

The first is the cinema, which would be built on land close to the ferry slipway and next to an existing boat storage shed.It would seat roughly 30 people and host weekly screenings throughout the year, rising to twice a week in the summer. It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0026rsquos growing film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country every autumn.Cromarty Estate also plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema in a bid to cater for growing business demand in the town.A statement submitted by Cromarty Estate said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation, with the result that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"Addressing this need... will make Cromarty a more balanced and sustainable community.\"Film society trustee Tanya Karlebach said the group was \"really excited\" to reach this milestone and the move would help increase the frequency of screenings in Cromarty.She added that there is still some fundraising to do before the \u0026pound240,000 cost of the venue is covered, but that by lodging the application now, they are hopeful permission will be in place to begin as soon as the target is met.They hope to hear about their remaining grant applications and other fundraising by late autumn.She added the society had opted for a new-build because none of the existing sites in Cromarty were suitable for conversion. They would also have cost more to take on than building a cinema from scratch.\"We hope the community is supportive,\" she said. \"We\u0026rsquove had positive feedback so far and it\u0026rsquos in a great location down by the ferry.\"A survey of Cromarty residents found that 82 per cent backed a cinema in the town and the same number would go to more screenings if the venue was better than what is currently on offer.The plans for the cinema and office hub have won support from a leading Highland business figure.David Richardson, the Federation of Small Businesses\u0026rsquo Highlands and Islands development manager, said the organisation \"wholeheartedly supports locally-managed collaborative ventures that make our small rural communities even better places to live, especially for the young people and families that we desperately need to retain and attract.\"Cinemas appeal to all ages and to locals and visitors alike, and they can also be great social hubs.\"Equally, the presence of purpose-designed office space can do much to encourage would-be entrepreneurs to take the plunge and start new businesses existing small business to expand and to attract businesses from outside to relocate.\"It approved the buildings would feature dark metal cladding to the walls of the cinema, with timber cladding on the office hub.Construction could start as early as spring next year.To donate to the cinema project go to www.justgiving/crowdfunding/cromartycommunitycinemaSaturday 28 Jul 2018 6:44 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The utility giant said underlying earnings at its generation and supply unit had soared by more than 300 per cent to £165.8 million in the six months to the end of June. It added that the  division had “recovered” from a poor performance in 2017.            Average customer consumption increased by 4 per cent year-on-year over the period, which was mainly due to cold weather from the Beast from the East around late February and March.            Customer numbers now stand at about 4.9 million, down from the five million reported at the end of the first quarter of 2018.The latest figures come after the Big Six energy company, which is owned by Spanish multinational Iberdrola, increased prices in a move that hit some 950,000 households.The firm hiked its standard variable gas and electricity prices for around a third of its customers from 1 June, with impacted households facing an average increase of 5.5 per cent.ScottishPower attributed the rise to an increase in wholesale energy costs, alongside costs associated with upgrading meters and delivering electricity from low-carbon sources.The firm has been investing in wind power, having completed a £650m project to build eight wind farms north of the Border.            Over the first six months of 2018, ScottishPower also started construction on a major offshore wind farm in East Anglia, the East Anglia ONE project.Underlying earnings at the ScottishPower Renewables business rose 27 per cent to £205.1m while they nudged up 3 per cent to £399.9m at the SP Energy Networks division.The group has also completed the installation of one million smart meters. It is working with four installation partners across the UK, installing at peak 2,700 meters per day with a UK-wide workforce of more than 500 people.ScottishPower chief executive Keith Anderson said: “Everyone knows that installing smart meters hasn’t been plain sailing for suppliers. Challenges have been overcome, with more to face, but it is a major achievement to reach one million installations.            “The potential for customers to reduce consumption and save money is only one benefit. As the energy industry becomes fully digital in the years ahead, the new meters will be a vital cog in a smart network that supports electric vehicle charging, manages locally produced renewable energy and even the storage of electricity at home.”On the half-year results he noted: “All of our business areas are performing in line with expectations. Our investment in onshore wind last year has seen an increase in electricity generated, and excellent progress has been made on delivering the £2.5 billion East Anglia ONE project.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4775236.1532720587!/image/image.jpg","title":"st andrews university voted top for student experience","story":"        The University of St Andrews has scooped first place in the UK for student academic experience, according to the results of the latest National Student Survey 2018.                The National Student Survey (NSS) named the university the UK’s top mainstream university – the tenth time in the past 12 years it has topped the league table.            The University of Dundee  once again achieved a top 10 UK place, and also ranked second in Scotland, followed by the University of Glasgow.            The census of nearly half a million students, the NSS is undertaken independently by Ipsos MORI.A total of 94 per cent of St Andrews final year students  gave the university top marks for the quality of the learning and teaching experience. The survey reflects student responses to questions  on academic support, learning resources, teaching, management, assessment, personal development and satisfaction. Professor Sally Mapstone, St Andrews principal, said: “This is a terrific result and a tribute to the commitment of academic and professional staff across the University of St Andrews who provide an outstanding environment and experience for our students. “St Andrews students recognise the exceptional quality of learning and teaching, facilities, and support at our University.             “We work in partnership with our students to ensure we continue to excel in this regard, and we take nothing for granted. These results demonstrate that those students joining our academic family in 2018 have made the right choice in calling St Andrews home.“Scottish universities are setting excellent standards in UK education, and we are proud to lead in the NSS, and to demonstrate our deep-rooted commitment to academic excellence and the student experience.”Alastair Sim, director of Universities Scotland, representing Scotland’s 19 higher education institutions, said the results gave Scotland a “very good report card” but that the reasons for a small drop in satisfaction in some areas would be examined.“Today’s survey is another way of giving students a voice on their experience at university and it’s a survey that universities pay close attention to.            “83 per cent of students in Scotland are satisfied with the quality of their course, 89 per cent think staff are good at explaining things and 85 per cent think the course is intellectually stimulating. “That’s a very strong report card for our universities but we’ll obviously want to try to understand what sits behind the minor, 1 per cent drop in overall satisfaction amongst full-time students and a three per cent drop amongst part-time.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4774174.1532601783!/image/image.jpg","title":"end of era as john menzies offloads distribution arm","story":"        Logistics group John Menzies has entered into a conditional agreement to sell its print media division Menzies Distribution to investment funds managed by \u0026#8220transformational\u0026#8221 private equity investor Endless LLP in a \u0026#16374.5 million deal.

The Edinburgh-based group was founded in 1833 with the opening of a bookshop on Edinburgh’s Princes Street, which began selling The Scotsman newspaper over the counter and Menzies became known for retailing and wholesaling.            As part of the disposal, Menzies will retain a 10 per cent equity stake in the business, while Menzies Distribution will be responsible for the funding of Section B of the Menzies defined benefit pension scheme, which represents 17 per cent of the assets and liabilities of that scheme as at 31 December.John Menzies chairman Dermot Smurfit said: “I am delighted to announce today the sale of Menzies Distribution. In doing so we create a ‘pure play’ aviation services business that operates in a structural growth market and is very well-placed to take advantage of the many exciting opportunities that exist.”Upon completion of the disposal, which is subject to shareholder approval and expected to complete in September, Forsyth Black, currently president and managing director of Menzies Aviation, will be appointed chief executive of John Menzies and will be supported by Giles Wilson, chief financial officer and John Geddes, group company secretary and corporate affairs director.Smurfit added: “In his role as Menzies CEO, Forsyth Black will now focus on growing our market share in the aviation services market, increasing our operating margins and continuing to deliver excellent services to our customers.”The firm is set to report its interim results on 14 August."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4774586.1532628570!/image/image.jpg","title":"jim duffy i lapped up brexit s fairytale but it s become a nightmare","story":"        The goodies always win in fairytales, but in real life Brexit bad guy Boris seems poised for victory, writes Jim Duffy.                There is nothing better than a cracking fairytale when everything works out in the end with the main characters dancing into the sunset. Having overcome obstacles, barriers and nasty people, our wanderers sail away in a dream world of happiness and bliss. It warms our cockles and makes us feel all gooey inside. From Disney’s Cinderella to Tarzan to Shrek, good will win through and love will save the day.            And as always the baddie or villain gets his or her comeuppance and is cast aside. The villain learns his or her lesson and either falls off a cliff or eats lots of humble pie. But in the Brexit fairytale, the villain keeps winning and it’s spoiling the ending for me...            For many of you, Boris Johnson was a joke and a joker. He was happy to hang from a zip wire in London, ensuring all the press put his picture front of stage in the next day’s editions. He just loved the fact that his hair was literally all over the place and in need of some care and attention. It was and is messy and disheveled – all the time, making him look a bit clumsy and cute. He basked in the knowledge that the Tory-leaning broadsheet, The , would hire him at the drop of a hat to write his column, giving him that elevated platform he needed to point the finger at others. But, in this fairytale, Brexit Boris just will not leave us all alone to get on with the film. He keeps calling a halt to production. No, this baddie will not learn his lesson.I was one of those gullible idiots who swallowed the Brexit Bus slogans – hook, line and sinker. Hundreds of millions of pounds would come back to the UK each week and our NHS would swallow it up to keep this stalwart of British society prospering. READ MORE: |UK to stockpile food in event of no-deal BrexitAlong with Nigel Farage, Boris was front and centre in the Brexit campaign. It appeared these two characters were key to the plotline. They were partners in crime, but likeable rogues who were happy to swill a pint at the local village pub or get involved in some crazy prank. Were they the goodies or the baddies though? Then the unthinkable happened and we all woke up to the next instalment in our fairytale. These two had pulled it off.              Farage then did a runner. He has carved out a tidy media career with LBC in London. It is estimated that his media earnings are topping £700,000 a year. Well done Nigel. And who knows, Her Majesty may even honour him with that knighthood. It’ll be “Arise Sir Nigel”, as he distances himself from the nightmare he has helped create. But, this character is only now reduced to a sub-plot in our fairytale. The main protagonist and staring role goes to Boris. And I’m now convinced this baddie may be unstoppable.  No doubt the Tory grandees wanted him in power to give him a flavour of what it was like working with others. So, Mrs May was told to give him a seat at the table. The office of Foreign Secretary beckoned and he was completely unimpressive. Why? Because in this fairytale, he was plotting for more. He wants it all. He wants a shot at the title.My question to the screenwriters of our fairytale is this: Is the baddie not supposed to die or get trampled by rampaging wildebeest? Surely, you are not going to let the villain win the day?  No sooner had Johnson resigned, in what can only be described as a staged media directors cut, than he starts writing for the . The first thing he does is have a go at Sadiq Khan on London’s rising knife crime and violence. Now, let me see. How convenient is that Boris?

The one you, Boris, created and we are all suffering from as a result – Brexit. You cannot just whitewash yourself out of this one, hoping that some other patsy will pop up and take the blame. No, you wanted it, you sold it and now you need to run with it! We want a happy ending, Boris, and only you have the answer. After all, you had the answers 18 months ago...Does it feel like I’m being a bit accusatorial? Am I being too harsh on this Boris character? Are there other baddies in the background pulling his strings and writing the ending of our fairytale?This is our reality today as we prepare for a no-deal Brexit, WTO rules and a whole raft of sub-plots that we have not even considered. And we Scots are powerless to intervene in any way. The First Minister has tried. To be fair, Nicola Sturgeon must be sick to her back teeth of this baddie, wondering how she can have him written out of each scene. But, like Dr Legg in Eastenders, he keeps coming back.I’m afraid folks, there is no happy ending to our fairytale. Boris will make sure of that. Just as the world is burning, this baddie wants the hot seat, so he can rule and fulfil his potential and and make Boris 2, Boris 3: This Time it’s Personal, etc. It’s his movie and sequels and we are all bit-parts.              I wonder if he wakes up in the morning and sings that Lion King song, ‘I just can’t wait to be king!!’ The only problem with all of this is our fairytale has been turned upside down. Maybe it’s time we all left in search of Narnia.

Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz, who hosted the Prime Minister at a music festival in Salzburg yesterday, said he believed Brexit talks were going “quite well”, but warned that the UK should seek the closest possible ties to the EU. Mrs May also held talks with the Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis, who leads a Eurosceptic government that Downing Street hopes will speak up in favour of a EU concessions to grant the UK a good Brexit deal.            However, the Czech state secretary for European affairs said his government would not help the Prime Minister find “loopholes” in the EU negotiating position insisted there was unity behind Mr Barnier’s approach to the talks and the Prime Minister would struggle to find “loopholes” in the EU’s position. “It is almost physically impossible to have, at the same time, full regulatory autonomy on one side and full market access,” Ales Chmelar said.            “There needs to be a certain balance between the rights and obligations in those terms.”This week saw the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier deal the Prime Minister a serious blow by rejecting a key plank of her Brexit strategy, a “facilitated customs arrangement” under which the UK would apply EU tariffs and customs checks on goods in transit to the continent.Mr Barnier said the EU “cannot and will not accept” a third country administering its customs rules.That stance was backed by Mr Chmelar, who said it would be a “clear problem” for the EU to “not have a mechanism to control its borders”.In spite of a warm welcome in Austria from Mr Kurz, there was little comfort for Mrs May in his remark before their meeting that the Chancellor viewed Brexit “very negatively”.            Mr Kurz added: “It has been taken by the British people so now we have to find a way to deal with it, and from our point of view it is important to avoid a hard Brexit”.Former Brexit minister Steve Baker has claimed the EU is pushing the UK towards a possible “capitulation”, forcing it to choose between leaving without a deal or accepting Brussels’ terms.Mr Baker, who resigned in response to Mrs May’s Chequers plan, said Brussels was attempting to get the UK to remain in both the single market and customs union.“Chequers was bound to be the beginning of the EU pushing the UK to the unacceptable combination of EEA [European Economic Area] and customs union membership,” Mr Baker said on Friday.            “On this road, eventually we will reach a fork between final capitulation or exit with no agreement.”Mr Baker said it would be “far better to find the political and administrative will to solve the problems of the UK border with Ireland through an advanced FTA [free-trade agreement]”.Meanwhile, Eurosceptics warned against any attempt to extend the Article 50 process in the event a deal hasn’t been stuck by the UK’s exit date in March 2019.That option was firmly rejected by Cabinet minister Liam Fox and influential backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg, with Mr Fox warning: “To attempt to extend our membership even longer, many voters would regard as a complete betrayal by the political class, and I think they would be right.”Mr Rees-Mogg, leader of the pro-Brexit European Research Group of Tory MPs, said: “Liam Fox is right, extending Article 50 is the definition of failure for the Government.”            Experts have warned that Mrs May’s Brexit blueprint will stop the UK from joining a new free trade agreement bringing together some of the world’s fastest-growing economies.Free trade with the EU in agricultural and manufactured goods would make it “most unlikely” that the UK could also join the 11-member Trans-Pacific Partnership, according to a Policy Exchange think-tank paper."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4774013.1532550395!/image/image.jpg","title":"strictly come dancing sensation ed balls on his newest tv show","story":"        Ed Balls is discussing the dos and don\u0026#8217ts of donning a leotard.                No, he’s not referring to his Strictly Come Dancing days (in case you missed it, he was the unexpected star of the 2016 series).            The former politician, 51, actually wears a skimpy Union flag number to enter the wrestling ring in new BBC Two show, Travels In Trumpland With Ed Balls.            “I’m not someone who previously had bikini line concerns, but they wanted me to wear a really tight-cut leotard, and I thought it would be unflattering,” quips the Norwich-born father-of-three, who’s married to Labour MP Yvette Cooper.“I got a pair of black boxers under it. Had I only worn the bikini line, that might have ruined it for the viewer…”He decided not to shave his legs and torso, like his fellow wrestlers did, either.“My kids think dads should be embarrassing but that I substantially overachieve,” he adds with a grin.“I could explain to my 13-year-old why it was important to do the wrestling, but if I’d have been waxed and shaved, she would have said it was too much.”            The factual entertainment series sees the ex-shadow chancellor walk in the shoes of a variety of supporters of US President Donald Trump, to try and understand why they voted for him.“Lots of people will assume they’re either deluded and don’t understand, or extreme and dangerous, but we just met really nice, ordinary people,” he says.“I thought that after the first year Trump would be losing support, but we didn’t find that at all and it wouldn’t surprise me at all if he won a second term.”The three episodes look at different issues facing Americans, whether that’s the gun control movement or immigration policies, and how they feel about their country since former reality star Trump was elected in 2016.            “I thought he’d drop the wild persona and become a more reasonable, centrist president but he hasn’t at all,” Balls notes.“You assume it can’t get worse, and it does.”As well as being an insightful and entertaining series, what might surprise viewers is how emotional it is to watch at times.In the first episode, Balls stays at a farm with a group of war veterans, and as well as hearing their thoughts on Trump, he joins them round a campfire for a toast to friends who lost their lives in service.And he asks to toast to Labour MP Jo Cox, a mum-of-two who was murdered by a far-right extremist outside her constituency surgery in Birstall, near Leeds, a week before the EU referendum.            “The only thing which felt comparable to me was Jo, who I knew very, very well,” Balls confides of the moving scene. “I did a lot of campaigning and fundraising with her.“From a personal point of view... Jo losing her life is a terrible thing, obviously, but I’m somebody who has three kids, and a partner who does exactly the same kind of surgeries every Friday, so it could absolutely have been us.“I could both think about what it’s like to be Jo but also think about what it’s like to be her family.”Balls agrees that competing on Strictly – on which he won fans over with his memorable salsa to Gangnam Style – showed the public a different side to him.“People kept saying to me, ‘We always knew you were a politician but it’s great to see you’re a human being as well’.”With presenting this documentary series taking him out of his comfort zone once again, he says we can expect to see even more of his personality.“It’s impossible to be in a character for so many hours [of filming] each day, so it’s impossible to conceal who I am.” Did he look to an experienced interviewer like Louis Theroux for inspiration?“I took a decision that I shouldn’t watch anyone else doing this kind of thing until we had made the first episode. I didn’t want to try and be someone else.“If you asked me what the genre is, it’s a mix of old-style, early Louis Theroux meets The Real Marigold Hotel and little bit of Ruby Wax.“I tried to let the characters do the talking. I reveal my opinions to camera but not to the people I’m with.”It was the 2015 general election when Balls lost his seat in the Morley and Outwood constituency, in West Yorkshire.And he doesn’t seem to envy those currently working as an MP.“I’m regretful politics is so chaotic at the moment, and I look back at better times wistfully,” he says.“But if you said to me, ‘You could be in Parliament or you could do this show at the moment’, I’d definitely choose this show.”"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure.

One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions (£16?), Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"blue green algae found in tingwall ","story":"Another loch has been found to contain blue green algae, this time the Loch of Griesta in Tingwall.\nNotices will be posted next to the loch warning against contact with the algal scum.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s environmental health department received notification of the discovery from the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency.

I think if there’s any doubt in any competitor’s mind, that will show up a weakness.\n“So it’s important our guys feel confident and from the experience of Shetland inter-county matches before – of which me and [assistant manager] Robert [Geddes] have had a couple – we know that this team is capable of meeting the standard required to win.”\nHowever, Main is under no illusion about the scale of the challenge facing his side.\nHe said: “Orkney at this moment in time in my mind are clear favourites [due to] their home record over the last year, albeit in a different format – the North Caledonian competition.\n“In addition, two years ago we went with great confidence and unfortunately came away with a defeat so we know they are extremely strong and difficult on their home park.”\n *Eighteen players will be travelling but only 16 can be selected for the match.\nMeanwhile, hopes are high that the Shetland women’s hockey team can improve on their recent record against Orkney.\nThis year’s game will see Orkney attempt to record a 14th straight victory.\nShetland’s last success came via a penalty shoot-out after a 2-2 draw in 2003, but joint coaches Derek and Brenda Leask believe the team is close to finally turning the corner.\nDerek Leask said: “The team is well prepared and have been focusing on strength and speed work with weekly Sunday morning training sessions at the Factory Gym at Whiteness.\n“Dhanni Moar and his coach Bryan Pearson, devised a 12-week training programme to have the lasses in peak condition. The squad demonstrated great commitment in tuning up in large numbers to every session. The hockey team really appreciated Dhanni and Bryan giving up their time to help them perform to their best in this fixture.\n“It’s been a long time since Shetland won the cup in Orkney [1982] but despite the reds’ recent success the team is confident of pushing them all the way this year.\n“We’re really looking forward to putting on a competitive display and showing that there is a high standard of hockey in Shetland too.”\nHockey squad: Megan Nicholson (Spurs), Francesca MacColl (Delting) Janetta Williamson (Delting), Rhiannon Inkster (Spurs), Megan Hibbert (Delting) Vicky Wiseman (Burra), Nicola Balfour (Delting), Kristen Jeromson (Burra), Emma Michael (Spurs), Aimee Keith (Zetland), Kayleigh Irvine (Zetland), Maggie Kay (Whalsay), Rhea Nicolson (Burra), Victoria Duthie (Whalsay), Cara Leask (Delting), Kristan Robertson (Burra), Stacey Laurenson (Burra) and Sarah Williamson (Burra).\n• Follow The Shetland Times\u0026#8217 website and Facebook page this weekend for scores and updates\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with 14 women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday.\n issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.

Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-visitorthebest-360px_Page_4.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league. Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Campbell-Stewart-MacLennan-Co.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

When you consider some of the sleaze, corruption and criminal scandals that have engulfed the British parliament during that time, that is quite extraordinary.- Michelle O\u0026#039Neill\nBritish MPs have voted to suspend the DUP\u0027s Ian Paisley from parliament for 30 days after a report found him guilty of serious misconduct by failing to declare luxury holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government. \nThe British Parliament\u0027s Standards Committee recommended that the controversial North Antrim MP be suspended after considering allegations that he failed to declare the two luxury holidays. \nToday at Westminster MPs voted to suspend the DUP MP for 30 days, one of the longest suspensions ever handed down to an MP. \nHe has also been suspended by the DUP pending a further investigation into his conduct. \nHis suspension will mean he is likely to miss a number of key Brexit votes at Westminster, further narrowing Theresa May\u0027s ability to get legislation through amid the growing chaos in the Tory party. \nHis suspension could mean that Ian Paisley may have to resign from the House of Commons. \nFollowing today\u0027s vote, the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, will write to the Chief Electoral Officer asking her to set up a petition which, if signed by 10 per cent of the electorate in North Antrim, will trigger a by-election and force the DUP politician to stand down. \nAfter the publication of the report last week, Sinn Féin called for Ian Paisley to resign. \nSinn Féin deputy leader Michelle O\u0027Neill called on the DUP to state publicly what further action it intends to take against Ian Paisley. \n\"Ian Paisley’s colleagues in Westminster have overwhelmingly voted to impose the most serious sanction handed down to any MP since 1949. When you consider some of the sleaze, corruption and criminal scandals that have engulfed the British parliament during that time, that is quite extraordinary.\n\"Despite this, the DUP leadership have yet to give any indication whether the party will be taking any action against Ian Paisley. We are told that party officers met at the weekend but all we have had since then is a bizarre defence of his actions from Sammy Wilson.\n\"The DUP leadership must end its silence on this issue. They need to be clear as to whether they are prepared to defend a lack of integrity in public office,\" she said. \n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27426  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\nJoint stewardship through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference amounts to an honest and responsible effort to protect and advance the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement framework.- Michelle O\u0026#039Neill\nThe British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference met today in London today for the first time in ten years. \nThe body involves ministers from both the British and Irish governments meeting to discuss a range of issues was created by the Good Friday Agreement in 1998. \nThe conference has not met since 2007, shortly before the return of the political institutions in the north when Sinn Féin and the DUP agreed to share power. \nSinn Féin have been calling for a meeting of the conference to be convened ever since the DUP collapsed talks designed to reestablish an Executive in February. \nSinn Féin Deputy Leader Michelle O\u0027Neill welcomed today\u0027s meeting, describing it as an \"important step\" towards power sharing. \n“Today’s conference of both the Irish and British Governments is an important step to help remove the obstacles to genuine power-sharing and for London and Dublin to fulfil their own obligations in respect to the Good Friday Agreement, the Stormont House Agreement and other outstanding matters relating to citizens\u0027 rights, legacy matters and All-Ireland co-operation.\n“In the absence of the Assembly and Executive at this time, the choice is between the protection of the Good Friday Agreement which is under constant attack, by the hard Brexiteers within the DUP and Tory party, or its abandonment.\n“We have made clear that for Irish nationalism any return to British direct rule would represent its abandonment and is therefore unacceptable.\nMichelle O\u0027Neill said both the British and Irish governments have a responsibility to ensure the Good Friday Agreement is implemented. \n“Together both governments have a clear duty under the Good Friday Agreement to make determined efforts to support the re-establishment of the institutions.\n“Joint stewardship through the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference amounts to an honest and responsible effort to protect and advance the full potential of the Good Friday Agreement framework.\n“The conference allows both governments to co-operate at all levels on all matters and despite the fact they allowed it to lapse, having not met since 2007, we welcome today’s meeting and the fact the Governments themselves are getting back on board with this process,\" she said. \n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27427  ","story":" Declan Kearney\nSinn Féin National Chairperson\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language - Declan Kearney\nAntrim and Newtownabbey Borough council is overwhelmingly unionist.\nThe Borough makes up the larger part of my South Antrim constituency.\nOn the 26th February last the council rejected a petition to support the provision of bilingual (English and Irish) streets/roads signage in the area.\nUnionist councillors then decided to go a step further and passed a motion committing Antrim and Newtownabbey council to an ‘English only’ policy.\n\nThat was a ridiculous and stupid stance to adopt.\nIt is also unlawful.\nThis new council policy is in breach of Article 11 of the Local Government Order 1995, and it violates the European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages.\nBut it is also an affront to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect and equality enshrined within the Good Friday Agreement (GFA).\nThe decision taken was a deeply insulting message aimed directly at those who live and pay rates within Antrim and Newtownabbey who identify as Irish citizens, who cherish the Irish language, and Gaelic cultural traditions.\nIt does not matter in the narrow, blinkered world of those who control political unionism in Antrim and Newtownabbey council that the Irish language and cultural identity actually matters to a significant section of rate payers in the borough.\nThe Gaelic Athletic Association runs deep in this part of County Antrim. It is central to community life and is active across the local community, working collaboratively with other sporting codes and community and civic organisations.\nThere are eight Gaelic Athletic Clubs active within the local council boundaries, with a combined membership reaching into thousands.\nPromotion and use of the Irish Language has been historically strong in the area. The language has become even stronger in the last 30-40 years particularly.\nToday in terms of Irish medium education (IME), four Naíscoileana (preschools) flourish, and there are two gaelscoileanna (primary schools), and another English medium school with IME provision.\nThe demand for IME in South Antrim is growing.\n\nSo, many citizens in South Antrim possess an innate sense of their own Irishness. It really matters to them.\nLike everywhere else in Ireland the rich local heritage and history of townlands, place names, geography, and topography of South Antrim cannot be understood without reference to the Irish language.\nTo take two local examples: Cranfield has its origins in Creamh choill, the woodland of the wild garlic: Farranflugh is the anglicised version of Fearainn Fliuch, otherwise, the boggy or wet ground.\nBilingual signage captures that rich heritage by making it visible and providing an educational reference point for the local community and visitors.\nThe council’s ‘English only’ policy effectively air brushes out access to a heritage we all share regardless of political allegiance.\nThe English language is only a small part of who we are and where we have come from as a community.\nSome in the leadership of both the DUP and UUP have sought to weaponise the Irish language and to demonise those who support its use and visibility.\nThey have prosecuted their own version of a ‘project fear’ which deliberately misrepresents the campaign for Irish language rights as cultural warfare.\nThat type of exclusive and bigoted mind-set goes right to the crux of why the political institutions do not correctly exist in Stormont.\nThe DUP wrecked power sharing and partnership in recent years as the culmination of their 20-year campaign opposing the GFA since 1998.\nThose presently in charge of the DUP don’t want to exercise proper power sharing with Sinn Féin and are opposed to a rights-based society. \nThat’s the message which comes from the leadership of the DUP, and as a result, why unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey have now adopted an ‘English only’ policy in an act of abject disrespect to their Irish neighbours.\nPolitical unionism in South Antrim has form in the history of exclusion.\nNever once in the history of local government in Antrim and Newtownabbey have unionists shared the position of Mayor or deputy mayor with a Sinn Féin councillor.\nIn the 2017 Westminster general election 18.1% of the electorate voted for Sinn Féin in South Antrim.\nThat section of the electorate is synonymous, albeit not exclusively, with those citizens who consider themselves to be Irish.\nAn additional 12.9% voted for other non-unionist political parties.\nImportantly some citizens who vote for the unionist parties consider themselves to be both Irish and British. Unionism is not a culturally homogeneous bloc.\nSo when the unionist councillors in Antrim and Newtownabbey vote to adopt an ‘English only’ policy that tells a substantial cross section of local rate payers that they are unequal and do not deserve to be treated with parity of esteem and respect.\nThe only conclusion is that those in charge of the local unionist parties are not committed to a shared future and inclusion, and instead want to make South Antrim a cold house for the Irish identity.\nAnd, that mind-set is a throwback to the days of the old apartheid, orange state in the north of Ireland.\nThe ‘English only’ policy in Antrim and Newtownabbey borough council is now the subject of a judicial review.\nLocal Irish language activists and rate payers have begun a campaign to overturn this disgraceful policy.\nI have been encouraging local people to register their objections with the Chief Executive.\n\nIf there is ever to be a shared and united future in the north that must also apply within Antrim and Newtownabbey council politically, culturally and in respect of every aspect of community and civic life.\nLocal councillors and council officers have an obligation to ensure the operation of this council is conducted in a legally compliant, fair, equal, inclusive, transparent and democratic matter.\nThey should be actively promoting and ensuring adherence to the principles of parity of esteem, mutual respect, equality, and anti-sectarianism enshrined in the GFA.\nThat is what the republican and nationalist electorate and other progressives and fair-minded people in South Antrim expect from those charged with administering local government.\nCitizens in Antrim and Newtownabbey pay high rates with the expectation of good quality council services.\nThey do not pay high rates to be treated with such abject disrespect.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a05f.jpg","title":"65204  ","story":"    \nA TEMPLEPATRICK horse and her locally-based rider have won the \u0026#8364300,000 Global Champions Tour Grand Prix in Paris.\nEgyptian rider Sameh El Dahan has been based with the Joanne Sloan-Allen Sycamore Stables\u0026#160 team in Templepatrick for the past eight years and shot to victory with Suma\u0027s Zorro.\nHaving won the five-star Grand Prix in Calgary last year and the La Coruna Spain Grand Prix earlier this year, the pair beat top young Irish rider Bertram Allen by half a second.\nJumping on the spectacular stage of the Champs de Mars, next to the Eiffel Tower, El Dahan\u0027s victory allowed him to qualify for the LGCT Super Grand Prix in Prague this December.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"65205  ","story":"                \nAN Antrim nurse has made it into the record books at the World Powerlifting Championships in Canada.\nIn what she has called \u0027the most surreal experience of my life\u0027, Chlo�-Jade McDonald competed on the global stage alongside her idols, going last and finishing with 130 squat, 70 bench and a 177.5kg deadlift to secure national standard and three Irish records.\nShe finished third overall in the deadlift, scooping a bronze medal.\nCJ\u0026#160 is the current -57kg National champion and holds a number of Irish records including a phenomenal 163kg deadlift record. \nHer rise in the sport has been nothing short of meteoric, as she continues to juggle her intensive training schedule with a career as a psychiatric nurse as well as her duties as Randalstown Hockey Club\u0027s First XI captain.\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/a01f.jpg","title":"65208  ","story":"    \nSINISTER footage has emerged of a masked man pointing a gun out the window of a house at a pre-Twelfth Church parade in Randalstown.\nSunday\u0027s annual parade saw brethren from Randalstown District LOL No 22 and members of two local bands taking part in a church service and act of Remembrance.\nAs the bands and the brethren -

There are many, many more people who have no sight at all. \n  \n“I’ve done training with a guide dog so that I will be ready when the time comes but I’m not at that stage yet.”\n  \nBrian’s latest sponsored walk went ahead in early July and saw around 50 people joined in at very stages of the 13-hour hike.\n  \nIn the previous two years, Brian’s efforts have brought in almost \u0026pound10,000 and he is hopeful that his latest walk will be the best fundraiser yet.\n  \nBut it is not only about raising funds for Brian.\n  \nHe believes that the charity needs to be highlighted for the vital work it does in providing guide dogs.\n  \n“These animals are trained to the highest degree so that a blind person can put their full trust in thedog.\n  \n“That is the real key factor. The difference these dogs can make to a person’s life is not quantifiable. \n  \n“They are a an invaluable safety tool and a wonderful companion.\n  \n “It takes around \u0026pound56,000 to train each dog so you can see that there is a great need for support from the public,” he said.\n  \nBrian concluded: “I would like to thank ecverybody who supported the walk both physically and financially. \n  \n“I’d especially thank the Antrim and Ballymena Guide Dog Volunteers for their great support and I have to applaud the ‘route manager’, Terry Hasson for all his behind the scenes work and dedication to the event.\n  \nA ‘just giving’ page is in operation allowing members of the public to make contributions online.\n  \nSimply do a google search for ‘Just Giving - the docs 50 mile walk’.\n  \n Meanwhile, tickets will soon be available for a concert featuring Liam McLaughlin which is due to take place on Friday, August 24 at the Michelin Club.

It requires a cut and lift once a year in September where the meadow is mowed and the cuttings are lifted which prevents the grass from taking over. The school has achieved so much by doing less and spending no money.\n  \n“The principal, Mrs Lutton has been very supportive of the initiative and the groundsmen have ensured the meadow is looked after in the proper way.”\n  \nRachael said the meadow has been such a success that the school has agreed to extend its size. \n  \nRachel added: “These flowers have been lying dormont in the soil for years waiting for an opportunity. We now have over 20 of these rare flowers after just two years of changing the mowing regime.”\n  \nOther wildflowers found in the meadow include Self-Heal and Birds Foot Trefoil.\n  \nRachael continued: “We would love to see Ballymena schools become a showcase for meadow creation. \n  \n“Council has planted quite a lot of wildflowers around the town and it would be great to see less mowing and more and more of these wonderful meadows.” \n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/spb27-22-jpeg.jpg","title":"65134  ","story":"    \nTHE Vice Chair of the North Antrim Young Democrats, Ballymoney man Mr Timothy McLean has come out in support of the party leader Arlene Foster. \u0026#160\nLast week DUP party stalwart of some 40 years Alderman John Finlay blasted Mrs Foster in an open letter for attending a GAA final on Sunday.\nTimothy McClean, son of Cllr Alan McClean has responded to Alderman Finlay\u0027s comments with the following statement.\nMr McLean said: Arlene Foster has never asked Councillor John Finlay to abandon his conscious or his deeply held beliefs.

Noel McClean had cut short his holiday in Scotland and returned home when he heard\u0026#160 the news.\nSpeaking to a packed church at the Service of Thanksgiving Rev. McClean said Alex\u0027s death had, shocked the entire community, not only locally but far and wide.\n\u0026#8220We will never see his face again or benefit from his conversation and all the stories that made Alex such a legendry figure with such a wealth of knowledge.\nAfter Rev. McClean\u0027s tribute (see adjoining page), the Rev. Stanley Stewart of Castlerock said a prayer on behalf of the family, his wife Valerie being one of Alex\u0027s closest relatives.\nRev. Stewart said that: Alex had a long life, lived well, and had been a great supporter of the community through his lifelong involvement in many organisations and though his many friendships.\nOne of the many mourners at the service, was Mr Donal O\u0027Hanlon Chair of the Newpoint Players, Newry who have performed at the Ballymoney Drama Festival for 30 years in a row.\nMr O\u0027Hanlon said: We have attended 30 festivals on the trot and the linch pin for us in that was Alex as secretary.\n\u0026#8220Whether there was good adjudication or bad Alex was always there in the tea room to give support and say all that was good about the performances.\nSpeaking from London, Director of Newpoint Players Sean Treanor added Ballymoney will never be the same without him, especially at\u0026#160 festival time.

It was the first time he had competed since withdrawing from the Isle of Man TT Races back in May.\nDunlop was a revered competitor who had more than one hundred wins to his name at both national and international level. 15 of those came at the County Dublin circuit which ultimately claimed his life on Saturday afternoon during practice for the Open Race.\nWhyte said that after some lacklustre seasons where fans only got to see sporadic glimpses of his ability shine through, 2018 looked set to be the start of something special as Dunlop joined forces with Tim Martin in the Superstock and Superbike classes. \nThe team was being built around Dunlop, with Martin ending his sabbatical from the sport after just one year.\n\u0026#8220Tim threw everything he had at it for William, Whyte told Chronicle Sport.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/jbllegiofdoolfna1.jpg","title":"65370  ","story":"    \nARMOY Road Races Clerk of the Course Bill Kennedy says this weekend\u0027s 10th anniversary event is a \u0027massive milestone\u0027 for organisers.\nRace Week continues apace until this weekend with practice on Friday and Race Day taking place on Saturday.\nIt\u0027s been a massive achievement for the club, said Kennedy.

This is because Cameron’s health has declined over the last few weeks and we have just been fully focusing on giving Cameron everything he needs at this time.\n\n“It is with the greatest of pains in our heart that we share his journey is near over. We don’t know how long we have left with our beautiful boy but although he is sleeping mostly now he still is fighting with all his might when he is awake. He is in no pain and is just restful. We plan to be at home surrounded by family where he will be happy.\n\n“We can’t thank you all enough for everything you have done for our sweet boy. Because of the love, help and support we received Cameron’s life was greatly extended and in those times he had amazing days that we where so blessed to be apart of.\n\n“We hope to honour Cameron by continuing Cure4Cam. He has spoke of things he wants us to do in his charity and we hope we can do him proud by helping other kids with cancer and funding help and awareness for DIPG as well as much more.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAll the time in the world would not be enough with our amazing son. But we are thankful and honoured to have had the time we have had. We are filled with pride on the young man he has become. He fought this battle with more strength and courage than we could have.\n\nAs our hearts are shattering we ask for prayers. Prayers for Cameron in all that he needs right now, for his sisters and for us and our whole family. \n\n“We are going to take some time out.

It’s important that we show solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community and send a clear message that inequality and discrimination of any kind is simply not tolerable.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAfter the meeting the DUP issued a statement accusing Sinn Fein of hypocrisy.\n\n“The DUP outrightly condemns any act of hate or violence against any member of the community.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                   \t\n      \t\t\nDeputy Lord Mayor, Paul Duffy\n      \t\n         \n\n\n\n“The motion before the Council on Monday night was divisive as there was a significant element of hypocrisy given that Sinn Fein proposed a motion which focused heavily on hate crime, yet the IRA, which by Sinn Féin’s own admission has been inextricably linked to that party, committed some of the most heinous crimes during ‘The Troubles’ for which members of IRA have not been held responsible. \n\n“The families of victims of IRA violence deserve the greatest respect and the ultimate show of remorse for crimes committed against these victims by the IRA would see Sinn Fein ask specifically that those members of the IRA who committed murder and other acts generated by hatred, come forward to face the courts. All other attempts at deflection under the so called banner of ‘equality’ by Sinn Fein will be highlighted by our DUP council grouping.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“The motion appears to have been submitted very late in the day and the implications of such a motion are far reaching. Due process hasn’t been followed, no call for an equality impact assessment as is custom and practise when displaying flags and emblems and we are going against our policies and procedures.\n\n“We as a party fear that this result will open the floodgates for all groups to suggest flying all types of flags from civic buildings, we would argue very strongly that official local authority flagpoles should only be used to fly the nation’s flag or indeed the armed forces flag which incorporates the Union Flag. \n\n“These are the reasons we objected in the strongest possible terms to any other flag being flown and are somewhat dismayed and astounded that only the DUP and Independent councillor David Jones voted against such a haphazard and unprofessional approach. We will on this occasion have to consider taking legal advice and utilising the call in process.”\n\nFollowing the meeting Cllr Jones said: “I opposed the Notice of Motion. My reasons were quite clear. I have no issue or problem with the LGBTQ+ community. Where I have a major problem is such a motion being proposed by Sinn Fein while over a period of thirty years their military wing, PIRA, carried out the most heinous indiscriminate murders on people no matter their sex, religion, colour, age or sexual orientation and have to date offered no remorse or apology for their actions. I do not believe Sinn Fein should be seen as s of minority groups, no matter who or what that group may be.\n\n“During a fractious debate members of Sinn Fein attempted to shout me down. They went as far a proposing a Motion of Censure on me to stop me from speaking at the meeting but following a vote this Motion failed.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“At the close of the debate and despite a rejected amendment being proposed the Sinn Fein Notice of Motion was passed. I and the DUP voted against while the UUP did not vote.\n\n“Once again I feel this shows the desperation of Sinn Fein to latch onto an issue they believe will show them to be the defender of a minority. No doubt they will say I am biased against the LGBTQ+ community. I totally repudiate this. I have worked with, socialised and have friends from the LGBTQ+ community. When I spoke to some of them before last nights meeting and I explained my reasons for not supporting the Sinn Fein Notice of Motion they were equally scathing of it saying they did not want to be used by a political party to bolster their image.”\n\nCllr Catherine Nelson proposed Cllr Jones be censored but this failed due to support from both UUP and DUP members. \n\nCllr Duffy said: “His disregard for the authority of the Mayor fell well short of the behaviour expected from members in the chamber.\n\n“In dredging up the past he used it as an excuse to deny this gesture of solidarity to members of the LGBTQ+ community. I am delighted our motion passed despite his opposition. We will be the first council in the North to fly the rainbow flag and that is something to be proud of.\n\n“I urge members of our local LGBTQ+ Community, and their families, to join me this coming Tuesday night for a celebratory event during Pride Week in Craigavon Civic Centre 7-9pm.”\n\nThose who are interested in attending the event are asked to contact the Lord Mayor’s Office on 028 3752 9633 as they need to know numbers for catering purposes.\n            \n

agent owen becomes secret agent","story":"\nMove over Tom Cruise, there\u0026#8217s a new Mission Impossible star in the making - Portadown Estate Agent Owen Matchett.\n\n                \nAnyone who follows the Williams Estate Agents Facebook page will know only too well they are given to more ‘off the wall posts’.\n\n\n   \n                 \n                \n\n\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nWell next week they are set to scale new heights of daring to promote the agency - by ‘dangling upside down from a helicopter’ in a Mission Impossible spoof video.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nEstate Agent Owen will transform into a Secret Agent - resplendent in full tactical gear - for the movie skit as he tries to place a sold sign on one of his properties.\n\n    \n\n    \n\n\n\nThrow in a some stunt driving and a 30 foot fall into an air bag and you have the perfect recipe for an eye-catching and fun video.\n\nExplaining the thinking behind the video Owen said: “A few years ago we did a James Bond skit for the movie Spectre coming out. It got 18,000 views. With Mission Impossible coming out this week, I thought I’d do a bit of a spoof,”\n\n\n   \n                 \n                \n\n\n\nFilming took place at Todd’s Leap in Ballygawley over the weekend and speaking before his movie moment Owen said: “I’m going to go for it big time, I’m just hoping people will find it amusing and entertaining.\n\n“It will involve a high speed helicopter chase, high speed rally driving, abseiling and me jumping 30ft into an airbag.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAnd, while we don’t want to give away the ending, the concluding message is ‘At Williams, no mission is impossible’.\n\nBut Owen’s exploits won’t just be confined to Facebook, as while he is being filmed doing his stunts a TV crew will be along to film him being filmed for a TV slot (that’s nearly as confusing as a Mission Impossible plot).\n\nThe company had approached Owen after they saw his James Bond spoof and had asked him, if he was doing something similar, to invite them along so they could cover the story.\n\nOwen went on to say: “I do these videos thinking outside the box, something a bit different from what other agents might do with housing market figures and such. I don’t do that type of thing.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“I’m a bit of a movie buff and love action movies and hopefully people will get a laugh and some enjoyment out of it.”\n\nThe video will be released on the Williams Facebook page next week - along with details of a competition to win a family day pass to Todd’s Leap.\n\nAnd to conclude in Mission Impossible style: This message might not self destruct but it is tomorrow’s chip paper!\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"a new fellowship of the rings is born","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nUNTIL\n three months ago, local environmental champion Aidan Crean had never seen a barn owl – which is why he looks so ecstatic this week in this photograph.\n\nAidan is holding a baby owl in what was the culmination of a project that is breathing new life into the fortunes of this spectacular and incredibly rare bird. \n\nA pair of barn owls – scréachóg reilige in Irish, meaning screecher of the graveyard – were found to be nesting in a derelict cottage on the shores of Lough Neagh, and – watched round the clock by another great West Belfast nature lover known to bloggers as Antrim Lens – the parents produced a record haul of five chicks. And just before the youngsters left the nest to take to County Antrim skies, Aidan led a team of birders to ring them. It was a marvellous occasion for all who took part. These participants now share a special bond, a fellowship of the rings not unlike that from the famous trilogy Lord of the Rings itself.\n\nIn April, Aidan was overjoyed to see his first barn owl when, after a three-hour stake-out of the old cottage with Dúlra, one emerged like a ghost from the window and out over the shimmering, moonlit lough. That night one of the most significant barn owl projects was launched – if the birds successfully bred, Aidan determined to ring the chicks, setting in motion a structured, monitored process to analyse the population of one of our most threatened birds, one which was on the verge of extinction in Ireland.\n\n“Now that they have rings, these chicks have become dots on the map of barn owls in the world,” said a proud Aidan. “They are five ambassadors who will contribute to a national scientific study of these birds in Ireland.\n\n“And I want the public to help us. These five birds will leave their nest by next Friday and set out to make lives for themselves. Their territory will be from Hannahstown right out to Lough Neagh. We want people to look out for them. If anyone sees one, we want to know. \n\n“You’ll often see an owl in your headlights, and if you also see a flash of metal on their legs, then it’s one of ours. And we want to know about it especially if you see one of them hurt and in need of help.”\n\nThe team weighed and measured the chicks, discovering that four of them were male. “That’s four new territories for breeding barn owls next year,” Aidan said.\n\nAidan and pals – including Belfast Media Group editor Robin Livingstone – set out to ring the chicks in a slick operation.\n\n“This was all about planning,” said Aidan. “We wanted to keep disturbance to a minimum so we had it all worked out beforehand.\n\n“Everyone knew their job, be it climbing the ladder to the nest, weighing the birds, writing their details in the log book, putting on the rings. And everyone was caring and sensitive of the brood. We only spoke when we had to and were gone as soon as possible.\n\n “Adult owls leave their chicks alone in the nest, so the two parents were sleeping in the chimney pot when we went to the nest in the rafters and they weren’t disturbed at all. Owls could teach us a lot – once the chicks are four weeks old the parents sleep in a different bedroom. They know they’ll not get any peace with the young ‘uns playing and constantly pulling at them because they want the bird equivalent of McDonald’s and Pizza Hut. \n\n“The parents go somewhere else so they can get a good night’s sleep rather than stay with their teenage brood.”\n\nThe chick with Aidan is about 40 days old – owls incubate their eggs as soon as each is laid, unlike garden birds who wait until all the eggs are laid before they incubate to ensure they all hatch together – so the five chicks are all different ages and weights.\n\n“This was pretty special for me,” said Aidan. “Despite a lifetime of birdwatching, I’d never seen a single barn owl until this year. To see five chicks in a single nest is phenomenal. This is one of the biggest broods ever recorded, and shows that the birds here are healthy and finding plenty of food.”\nThe old abandoned cottage is on land belonging to the owner of Randox Laboratories Dr Peter Fitzgerald, who is said to be delighted that barn owls have chosen to nest there and is backing the study of the chicks.\n\nAidan added: “There may be only a couple of pair of breeding barn owls in the whole north of Ireland, so these chicks are precious and represent hope that they can make a comeback. A big congratulations is due to everyone concerned.”\n\n* If you’ve seen anything interesting or have any nature questions, you can text Dúlra on 07801 414804.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Generation-identity.png","title":"fascist graffiti re emerges in north belfast","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\nA SINN Féin councillor has stressed the importance of challenging the far-right after the appearance of graffiti promoting a new fascist group in North Belfast.\nLogos representing the white supremacist Generation Identity movement were daubed on street furniture on the Cavehill Road, but were quickly removed due to the fast actions of Cllr Mary Ellen Campbell and maintenance workers from the Belfast City Council.\nGeneration Identity describe themselves as a “movement aimed at preserving the ethnocultural identity of Europe”, and are active in 13 countries across Europe and North America.\nThe shadowy group has been trying to gain a foothold in the North and have already been involved in a number of public demonstrations.\nLast month they were part of the “Free Tommy Robinson” rally at City Hall where demonstrators were pictured giving Nazi salutes.\nSpeaking to the North Belfast News, Cllr Campbell said that fascist graffiti has become a more common occurrence in recent times.\n“It’s about the fourth or fifth time I have had to get this type of graffiti removed in the area,” she said.\n“We need to keep challenging them to prevent them gaining a foothold.\n“More and more people are questioning what it is because they started putting their logo up. If you look at their logo it isn’t immediately recognisable, it’s not a swastika, but people need to be looking at it as such.\n“North Belfast is a very culturally diverse area and we don’t want anybody with that negative agenda organising here.\n“We can see what they are doing outside City Hall and we can see what they are doing in other countries. North Belfast is a welcoming area and that’s the positivity that we want to promote.\n“Thankfully the Council removed the graffiti almost immediately after I reported it.\n“The people of this area have been very welcoming to families that are here from Syria and other countries. We’re a diverse part of the city and that’s the part of the city that I want to live in and promote.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"internet sensation set to go on stage","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nA WEST\n Belfast comedian whose parody of chart hits from the likes of Ed Sheeran – which has seen him go ‘viral’ on the internet – is about to headline his own show such is the demand to see him live.\nBrooke’s Paddy Rafferty, known to fans as Paddy Raff, will perform at the Foundry Club, formerly the Stiff Kitten, in the city centre on Friday July 27. The 34-year-old told the Andersonstown News how he had always been performing skits and his own take on songs throughout the years and decided that 2018 was his year to try his hand at stand-up.\n“Even back at school I would always try and change the lyrics of songs, whatever was popular at the time. The ability to flip lyrics dead quick always came naturally to me,” he said.\nPaddy explained how he started to play guitar in his teens and began to use his talent to create comedy videos which he has since posted on his social media Facebook page and which now have received thousands of hits.\n“I have my own take on Ed Sheeran’s ‘Galway Girl’ – I do ‘Broadway Girl’ and instead of Fountains of Wayne’s ‘Stacey’s Mom’ I sing about Stacey’s Ma. I’ve only really been performing since March but it has really taken off and it’s going really well.”\nPaddy said he is really looking forward to performing at The Foundry – which is already approaching a sell out.\n“I have always been a big fan of Billy Connolly, who funnily enough used a guitar as well in his early gigs. I’ve always loved stand-up comedy and never for a minute thought I’d actually be up there doing it myself.\n“It’s great to know that people will be coming next Friday to see and hear my stuff, I’m not being complacent, I’m putting the work in so it’s going to be a great night for everyone coming along.”\nPaddy will play The Foundry on Friday July 27. A limited number of tickets are still available priced at £8.\nFor more details on Paddy and his upcoming gigs follow www.facebook/paddyraff\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Paisley-tears.png","title":"mp ian paisley suspended for","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nDUP\n MP Ian Paisley has been suspended from the House of Commons for 30 sitting days – his party immediately also suspended him for an unspecified period pending its own investigation.\nThe North Antrim MP’s punishment follows his failure to declare two lavish family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government, following which he wrote to the then Prime Minister supporting the country in its bid to block a UN investigation of its human rights record.\nThe Seaker of the House of Commons described it as “a regrettable state of affairs”. A petition is to be opened ,which, if signed by 10 per cent of the North Antrim electorate will lead to a by-election and Mr Paisley being forced to stand down.\nSir Kevin Barron, chair of the Standards Committee, who delivered the findings, concluded that Mr Paisley was guilty of \u0026#8220serious misconduct and his actions were of a nature to bring the House of Commons into disrepute\u0026#8221.\nIn response, the DUP have suspended Paisley “pending further investigation into his conduct.”\nSinn Féin North Antrim MLA Philip McGuigan said the DUP cannot dismiss the fact that its Mr Paisley lobbied in defence of a regime with a shocking human rights record.\n “Much of the focus of the Ian Paisley scandal has revolved around his failure to declare two lavish family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government,” he said.\n“That is understandable given the focus on integrity in government following the DUP’s involvement in a number of scandals including RHI, Nama, Red Sky and dark money for Brexit.\n “These have all severely damaged public confidence in the political institutions but this latest scandal also calls into the question where the DUP stands on fundamental questions of human rights.\n“Amnesty International has said that serious human rights abuses were committed with impunity by the Sri Lankan regime during the conflict there.\n“Yet, after receiving his gifts from the Sri Lankan government, Ian Paisley actively lobbied the British Prime Minister to oppose a United Nations resolution to establish an international investigation into the human rights abuses in Sri Lanka.\n“Does the DUP leadership really believe that it is acceptable to dismiss the fact that one of its MPs lobbied in defence of a regime that carried out mass murder, war crimes and gross human rights abuses?\n“This is a litmus test for the DUP leadership and If Ian Paisley does not do the right thing and voluntarily resign, his party should compel him to do so.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"ms decision to close lisburns bow street mall store described as a blow to city centre","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nSDLP MLA Pat Catney\n has said the loss of the M\u0026#038S Simply Food store in Lisburn’s Bow Street Mall is “a blow” to the city centre, to staff and shoppers.\nIn a statement Marks and Spencer said it had opted not to renew its lease on the Simply Food store but that no jobs were at risk with staff having been advised that all existing employees at the Lisburn branch will be redeployed.\nThe closure of the food store, which has been open ten years and employs 40 staff, will further add to the many already shuttered and empty retail slots in the complex following the liquidation of its anchor tenant BHS.\n“Any loss of business in Lisburn is a drain,” said Mr Catney. “Any business closure makes it more difficult for retailers to build their product up,” he said. “It’s the old saying – there’s no point going to market if there are only two stores in it. We need to be working to lift, build, Lisburn city centre up together.”\nMr Catney told Daily Belfast that the issue of paid city centre parking is taking a heavy toll  as shoppers are choosing to travel and spend their money elsewhere.\n“I personally don’t like the paid parking from a trading point of view, the parking attendants are very, very strict and I’m calling upon the city centre management from us as MLAs to really look at a strategy that will lift where we work in the city.”\nMr Catney described as “disappointing” the fact the Belfast Rapid Transit (BRT) scheme was not rolled out to Lisburn. “You have this Glider bus running from West to East in Belfast that could’ve pulled on out here. This is a commuter town, there are so many developments being built here with a lot more young people and families moving here so I would’ve liked to have seen that considered.\n“I will be contacting Translink over the coming days to request that bus services to Sprucefield shopping centre are frequent enough for those consumers who previously used to shop at M\u0026#038S in the town centre.”\nThe M\u0026#038S Simply Food store is expected to close its doors in the autumn. \n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"name change opposed by belfast celtic society","story":"                                                                                                  \t                \t\n\nPLANS\n for Sport and Leisure Swifts to change their name to Belfast Celtic suffered a setback yesterday with the news that the Belfast Celtic Society has voiced their opposition to the move. \n\nThe Glen Road Heights outfit announced its intentions to change their name in a statement issued on social media earlier this month, with the aim of “improving the club and improving the footballing prospects for young people in West Belfast”. \n\nHowever, despite approaching the society prior to making their announcement, Sport and Leisure’s plans have been met with opposition from the Belfast Celtic Society. \n\nHaving distanced themselves from the name change in a previous statement, primarily due to their status as a charitable organisation, the Belfast Celtic Society held a full committee meeting yesterday morning (Wednesday) to discuss the matter. \n\n“The Belfast Celtic Society again reiterates that it had no involvement in this venture,” a spokesperson said. “The Society was only made aware of the development 48 hours before the public announcement. \n\n“The Society was surprised by this announcement and the reaction received from both our membership as well as the general sporting public has been overwhelmingly negative. \n\n“Since its foundation almost two decades ago, the Society has been approached on more than one occasion to endorse and support a range of commercial enterprises with the intention of exploiting the name of the club for commercial gain. \n\n“Over this period, our standard response has been that this is contrary to the constitution of the society which is regulated by the Charity Commission.” \n\nThe Society also expressed its concern that the families of the former players of Belfast Celtic were not consulted prior to the announcement. \n\nThe Belfast Celtic Society also claim that the trademark registered by businessman Anthony John Bonnar earlier this year is a new company and is not linked to the old Belfast Celtic Football and Athletic Company. \n\nHowever, speaking to the Andersonstown News, Sport and Leisure chairman Jim Gillen said that while he was disappointed the Belfast Celtic Society hadn’t supported the name change, he stressed that the club will be moving forward with their plans regardless. \n\n“We have everything in place. As of yet, the IFA (Irish Football Association) has yet to rubber-stamp it,” said Gillen. \n\n“We have to go ahead with it. We informed them (the Belfast Celtic Society) and we spoke to a few members. They seemed to think it was a good idea. They’ve obviously put it to their full committee and they have given a different outlook. There’s nothing we can do about that other than trying to change their mind. \n\n“We would like to go ahead with their blessing and indeed the blessing of everybody in West Belfast. We’ll stay positive on what we are trying to achieve.” \n\nSport and Leisure Swifts are set to play their first game of the new season against Armagh City on Saturday, August 18 and are hoping the name change to Belfast Celtic will be approved by the IFA before that fixture.\n"}]
