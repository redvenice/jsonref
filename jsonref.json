[{"url":null,"title":"Prince Harry father Charles barely spoken MONTHS","story":"Share this article Clarence House yesterday repeated that Charles had \u0027no knowledge\u0027 of the \u0027cash for access\u0027 allegations, but it did not comment on whether Harry raised concerns with him about Mr Mahfouz.The Metropolitan Police has made initial inquiries into Mr Fawcett, but a full investigation has not been launched.Ex-Liberal Democrat MP Norman Baker, who filed a criminal complaint about the matter three months ago, said: \u0027The fact Harry dropped this guy should have been a red light for Charles, but clearly he ignored that and drove straight through.\u0027Royal commentator Peter Hunt added: \u0027Prince Charles presented Mr Mahfouz with his CBE in 2016. Did Prince Harry tell him about his concerns in 2015?\u0027Just one of the many questions the Metropolitan Police could ask father and son if they choose to investigate.\u0027Harry first met Mr Mahfouz in 2013 at a pub in Chelsea, west London, owned by Mark Dyer, a former royal equerry, The Sunday Times revealed.They discussed the duke\u0027s charity Sentebale, set up in 2006 to help people in Lesotho and Botswana affected by Aids, following his gap year in Africa.The newspaper reported the pair met again at Clarence House the following year after Charles had also met Mr Mahfouz, where Harry allegedly joked: \u0027Has father beaten me to it and got the money?\u0027In February 2013, Mr Mahfouz donated £50,000 to Sentebale. Later that year he gave £10,000 to Walking With The Wounded, another charity of which Harry was patron.A spokesman for the duke said: \u0027The duke had one planned meeting with this donor eight years ago, did not introduce him to any members of the Royal Family, and expressed his concerns about the donor.\u0027The Prince\u0027s Foundation is being investigated by the Scottish charities regulator over claims it accepted a six-figure sum from a wealthy Russian donor which was later rejected by its ethics committee. An independent investigation into the \u0027cash for access\u0027 allegations commissioned by the foundation last week found \u0027evidence of communication and co-ordination\u0027 between Mr Fawcett and \u0027fixers regarding honorary nominations for a donor between 2014-18\u0027.Sentebale said: \u0027It is entirely normal and legitimate for patrons to meet potential donors, on whose support we depend. This includes the two donations received in 2013-14 from the Mahfouz Foundation – donations that we would not have accepted if we believed there was anything improper behind them.\u0027  Harry throws his own father under the bus  By Rebecca English To say that the Prince of Wales\u0027 relationship with his sons is complex is an understatement.Both William and Harry have historically accused Charles of being a \u0027laissez-faire\u0027 father – one more preoccupied with weighty affairs of state and his considerable philanthropic legacy than bathtime, wrestling matches and bedtime stories.It\u0027s not entirely fair, of course. The reality when it comes to the Royal Family – as with any family – is always more complicated.Like other royals, Charles was \u0027deeply, deeply\u0027 hurt at the manner of Harry and Meghan\u0027s bitter exit from the family in 2020.Still, as Harry and William\u0027s relationship descended into acrimony, their father tried to remain a non-partisan figure – partly because Charles has always shied away from personal confrontation with his sons, but also because he genuinely wanted to retain a Swiss-like neutrality between them.But, while disappointing, the statement from the prince\u0027s Los Angeles-based spokesman effectively throwing his father \u0027under a bus\u0027 over the \u0027cash for honours\u0027 investigation did not come as much of a surprise. The comment, which was belatedly issued after a newspaper highlighted Harry\u0027s own links with Saudi billionaire Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz, was at pains to try to emphasise the younger prince\u0027s own foresight. It glossed over Harry\u0027s private meeting with Mahfouz in a close friend\u0027s pub in Chelsea – and a subsequent encounter at Clarence House where he was said to have joked: \u0027Has father beaten me to it and got the money?\u0027Much as there is the notion of collective responsibility at Cabinet level, so is it within the folds of the Royal Family: defend your position directly and to the point by all means, but not at the expense of your nearest and dearest.Harry\u0027s statement, however, was liberally sprinkled with digs at his father – the reference to \u0027the CBE scandal\u0027, for example. Then there was the suggestion that the younger prince and his advisers saw sense at the earliest possible opportunity, when Charles\u0027 former senior aide Michael Fawcett – and presumably the Prince of Wales himself – did not.As for the claim that Harry \u0027expressed his concerns\u0027 about the donor... well, to whom? Certainly no one within his father\u0027s household has any recollection about this at all.Indeed, I understand that Charles wasn\u0027t even aware until this weekend that his son had met Mahfouz in a west London pub, let alone encouraged his charity to accept any money from him.If Harry was that concerned about the Saudi billionaire, surely he could have warned his father, possibly when he saw him at his London residence the same day.It was also no secret, subsequently, that Mahfouz had become a major donor to Charles\u0027 charitable endeavours – he had a wood named after him at Dumfries House, the Scottish seat of his charitable empire, after all.Contrary to claims in the BBC\u0027s recent controversial documentary on royals and the media that the three royal households are all too quick \u0027brief\u0027 against each other, Clarence House was again maintaining a dignified silence last night.But one loyal friend of the Prince of Wales felt obliged to ask: \u0027If Harry indeed had such deep concern about this man and his \u0027motives\u0027, then why on earth did he not tell his charity, Sentebale, to just hand the £50,000 he had given them back?\u0027Prince Charles \u0027deeply shocked \u0026amp hurt\u0027 by Harry and pair have barely spoken in 8 monthsPrince Harry and Charles: has their fragile relationship been damaged beyond repair?"},{"url":null,"title":"Covid booster vaccines likely going needed number years Pfizer boss claims","story":"Share this article Last week Pfizer\u0027s chief executive Dr Albert Bourla said global economies will probably need to rely on jabs for years to come to stay on top of new variants and counter waning immunity.As a company, Pfizer is expected to rake in £61billion in revenue this year, double its pre-pandemic takings, and if boosters are needed every year the company\u0027s takings could increase further.But Dr Bourla has denied profiteering from jabs, insisting each was sold to rich countries like the UK for about as much as a \u0027takeaway meal\u0027.The UK has ordered another 54million doses of Pfizer that can be tweaked to fight off Covid variants.While officials did not reveal how much the Pfizer jabs cost the UK, EU contracts show the bloc is spending about £16.50 per dose of Pfizer.The profits Pfizer makes from it jab have come under increasing scrutiny in recent days following explosive allegations that it only costs the pharmaceutical giant 76p per dose to manufacturer which it then goes on to sell to the UK.These claims are part of a Channel 4 Dispatches investigation due to air on Friday night. The programme also alleges Pfizer funded a presentation in which speakers claimed the jab made by rival company, AstraZeneca, could cause cancer and was not safe for immunosuppressed patients.The speech was said to have taken place at an educational seminar in Canada last year but it\u0027s not clear how many took place or if it was an isolated event.Pfizer has vehemently denied claims it sought to undermine AZ\u0027s jab, stating the presentations had been \u0027wrongly attributed\u0027 to the US drug giant and were carried out by a third party.The company has also said the 76p estimate on its jab manufacturing costs was \u0027grossly inaccurate\u0027 and did not take account factors such as funding clinical studies, and global distribution. Omicron has also proved profitable for Pfizer thus far with shareholders in the company snapping up £3.9billion in profit in the vaccine frenzy induced by the rise of the mutant variant. Shares in the pharmaceutical giants rose by 7.4 in the seven days to November 30 — after South Africa alerted the world to the mutant strain on November 24.In the week after Omicron\u0027s discovery, investment managing company Vanguard Group Inc made the most money from Pfizer\u0027s shares, seeing their total value increase to £1.3billion.Pfizer\u0027s chief executive Dr Bourla himself saw his stocks increase in value by nearly £257,000 during the week. "},{"url":null,"title":"Lizzo jumps ocean Art Basel performance Miami","story":"Share this article Though Lizzo didn\u0027t go into detail about what they connected over, it\u0027s clear that the two are close as she bagged a front row seat to Adele\u0027s One Night Only concert at the Griffith Observatory in L.A, which she described as \u0027incredible\u0027.Meanwhile, the Juice singer detailed how returning to the stage after the coronavirus lockdown knocked her \u0027confidence\u0027 as she wasn\u0027t sure if people would still \u0027care\u0027 about her.She said: \u0027I felt like I was going to be rusty, but it\u0027s almost like second nature.

Photograph: iStockAbout 480,000 primary school children aged between five and 11 will be offered Covid-19 vaccines after the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) signed off on their use.The State’s vaccine advisory body recommended to Government that the vaccines – a lower dose than the jab given to adults – should be offered to this age group.Deliveries of the vaccine are expected to arrive into the State in the coming weeks with a full rollout to children due to begin in January.The Health Service Executive (HSE) had been preparing a plan for the rollout of the vaccines to children but had been awaiting guidance from Niac before it put the plan into operation.Niac met on Monday evening to discuss the next phase of the vaccine rollout.The Department of Health and the HSE will now work to put these updates into operation.Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly said that Niac had strongly recommended that the vaccines be given first to children with an underlying condition and those who are living with a younger child with complex medical needs or with an immunocompromised adult.Niac advised that these three categories should be prioritised for vaccination at the same time as others aged between 16 and 49 with underlying medical conditions.It has recommended to Government that these vaccinations should be offered to the children with the same priority as booster doses for those under the age of 40.The HSE is currently offering booster and third doses to people aged 60 years and over, healthcare workers and people with weakened immune systems and underlying conditions.The rollout of the booster doses to people aged between 50 and 59 is expected to begin on Thursday.The HSE had been awaiting guidance from Niac on the first vaccine doses for children before deciding on when people aged between 40 and 49 would receive their booster jabs.The vaccine for children, which is about a third of the vaccine dose given to those aged 12 and over, will be given as a two-dose schedule, three weeks apart.Children aged between five and 12 account for the highest number of cases of the disease. The most recent figures show that about one in five infections in the two weeks to December 6th were among children in this age group, accounting for 13,400 cases during that fortnight.“As the country continues to experience a high incidence of disease, we have seen a significant increase in confirmed Covid-19 cases in this age group,” said Mr Donnelly.“While we know that most children will experience a very mild form of this disease if they pick it up, for a small few they may become severely ill. Extending the possibility of vaccination to this age group offers another layer of protection to our children and to those around them.”More than 93 per cent of the adult population has been vaccinated with initial doses. The HSE has administered more than a million booster jabs since the start of the rollout.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"omicron can partially evade pfizer vaccine early study suggests","story":"BioNTech chief executive Ugur Sahin: ‘We think it’s likely that people will have substantial protection against severe disease caused by Omicron.’ Photograph: Daniel LealAFP via GettyThe Omicron variant of the coronavirus can partially evade the protection from two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine, the research head of a laboratory at the Africa Health Research Institute in South Africa has said.Still, the study showed that blood from people who had received two doses of the vaccine and had a prior infection were mostly able to neutralise the variant, suggesting that booster doses of the vaccine could help to fend off infection.Alex Sigal, a professor at the Africa Health Research Institute, said on Twitter there was “a very large drop” in neutralisation of the Omicron variant relative to an earlier strain of Covid-19.The lab tested blood from 12 people who had been vaccinated with two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, according to a manuscript posted on the website for his lab. The preliminary data in the manuscript has not yet been peer reviewed.Blood from five out of six people who had been vaccinated as well as previously infected with Covid-19 still neutralised the Omicron variant, the manuscript said.“These results are better than I expected. The more antibodies you got, the more chance you’ll be protected from Omicron,” Mr Sigal said on Twitter.He said the lab had not tested the variant against blood from people who had received a booster dose, because they are not available in South Africa yet.According to the manuscript, the lab observed a 41-fold decline in levels of neutralising antibodies against the Omicron variant.Mr Sigal said on Twitter that figure is likely to be adjusted after his lab does more experiments.‘Substantial protection’While neutralising antibodies are an indicator of the body’s immune response, scientists believe other kinds of cells such as B-cells and T-cells also are stimulated by the vaccines and help protect against the effects of the coronavirus.The preliminary data does not indicate that the vaccine is less able to prevent severe illness or death. While lab tests are under way, BioNTech chief executive Ugur Sahin said last week: “We think it’s likely that people will have substantial protection against severe disease caused by Omicron.”The Omicron variant, first detected in southern Africa last month, has triggered alarms globally of another surge in infections, with more than two dozen countries from Japan to the United States reporting cases.The World Health Organisation classified it on November 26th as a “variant of concern”, but said there was no evidence to support the need for new vaccines specifically designed to tackle the Omicron variant with its many mutations.There is not significant data yet on how vaccines from Moderna, Johnson \u0026amp Johnson and other drug-makers hold up against the new variant. All the manufacturers, including Pfizer and BioNTech, are expected to release their own data within weeks. Mr Sahin told NBC News on Tuesday that BioNTech has data coming on Wednesday or Thursday related to the new variant.Less severeTop US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci said on Tuesday that preliminary evidence indicates that the Omicron variant of the coronavirus likely has a higher degree of transmissibility but is less severe.He said the US was doing its own tests to determine the protectiveness of the current vaccines against the variant and expects results sometime next week.Umer Raffat, an analyst for Evercore ISI, cautioned against reading too much into a single study, noting there has been significant variability in measuring declines in antibody levels in previous lab studies.“Let’s wait for additional studies to draw a mosaic,” he said. – ReutersEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"q a all you need to know on getting the moderna vaccine as a booster","story":"The HSE is reported to have large supplies of Moderna due to expire next month, so that will be the main booster vaccine administered over coming weeks. Photograph: Getty ImagesPeople due to receive their Covid-19 booster vaccine in coming weeks will primarily be offered the Moderna dose at HSE vaccination centres.The HSE is reported to have large supplies of Moderna due to expire next month, so that will be the main vaccine administered over coming weeks to the over-60s, over-50s, healthcare workers and younger people in vulnerable groups – though it will be restricted to people over 30.Anecdotally there are indications some people may be reluctant to take the Moderna vaccine. This may be due to Irish stocks about to expire shortly andor confusion about its efficacy. This follows the company’s chief executive Stéphane Bancel warning last week the Moderna jab may not be as effective against Omicron as it had been with the Delta variant.The HSE has confirmed recipients will have no choice on what vaccine they are given.What type of coronavirus vaccine is the Moderna jab?It is a new kind of synthetic “mRNA vaccine” – the PfizerBioNTech vaccine is from the same stable. They provide excellent protection against severe illness and hospitalisation – and have played a critical role in reducing Covid-19 deaths since being approved. A downside, however, is that they must be stored at very cold temperatures.In a half-dozen studies published earlier this year the Moderna jab appears to be more protective over the long term than the Pfizer-BioNTech jab. Protection against symptomatic infection was 93.1 per cent for people aged 60 and above who originally received the OxfordAstraZeneca jab and 94 per cent for BioNTechPfizer recipients a fortnight after the booster shot was administered.Should people be worried about receiving a soon to be out-of-date vaccine?In short no, as they retain the ability to boost antibody production within currently approved time s – though inevitably potency wanes over time. The Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Janssen (Johnson\u0026ampJohnson) vaccines were put on the market with emergency use authorisation of up to six months.This compares with a shelf life of two to three years for most vaccines and other medicines. This is an “inevitable consequence of getting the vaccines out of the door as quickly as possible” , chief scientist at the Royal Pharmaceutical Society Gino Martini told the journal BMJ.Months later,these “emergency” expiry dates remain in force for these vaccines. For approved Covid-19 vaccines, the initial shelf lives were based on data available at the time of submission for regulatory approval.The long-term shelf life has not been extended for any of the vaccines. A shelf life extension would require supporting evidence from relevant stability studies. Vaccine manufacturers are monitoring batches of vaccines with the aim of providing a longer shelf life probably the usual two years.What about the Omicron threat?While Moderna said existing vaccines including its mRNA version will probably be less effective against the Omicron variant, most experts believe they will continue to provide significant protection against severe disease and hospitalisation. It should be stressed, however, definitive indication has yet to emerge. That will be a matter of weeks, if not days.Moderna has confirmed it is developing an Omicron-specific booster though manufacturing the new vaccine would take time. Tens of millions of doses could be available in the first quarter of 2022, but scale-up would not happen until the second quarter – provided it is shown such boosters are required.What is the latest indication on the benefits of mixing vaccines?Evidence supporting a mixing of vaccine doses has hardened over recent months. A study this week shows combining a first dose of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine with a second dose of either the Moderna or the Novavax jabs results in far higher levels of neutralising antibodies and T-cells compared with two doses of the AstraZeneca jab.This finding also has important implications for lower-income countries that have not yet completed their primary vaccination campaigns as it suggests you do not need access to mRNA vaccines – and therefore ultra-cold storage facilities – to trigger an extremely potent Covid-19 vaccine response.The study also bolsters confidence that using the Moderna vaccine as a booster dose in people who have previously received the AstraZeneca jab should result in high levels of neutralising antibodies and T-cells.It follows separate data published last week suggesting the Pfizer and Moderna booster jabs can dramatically strengthen the body’s immune defences.The National Immunisation Advisory Committee (Niac) has decided not to recommend the Moderna booster vaccine for eligible people aged under 30 years “as a precaution”. A similar approach has been taken by authorities in France and the Scandinavian countries after early data showed a higher rate of myocarditis in young males who received Moderna compared to those who were administered Pfizer.For those aged 30 and over, Niac advises the Pfizer vaccine or a half-dose of Moderna should be administered after a six-month interval, though for operational reasons a minimum interval of five months may be used.There are early indications the infection rate is slowing down among those aged 75-79 due to the administration of boosters. Covid-19 infections have already fallen among those aged 80 and over, where booster coverage is above 80 per cent. It also describes as encouraging a decrease in the number of infections among healthcare workers.The rise rapid rise of Omicron elsewhere, which is likely to be replicated in Ireland soon, is the big new complicating factor. So all bets are off until clarity on the exact extent of that threat emerges.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"donegal town dealing with mica if it was in dublin this would already be fixed","story":"Moville, on Donegal’s Inishowen peninsula, is among the worst affected areas in the country for mica and for the students in Moville Community College, the subject is rarely far from their minds.  Video: Enda O\u0027DowdAngeline Ruddy, deputy principal of Moville Community College: ‘It’s on our children’s lips, it’s on our staff’s lips... There’s no getting away from mica’. Photograph: Enda O’DowdAt Moville Community College, everybody is talking about mica.“There’s not an English essay that’s passed to a teacher that doesn’t have a mention of mica in it somewhere... and every time you mention humanitarian issues it’s the first thing to the forefront,” says deputy principal Angeline Ruddy.“It’s on our children’s lips, it’s on our staff’s lips,” she says. “There’s no escaping it. There’s no getting away from mica.”The presence of the mineral in construction blocks – which makes them crack and eventually crumble – has caused structural damage to an estimated 7,500 homes in counties Donegal and Mayo, as well as smaller numbers in other counties.Mica has impacted the entire community, says principal Anthony Doogan, and the school community is no different.At Moville Community College approximately 20 per cent of staff and 25 per cent of pupils – about 20 staff and 100 families – are living in “mica homes” even more have siblings and parents who are affected.“I have five siblings, and four of them are affected by mica,” says Ruddy. The one who isn’t lives in the US.“Where I live, in a half mile radius, 20 houses are affected. It’s everywhere we go.”Her children “know nothing else but a mica household” as they go about their daily routine, mica is “like an app running in the background for every one of us.“‘Is the house safe tonight?’ is a regular question my children will ask,” she says. “I have cracks that are now the width of a two-euro coin, which means my gable is starting to move away from the wall of my house. I don’t know, really, if we are safe any longer.”Others tell a similar story. Special needs assistant Barry Moore’s home is crumbling his daughter was riding her bike around the house when “a lump of plaster fell off... it was near enough to scare her, and me.”“You’re lying at home at night and you hear the walls moving. It’s scary, to think you’re living in a place that is meant to be your safe place and you’re hearing the walls cracking.”Five of the special needs assistants – nearly half of the special needs staff – have mica homes, and so do some of the students they support. A hoist used by one child is attached to a crumbling mica wall, while foster parents have bought two mobile homes to house their children with complex needs.“They need routine, they need to know what happening... they’re going to be moved into two mobile homes behind their house and watch their house getting knocked down,” says Moore.In school, he says, you can “see the children who have mica, or whose houses have mica. They are, like their parents probably are, nearly obsessed with the fact they have mica.“As staff you’re trying to accommodate and support children... but they’re going home to houses that aren’t safe and that are causing them grief and stress.”Guidance counsellor Sineád McCarron’s home also has mica she warns of “what’s coming down the line... this is just going to explode, really, in terms of the amount of support the students need.”As principal, Doogan has significant concerns about the physical and mental health of students and staff – not least through heightened levels of anxiety – and about the impact on students’ attendance and life chances the effects, he estimates, will persist for the next five to 10 years.The anxiety of students and parents “is having an impact on their work rate and their effectiveness at their studies at school,” he says.“Every secondary school in the country”, he emphasises, has seen the effects of Covid “We’re at the beginning of this cycle for mica and in two years’ time, when there’s a large number of houses in this community which need to be demolished and rebuilt, there will be severe anxiety and perhaps worse felt by a lot of our students.”There is also “clear evidence” of an increase in absenteeism due to illness – “they’re living in draughty rooms, the rooms are colder, the rooms are causing them health issues that they wouldn’t ordinarily have” as well as students from mica homes who have left school altogether.Brother and sister Shaun and Aoife Noone describe how their home is “falling down”: “If I put my hand in the wall I could just pull away some of the side of the house,” says 17-year-old Shaun.They have moved out so that their home can be demolished and rebuilt. “I don’t really have a study room so that’s affecting my study, because I’m doing my Leaving Cert now, and it’s harder to focus and settle down and get work done,” he says.“I feel disadvantaged, it’s unfair that most people would stress or be anxious about exams but I’ve got the pressure of my house on top of that, so it’s a bit hard on the mind as well.”Aaron Price (13) and his family have also moved out. “It was a lot to handle trying to go to school and do homework and trying to empty the house.”The Government this week announced a €2.2 billion scheme to rebuild mica homes in Donegal and Mayo, capped at €420,000 per home and with a sliding scale of rebuilding costs from €145 per sq ft for the first 1,000 sq ft to €110 for the next 1,000 and €100 thereafter.It has been criticised by the mica campaigners in Donegal as falling short. “Apparently a new scheme was decided but it’s stupid, apparently each square metre gets less money, that doesn’t make sense,” says Aaron.“We need 100 per cent, and I know we probably will never get that, but if it was in Dublin, this would already be fixed.“It’s not our fault, we spent a lot of money on building our house... why should we have to spend more and more money rebuilding our house?”The adults have done the figures each of those spoken to by The  is facing a shortfall of between €60,000 to €80,000. “If council houses are being built at the minute they are built on a rate of €150 a square metre,” says Moore. “What was being offered would work out essentially for our house at €127 a square metre, which would leave us paying €65,000 on top of what we would get.“My other half is a psychiatric nurse, we’re no millionaires, we’re working-class people and we live in an average size house in Donegal which is the average in the country for a one-off build, 2,500 sq ft.“If they had dropped the sliding scale part... 145 euro per square foot, that’s it, and then your rent and then your storage, I would say 90 per cent of people would have been happy and celebrating, but they put in a scale that doesn’t exist in any builder’s pricing.”“The cost to me right now is €79,000, and that’s just for the build,” says Ruddy. “My house is 2,600 sq ft... that gives a total of €315,000 of a grant. The builders have come back to me with €395,000.“I can’t borrow because I have a mica home... 100 per cent redress is so far from it, I don’t think I’m even getting 80 per cent redress.“My children are at the stage where I should be starting to save for their college. Am I going to build their house and deprive them of education? We’re facing these choices.”“People bought the material in good faith... yet they are being victimised to the extent of having to spend 40, 50, 60, €80,000, whereas other areas were given 100 per cent redress,” says Doogan.For him, it is about the value placed on people from this area, not least given that the school itself is still “nowhere near completion” 20 years after it opened. “We bailed out the banks for €64 billion, and they’re saying three or four billion is a huge amount of money, but it’s less than five per cent of what we gave to the banks.“The people up here paid their taxes to pay for the bank bailout, and people here, like me, paid their taxes to pay for the pyrite redress in Dublin and Leinster. People round here are saying, ‘is there a different law for us?’”McCarron, too, is clear: “How can we help people look after their wellbeing and instil value systems of fair justice when our own Government continues to let this happen?”“They’ve let us down,” says 15-year-old Aoife. “If this was happening in Dublin, I feel it would be a different story, because we’re that far away and we’re rural they say ‘ah, them Donegal ones, they live in big mansions, they can afford it’. We can’t. We need our houses fixed.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"storm barra widespread power outages and schools closed as severe weather continues","story":"Powerful gusts of wind and heavy rain signalled the arrival of Storm Barra to Dublin.

As of 6.45am on Wednesday, about 59,000 electricity customers were without power across the country, particularly along the western and northwestern seaboard.Continuing windy this morning, in the northwest, where northwest winds will continue very strong \u0026amp gusty 🌬️Winds will ease over Munster \u0026amp south Connacht this morning \u0026amp over rest of the country Sunny spells \u0026amp showers of rain, sleethail🌦️Cold with highs of 4 to 7°C. pic.twittervQClrI34hd— Met Éireann (@MetEireann) West Limerick had some of the largest faults, an ESB spokesman said. Crews are mobilising in the affected areas to begin the network repair.People are urged not to approach fallen electricity lines and if they come across them to treat them as live.Irish Water issued five “boil water” notices on Tuesday night, affecting more than 76,000 people.Water supplies across the country were affected, with a particularly high number in Cork, Kerry, Donegal, Wexford and Waterford, due to the heavy rainfall and high winds, which is causing flooding and power outages at water plants.The chair of the National Emergency Co-ordination Group said it was a busy night for emergency services, with fallen trees and debris on the roads.ClosuresSchools and educational institutions in counties that were under red or orange weather warnings were advised by the Department of Education and the Department of Further and Higher Education to remain shut on Wednesday.Schools in Dublin, Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Cork, Kerry, Waterford, Limerick, Clare, Galway, Mayo and Wexford were affected by the advice.The decision to close schools was taken due to the potential for storm damage to school buildings. Assessments will be carried out today, with the expectation that normal schooling will return nationwide on Thursday.The principal of a primary school in west Dublin expressed concerned that some parents would not be aware that schools in Dublin would remain closed due to the late time at which the weather warning was extended to the capital.Some universities have announced they are opening on Wednesday due to the orange warnings coming to an end.Trinity College Dublin announced the campus is “open as normal”, with all activities resuming, while University College Cork said it was reopening with “immediate effect”.Road conditionsBus Éireann announced a number of disruptions to its routes, largely the cancellation of school transport services in the counties that are affected by the school closures.Two early morning routes from Clifden to Westport and Sligo to Enniskillen were cancelled.Irish Rail said it is operating as normal on Wednesday, however some services are delayed due to adverse weather conditions. Dublin Bus said it is operating as usual.\u0026nbspAs gale force force winds pounded the northwest overnight, motorists were advised on Wednesday morning to exercise extreme caution due to the dangers caused by fallen trees and branches.Sligo County Council roads and fire service crews worked throughout Tuesday night and Wednesday morning clearing trees in every area of the county.Even after the orange weather warning expired at 8am, conditions remained hazardous in Sligo with many roads closed or partially blocked.Road crews were dealing with fallen trees on Tonaphubble Lane, the Gurteen to Ballymote road, the “side road” at Bertie’s Pitch and Putt off the N15, on the N17 at Ballinacarrow, the Riverstown to Drumfin road, from Quarryfield to Bell’s Cross, Bunnannadden, and at Drumbeg West (L5902 to L1902).Sligo County Council “strongly advised” people to stay away from coastal areas, with a combination of high waves, storm surge and high tide causing flooding.Residents of Ballincar, Springfield and surrounding areas were requested to avoid using the Mardyke Road during high tide from 8am-9am on Wednesday, and to use alternative routes such as Scotsman’s Walk.More than 1,700 customers in the Ballymote area who have been left without power have been told to expect electricity to be restored by 6.30pm.Lough Key Forest and Activity Park in Co Roscommmon will remain closed on Wednesday “for the caution of our staff and customers”.Five-day nationwide forecasts, weather warnings and rainfall maps Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside politics the life and legacy of charles j haughey with professor gary murphy","story":"Depending on who you ask, Charles J.

Photograph: Liesa Johannssen-KoppitzBloombergBundestag MPs gave Olaf Scholz a boisterous standing ovation on Wednesday morning after he was elected post-war Germany’s ninth chancellor.In a secret ballot, the 63-year-old received 395 votes out of a total of 707 with 303 votes against and six abstentions.Mr Scholz succeeds Angela Merkel after he led his Social Democratic Party (SPD) to win last September’s federal election, and formed a three-way coalition with the Greens and the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP).He takes office as Germany battles its fourth wave of Covid-19 and a faces a series of geopolitical challenges, including growing tensions between Russia and Ukraine. On Tuesday Mr Scholz and his future coalition partners signed a 177-page coalition agreement promising more generous welfare, investment in the battle against climate change and steady public finances without tax increases.Wednesday morning’s secret ballot set in motion a long day of shuttle diplomacy that was even more low key than usual due to pandemic restrictions.After accepting the vote, a grinning Mr Scholz donned his black mask again and was congratulated by parliamentary colleagues in a long line of fist-bumps. He was then due two kilometres west in Bellevue Palace to receive his official seal of office from President Frank Walter Steinmeier. Following this Mr Scholz returns to the Bundestag where he will take his oath of office around noon with parliamentary president Bärbel Bas.During a second visit to Bellevue, this time with his new cabinet, President Steinmeier will make a short address. All eyes then turn to the chancellery, where Dr Merkel will thank her staff and hand over power after 16 years.Watching Wednesday’s events from a Bundestag balcony: Mr Scholz’s wife Britta Ernst and his rarely-seen parents, Gerhard and Christel Scholz. Nearby sat former chancellor Gerhard Schröder, Mr Scholz’s boss for seven years until 2005, and Angela Merkel.Dr Merkel was given two standing ovations on her final day in the Bundestag chamber after 31 years.Just 11 more days and she would have overtaken her mentor Helmut Kohl as postwar Germany’s longest-serving chancellor. Instead she begins life as a private citizen with no plans, she insists, apart from things that interest her - now that she has the time for them.“I’ll try to read, then my eyes will fall closed because I’m tired,” she said in July, “then I’ll sleep a bit and then we’ll see.”Her fictional alter-ego, the crime-solving Miss Merkel, has no time for naps in a new novel by David Safier. As in his first successful crime novel last year, the amateur sleuth Miss Merkel and her loyal pug Putin have to solve the murder of a graveyard gardener in rural Germany. Among the suspects: two rival undertaker families, a stonemason and a satanist. After 16 years saving the world in regular intervals, even a fictional whodunnit sounds like a welcome change of pace for Germany’s first woman leader.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"History of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo role"},{"url":null,"title":"grinning is winning the us right is awash with laughing cavaliers","story":"US congressman Thomas Massie participates in a ceremonial swearing-in ceremony in the Capitol. Photograph: Tom WilliamsCQ Roll CallIt is not so much the guns as the grins that make the photo such a document of its times. “Santa, please bring ammo,” tweets US Congressman Thomas Massie as his seven-strong household pose with rifles in front of a blameless Christmas tree. His pun-strewn replies to accusations of bad taste confirm that this is “just” playful lib-owning at work. What, his entire being seems to ask, is the worst that could happen?Five years since the votes for Brexit and Donald Trump, it is still not understood how much populism boils down to antic rebellion rather than (the initial theory) economic grievance or (much more a leftwing thing) doctrinal belief. This is to some extent a movement of laughing cavaliers. Violence is not their wish, but nor do they recognise it as a plausible and unintended outcome of their doings.And why, given the lack of warnings from recent history, should they? Temporally, we are now almost as far from the second World War as it was from the American civil war. Few voters in the West have ever seen their domestic politics go catastrophically, life-endangeringly wrong (at least until the Capitol siege of almost a year ago.) Their appetite for political risk is therefore only natural. Consider it the civic version of the rash consumption and investment at the end of a business cycle, when the last crash is too remote to remember. “Stability is destabilising,” said the economist Hyman Minsky, who should have tried his hand at political commentary.To define the West’s problem as one of casualness, not wilful malevolence, is not to minimise it. In fact, it is much the harder problem to fix. The implication is that nothing short of a violent crisis will restore to people a healthy fear of the political extremes. Social media can be tamed, electoral dark money banned and education improved to little effect. These are tactical answers to a problem that could not be any more structural: in today’s grating argot, a lack of “lived experience” of the consequences of populism.Steady politics diesIt is a problem that by definition gets worse with time. When the second World War veteran Bob Dole died at 98 last weekend, the US did not just lose a dry wit and once-productive senator. It lost one of its few remaining messengers from the dire first half of the last century. Praise for him is really a lament for the generations who kept politics more or less steady from 1945 to just before the millennium.Liberals have had half a decade to study populism in its modern form. They still miss its ludic element: its treatment of politics as a kind of low-stakes team sport. Even those who credit it tend to blame the innate frivolity of iniduals, rather than a historic context in which no electoral choice has gone disastrously wrong in living memory. It cannot be a fluke that the most stable major democracy, Germany, is the one where the second World War, or rather its demagogic prelude, is simply never allowed to leave public discourse.If and when US democracy falls, giggling complacency, not moustache-twirling villainy, will be the presiding atmosphere. Of course, there are real believers and zealots on the American right. Former Trump aide Steve Bannon is one, as is the writer Michael Anton. But there were plenty of those in the 1990s and (in Barry Goldwater, a presidential candidate) the 1960s too. What has changed is the share of the wider populace who think no harm can come of extensively indulging them.Outsider cachetIn encounters with Trump voters and donors, a certain type recurs: unfailingly civil, vanilla in most of their tastes and often easier company than their leftwing equivalents. Some are just loyal conservatives. (Dole himself was not above a bit of tribalism.) Some, as is true of the most prominent Brexiteers, relish an outsider cachet that was hitherto denied them by their own wealth and whiteness. Almost all are hurt to be thought of as enablers of civic damage to their country. In toying with the likes of Trump, their main failing is one of imagination, not of conscience. They can’t picture the worst-case scenario. Two or three generations separate them from any salutary historical lesson about what a fissile material politics is.To regard anything in public life as “inevitable” is to succumb to teleology. Still, with the passing of Dole and much of his generation, it is hard to avoid the thought that societies grow rasher and more reckless as their memories of past crises fade. In other words, for the West, whose last existential mess is now a human lifetime ago, there is no avoiding the wages of success. It should expect its politics to wobble and lurch until such time as citizens taste the consequences again. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2021Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"watch kamala harris became incredible disappearing vice president","story":"Kamala Harris made history as the first woman, first Black American and first Asian-American to become vice president. But after less than a year in the post, she is a historically unpopular vice president, according to The \u0027s Washington Editor Rozina Sabur. As seen in the video above, where Ms Harris was once always in the frame during Joe Biden\u0027s major addresses, she\u0027s been notably absent from the president\u0027s side of late. “For now at least, it seems she is no longer Joe Biden\u0027s heir apparent,” says Rozina Sabur.“A number of Democrats seem prepared to challenge her for the nomination should Biden not seek re-election in 2024.”More from NewsCovid Plan B latest news: New work-from-home restrictions and vaccine passports expectedPolitics latest news: Tory MPs demand inquiry as Boris Johnson comes under fire from all sides over Downing Street Christmas partyThai billionaire sentenced to three years in \u0026#39Black Panther\u0026#39 poaching caseStorm Barra: Thousands left without power - with 60mph winds forecast to hit UKNew German Chancellor Olaf Scholz faces first test as US steps up pressure to block Nord Stream 2The EU to the Left.

It could make it illegal to try to help a son or daughter accept their body as it is rather than pursue a pathway to puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgery. It risks erasing the possibility for children to be different, to not conform to stereotypes and to work through their emotional turmoil. Instead of helping children deal with the fact that sometimes things can’t be easily resolved – that it’s possible to be a feminine boy or a masculine girl – the law could increase the pressure towards a more rigid choice.It ignores the fact that most children presenting with gender dysphoria find it resolves as adults. And it may shut down exploration of why there has been such a huge rise in the number of children who have concerns about their gender, why two thirds are girls, the prevalence of autism, or why gender dysphoria is particularly common among children who go on to become gay or lesbian adults.The proposed law follows a campaign by Stonewall to extend a ban on conversion therapy for sexual orientation, on which there is near universal agreement, to cover talking therapies that intend to change a person from being transgender. That sounds simple, but it conceals huge complexity, particularly as it relates to children.It requires the Government to define what it means to be a transgender child, as opposed to a child suffering from gender dysphoria. As there is no objective test, it moves the Government into accepting the principle of self-identification. Is the bar the assertion by a girl that she is a boy, or vice-versa? How long must they hold this belief? At what stage does legitimate therapy or conversations that seek to explore what might underpin a child’s assertion that they are in the wrong body become vulnerable to accusations that the intent was to change a transgender child?The legal defence is that there must be an “intention” to change the person to or from being transgender, and that the Government wishes to preserve talking therapies that support those who are “questioning their LGBT status”. But how do you define in law “questioning”? Is it compatible with a firm assertion “I am trans”? How does the Government take into account the risk of a chilling effect, where legitimate clinicians withdraw from providing support because they do not want to risk being dragged through the courts? What of freedom of belief and speech? Many people would argue passionately you cannot be born in the wrong body. They are currently free to express what they believe to be the case. But if gender identity is “how you feel”, and your feelings are altered by hearing others’ arguments, have you been subjected to conversion therapy?These issues are so complex and sensitive, you’d be forgiven for thinking the Government will approach the drafting of the legislation with care. That it would wait for the NHS’s Cass Review, which will set out a definition of good care for children with gender dysphoria. Yet the opposite is true. The Government has promised a draft bill for spring 2022. Only six weeks have been allowed for the consultation, two months to analyse the responses and make policy decisions, and a handful of weeks to draft the Bill.As director of legislative affairs for two prime ministers, I know there are times you have to work fast to get a bill on to the statute books, but there’s no deadline for this legislation. Nor does taking a little more time leave anyone vulnerable: the vast majority of activities considered conversion therapy are already prohibited. Those rushing to show progress for the “Safe to be Me” conference need to recognise that it will last only a few days, but the Act will be on the statute book for years and the Bill will take months to progress through Parliament.Lobby groups will also seek to amend the Bill to achieve other objectives. These could include lowering the age for cross-sex hormones and making puberty blocking drugs more readily available. If the Bill offers a definition of being transgender, alternative, more expansive, definitions could be proposed, potentially with the intention of amending the Equality Act, or the Gender Recognition Act.The Government must slow down. At the very least arrange pre-legislative scrutiny in a Joint Committee. It can go through the draft Bill, seek further evidence, test the policy, and make suggestions. It will help build consensus.Nikki da Costa is a former head of legislative affairs at No 10 Downing StreetMore from NewsPolitics latest news: Tory MPs demand inquiry as Boris Johnson comes under fire from all sides over Downing Street Christmas partyCovid latest news: New work-from-home restrictions and vaccine passports expected as Government looks to Plan BThai billionaire sentenced to three years in \u0026#39Black Panther\u0026#39 poaching caseStorm Barra: Thousands left without power - with 60mph winds forecast to hit UKNew German Chancellor Olaf Scholz faces first test as US steps up pressure to block Nord Stream 2The EU to the Left.

It is believed to have been built over several centuries, somewhere around 3,000 BC to 2,000 BC.While some have speculated that Stonehenge may have been used for healing or for studying the cosmos, a more widely held theory is that it formed the culmination of a funerary procession from the River Avon.Stonehenge and Seahenge are two of just 120 known henges in Britain, while there are over 1,000 stone circles which are more likely to survive the country\u0027s harsh weather conditions than their timber counterparts.The Seahenge timbers are among over 430 objects brought together from across the UK and Europe for what will be the British Museum’s largest exhibition for several years.The curators hope to dispel the idea that the creators of Stonehenge existed in an isolated and primitive society. The loans and items from the museum’s own collection come from across Europe, including France, Switzerland, Germany and Portugal and display the rich cultural world and networks of exchange within which neolithic Britons existed.The majority have not been seen in the UK before.“We think of Stonehenge as an English and a British monument. But actually, when you start to look at it, the tentacles of the root systems reach out across Britain and across Europe,” said Dr Wilkin. Also among the items displayed will be two remarkable cone-shaped gold hats, resembling those of a wizard, and the full Bush Barrow Hoard from the Wiltshire Museum which includes the finest example of Bronze Age gold craftsmanship ever found in Britain.More from NewsCovid Plan B latest news: New work-from-home restrictions and vaccine passports expectedPolitics latest news: Tory MPs demand inquiry as Boris Johnson comes under fire from all sides over Downing Street Christmas partyThai billionaire sentenced to three years in \u0026#39Black Panther\u0026#39 poaching caseStorm Barra: Thousands left without power - with 60mph winds forecast to hit UKNew German Chancellor Olaf Scholz faces first test as US steps up pressure to block Nord Stream 2The EU to the Left.

Take Emmanuel Macron, the French president, who yesterday saw fit to compromise his strong enthusiasm for the European Union.In a speech in Paris, Mr Macron openly condemned an attempt by the European Commission to promote nonsense. He was referring to its initiative, now disbanded, to fight a woke war by banning gendered words and phrases, such as man-made and ladies and gentlemen, and replace them with neutral and supposedly inoffensive terms like human-induced and dear colleagues.The president openly criticised the Commission, stating that a Europe that comes to explain to people what words they should or shouldn’t say is not a Europe to which I totally adhere. It’s nonsense, basically. Yet this is the same inidual who has openly called for closer fiscal and political integration between member states, who champions the integrity of the single market, and who despises Brexit as an insult to and repudiation of everything he holds most dear.Macron faces presidential elections next year and is trying to undermine the campaigns of Right-wing candidates Éric Zemmour and Marie Le Pen. A war on woke appeals to conservative opinion, particularly because it is viewed as a trans-Atlantic import in a country where suspicion of the United States is deeply held.But by openly taking sides in this conflict and opposing the march of wokeness across our cultural battlefields, Macron is challenging not just its failed bid to alter terminology, but the EU’s very foundations.He is inadvertently siding, for example, with the governments of Hungary and Poland, which have accused Brussels of imposing its wokeness, especially on LGBTQ rights, and openly defied it. Yet only recently, at an EU summit in June, he urged the EU to fight a cultural and civilizational battle to stop the rise of illiberal ideas, which he alleged threatened core European values.Macron’s ided loyalties – between the EU and his own electorate – have become clear before. After a French school teacher was beheaded by Islamists in October 2020, his government championed free expression, even offensive views like those supposedly held by the Hungarians and Poles. And Mr Macron also came close to challenging one of the sacrosanct principles of the European project – freedom of movement – when he promised to step up police surveillance of French borders to tackle the growing threat of terrorism.How, then, can Macron tread this political tightrope between his own electability and his most cherished values?He could do worse than emulate the very man he has recently picked out for fierce criticism – Boris Johnson. Over the years, our own Prime Minister has proved highly adept at appealing to many opposing strands of opinion. Although he infuriated the woke by referring to veiled Islamic women as letter boxes, his article never condemned them. And he was always liberal about immigration even though it was central to the Brexit campaign.In fact, over the next few months, we must expect French presidential rhetoric to become increasingly Johnsonian. Macron has recently urged his fellow French to defend the values of democracy, even though this is not something the EU, which has obstructed and even ignored referendums, has championed. Instead, such references are already resembling the rhetoric of Brexit campaigners who wanted to take back control. Of course, such political role reversals are hardly uncommon, but in this case the irony is particularly delicious.RT Howard is the author of ‘Power and Glory: France’s Secret Wars Against Britain and America 1945-2016’More from NewsCovid latest news: New work-from-home restrictions and vaccine passports expected as Government looks to Plan BPolitics latest news: Tory MPs demand inquiry as Boris Johnson comes under fire from all sides over Downing Street Christmas partyThai billionaire sentenced to three years in \u0026#39Black Panther\u0026#39 poaching caseStorm Barra: Thousands left without power - with 60mph winds forecast to hit UKNew German Chancellor Olaf Scholz faces first test as US steps up pressure to block Nord Stream 2Dogs prevent more than 100,000 suicides in people with autism in the UK, study claimsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"fought eus innovation crushing rules","story":"Bad regulation misleads people, stifles innovation, hits jobs and is a hidden trade barrier deployed by the European Union – in addition to the six per cent tariff we pay to import into the EU. Dyson has experienced this first-hand over the past seven years, in our drawn-out but ultimately successful legal battle against the EU’s flawed energy labelling regulation, which illegally misled millions of consumers.The case has not only revealed the complexity of EU regulation but has shone a light on the dark arts of lobbying in Europe. Today it reaches what we hope is the final act. We have already won the case to scrap the regulation in its entirety, but now we find out whether the European General Court will award us damages.To most people, the regulation in question may seem innocuous. The EU directive stipulated that every vacuum cleaner sold in the EU should display a label designed to show how energy efficient each machine was and help drive down energy usage. A good idea in theory, where the best would be given the highest A-grade and the worst a G-grade.In reality, however, the testing regime behind the grading was a sham. Flying in the face of logic, science and the EU’s own laws, the Commission decided that unlike washing machines and dishwashers, which are tested when loaded, all vacuums should be tested empty, in dust-free conditions that were nothing like real world use. It created false results and illegally benefited one group, principally the bagged European vacuum cleaner manufacturers.The label overstated the real-world performance of old-fashioned bagged vacuum cleaners, many of which were awarded green A-grade labels. As we found out from correspondence obtained through Freedom of Information requests, this was influenced by lobbying from European industry, including the leading German bagged-machine manufacturers who had much to gain from using regulation to keep unwanted rivals out. The sentiment felt clear. Ignore Dyson, they’re British.Only once people got their machines home did they discover the truth. Bags and filters would start clogging with dust – as they do – meaning the real-world performance of a so-called A-grade machine could be as low as a G. In addition, some manufacturers installed devices to increase the motor wattage as the bag filled with dust. This would not be detected in a test state, therefore circumventing the regulation. Dyson’s vacuums, in contrast, have constant performance and are tested on dust – 60 different kinds, in fact. What you see is what you get.Not only was this misleading to European consumers, but it also put Dyson at an unfair disadvantage. After a tortuous legal battle involving a lengthy appeal at the European Court of Justice, we eventually won our case in 2018, which had been initially rejected by the European General Court in 2015. The European Court of Justice found that “the General Court manifestly distorted the position taken by Dyson”. It “infringed its obligation to state reasons … erred in law and … distorted the facts and failed to comply with its duty to give reasons”. It was an indictment of how European regulation works.The flawed label was scrapped – one of only a handful of occasions when an EU regulation has been overturned. Revealingly, the Commission did not appeal this decision.The energy label is a case study in bad regulation and its insidious effects. It cost Dyson over a hundred million pounds, erting time and resources away from what we should have been doing – innovating, inventing, and developing new products. Investment destined for research at our two UK campuses, where we employ 3,500 people and support thousands more jobs around the world, went instead into lawyers’ pockets. Dyson fought this case for itself and to protect consumers from misleading regulations devised by EU bureaucrats and the European manufacturers they favour.Regulation, used sparingly, doesn’t have to be damaging to innovation. Dyson, for instance, was the first manufacturer to support a regulation that proposed a cap on the energy wattage of vacuum cleaners sold in Europe. This challenges companies to innovate in order to use each joule of energy more efficiently. It is not a tick-box exercise but sets a clear objective, then allows companies the freedom to work out how to achieve it.At a time when the world needs innovation, governments should be encouraging companies, not tying their hands. Dyson is investing £2.75 billion over the next five years in new technology. Both regulation and the tax system should support those companies taking risks – backing those who invest their own money, rather than bureaucrats picking winners, supporting favourites or directing innovation through regulation. For example, Dyson’s battery-powered vacuums can now do with 200 watts what mains-powered machines did with 2,000 watts – an energy saving that was research-led, rather than government-directed.I fear EU bureaucrats may yet decide to reintroduce an energy label, using a similarly flawed testing regime. Worse still, we could even see the UK Government unwisely adopt it. The whole point of leaving the EU was to give the UK the freedom to create our own regulations. It would be a terrible waste to throw away that opportunity. Nevertheless, Dyson will always fight bad regulation – to defend consumers, boost innovation and develop the best technology in the world.More from NewsCovid Plan B latest news: New work-from-home restrictions and vaccine passports expectedPolitics latest news: Tory MPs demand inquiry as Boris Johnson comes under fire from all sides over Downing Street Christmas partyThai billionaire sentenced to three years in \u0026#39Black Panther\u0026#39 poaching caseStorm Barra: Thousands left without power - with 60mph winds forecast to hit UKNew German Chancellor Olaf Scholz faces first test as US steps up pressure to block Nord Stream 2The EU to the Left.

Drivers hate cyclists who hate lumbering lorries who hate nippy electric scooters whose riders hate pedestrians who hate anyone about to run them down on pavements or zebra crossings. Cabbies hate everybody, of course, but Uber drivers above all. And everybody hates red lights. This week, a report from analyst Inrix revealed how bad things have got. London has become the most congested city in the world, with its drivers losing an average of 148 hours sitting in traffic each year. Next up in Britain are Cambridge (with 75 hours), Bristol, Exeter and Cheltenham.Nationally, the costs are grim. Collisions are up by 26 per cent year on year, with each driver losing almost £600 in wasted time while they twiddle their thumbs. Some foreign cities are bad – notably Paris and Brussels – but London is the worst. No wonder that the finger of blame is always being pointed. Inrix’s Peter Lees directed his, in part at least, at cycle lanes which, he said, had a “negative impact on congestion”.“If road space is being shared with other forms of transport, there’s less Tarmac effectively for the cars to be on,” he said, stating the obvious. “Use of roads is all about supply and demand.”Well, indeed. And demand is very much up. Partly, that’s a long-term trend. Two centuries ago, 93 per cent of the world’s population lived in the countryside. Of 9.8 billion people expected to live on Earth by 2050, by contrast, 68 per cent of them – 6.6 billion – are forecast to be living in cities, dozens of which around the world are growing into “megacities” of more than 10 million citizens. Meanwhile, the pandemic has disrupted travel in peculiar ways, making us cling to our cars as never before. By the time of the first lockdown on March 23, public transport figures were collapsing: rail passenger numbers plummeted to 25 per cent of usual levels Tubes to 15 per cent buses to 31 per cent. But motor vehicle traffic was holding up at 69 per cent of the pre-pandemic norm. Cycling was at 86 per cent. Just four months later, when public transport passenger numbers were still half what they had been, road traffic had returned to usual levels. And, to this day, that trend continues. Public transport is carrying around two-thirds as many people as it used to. But there are as many, if not more, vehicles on the road. At weekends, there is a whacking 20 per cent more traffic than there used to be before Covid.But urbanisation is a global phenomenon, you might say. And the pandemic has affected everyone in cities globally. So what makes London, and Britain beyond, quite so bad when it comes to traffic? What are we getting wrong? And who is getting it right?One battle is over Low Traffic Neighbourhoods (LTNs), networks of streets closed off to through car traffic, and marked out by hefty wooden planters and an unmoving line of outraged motorists shaking their fists. Behind those barricades, hint LTN champions, lie oases where parents push prams and cyclists sweep safely by, all breathing air as pure as their consciences. LTNs, they add, cut noise and don’t “add significantly to congestion on main roads”. Drivers claim that’s nonsense, blaming LTNs not just for delays, but actually for increasing pollution by forcing them into lengthy detours.Perhaps most pernicious of all is the allegation that LTNs benefit the rich at the expense of the poor, turning wealthy central areas of London into no-go zones for those from further out, whose houses are worth less and who, badly served by public transport, must drive to their destinations. As one Twitter user put it yesterday: “There’s a certain class of people who have the facilities to shower at work – the type of office job, middle-class white boys who foisted the whole naff LTN concept on us all in the first place.  Who can’t imagine anyone else’s life being different to theirs.” “It’s an important point,” says Paul Swinney, director of policy and research at the Centre for Cities think tank, “given these things do impact different parts of society to make sure that the common solution works for everybody.” He counters that poorer people often live in areas with the worst air pollution, which is thought to shorten thousands of lives each year. Two factors that make it dreamy or nightmarish to drive into and around cities, though, are counterintuitive, in that they have nothing to do with transport at all. The data, though, show that how densely cities are populated and how thriving their centres are makes a huge difference to drivers. If cities are densely populated, it is easy to provide a coherent public transport network to lower car numbers. Paris, with almost 54,000 people per square mile and busy  stops every 200 yards, is the classic example. Sheffield, with 4,000 people per square mile, has a tramline that is considerably less popular.Moreover Paris has a thriving centre, so it is easy to funnel people in the single direction they are all going. Whereas Sheffield, like many British cities outside London, has been hollowed out jobs are spread all over the place, so workers find it far easier to drive to their offices. This combination of city densities and thriving centres transforms public transport planning and so has a huge impact on drivers. For example, Leeds and Marseille have a similar population but, according to a recent Centre for Cities report, because Marseille is denser, 87 per cent of people can reach its centre in 30 minutes by public transport, compared with just 38 per cent in Leeds. Indeed, in Europe 67 per cent of people can commute to city centres in 30 minutes, compared with just 40 per cent in Britain. Our scattered cities make public transport trickier and send more of us flocking to our cars. And that time wasted is money wasted. Rome and Manchester are the same size but the Italian capital, despite its notoriously chaotic road traffic, is 55 per cent more productive, “partly because a much larger share of its workforce can travel into the city centre by public transport”.There are some obvious fixes to improve a city’s transportation network, says Swinney, with the cheapest and easiest being to bring fragmented bus routes into a coherent network, as cities like Manchester, with increased mayoral power, are now doing. But the usual balance of public and private is being upset. So-called “micromobility”, like e-scooters, is already changing the nature of traffic. Electric cars, too, will bring down pollution, but future breakthroughs such as driverless cars may really revolutionise our roads, allowing ownership “on demand”, with cars rolling away to other masters once we have finished our journeys. The status quo is unlikely to persist, and private, personal cars do not play a big role in the crowded cityscapes of many future planners.  The Government’s Urban Mobility Strategy says that road transport contributes a quarter of the UK’s total greenhouse gas emissions with passenger cars accounting for almost two-thirds of that. “There are six cars for every 10 people in the UK, but the average car is unused 96 per cent of the time,” the Department for Transport notes. “Parking spaces occupy around 15-30 per cent of a typical urban area.” Almost a third of the space in our cities is taken up with parked cars? “It’s crazy,” says Swinney. Radical change may already be afoot. Berlin is now considering a proposal that would ban cars entirely from its centre – the equivalent of Zones 1-2 in London. “That’s the thing with every transport policy,” notes Swinney. “There are always going to be winners and losers.”More from NewsPolitics latest news: Tory MPs demand inquiry as Boris Johnson comes under fire from all sides over Downing Street Christmas partyCovid Plan B latest news: New work-from-home restrictions and vaccine passports expectedThai billionaire sentenced to three years in \u0026#39Black Panther\u0026#39 poaching caseStorm Barra: Thousands left without power - with 60mph winds forecast to hit UKNew German Chancellor Olaf Scholz faces first test as US steps up pressure to block Nord Stream 2The EU to the Left.

The three-year, £.bn Restart Scheme launched in June with firms including Serco and Maximus giving “tailored” support to claimants. But Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said the number of people eligible “has turned out to be somewhat dferent from what we had forecast or estimated or modelled. “I think it’s fair to say we didn’t have as many referrals initially as we would like - that’s improving on a weekly basis.” Ms Coffey said at the moment there were “strict criteria” for claimants - that they have to have been unemployed for  to  months. She added: “We are considering some options potentially to open that up.” Ms Coffey said the scheme is not yet mandatory but “I think that will be coming very soon.”  She told the Commons Work and Pensions Committee: “That intensive work they’re getting with Restart I think will be still good outcomes, but it’s a fair challenge on ‘is this still the best use of taxpayers’ money’.” Restart was billed as helping a million claimants back into work when it was announced last year. Once referred, jobseekers must take part in “tailored support” for “intensive work search” under a -month placement. The Department for Work and Pensionsclaims the scheme will allow contractors to “develop a strong understanding of iniduals’ employment history, skills, aspirations and support needs to develop the right package of support to help each participant succeed.” This could include changing career, updating IT stills or getting certicates in construction or transport. The budget is £, per claimant, far lower than the £, per claimant under the separate Kickstart Scheme for --year-olds, according to the National Audit Office. Today Cabinet minister Ms Coffey admitted only , young jobseekers have so far begun Kickstart placements - despite an aim to get , in place by Christmas. The £bn programme pays firms £, a head to offer six-month work placements to - year olds onUniversal Creditwho are at risk of long-term unemployment.The state covers % of the minimum wage for  hours a week and firms, which can top up wages, get a £, admin fee. But Ms Coffey said: “A lot of people were also telling us ‘I can get a job that’s  to  hours, I don’t want one that’s just for  hours”. Despite the figures she insisted: “I think Kickstart has been a success. “There’s well over , young people who’ve had an opportunity, for some of whom has been le changing, and they’re on their way to good jobs… We continue to have those successes every week.” The government’s pledge to offer , placements collapsed amid repeated lockdowns in the first six months of Kickstart. Just , young people had started job placements under the scheme as of mid-January. While the government will still only accept applications up to December , the deadline to start the placements has been extended to the end of March.

He recalled feeling frustrated as a teen because of his undiagnosed dyslexia. Image: PAByAletha AduPolitical Correspondent:,  Dec | commentsMatt Hancock has called for the introduction of dyslexia screening at primary schools to break the link with the learning dficulty and crime. The ex-Health Secretary told MPs  per cent of young people slip through the cracks and head into the world of work without being diagnosed. There are correlations between dyslexia and unemployment, drug usage, school exclusions and homelessness, he told MPs and highlighted more than half of the prison population are dyslexic. These are the knock on effects of undiagnosed dyslexia, and we have the tools to solve this injustice. Introducing his Dyslexia Screening Bill, he said Iaposm proud to be dyslexic, but admitted it wasnapost always that way.  As a teenager, I didnapost know I was dyslexic. I spent my school years focusing on maths and science subjects, always trying to avoid anything that needed more than a few sentences. He recalled the light bulb moment he experienced once he was told of his learning dficulty. Mr Hancock was not diagnosed with dyslexia until he went to Oxford University aged . “I was one of the lucky ones who was caught. There are too many children who are not caught early enough. It is a quiet scandal that an estimated four-in-five dyslexic children leave school with their dyslexia unidentied, he told MPs. He told the Commons it is a quiet scandal that some young people have their potential unrealised and often their confidence undermined because they are unaware of their condition. Mr Hancock told MPs specialist teachers who had training to spot the learning dficulty, alongside cheap and essay computer-based screening tools” would help many young people. Mr Hancock’s Dyslexia Screening Bill received support from a cross-party group of MPs, but is unlikely to become law without Government backing. The former Health Secretary who was a key face during the Covid pandemic quit his Cabinet position after CCTV footage surfaced, showing him breaching social distancing rules, kissing his aide in his Whitehall office. He told ITVaposs Peston show he is in no rush to get back into Government and is enjoying sitting on the back benches.“Itaposs a very important job and I think contributions from people who’ve been there in the heat of the battle [like] Mark [Harper] as chief whip... or Theresa May – the contributions she makes as former prime minister – andI can make that sort of contribution in the House of Commons then I’ll enjoy doing it.Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON CabinetHouse of CommonsSchoolsPoliticsHomelessness\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ex-minister Tracey Crouch said she was “fuming!” while former party chairwoman Sayeeda Warsi tweeted: Every minister, parliamentarian  staffer at the #downingstreetparty must resign NOW.” Keir Starmer accused No of spouting “lies”, while the Lib Dems demanded “any legal advice” produced on the party amid speculation it could have been legal on a technicality.As grim-faced Attorney General Suella Braverman and Health Secretary Sajid Javid were spotted going into No, Tory Tobias Ellwood urged Cabinet Secretary Simon Case or “another senior independent voice to probe the matter. Ex-No aide Dominic Cummings said the PM would need “a f***ing dead cat army” - just as reports emerged that he could announce Plan B Covid measures today.For a week after the Mirror revealed the bash on December  last year - when London was in Tier  lockdown rules - ministers have insisted no rules were broken.No even tried to insinuate it didn’t happen - by claiming whatever took place wasn’t a party.But now a clip has been leaked to ITV News of a private ‘mock’ press conference four days after the bash, which involved a Secret Santa, wine, a quiz and “ or ” people.War-gaming questionsthe event leaked, then-Press Secretary Allegra Stratton shrugged “what’s the answer ” before joking it was “was not socially distanced”.  Last night the politan Police said: We are aware of footage obtained by ITV News relating to alleged breaches of the Health Protection Regulations at a Government building in December . It is our policy not to routinely investigate retrospective breaches of the Covid- regulations, however the footage will form part of our considerations. Mr Hancock told ITV’s Good Morning Britain: “I’ve seen something from the police in the newspapers saying they will take it into consideration. It’s absolutely a matter for them and certainly not for the politicians.” But despite being in government at the time he insisted “I wasn’t invited, I wasn’t there”, adding: “I only found out about it late last night and then I got up early this morning.” Speculation has been mounting about how No claimed the party did not break rules.  Firstly, ‘permitted organised gatherings’ were allowed under the December  lawsthey happened on premises “operated by a public body” and organisers carried out a risk assessment. But at these gatherings, “mingling” between dferent household groups was still banned by law.Secondly, gatherings that were “reasonably necessary for work purposes” had an exemption under the law. But the GOV.UK Twitter account said on December , a day before the party: “Although there are exemptions for work purposes, you must not have a work Christmas lunch or party, where that is a primarily social activity.”Thirdly, barrister Adam Wagner pointed out the  Public Health Act - from which lockdown laws spawned - suggests a government department or ‘Crown property’ may have an immunity clause. The  Act says government departments can form an agreement with the local council that “any relevant provision of this Act specied in the agreement shall apply to the property”.  Mr Wagner said there are “potential legal ambiguities” and “It’s not clear whether that means it doesn’t apply to iniduals.” Tory MPs are enraged that they defended No only for the video to emerge last night. One anonymous Conservative told the BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg: “Every lie just compounds the problem. But lying eventually catches people out. “Another awful mess created out of Downing St. Question now in tea room is Boris reaching a tipping point - where he is becoming a liability and no longer an asset ” Tory MP Anne Marie Morris said: “Clearly there were rules in place that most of us were diligently followingand they decided to break them. “Itaposs not on and, at the very least, they should admit their blatant error and apologise for breaking the rules they imposed on society.”  Former minister Tracey Crouch, MP for Chatham and Aylesford, demanded an apology, Kent Online reported. I am fuming! My constituents have every right to be angry, she said. Their memories of lost loved ones are traumatised knowing that they died alone, first and last Christmases passed by, and many spent what is usually a special day by themselves. I am not even going to begin to justy or defend a party in Downing Street. We all deserve a fulsome explanation and apology and swtly.Tory peer and former Conservative Party chairwoman Sayeeda Warsi said all those present at any party should resign “no s no buts”.She added: “The rule of law is a fundamental value, the glue that hold us together as a nation. Once that is trashed by those in power the very essence of our democracy is at stake. Chairman of the Commons Education Committee and Tory MP for Harlow Robert Halfon said: I certainly think that those who were doing the video should apologise for the insensitivity of it when people were suffering and struggling all through that time.  But he stopped short of calling for the Prime Minister himself to apologise. NHS England medical director Stephen Powis told BBC Radio aposs Today: Itaposs important the public follow the guidelines, I think they have done that magnicently.Conservative Sir Roger Gale told Sky News: “This is like something out of The Thick Of It. He added: “I fear this could be a Barnard Castle moment all over again. It is very serious.”Sir Roger demanded Boris Johnson come toPMQsand either admit there was a party - or categorically deny it.The MP told the BBC: “If he says that, I will believe him. And the reason is because that will be on the record at the despatch box, and of course to mislead the House of Commons deliberately would be a resignation matter.” Failing to explain the row this morning, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said at the Chatham House foreign affairs think tank: “We do follow the rules on Covid. “On that particular issue that you raised, I’m not aware of the precise circumstances. “I know the Prime Minister’s spokesman has addressed that issue.” She added: “It is in everybodyaposs interests that we follow the Covid rules and that we boost vaccines as soon as we practically can. “There will be steps up in the booster campaign and that is obviously very important to deal with the new iant. “As to alleged events in No, I don’t know the detail of what happened. “I know that the Prime Minister’s spokesman answered those questions in detail yesterday and I am sure there will be further discussion of that issue. “My focus has been, as I am sure imagine, on foreign policy.” The recording is of a rehearsal on December  for planned daily TV media briefings, which Ms Stratton was supposed to be the face of but the Prime Minister later scrapped. Ed Oldfield, adviser to the PM, said: “I’ve just seen reports on Twitter that there was a Downing Street Christmas party on Friday night, do you recognise those reports ” “I went home”, replies Ms Stratton, who appears to crease up laughing before telling colleagues hold on. Following a long pause, Mr Oldfield goes on: “Would the prime minister condone having a Christmas party ” Ms Stratton laughs and says “what’s the answer  before her colleagues step in to help her compose an answer. “It wasn’t a party, it was cheese and wine”, offers one. On the day of the party, Tier  rules banned gatherings of multiple households in London unless they were “permitted organised gatherings” such as a business meeting. Less than  hours after the No party, Boris Johnson told England that with a heavy heart, Christmas would not be able to go ahead as planned. On the day of the mock press conference,  people died in the UK with Covid on their death certicate.Boris Johnson’s government went into hiding this morning as Health Secretary Sajid Javid abandoned the ‘broadcast round’ of TV interviews, where he was meant to celebrate a year since the first Covid jab. ITV’s Good Morning Britain left an empty chair while BBC Radio  presenter Nick Robinson said Mr Javid’s appearances was cancelled “just a few minutes after that video emerged”.Last night No bizarrely claimed in response to the evidence: “There was no Christmas party. COVID rules have been followed at all times.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Coronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

And they have thrown their weight behind the Mirror’s Look Me In The Eye campaign, which recently saw Prime Minister Boris Johnson agree to become the first premier to sit down and meet with survivors and their families. Official numbers are patchy but it is thought around , men, many of them on National Service, took part in hundreds of nuclear blasts in America, Australia and the South Pacic between  and . They now report a legacy of rare cancers, a higher risk of miscarriages for their wives, and  times the usual rate of birth defects in their children. Genetic research has proved they have the same level of DNA damage as clean-up workers at Chernobyl. After the Mirror won them a medal review, last year they were told there was not enough “risk and rigour” in the tests to get a gong.In a joint statement, the mayors said: “It is impossible to comprehend the risk taken by our nuclear test veterans. They served on the most dangerous of operations thousands of miles from home, where they were exposed to le-threatening levels of radiation.” Read more The eight mayors - also including Tracy Brabin of West Yorkshire, Jamie Driscoll of North of Tyne, Dr Nik Johnson of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, Sadiq Khan of London, and Dan Norris of the West of England - represent a total of m Brits. They said: The government has a moral duty to recognise the sacrices our veterans have made, and support them to live dignied and fulfilled lives once they leave the Armed Forces. Despite their dedication, this government is failing our nuclear test veterans and their families. The government has denied them the opportunities they deserve and refused to give any compensation for the medical conditions that have dominated their lives.  They added: “Time is running out for us to do the right thing. We’re backing the ‘Look Me In The Eye’ campaign and calling on the PM to meet with these brave veterans, recognise their sacrices, provide compensation where it is due, and award them the medal they rightly deserve. We need truth and justice for our nuclear test veterans.”The Ministry of Defence refuses to reveal how many nuclear test veterans have qualied for a war pension on the basis of radiation injury, but the Mirror has uncovered cases of veterans forced to leave their deathbeds for hearings, asked to provide proof of their doses, and even labelled aposvexatiousapos for making repeated Freedom of Information requests for their records.Information gathered by the British Nuclear Test Veteransapos Association in  found that, of , pension applications, .% were refused outright. After appeals, only  were approved, a success rate of just .%.Last year, then-Veterans Minister Johnny Mercer said there was hostility towards this group of veterans among officials and it had to change. In , the MoD finally admitted that, contrary to what it had told them for decades, % of the men were probably exposed to radiation when ordered to fly through mushroom clouds, sail and crawl through fallout, and decontaminate equipment. But successive governments have consistently refused formal compensation, and spent millions fighting legal claims. Some servicemen died at the time of the tests, or soon after.In , David Cameron thanked test veterans for their service and made charitable funding available for memorials, archives, and home adaptations, but stopped short of full, official recognition. In , Labour promised each veteran a £, ex gratia payment, and this summer Keir Starmer told them that was just the starting point of what he would do in government. He said: “Your campaign is our campaign.”For more than  years the Mirror has campaigned for justice for the brave men who took part in Britain’s nuclear weapons tests. The Ministry of Defence has fought back every step of the way. We have told countless heartbreaking stories of grieving mums, children with deformities, men aged before their time and widows struggling to hold their families together, all while campaigning for recognition. Two years ago we launched an appeal for a medal for the , survivors. For the first time we were able to prove some were unwittingly used in experiments. Our appeal was backed by then-Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson but his review foundered after he lost his job. It had only six meetings in two years. They never asked to meet veterans. They never questioned the evidence. Instead they asked for information from the MoD, which has a track record of denying what its own paperwork later proves. And as our medal campaign gathered steam, civil servants simultaneously withdrew public documents from the National Archives. Would anyone working in Whitehall today stay there, megatons of plutonium exploded south of the river  The test veterans and their families will never stop fighting. The Mirror will never cease to demand they are heard. Prime Minister, listen to them. Overturn this disgraceful decision.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Sadiq KhanAndy BurnhamDan JarvisBoris JohnsonDavid CameronDan NorrisJohnny MercerMinistry of DefenceCold WarPensionsPoliticsNuclear weapons\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The words yesterday from Cambridge University statistician Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter rang alarm bells about the potential impact of Christmas socialising. Continued contradictory messages from a rule-breaking Prime Minister on both parties and socialising is heightening concern as the coronavirus spreads, including an Omicron iant worrying virologists. And when vaccines are the main line of Britain’s defence in this pandemic, Boris Johnson’s failure to mobilise a national jabbing programme to match the huge effort earlier this year is a lethal and expensive blunder. Statistics released by Labour leader Keir Starmer, showing , doses in a recent -hour period were less than half the , in a day at the peak last March, damn a frequently complacent and dithering No . More suffering The killing of Arthur Labinjo-Hughes demands a national review to protect other children from evil crimes – but regrettably there is no certainty other little innocents will not lose their lives. We heard that from Government ministers after Victoria Climbie, Baby P – Peter Connolly, Daniel Pelka and now Arthur that lessons must be learned and perhaps some were. Yet children continue to die after facing the most horric and unthinkable cruelty. Increasing already y prison sentences may assuage public anger and deliver what many would applaud as tougher justice. What does not exist is evidence the prospect of extra years in prison would deter depraved adults.

Officials can be heard laughing about cheese and wine as Boris Johnsonaposs former spokeswoman Allegra Stratton cracked jokes about a business meeting in which there was “definitely no social distancing.” The recording, passed to ITV News, is of a rehearsal on December  for planned daily TV media briefings, which Ms Stratton was supposed to be the face of but the Prime Minister later scrapped. Staff in the  Downing Street press room can be heard pretending to ask questions about a party. Boris Johnson has faced calls to resign while Labour leader Keir Starmer said he must come clean about it.Meanwhile the politan Police says it is reviewing the footage and it will form part of its considerations.Ed Oldfield, adviser to the PM, said: “I’ve just seen reports on Twitter that there was a Downing Street Christmas party on Friday night, do you recognise those reports ”  “I went home”, replies Ms Stratton, who appears to crease up laughing before telling colleagues hold on. Following a long pause, Mr Oldfield goes on: “Would the prime minister condone having a Christmas party ” Ms Stratton laughs and says “what’s the answer  before her colleagues step in to help her compose an answer. “It wasn’t a party, it was cheese and wine”, offers one. “Is cheese and wine alright ” Ms Stratton asks, before adding, again laughing “it was a business meeting”. She then warns those present “this is recorded” and says “this fictional party was a business meeting and it was not socially distanced.”  Downing Street has denied there was a party and, when asked himself, the Prime Minister said he had been assured guidance was followed. It comes after the Daily Mirror revealed bombshell allegations that revellers at an unofficial No Christmas bash on December  allegedly enjoyed food, drinks and games which went on well past midnight. Fresh allegations in the Times also revealed that officials organised a apossecret Santaapos and sent out invites, suggesting the event was planned. Millions of people were living under strict Covid rules at the time - with London under Tier  restrictions.  The following day Mr Johnson announced that Christmas plans had to be drastically scaled back. Keir Starmer, leader of the Labour Party, said: “People across the country followed the rules even when that meant being separated from their families, locked down and - tragically for many - unable to say goodbye to their loved ones. “They had a right to expect that the government was doing the same. To lie and to laugh about those lies is shameful. “The Prime Minister now needs to come clean, and apologise. It cannot be one rule for the Conservatives and another for everyone .”  The SNPaposs Westminster leader Ian Blackford said: This video is damning and leaves the Prime Minister with a lot to answer for. When every inidual up and down the country was told to stay at home in order to protect the NHS, the Tories were instead having a Christmas party which, as a senior staff member has now confirmed, was aposnot socially distancedapos.If this is true, then the Prime Ministeraposs position is untenable and he must remove himself from office immediately. Ms Stratton remains the Prime Ministeraposs spokeswoman on Cop and had previously worked as head of communications for Chancellor Rishi Sunak.The Chancellor was pressed on whether he or any of his special advisers had attended the Christmas parties in Downing Street last year.He told MPs: No, I did not attend any parties.Most ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonPoliticsChristmas partyDowning Street Christmas Party\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

So where’s MY choice It is estimated by a charity that , children have long CovidImage: Getty Images iStockphotoopinionByPolly Hudson:,  Dec | commentsAt first it seemed sensible. Then insulting. Now  Scandalously negligent. Primary school age children in this country currently have the highest infection rates they’ve ever had during the pandemic - but there are no plans to start vaccinating them. Nearly five million - year olds have been jabbed in America, on Sunday the scheme was approved in Australia, and the rollout is expected to start next week in some European countries after it was given the green light by the European Medicines Agency. But here, nothing.Some parents won’t want their kids to be vaccinated of course, and that’s their choice - but I do, desperately. So where’s MY choice I’d take my seven-year-old to a back street illegal vaccinatorsuch a thing existed, but unfortunately it doesn’t.Do you agree  Have your say in the comment section Omicron is only just getting started, and already a whopping , kids tested positive for covid last week, with actual infection levels estimated to be up to four times higher than that. Charity Long Covid Kids reports that , children currently have long covid - , of whom have been suffering with it for over a year.Respected epidemiologist and public health researcher Deepti Gurdasani puts it simply, “Infection of children with SARS-Cov- will be one of those actions we look back at in history and wonder how on earth it was allowed to happen - by those who should’ve been protecting them.” I’ve gratefully accepted every vaccine my son has been offered, starting when he was eight weeks old. I’m lucky to live in a country where they’re available as standard, for free. And I believe it’s my duty to ensure he’s up to date with them, in accordance with the No part of parenting: trying to keep your kid safe. Also of course in this case, where coronavirus is still circulating, jabbing everyone means the whole community is protected. It’s better for everyone. The news about Omicron is becoming ever more concerning, and there were already upwards of , Covid cases a day before it reared its unwelcome head. And yet, every morning, I deliver my son into an environment where he mixes freely with hundreds of others, with no mitigations. No masks, no bubbles, no ventilation. And no vaccine either. Best of British luck, eh, kid  Vaccinating children was approved in the US at the end of October. Prof Jon Levy, chairman of the Department of Environmental Health at Boston University, welcomed the news: “Every paediatrician I know is eager to get their own kids age - vaccinated immediately. “They plan to get as many kids vaccinated in their offices as quickly as possible. If that doesn’t tell you how safe and effective the vaccine is. I don’t know what will.” If the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation know something we don’t – and have good reason why they’re dragging their feet on protecting the smallest, most helpless people in our communities – they need to speak up. Otherwise, they’re forcing us to fail our children.

He revealed that he was on leave from August  and did notuntil August , some  days after the Afghan government collapsed.He told the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee: “If I had my time again I would have come back from my leave earlier than I did.” Sir Philip was criticised by MPs for failing to come back from holidays to deal with the crisis.He even chose to remain on holiday after then-Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab jetted home from a luxury break in Crete.Conservative MP Alicia Kearns told Sir Philip: I donapost think it is enough to say, aposmea culpaapos. How in two weeks did at no point, you go, aposI canapost, I have to go in and protect my people’ ”  The civil servant said cover arrangements were in place and he stayed in touch with the department all the way through the period. He also defended ordering crisis centre workers to stick to eight-hour shts - despite a “monumental volume” of emails from desperate Afghans and Britons hoping to flee. Tory MP Bob Seely said: “People clocking off after eight hours, not bothering to come in at weekends - it’s all complacent and wooly and waffly and unfocused and sort of just a bit rubbish.” But Sir Philip hit back: “There isn’t a clocking off culture at all … when we’re in a full blown crisis it’s very intense. “We have an eight-hour sht system and we make sure therefore that people are getting a period of rest and then coming back onto shts.” MPs also heard explosive claims from Raphael Marshall, who worked for the Foreign Office during Operation Pitting and who branded the ministry’s response to the Afghan crisis dysal and chaotic. Allied forces withdrew as Taliban fighters advanced - sparking a refugee emergency as worried Afghans tried to flee Mr Marshall claimed just % of Afghan nationals who applied to leave under one UK scheme received help. Some were murdered after being left in Kabul after the Taliban swept to power, he alleged in written evidence to the committee. Meanwhile, a row broke out over claims the PM intervened to order the rescue of animals from Afghanistan after the Taliban takeover. Sir Philip insisted there was was no prioritisation of animals in the evacuation from Kabul, after a whistleblower claimed Boris Johnson issued an instruction to save animals from the Nowzad shelter during the evacuation effort.Whistleblower Mr Marshall accused Mr Johnson of issuing an instruction to save animals from the Nowzad shelter - potentially putting British troopsapos lives at risk and preventing people from fleeing Kabul. He told MPs there was an instruction from the Prime Minister to use considerable capacity to transport Nowzadaposs animals. Mr Johnson branded the claim complete nonsense and Downing Street said it was entirely untrue. Former Royal Marine Paul Pen Farthing, who ran the shelter, launched a high-profile campaign to get his staff and animals out, using a plane funded through donations. The Government sponsored clearance for the charter flight - triggering allegations animals had been prioritised over people. It has previously been claimed the PM’s we Carrie also intervened to ensure the animals were transported to the UK. But Mr Johnson’s spokesman said neither the Prime Minister nor Mrs Johnson were involved. Yet campaigner Dominic Dyer insisted he had called on the Johnsons for help.I forced the Prime Ministeraposs arm, I think all of us behind this campaign did,” he told the BBC. The next day, the senior commander in the Ministry of Defence, in the Air Force department, contacted me and said you can have your flight authorisation and we could get that plane down on the ground into Afghanistan.“Thataposs my proof because without the intervention from the Prime Minister,would have continued to block the operation. Labour leader Keir Starmer said of Mr Marshall’s evidence: “This is a devastating testimony that lays bare the shambolic incompetence of the Government in protecting thousands of Afghans to whom we owed a duty.”Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Boris JohnsonBen WallaceLabour PartyConservative PartyTalibanForeign OfficeAir ForceBBCMinistry of DefenceCivil servantsPublic servicesPoliticsAnimals\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Staff in the £.m No briefing room joked about there being “cheese and wine” and suggested they could defend it as a “business meeting”.  On the day of the mock press conference,  people died in the UK with Covid on their death certicate. Boris Johnson is not accused of being at the December  party, but is accused of being at a second bash held as a leaving do on November . Today Health Secretary Sajid Javid abandoned the ‘broadcast round’ of morning TV interviews, where he was meant to celebrate a year since the first Covid jab. ITV’s Good Morning Britain left an empty chair while BBC Radio  presenter Nick Robinson said Mr Javid’s appearances was cancelled “just a few minutes after that video emerged”.It is incredibly rare for the government to put no minister on the morning round, which happens between am and am and often involves five or six interviews.  Sky News presenter Joe Pike said: “The Health Secretary was briefly due to come on this programme and other programmes this morning because it’s one year since Margaret Keenan was the first person in the world to receive a Covid vaccine outside a clinical trials. “That was cancelled, and other ministerial visits today with media access have also been cancelled.” Last night No bizarrely claimed in response to the evidence: “There was no Christmas party. COVID rules have been followed at all times.”But the PM will have to face the music at Prime Minister’s Questions at noon, where Keir Starmer is likely to blast his attempts to deceive the British public. Labour ’s leader said “to lie and to laugh about those lies is shameful,” adding: “Unfortunately we have a Prime Minister who is socially distanced from the truth.”SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford added: “If this is true, then the Prime Minister’s position is untenable and he must remove himself from office immediately.”Tory MPs are privately enraged that they defended No only for Boris Johnson to breach their trust. One told ITV there would need to be resignations.  Conservative Sir Roger Gale told Sky News: “This is like something out of The Thick Of It. He added: “I fear this could be a Barnard Castle moment all over again. It is very serious.” Sir Roger demanded Boris Johnson come to PMQs and either admit there was a party - or categorically deny it. The MP told the BBC: “If he says that, I will believe him. And the reason is because that will be on the record at the despatch box, and of course to mislead the House of Commons deliberately would be a resignation matter.” On the day of the party, Tier  rules banned gatherings of multiple households in London unless they were “permitted organised gatherings” such as a business meeting. But barely  hours before staff met, the government explicitly warned a business owner that Christmas drinks would not count as “reasonably necessary for work”.The GOV.UK Twitter account told a man called Mick on December : “Although there are exemptions for work purposes, you must not have a work Christmas lunch or party, where that is a primarily social activity and is not otherwise permitted by the rules in your tier.” NHS Confederation chief Matthew Taylor said the Downing Street Christmas party was a “blow to morale” to NHS staff. “If it feels as though powerful people are not playing by the rules, then there is a blow to morale, it does make it harder to get people to follow the advice,” he added.One NHS staffer told the PA Media news agency she was incandescent with anger.To say Iaposm angry... Iaposm incandescent. Itaposs the disrespect, itaposs the one rule for us and another rule for them, thataposs whataposs the worst, the NHS worker said. I see Allegra Stratton laughing up there and I feel sick, I feel disrespected,Iaposve been taken for a mug. I canapost put enough words together right now as to how appalling that behaviour is. It should have consequences.  Former Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was “absolutely” a matter for police to look at. Last night the politan Police said: We are aware of footage obtained by ITV News relating to alleged breaches of the Health Protection Regulations at a Government building in December . It is our policy not to routinely investigate retrospective breaches of the Covid- regulations, however the footage will form part of our considerations. Mr Hancock told Good Morning Britain: “I’ve seen something from the police in the newspapers saying they will take it into consideration. It’s absolutely a matter for them and certainly not for the politicians.” But despite being in government at the time he insisted “I wasn’t invited, I wasn’t there”, adding: “I only found out about it late last night and then I got up early this morning.” The recording is of a rehearsal on December  for planned daily TV media briefings, which Ms Stratton was supposed to be the face of but the Prime Minister later scrapped.  Ed Oldfield, adviser to the PM, said: “I’ve just seen reports on Twitter that there was a Downing Street Christmas party on Friday night, do you recognise those reports ” “I went home”, replies Ms Stratton, who appears to crease up laughing before telling colleagues hold on. Following a long pause, Mr Oldfield goes on: “Would the prime minister condone having a Christmas party ” Ms Stratton laughs and says “what’s the answer  before her colleagues step in to help her compose an answer. “It wasn’t a party, it was cheese and wine”, offers one. “Is cheese and wine alright ” Ms Stratton asks, before adding, again laughing “it was a business meeting”. She then warns those present “this is recorded” and says “this fictional party was a business meeting and it was not socially distanced.” Becky Kummer, spokesperson for Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice said: “In September Boris Johnson looked bereaved families in the eyes and told them he had done everything he could to save their loved ones. There are simply no words to describe how upsetting and shameful it is then to hear Boris Johnsonaposs team laughing about breaking the rules they had made, whilst others followed them and could only say goodbye to their loved ones through a screen. “It’s the behaviour of people who think they’re above us.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyNick RobinsonBoris JohnsonPMQsGood Morning BritainPoliticsChristmas partyDowning Street Christmas Party\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

A tearful Madeline Halcrow said that the murdered little boy had lost the sparkle in his eyes the last time she saw him, during an interview on ITVaposs Good Morning Britain.She branded Thomas Hughes and Emma Tustin as evil and sadistic and torturous during the television appearance, reported BirminghamLive. I last saw Arthur on my birthday, October , he was the happiest child, he was very very much loved by everybody, she said. He was my daughteraposs baby bear and my sunny delight. But he had lost the sparkle in his eyes,that makes sense.  His dad came to pick him up and he asked his dad: Is she in the car  Ms Halcrow then said that her grandson began to cry and didnapost want to go. She continued: And Arthur started to cry, and he asked me: Grandma, can I stay with you  The tragic case where the youngster was killed at the hands of Tustin and Hughes has caused shock and an outpouring of grief around the country.  Ms Halcrow was in tears and was given tissues as she told of the horror and her anger towards the culprits. Tustin was jailed for le at Coventry Crown Court on Friday, with a minimum term of  years, after being found guilty of the six-year-oldaposs murder. Little Arthur was found with  areas of bruising on his body after he died from unsurvivable brain injuries in June last year, while alone with Tustin.  His father, Hughes, , was sentenced to  years for manslaughter. Asked whether the sentences were long enough, Madeleine said: No, le should mean le. They took away Arthuraposs le... there was no remorse, no sympathy shown. Theyaposll never get to heaven, theyaposll burn in hell -they get there.  Arthur was a keen Birmingham City fan and football teams in the Midlands paid their own tribute to him last week with an applause during the sixth minute of the games. The Blues were joined by rivals Aston Villa, as well as Wolverhampton Wanderers, Walsall and West Bromwich Albion in honouring the youngster. In another emotional tribute over the weekend, hundreds of blue and white balloons were released into the sky around Shirley.

Image: CollectByNaimah Archibald-PowellJunior Feature Writer:,  Dec | commentsGetting a delivery of weights and home gym equipment was a dream come true for teen fitness fanatic Darshan McGregor. And after coming through gruelling treatment for a brain tumour, a call from Bear Grylls was the icing on the cake for the -year-old. Darshan said: “He’s been through so many le-threatening challenges so he could relate to me. Bear just said keep going, keep fighting and never give up.”Darshan’s wish for gym kit was granted by charity Make-A-Wish UK, backed by the Mirror Christmas Appeal. He says: “It’s been amazing what they’ve been able to do. “It’s really made me happy and it’s one of the things that got me through my treatments, it was one thing I thought about – ‘ I get through this, I’ll get my wish’.” It was just over four-and-a-half years ago that the youngster from Berkhamsted, Herts, was told he had a brain tumour, at the age of nine.  Darshan says: “I feel like I lost part of my childhood – I couldn’t have fun because I was constantly in hospital. It was impossible to be happy.” Mum Samreen, , said: “Because the tumour was in the thalamus, right in the middle of the brain, taking a biopsy or doing any intervention to try to release the fluid in his brain was very high risk. The process was awful.” By Jason Beattie For the majority of families this Christmas will be a joyous time of presents, food and fun. But for some children the festive season will be very dferent. Across the country there are more than , young people who are critically ill. Many will be spending what should be a special time of the year in hospital. Others will have to have treatment, scans or blood tests. With your help we can give them a Christmas that they will always remember. This year’s Mirror Christmas Appeal is raising funds for Make-A-Wish UK that helps seriously ill young people make their dreams come true.It could be they want to meet their hero or heroine or feed an animal at the zoo or travel to see Santa in Lapland. The money raised could help Joshua, six, who has severe epilepsy, achieve his wish of a bedroom makeover or Summer, also six, who has acute leukaemia and dreams of a bouncy castle. Each year Make-A-Wish helps hundreds of critically ill children achieve their letime’s ambition. But to make a wish come true takes an army of volunteers, supporters and donors. That’s why every penny you donate could make a dference. Granting a wish can transform a child’s le. It gives them something to look forward to. For others it provides a special memory which makes the treatment they need more bearable.It can also help their parents who, despite doing everything they can for their sick child, feel it is not enough. Jason Suckley, Make-A-Wish UK chief executive, said: “I met the family of a boy who was recovering from brain surgery. “His grandmother told me how dficult it had been for her to watch her daughter struggle with the challenges of her son’s condition.But while they were enjoying his wish together, her daughter turned to her and said, ‘There is still magic in this world isn’t there mum ’ . “That’s just one instance that illustrates how the power of a wish lies in sharing positive memories with loved ones. “Every donation from Mirror readers will help us create those memories – bringing joy to ill children and their families during the darkest of times.” Samreen and marketing exec dad Fraser, , consulted experts and decided proton beam therapy in the US was the way to go – but it cost more than £,. A plea for government funding was turned down, so they raised it themselves by remortgaging their home and setting up a Go Fund Me page. After chemotherapy in the UK they went to Boston for the beam therapy and radiotherapy, and by October  Darshan was cancer-free.

Olcan Wilkes, seven, may have months to live after developing aplastic anaemia, and no current donor match available for his bone tissue type. His parents Sam and Genevieve, both , of Newent, Glos, are urging everyone to register as a donor and give their boy and others a chance. On average, % of patients with the ­condition die within a year unless a transplant is undertaken. Dad Sam said: “We need to find a bone marrow match, that’s the only cure.” Olcan is having two or three platelet transfusions a week and a blood transfusion every fortnight to keep him alive. But any small infection could hit his weakened immunity hard. Sam said: “If you aren’t on top of it, it could be ­catastrophic. The doctors have to treat everything asit’s worst-case scenario.” Olcan’s energy levels are often very low, but his parents try their best to get him outside with brother, Hunter, four.  “We take him out to the beach or wherever, places where other people aren’t around,” Sam, a farmer, said. In July, Genevieve was offered a job in Belfast and moved with her sons to Antrim, meaning Sam splits his time. It was soon after moving they noticed bruising on Olcan’s ankles. Then during a walk, he fell and his knees ­immediately turned “absolutely black and blue”. Tests in September showed he had the rare condition. Sam said he and Genevieve are amazed at how quickly he has adapted to hospital trips.  “He’s very intelligent,” Sam said. “We say you need a transplant because your blood cells need a kick up the bum.” Olcan is having immunosuppressive therapy called anti-thymocyte globulin, which could make him dependent of gruelling transfusions, and prolong his le until a donor is found. The severity of his condition means the chances of ATG working are fairly low. Sam said: “Within nine months most patients get an infection and die.”  He added as a family they are trying to raise awareness about becoming a donor. “The fact it could just happen to anyone is very upsetting,” he said.Register to be a bone marrow donor at: www.dkms.org.uk register-now Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON TherapyOrgan donationParenting\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

All were given temporary leave to remain in the UK but were ed to their country of origin after turning . The data was obtained by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism and relates to removals over the last five years. A report by the charity Refugee Support Network - now rebranded as Refugee Education UK - suggests some of those ing face perilous situations. Its researchers interviewed a range of Afghan ees for its After Return report, some of whom said they’d been caught in bombs or suicide attacks.  One, named only as Mohammed, told the charity in  that he’d been forced to join the Taliban for his own protection. He claimed he was “tortured” before leaving for the UK as a child and needed protection from his “enemies”. Then , he said: “I thought a lot about my decision, but I did not see any other way. I had to join the Taliban to be able to defend myself from my enemies and survive.” Others reported struggling with mental health issues, and accessing work and education. Under current laws, unaccompanied children arriving in the UK are expected to make asylum claims in the same way as adults - outlining exactly why ing to their home country would present a risk for them. Those rejected are granted leave to remain in the UK until six months before their th birthday.  Once this expires, children have the right to apply for an extension, but experts say very few of these applications are successful. Ben Davison, head of immigration at Ison Harrison Solicitors, said: If their appeal is unsuccessful, thataposs the point where the Home Office can take removal action. Appeals are more likely to be unsuccessful becauseitaposs going to be recognised that they will be at risk, itaposs usually recognised first time around. They can argue that they have established a private le in the UK, but there are specic rules. “Children generally need to have been in the UK for seven years to show it would be unduly harsh to remove them and those who have been here for a shorter period donapost meet that set criteria. Many are left in limbo as they wait for their claims to be processed - often housed in poorly maintained asylum accommodation. Mr Davison says that, even in light of the Taliban takeover, there is no guarantee those who arrived as unaccompanied children will be allowed to stay. He added: Itaposs not enough to simply say, aposAfghanistan has been taken overapos. It will be upon the applicant - child or adult - to make a case for why they particularly are at risk.  Our data relates to at least  asylum seekers removed from the UK between  and . It comes amid a spike in desperate asylum seekers paying traffickers to get them to the UK due to the lack of safe routes. Last month,  people drowned in the Channel while trying to reach Britain on a dinghy. A Home Office spokesman said: “Those with no right to be in the UK and foreign national offenders should be in no doubt that we will do whatever is necessary to remove them. “This is what the public rightly expects and why we regularly operate flights to dferent countries.” A foreign national offender is anyone remanded or convicted on criminal charges who does not have an absolute legal right to remain in this country. But when asked by the Mirror, the Home Office was unable to say how many,any, of the  people in question had been convicted of crimes. The spokesman added: “In light of the developing situation, we suspended s to Afghanistan in July and we do not carry out enforced s to Syria for the same reason. “We keep s under review and make assessments based on the latest country information.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON TalibanHome OfficeMental healthIraq\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

When Rick Ackers, from Wigan, North West England, bought Labrador Reggie after seeing him on a selling website, his family fell in love instantly. Rick’s then seven-year-old son became best friends with the pup. “He found love in our house,” Rick said. “He never left our side for the short time he was with us.” But just days later, the le of their newest family member was cruelly cut short after Reggie fell ill with a serious virus and had to be put to sleep.Rick was left heartbroken, and his young son tearfully asked himSanta could bring back their beloved dog. “It did cut him up,” Rick said.“I saw him talking to the ashes of Reggie on the fireplace.”  Reggie developed canine parvovirus, which was thought to be due to being taken from his mother too soon and not having his vaccinations as the seller had promised. It was later discovered that the Labrador had likely come from a puppy farm, born and raised in appalling conditions which probably contributed to his death. After Reggie died, Rick made it his mission to change the way that dogs and puppies are sold online by launching the aposJustice For Reggieapos campaign, so that other dog owners wouldn’t have to face the same heartbreak that his family had been put through. He launched a petition urging the UK Government to regulate websites where dogs are sold, by introducing new measures like verying the identity and address of sellers, and compulsory pictures of the puppies with their mothers, to help put a stop to greedy puppy farmers making quick cash.  After the petition shot up to over , signatures from fellow animal lovers, the issue is set to be debated by MPs in Parliament on December . It’s hoped that they will agree to bring in these new measures - known as Reggie’s Law, in honour of Rick’s beloved puppy. Rick planned a gruelling -mile walk from his home in Wigan all the way to London to hand-deliver the successful petition to Number . The inspiring journey aimed to raise money for Hope Rescue, a charity that saves stray and abandoned dogs in South Wales. Rick finally arrived on Tuesday afternoon and was joined by dozens of dog lovers for the final stages of the gruelling trip. Rick was pushed to the limits on the trek, and was even hospitalised after the skin on his feet wore away and developed an infection. He managed to walk an incredible  miles before being medically advised to rest by doctors. While Rick admits that he has been “suffering to the max” on his walk, he adds that, “nothing comes close to what Reggie and others have felt. He said that thinking of Reggie kept him going on his emotional journey, and he believes that the puppy will be looking down with pride at the campaign that has taken place in his name. We will change the law, he vows.

After arriving, Ryanaposs mum Margaret helped him to bed where he believed his chest pain was easing off - but just a few minutes later, he died. Despite paramedicsapos best efforts, his le couldnapost be saved. His cause of death will be confirmed in a post mortem later this week. His cousin Shannon explained: Ryan was at the blind tunnel at Darnick Street when he got pains in his chest. He then asked a passerby in a car for help and they refused and drove away. Ryan continued to walk home,which is a -minute walkyou arenapost struggling, so we donapost know how long it had taken him to walk home. Ryan wasnapost the type of person to ask for help so it took him a lot to ask a stranger in a car.  Ryan was a full-time carer for his mum Margaret who is said to be lost without him. In a bid to ease some of the burdens, a fundraiser has been launched to help pay for his funeral with well-wishers so far donating more than £. Shannon and the family are now urging people to be kind and help others. She added: Ryan was always smiling, always making people laugh, always the le and soul of every family event. He was so caring and would do anything for anyone. He kept himself to himself, no one has a bad word to say about him either. Ryan was also his mumaposs carer and did everything for her without even a grump. He was my aunt Margaretaposs only child, he was a healthy -year-old with no underlying health conditions. All the kids that know Ryan thought the world of him - everyone that knew Ryan loved him. He had plenty of time for anyone. A touching message on the fundraiser reads: Ryan was a great person, the most friendly guy I ever met. Always happy, a good neighbour and a better friend. He will always be remembered. Rest in peace my friend you will always be in our hearts. Margaret, we will always be at your sideyou need anything. Another added: As a mum to a mum, I just canapost imagine what you must be going through. Ryan was such a nice young man and a real tribute to you as a mum. Keep strong for him, he is watching over you.

Ministers have been forced to double the number of rooms available as those ing speak out about the chaos they have been faced with. One family, a mum, dad and six-year-old boy have been ripped apart after they were told the child could not share a double room with his parents. After theirfrom South Africa the mum was sent one room in Gatwick and the dad and child sent to another in Milton Keynes at a cost of more than £,. Janine Akers, the boy’s grandmother, told The Times: “They haven’t told their son yet and I don’t know what the stress is going to be when he’s told.  The hotel would not let them book for the three of them to stay [together]. When they got the two room bookings confirmed they had no choice but to take them otherwise they may have been stranded over Christmas. “This is going to cost them around £,. They had to defer their flights for £, find additional accommodation in South Africa which was £, and then pay for the quarantine hotels. Last night Olivia Blake, the couple’s MP in Sheffield, said the situation was “ridiculous” and that she was aware of other examples. She said: “Splitting families up and one parent having the full responsibility while quarantining is a big ask.  They’ve had to do it because they don’t want to be stranded for Christmas. The government needs to urgently make more family rooms available for quarantine. They did not properly fund this scheme.” John England is stuck in Pretoria, South Africa as he and his young family are unable to booked a family room for the forced -day hotel isolation. The -year-old from Hampshire told the Times that they could not confirm when they could get a family room of four, despite phoning and emailing, and aposdo not want to be split upapos. He added that his we suffers from anxiety, and aposeven quarantine will impact her signicantly. If we’re split the kids would be devastated.apos The government said: “The quarantine measures we have in place are minimising the risk of iants coming into the UK and safeguarding the hard won progress of our vaccination programme. The majority of passengers who have used the managed quarantine service have been satisfied with the service and we aim to keep families together.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Coronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But booster rollout has been flatlining – and health chiefs warn it will take time for the over-stretched NHS to ramp it up after millions more became eligible for a third dose.From today over-s who had their second dose at least three months ago will be able to book their booster, it emerged last night. Those whose last jab was two months ago will also be able to book a month in advance.  NHS England chief Amanda Pritchard said: “There is a lot we do not know about the Omicron iant but experts believe that evenexisting vaccines are less effective they will give protection. “So I would urge anyone eligible to come forward as soon as possible, and to keep checking for appointments in their area.” NHS England was criticised for waiting nine days to make booking available after regulators halved the wait between second doses and boosters from six months to three. But the expansion will pile more pressure on the health system.  NHS Providers chief Chris Hopson said: “We shouldn’t underestimate the scale of the logistical challenge required to ramp up the vaccination programme to full speed for the new booster population. The NHS is beyond flat out, and this is another challenge adding strain on to an already very pressured system.” GPs and pharmacies are being urged to restart vaccinations after many stopped to focus on the NHS backlog. A third of mass vaccination centres in stadiums and conference centres have shut since the peak of the initial jab rollout, and many hospitals also stopped operating as vaccination hubs. One NHS hospital chief, who asked to remain anonymous, said: “It feels like mile  of the marathon, but the finish line keeps getting further away.” Fewer people were jabbed over the weekend than they were before the PM promised to expand the campaign last Wednesday, figures show.  The , jabs on Sunday were down from , a week earlier. Monday’s , were up on , the previous week. For two weeks the daily average has been around , – some . million a week. The target is for . million a week to hit the end-of-January deadline for all adults in England and Wales. Ministers have been criticised for not calling on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation to expand jabs to all adults earlier. The Prime Minister asked scientic advisers  days agothey would back the expansion. Weekly reported Covid cases have risen to their highest level since January, with , in the past seven days including , yesterday. Omicron cases hit  as  new infections were confirmed by genetic sequencing yesterday – up from  new cases the day before. An R-value of . for Omicron was suggested in modelling by the University of East Anglia, with likely , cases since November . At least two cases were linked to a party in Somerset which Prof Tim Spector, of King’s College London, described as a “super-spreader” th birthday party. The Prime Minister is due to decide next week whether fresh restrictions are needed once experts have provided more data on the new iant. The PM’s official spokesman said: “[He] said it was too early to draw conclusions on the characteristics of Omicron but that early indications were that it was more transmissible than Delta. The PM reiterated that booster vaccines remain our best defence against new and existing iants, with the NHS on course to meet the target of offering a booster to all adults by the end of January.” Welsh Health Minister Eluned Morgan said the country expected a signicant wave of Omicron to hit by the end of January.She said it was now clear the coronavirus iant “spreads very rapidly” and she believed “that is clearly cause for concern”. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon yesterday ordered Scots to work from homethey can.New drive for jab staff and volunteers The NHS has begun a new recruitment drive for volunteers and paid staff on the anniversary of the first person in the world to receive an authorised Covid jab. Margaret Keenan, , had the Pfizer jab in Coventry after the UK regulator became the first to approve a Covid- vaccine. Until then the only people to get jabs were on human clinical trials.  Some , new roles are being advertised including vaccinators, admin and healthcare support staff. The NHS is also working with the Royal Voluntary Service and St John Ambulance to enrol over , volunteers. Amanda Pritchard, chief exec of NHS England, said the vaccination programme is “the biggest and fastest in our history” having delivered almost  million jabs. She added: “The rollout would not have been as successful as it has without the help of thousands of volunteers. The NHS and the country needs you once again.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSHospitalsPoliticsCoronavirusCoronavirus vaccineMutant CoronavirusOmicron iant\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Dr David Lloyd, a GP based in north London, has detailed the symptoms of the new iant primarily seen among younger age groups. Around % of children who have been confirmed as having the strain had reportedly developed a rash, he said. Alongside the rash were reports of symptoms including fatigue, headache and loss of appetite. According to Dr Lloyd, early cases of Omicron appeared to be presenting with slightly dferent symptoms to dferent strains.He toldSky Newsthat symptoms like fatigue, headaches and a loss of appetite seemed to be “quite important”, as was the emergence of a rash. “We’ve always had a small cohort of patients with Covid who are getting funny rashes but up to % of the Omicron children are getting an unusual rash,” he said. “So we’re starting to learn a little bit more about the virus and we are starting to look out for it.” Dr Lloyd carried on to say that the data suggested it does double “very quickly” in the number of people that were in the community. He added: “So let’s hope that it isn’t as deadly as the Delta and let’s hope that we can get on top of it. But it’s a concerning time.”Over the course of the pandemic, the NHS has listed three main symptoms of Covid to look out for in both adults and in children. The short list included a new, continuous cough, a high temperature and a loss of smell or taste. However, there had been calls for the list of symptoms to be expanded, as people with confirmed cases of Covid have reported a number of dferent symptoms. The World Health Organisationhas previously said there is no information at present to suggest the symptoms of the Omicron iant are dferent from other Covid- iants. Early data suggests that the new strain is more transmissible, but milder, than the Delta iant that is currently dominant across the world. Omicron cases in the UK have hit  today as  new infections have been confirmed. Professor Tim Spector, from the Covid Zoe app, said that in around  daysapos time the UK could have more cases of Omicron than some countries it had put on the travel red list.  The professor of genetic epidemiology at Kingaposs College London told BBC Breakfast: The official estimates are about -odd Omicron cases, and because the current testing is missing a lot of those, itaposs probably at least , to , I would guess at the moment.And we are expecting this to be doubling about every two days at the moment, soyou do your maths - say assumed itaposs , at the moment, and you think itaposs going to be doubling every two days, you can see that those numbers are going to be prettycertainly in about  days time. By that time, weaposll probably have more cases than they will in some of those African countries. So I think these travel restrictions do perhaps have their place initially, when cases are really low here and really high in the other country, but when we reach that equilibrium, thereaposs very little point in having them in my opinion.  Cases of the new Omicron covid iant are increasing across the UK after it was initially detected in southern Africa. New rules designed to slow the spread of the Omicron iant of coronavirus will see travellers having to take a pre-departure test before travelling to England from today. All travellers will be required to take a Covid- pre-departure test, amid warnings that the time between infection and infectiousness could be shorter with the new strain.Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON BBCDeltaNHSKings College LondonWorld Health OrganisationDavid LloydAppsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Duke of York has instructed his legal team to “leave no stone unturned” in the lead up to the January  hearing, described as his “last ditch attempt” to get allegations he abused a teenage girl thrown out. Royal sources say he is “totally consumed” with the legal battle and has been staying up into the night to keep in constant conversation with his Calornia-based lawyers. Next Monday they are set to deliver their final submissions to the New York court before a decision is taken in the new year as to whether the Duke will face a full trial. Virginia Giuffre is pursuing Andrew through the civil courts. He is accused of “rape in the first degree” amid claims he forced Ms Giuffre, also known as Virginia Roberts, to have sex with him three times in  while she was trafficked around the world by the royal’s late paedophile pal Jeffrey Epstein.  In August she sued the Queen’s son for unspecied damages which could run into millions of poundsshe is successful. Sources close to the Duke say he has become “incredibly stressed” in recent weeks after fearing his team’s strategy of not publicly responding to the claims is failing. Insiders also suggest he is extremely worried over the financial burden he has placed on the Queen, who agreed to personally meet his spiralling court costs, which could run into millions. Prince Andrew has denied the claims. One source close to Andrew said: “The tension in the camp is palpable. No one is really sure what Andrew’s involvement is other than asking a lot of questions, but he spends his days and nights poring over documents.  “He is totally consumed by it, keeping most irregular working hours so he can be in contact with his team. “He was particularly stressed a few days ago and was heard remonstrating with one of the team. The feeling was he was telling them to effectively cancel Christmas and get totally across all the eventualities of what could happen in the case so there are, as he put it, ‘no more surprises’. “It’s very much a last ditch attempt to get the case thrown out andthat doesn’t succeed he knows they are all potentially in it for the long haul.”  The Duke’s team want the “baseless lawsuit” thrown out, claiming Virginia Giuffre is looking to “achieve another payday at his expense”. Court documents filed on behalf of her lawyers condemned Andrew, , for launching a “baseless, defamatory” attack on her credibility, character and motives. Andrew’s team must meet Monday’s deadline to file a further response before the New York district judge Lewis Kaplan rules on the next stage. The judge has said he is targeting a date for trial between October to December . Prince Andrew has hired Hollywood lawyer Andrew Brettler from the £,-an-hour firm Lavely and Singer to represent him. Meanwhile, Andrew’s former friend, socialite Ghislaine Maxwell is on trial in New York for allegedly procuring and trafficking young girls for former lover Epstein. A source close to Andrew said he is “aware” the case is progressing but “has no involvement”. His spokesperson did not comment.Follow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Ghislaine MaxwellPrince Andrew, Duke of YorkVirginia RobertsRoyal FamilyCrimeJeffrey Epstein\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Imperial College London epidemiologist - dubbed aposProfessor Lockdownapos - told Radio aposs Today programme that the iant is likely to become the UKaposs dominant strain by Christmas. Prof Ferguson said a new year lockdown is apospossibleapos, although it depends on how much pressure the NHS faces in the coming weeks. It comes after the UK recorded  new cases of the Omicron strain on Tuesday, bringing the total to  infections. When pressed about the chance of a lockdown in the new year, Prof Ferguson said: At the moment itaposs very dficult to rule out anything we really havenapost got a good enough handle on the threat.  If the consensus is itaposs highly likely that the NHS is going to be overwhelmed then it will be for the Government to decide what it wants to do about that but itaposs a dficult situation to be in of course.Itcertainly might be possible at the current time. The scientist added that early research suggests the virus is more resistant to vaccines than previous strains, however getting jabbed is still the best protection against serious illness and disease. He said a laboratory-based South African study published last night indicated that Omicron can evade antibodies developed against the original strain better than any iant so far.  The professor also said research in the UK suggested protection from two doses of the Pfizer vaccine against mild disease roughly halved in Omicron cases. He anticipated that case numbers, which are currently doubling every two to three days, will accelerate aposquite markedlyapos within a week or two. Prof Ferguson said bringing back working from home rules could slow down the doubling of infections to four to five days.

One of the countryaposs top medics said the country was facing an unprecedented rise in infections which appears to be driven by the mutant strain. In the worst-hit province, Gauteng, average daily hospital admissions rose by  per cent in a fortnight.

The current list of symptoms on the NHS website has remained unchanged since the first lockdown, even with the detection of other iants such as Delta.Medics in South Africa, where the iant was first detected, are saying the main symptoms of Omicron are fatigue, body aches and a headache. One UK expert said up to one in four colds could currently be Covid as the symptoms become more mild. Dr Angelique Coetzee, a private practitioner and chair of the South African Medical Association, said patients have not been reporting a loss of taste and smell.It comes as Covid cases in the UK are increasing and so are concerns about the Omicron iant, with an expert saying there are likely to be more than , cases of Omicron in the UK, just  days after the coronavirus was first discovered. The strain was first located in the UK in Chelmsford and Nottingham on November , , after initially detected in southern Africa.Since then, cases have been rapidly increasing across the country. Today Boris Johnson told his Cabinet that early indications show Omicron transmits more easily than the previously dominant Delta iant. Today, the total number of Omicron cases in the UK hit  as  new infections have been confirmed. This includes a further  cases in England,  in Scotland and one in Wales, according to figures from the UK Health Security Agency. It is not yet knownthe new iant increases hospital admissions or is impacted by the common vaccines.Professor Paul Hunter, from the school of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said it is spreading rather more quickly than the Delta iant. The professor told BBC Breakfast it was not clear how evidence from South Africa would translate to the UK as we have a highly vaccinated population.He added: How itaposs likely to spread in the UK still uncertain, but I think the early signs are that it will probably spread quite quickly and probably start outcompeting Delta and become the dominant iant probably within the next weeks or a month or so at least.  The big remaining question is actually how harmful it isyou do get Covid with this Omicron iant, and thataposs the question that weaposre struggling to answer at the moment. Kingaposs College Londonaposs Professor Tim Spector, who is the lead on the ZOE Symptom Tracker App, said data from the app suggests about half of all cases are being missed because people are not presenting with classic Covid symptoms. He said: Omicron is probably more, much more similar to the mild iants weaposre seeing in people who have been vaccinated with Delta than anything .  And so it is going to be producing cold-like symptoms that people wonapost recognise as Covidthey just believe the official Government advice. Speaking to Times Radio, he added: “We’re estimating that somewhere between one in three and one in four colds are actually due to Covid. “And so that’s quite a high rate of people that are currently not even bothered to get a lateral flow test, or getting a PCR test, going to parties and spreading it around.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON BBCNHSKings College LondonUniversity of East AngliaPaul HunterAppsHospitalsCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ed Oldfield, a No  adviser, is heard asking: I’ve just seen reports on Twitter that there was a Downing Street Christmas party on Friday night, do you recognise those reports ”Stratton and several other staff in the room are seen answering the question with joking answers including: It wasn’t a party, it was cheese and wine, and This fictional party was a business meeting, and it was not socially distanced. What time is PMQs today  The PMQs take place every Wednesday in the House of Commons from pm. It will run for half an hour, until the end of Question Time, ending at .pm.  Prime Ministeraposs Questions sessions typically start with a routine question from an MP about the Prime Ministeraposs engagements. This is known as an aposopen question,apos after which the MP can ask a supplementary question on any subject. Usually MPs raise particular issues of current political signicance, following which the Leader of the Opposition will ask a total of six questions about the same topic or something dferent. Where can I watch Prime Ministers Questions live The PMQs will be broadcast live on the UK Parliament YouTube channel from pm. You can also watch it on TV via BBC News and Sky News or access it online through BBC iPlayer here and the Sky News live YouTube stream.

And last year, the couple was spotted browsing for the perfect tree at a store in Santa Barbara.But it appears that one young boy, who happened to be in the shop at the same time mistook Harry for one of the staff selling the trees. According to reports from the time, an arrangement had been made for Harry and Meghan to be allowed into the shop while it was empty but one family happened to still be inside.  The excited child ran through the trees to the duke and askedhe worked here, shop salesman James Almaguer claimed. He went on to describe Harry, , as a chill lad and Megan, , as very kind.Posting on Twitter, James wrote at the time: Meghan and Prince Harry came into my work today and we sold them their Christmas tree.It was anticlimactic, but a very, very interesting experience.

We had our lot empty when they got there - their agent promoted them a good time to come instead of us shutting it down. There was one family in there and their stoked little son ran through trees up to Harry and askedhe worked here not knowing who that is. They seem like very nice people honestly. Meghan sounds very kind and Harry sounded and acted like a chill lad honestly. I’m really glad they liked our trees. We got the best we could get. Very appreciative.  It is believed that Harry and Meghan will be spending Christmas in Calornia again this year with son Archie and baby daughter Lilibet.The couple had reportedly been invited to join the rest of the royals at Sandringham for Christmas. But a source told Page Six : “There’s a lot that goes into the logistics and the planning of the family Christmas, so of course, staff know that Harry and Meghan are not coming.“If they were, they would have communicated it to their family by now. “But this is Her Majesty’s first Christmas without her husband, so one would have hoped they would want to be with her.” The Sussexes have not commented on the claims.Meanwhile, the Queen is said to be looking forward to hosting her traditional family get-together.It is understood Her Majesty will travel to Sandringham on or around Friday, December . Christmas guests will include Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall as well as Prince William, the Duchess of Cambridge and their three children.

That is three times the number of cases, ,, logged on this day last year. Hospitalisations and deaths are signicantly lower now than they were at the beginning of December  however. On Tuesday  people died and , were in hospital with Covid, compared to  deaths and , patients in hospital a year ago. Have you been affected by Omicron  Email webnews@mirror  While the Covid vaccine is primarily responsible for this much-improved situation in terms of fatalities and the strain on the NHS, the Omicron iant has made the future much more uncertain than it was just a few weeks ago. Scientists have warned that the mutant strain could be three times more infectious than other iants. They predict that , people in the UK are catching the new iant each day while new cases are doubling every three days. Although much research into Omicron is yet to be done, there have been some suggestions that it can evade the vaccines to at least a small degree. At the moment deaths and hospitalisations - while high compared to other European countries - are steady.However,they start to rise over the coming weeks, the Government may decide to bring back restrictions designed to stop the coronavirus spread.Boris Johnson is reportedly considering Plan B for the festive period which could be put in place in the coming days, possibly even as soon as tomorrow. He may decide to do sothe spread of Omicron is threatening to overwhelm the NHS. At the moment scientists believe that Omicron cases in the UK are doubling every three days. Professor Neil Ferguson told the Today programme this morning that the new iant would be the dominant one, overtaking Delta, by Christmas. The Imperial College London epidemiologist predicted that Omicron cases would peak in Januaryno additional measures were taken by the Government.Prof Ferguson said a new year lockdown is apospossibleapos, although it depends on how much pressure the NHS faces in the coming weeks.When pressed about the chance of a lockdown in the new year, he said: At the moment itaposs very dficult to rule out anything we really havenapost got a good enough handle on the threat. If the consensus is itaposs highly likely that the NHS is going to be overwhelmed then it will be for the Government to decide what it wants to do about that but itaposs a dficult situation to be in of course. Itcertainly might be possible at the current time.  He said a laboratory-based South African study published last night indicated that Omicron can evade antibodies developed against the original strain better than any iant so far. Professor Ferguson anticipated that case numbers, which are currently doubling every two to three days, will accelerate aposquite markedlyapos within a week or two. The Government may decide to reintroduce social distancing measures to stop the rise in cases getting out of control. Its Plan B would mean people being told to work from home to limit the spread of the virus while vaccine passports could be enforced for entering events with crowds including football matches, it is reported.  If the rules are introduced, many Brits may be left with a feeling of de-ja-vu. A week before Christmas  a planned relaxation of rules for the festive period were scrapped due to the emergence of the Delta iant. Prime Minister Boris Johnson held a press conference on December  announcing that Christmas as planned was effectively cancelled. From midnight that day a new tier four was introduced, banning people from mixing indoors with anyone not from their household.

Gales and snow blizzards caused chaos on Tuesday with wind gusts reaching mph at Aberdaron, in Gwynedd, while around , homes in north-east Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales lost power.Now dozens of flood warnings have been issued across the UK along with the Met Office also issuing a yellow weather warning of gales in England for Wednesday.The Environment Agency has issued  flood warnings for England at locations including Hartlepool and Sunderland in the North East, Bournemouth and Weymouth in the South, and part of the Cumbrian coast. Some  flood alerts, for areas where flooding is possible, have also been issued across the country.  The Scottish Environment Protection Agencyhas sent  flood alerts and five warnings for areas in the north-east of Scotland and the south-west. Natural Resources Wales has also issued  flood warnings and  alerts, mainly covering coastal areas. Properties may flood and there may be travel disruption, said the Environment Agency. Local river and surface water flooding is also possible for parts of England and Wales on Tuesday and Wednesday. Land and roads may flood and there may be travel disruption.  More chaos comes as communities in the North East and Scotland are still trying to recover from the catastrophic effects of Storm Arwen. Thousands of homes lost power for up to  days in the wake of mph winds and lashing rain at the end of November. Northern Powergrid has not confirmed whether all homes were connected by Tuesday night as promised.Storm Barra moved in from the west on Tuesday, and a yellow weather warning for wind is in place from midnight until pm on Wednesday for the west coast of Wales and south-west England. As well as the high winds that hit Gwynedd, North Wales, which is covered by the wind warning, Orlock Head in Co Down, Northern Ireland Ireland, faced mph gusts on Tuesday. Met Office forecasters said Storm Barra may not cause as much chaos as Storm Arwen – though it has already sparked travel delays and school closures in Scotland. Spokeswoman Nicky Maxey said: “We are not expecting the impacts of Barra to be as bad as we saw with Arwen. “Storm Barra will bring strong winds and heavy rainfall to many parts of the UK today. We may see some snow on the higher ground, too. “It is unlikely to be as impactful as Storm Arwen last week but there will be blustery conditions so people should still be prepared.” ScotRail has warned that some Wednesday services will be cancelled due to the storm. The strong winds is expected to mean the temperatures are milder than usual for the time of year on Wednesday, with London predicted to see C, C in Cardf, C for Edinburgh and C in Belfast. Boris Johnson said on Monday more than , homes were still without power but that he was assured by Northern Powergrid boss Phil Jones that “affected properties would be reconnected on Tuesday at the latest.  The Prime Minister said “too many people have spent too long without power” and the situation in northern England was not acceptable. Schools in Dumfries and Galloway were forced to close because of the weather. Stranraer Academy was shut after the wind caused structural damage to the roof, the council said, and Drummore School closed after trees were blown down. UK forecast for the next  days Today: A generally windy day, with early gales in the west and southwest, perhaps severe in coastal Wales. Showers affecting most areas, some heavy and with some more persistent bands of showery rain especially across Wales. A little brightness or sunshine. Tonight: Showery rain and showers easing for many, clearer spells allowing patchy frost, mostly in the north. However parts of northwest England and the northwest Midlands likely to keep some showers. Thursday: Showers continuing to ease away northeastwards, many parts fine for a time. Rain ing to western parts by afternoon and central areas later. Mostly fairly chilly, milder in southwest later. Outlook for Friday to Sunday: Drier weather at times, with unsettled interludes. Blustery showers Friday and Sunday, mainly for the north and west, with longer spells of rain for most through Saturday. Turning milder.

But other experts say the third vaccine dose has seen less people report fevers, fatigue and aching bodies than after the first two.Some have said the latest shot leaves them thirsty - while some doctors say that could simply be a symptom of anxiety. While the side effect has not been confirmed or seen in any clinical trials, one doctor says medics have had a number of reports. Today marks the first anniversary of the first vaccine given in the UK.  Boosters are currently being given as the key defence against the concerning new Omicron iant. Dr LaTasha Perkins, a family physician in Washington, says extra thirst is nothing to worry about.“People have dferent symptoms when they get their immunisations, but I have heard of people feeling a little bit thirsty, she told Huffington Post :“That’s not an uncommon finding.”  But Natasha Bhuyan, a physician at primary care US-based practice One Medical, believes there could be other reasons behind the reported dehydration. “If someone is nervous about the vaccine, that can cause dry mouth, as anxiety is linked to dry mouth.” she said. It comes as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say your third booster shot should be a much smoother experience. “People had fewer reactions after their third dose than after their second dose,” CDC director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said.

Only the tip of -year-old Darcy’s wagging tail can be seen at first, as the goldie rustles around in the huge mound of leaves in search of her tennis ball. Moments later she pops her head out of the pile with the ball in her mouth, looking very pleased with herself as her owners give her a celebratory cheer. Darcy’s owner Ali Cohen, from Surrey, says that leaf piles and her tennis ball are two of the dog’s “greatest loves in le”, and getting older certainly hasn’t deterred Darcy from her fun games.  Despite having cataracts, Ali says that Darcy hasn’t lost her fetching skills - and “would play catch all day given half a chance”.Darcy, affectionately nicknamed “Lady D”, has also had arthritis since she was four years old, and Ali was told two years ago by a vet that there was “no way she should still be walking”.She now has a pull-along trolley that she travels to her favourite park in to make the journey easier for her tired legs. But her condition doesn’t stop the “determined” dog from living each day to the fullest, says Ali, as is evident in the heart-warming clip. “I’m not sure how much longer she’s got, but she enjoys le to the max for now.”The video of Darcy was posted in a golden retriever group on Facebook, where members dubbed it the “cutest video ever” and said it had “made their day”.“Goldens are forever puppies,” one person commented on Darcy’s playful nature. “And what were the chances she’d give up looking for that ball  % chance!” another joked.  Darcy isn’t the only dog who’s been enjoying the leaves lately.The joy ofthis group of corgiswas infectious as they found a huge pile of fallen leaves to play in, often disappearing out of sight in the mound due to their short stature.The five corgis, called Rusty, Skillet, Sierra, Muffin and Willow, were dubbed “leaf bunnies” for their style of bunny hopping playfully through the leaves.Andgoofy Dalmatian Ottocan’t get enough of leaf piles either - autumn seems to be the adorable pup’s favourite season, as another video shows him having the time of his le in the leaves.Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON ArthritisTeamDogsDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

As soon as he walked off my seven-year-old said aposthat is not Santaapos. We had to try and say Santa sends his helpers because heaposs too busy this time of year to do it himself. But sheaposs saying now aposI donapost believe it, Santaaposs not realapos because the Santa was that bad. It was horrible. The seven-year-old then was telling my four-year-old niece aposSantaaposs not realapos, which was really hard because I didnapost want to say aposyou canapost say that because sheaposs only littleapos because I still want her to believe as well, sheaposs only seven. My brother said aposI donapost know where this has come fromapos and I said itaposs probably because the Santa was that bad. Some of my friends sent me pictures of the Santa from their Polar Express and itaposs what youaposd expect Santa to look like - the big beard, being chunky and the little round glasses. It was a million miles away from what we got. The mum and her partner Adam Evans, , took her nine-month-old daughter Mylah-Jane, four-year-old stepdaughter Amelia and seven-year-old niece on the train. it was advertised as aposan immersive re-creation inspired by the iconic  Polar Express filmapos where customers can aposembrace the spirit of Christmas on their wonder-filled tripapos and apostake home lasting memories of a magical experienceapos. But Melissa says it started off badly as the shuttle bus dropped them off at outdoor marquees aposin the freezing coldapos for over an hour wait before they were allowed to board the train at pm. She also claims the entertainment on the -minute train journey was aposrushedapos and aposnot magical at allapos, unlike the advertised experience. Melissa said: When we got there it was absolutely throwing it down with snow and freezing and theyaposd put two little marques up that youaposd probably use in the summer because they didnapost have any sides to them. There were busloads of people turning and nowhere for them to go and there wasnapost really any staff around so we were just stood around not having a clue what was going on. About  minutes before our train was due they opened an indoor marquee to put on a show but there werenapost enough seats - a lot of people couldnapost come in and we had to stand at the back. We got taken down to where the train was on the  and Iaposve got to say that part was magical - not all of it was dire - there was fake snow and the train was amazing but once we got on the train was absolutely freezing cold. They gave everyone a hot chocolate and cookie but they were rushing around to collect the rubbish before weaposd even finished, it was really rushed. Where you get off thereaposs a shop which sells souvenirs and the kids can write a letter to Santa and that bit was quite good. I donapost know why they didnapost put that bit on at the start because we had nearly an hour to waste in the freezing cold but at the end it was rushed because the shuttle bus was on its way to pick us up. Some other parents commented in support of Melissaaposs scathing review, saying they too were disappointed after booking the same aposexpensive experienceapos and coming away with children aposscepticalapos about Santa. One said: Iaposm so glad Iaposm not the only person to say this! I was mortied!! My -year-old son was even sceptical and thataposs saying something!!! Another said: I felt exactly the same, Iaposve emailed as well. We paid nearly £ for  tickets, feeling ripped off. Meanwhile, others slammed her as aposentitledapos and branded her decision to post a photo of the Santa onboard alongside her complaint aposrottenapos. One said: What a bunch of self-entitled Karenaposs [whinging] about how Santa should look in their eyes - kids probs had a good time anyway but Karenaposs p****d off because Santaaposs beard wasnapost the correct- get a f*****g le. Another said: If youaposre making a formal complaint why post here. Bit of a rotten move posting this manaposs pic on social media and bagging him out like this. Some even noted that the heritage railway is run by volunteers and questioned the mumaposs accusation that the railway is aposripping people offapos. One commenter said: You mean a bunch of volunteers with nothing in it for them except a sense of trying their best are ripping people off  Are you sure about that  They have nothing to gain. But Melissa remains firm in her complaint, saying the Santa onboard didnapost meet expectations after seeing how aposmagicalapos the character looked in previous years and on other railwaysapos similar services. Melissa said: People were saying aposwhat do you expect, Santaaposs not realapos - weaposre not stupid but looking back at the pictures from previous years the Santaaposs look magical. When you read up on it, itaposs made out to be this amazing, magical experience for kids where you were going to be entertained. My friends had just come back from the Stoke Polar Express and said how good the Santa was, that he sat with the children and had pictures taken - there was no opportunity for us to do any of that. The comments started to get abusive so I just removed the post and blocked them. I donapost let things like that get to me. After launching a formal complaint the day after her aposdireapos experience, the mum is now hoping to receive aposat least a partial refundapos for the five aposgoldenapos tickets. Melissa said: To me £ is a lot of money to spend to see Santa for him to turn up like that, it was  per cent not worth the cost. I took my little girl to a place local to us where they did storytime and dancing with elves and met Santa - it only cost me £ and they had more joy out of that than the train.

Image: jennaelghatit TikTokByFlorence Freeman:,  Dec | commentsItaposs not every day youaposre left puzzled, wondering what heartless thief would steal sweet treats youaposve left for hard-working delivery drivers. It certainly isnapost a common experience when you then discover your common thieves are in fact common critters. This is exactly what happened to a mother and daughter when they set out to find out exactly who was stealing their Snickers from their porch. The pair were left in stitches at their security footage when they discovered sneaky squirrels were the cunning culprits, grabbing themselves a chocolate bar or two right from the family home in Illinois. The pair took to TikTok to show the hilarious footage of their neighbourhood thieves in action.  The clip, which was posted by user @jennaelghatit has been viewed more than . million times. At the start, the mum is heard exclaiming: Oh my, someone took a sh*t ton of Snickers. Oh my God yeah, I put like  out there. As the pair further inspect, they realise no deliveries had been made to their house and are further confused as to why any treats would have been taken. Ironically enough, the mum makes another statement, saying she hopes the culprits do not turn out to be squirrels, to which the daughter replies puzzled, aposA squirrel apos, as theyback into the house. But only a couple of seconds later, out pops the thief, a squirrel, as it welcomes itself to the basket of treats. The -second clip has left many in stitches, as many are still amazed that the culprit was in fact just a cheeky critter. One user was amazed, stating: WHAT, how was it actually a squirrel.  While another referenced Snickers iconic slogan: That was actually the driver...he just wasnapost himself because he was hungry. One user wrongly thought it was the daughter who was the culprit, as they said: I thought the daughter took all the snickers  and was playing it off like she didnapost know because thataposd be me. As another commented on the rude manner of the squirrel stating: he didnapost even deliver anything. Although squirrels have been reported to raid bird feeders, it seems they have adopted sweet tooths and are expanding their pickings.

Typically, we caused our own downfall - especially during lockdown when hairdressers remained closed. But lots of us have suffered a dodgy visit to the hairdressers, where weaposve walked away with a wonky fridge or even worse, a pudding-bowl cut. Either way, itaposs practically a rite of passage to sport the unsightly cut. But what happens when your dodgy new hairstyle was caused by your GUINEA PIG. Thataposs what happened from one hairdresser - who admits sheaposd had a skinful before falling asleep with her beloved piggie.Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here Gara Sullivan woke up to discover that her bald guinea pig, called Dixie, had CHEWED OFF her fringe after ing home from a drunken night out. The -year-old said she was in deep sleep after Thanksgiving celebrations and only made the aposhair-raisingapos discovery the following morning. Initially, she was horried by her chewed-up aposdo, but then became worried that the three-year-old piggie had swallowed clumps of her fringe and could be ill. But she discovered the chewed-off strands next to a guilty-looking Dixie - and shared the ordeal on social media, where it left people in stitches. Now hairstylist Gara has vowed to put an end to their cosy sleepovers - as she fears it could take a YEAR for her fringe to grow back. Gara, from Bellevue, Kentucky, US, said: She doesnapost have any hair - itaposs like sheaposs jealous of mine. She has a little hair on her nose but thataposs it, other than that sheaposs completely naked. Sheaposd had quite the meal, it was crazy. I take naps with her all the time butIaposm drunk, my boyfriend will create a little bed on the floor for me because he knows I like to snuggle with her.  I fell asleep and when I woke up in the morning, I went to the bathroom, looked at myself in the mirror and my bangs were gone. I knew she ate them, I went into the living room and they were right there on the floor. She didnapost even swallow them - sheaposd just left them. I felt nothing, I was totally out. It was the night before Thanksgiving and I drank pretty heavily. This will  per cent be the end of our drunken sleepovers. Gara and her boyfriend Alex Kennedy, , first welcomed Dixie into their home three years ago, along with their two other guinea pigs. While Gara knew the curious sow had a taste for human snacks, she never expected her pet to start eating her too. Gara said: Iaposm a hairdresser and I have this tuft at the front now. I had to move my parting across a little bit so thankfully I can hide it, but itaposs not the cutest look Iaposve ever had. Guinea pigs chew on a lot of random stuff but thankfully theyaposre usually in their cage. Sheaposs never eaten my hair before though. Iaposd say itaposll take six months to a year to grow back, itaposll probably get worse before it gets better. Dixie is very lovely, she loves to cuddle. Sheaposs really sweet and likes to nap. She sleeps a lot and doesnapost bite me. My other two are evil and will bite the cr*p out of you. Sheaposs a very chilled one - she just has a taste for human hair. Alex just laughed at me and told me thataposs what I get for sleeping with her. After posting the video on TikTok, Garaaposs clip was viewed more than m times, with .m likes and , comments. Gara said: On TikTok, I love the comments. Theyaposre so funny, everyone is laughing at me. It was so funny, I just couldnapost not share it with people.Entertained social media users joked the naked guinea pig was trying to make itself a aposguinea wigapos - while others noted it was abehaviour called aposbarberingapos.One person said: Itaposs called barbering and it shows dominance lol. Another added: She said aposIaposm making myself a wigapos. A third joked: I canapost get over this. This is the best. Okay I have to leave now because Iaposm laughing too much that I might wake up my husband.

Lewis Hamill, a -year-old sales executive, had a photo of national sporting hero Ben Brereton inked on his belly last week. He claimed the choice of image was primarily because it “fitted in well” with his other body art. But after a pal posted a picture of the tattoo on social media, Lewis was inundated with requests from fans and reporters based in South America wanting to find out more about the ink featuring the Blackburn Rovers and Chile ace. Lewis said a Chilean business even petitioned Pepsi to give him a letime supply of their famous drink. “I’ve been on CNN over there, ESPN Chile – it’s gone mad,” he said. “To me, it was just getting another tattoo, but now there’s some Chilean sports company trying to get Pepsi to give me a year’s supply.  “I’ve had messages from Chileans saying: aposYou are the third most loved British person in Chileapos. “They said first is Ben Brereton and second is Mr Bean, so I’m now being put in the same category as someone like Mr Bean.”Tattoo-mad Lewis, from Oswaldtwistle near Blackburn, had the picture of Ben Brereton inked onto his stomach by a friend at the end of November, Lancs Live reported. Lewis said he chose the image of Brereton wearing a flat cap, taken from a Pepsi TV commercial, as it worked well with his other body art. “I’ve got tattoos everywhere on my body – and I am a Blackburn fan anyway – but the picture itself just fitted in well,” Lewis said. “Because he’s got the flat cap on, it’s like an old-fashioned look, and I’ve got the Kray twins on my belly and an old-fashioned film guy on my chest.  “When it’s all finished, it will just look like a normal thing, andsomeone doesn’t know who he is, then it will just look normal.” Stoke-born Brereton, who currently plays club football for Blackburn Rovers, qualied to represent Chile through his mum in .He then became a national hero after playing against Lionel Messi and Neymar in the Copa America football tournament and has since attracted legions of supporters online. So when one of Lewis’s pals posted a photo of his tattoo on a Blackburn Football club Facebook page, it wasnapost long before he got requests for more information. “My friend posted it saying, “Check out my mate’s new tattoo!” Then someone commented on it, a Chilean man, saying aposWhoeveraposs tattoo this is, please can you contact me apos “He said to me, aposI’ve got a Brereton fan page with , followers on it. He’s a superstar in Chile. Can I please have your permission to post it onto my page apos“Within the space of a couple of hours, my phone was just going mad. I had Chilean reporters contact me on Instagram.”One team of reporters from Chile happened to be making a documentary about Brereton in the UK at the time, and they invited Lewis to meet the star the next day. When he was finally united with the centre-forward at Blackburn Rover’s training ground, Lewis was thrilled to find out that he liked his tattoo.  Lewis said: “The first thing the reporters said to him is, aposThis person has a tattoo of youapos and he said, aposYeah, it’s a good tattoo.apos “He asked me, ‘What made you get it ’ and I said, aposIt’s just a good picture, innit.apos “Obviously, they then lted up my top straight away and said, ‘Will you sign it ’” From there, Lewis said all the major media organisations in Chile got in touch with him about his tattoo, leading him to appear on several national news channels.

Hermit Agafya Lykova, , is getting a solar  to provide electricity to power a satellite phone to enable her to summon help to her remote home hundreds of miles from anywhere in Siberia. She has accepted the technological gadgetry amid concerns for her health in the remote snow forest - where temperatures plunge to minus C in winter . Agafya is the sole survivor of a family that in  fled into the wilderness - where she was born - to avoid religious persecution and death squads under Stalin. The Lykov family of devout Orthodox Old Believers remained undiscovered in the harsh wild for four decades staying out of sight for the Second World War and Yuri Gagarin’s landmark first manned mission to space. They lived - as she still does - guided by an old bible in the Western Sayan Mountains in an area where wolves and bears roam.  This year also saw a new one storey timber prefabricated home brought to her mountainside, replacing the tumbledown shack built by her father and brothers, where she was born. Soon after it was built, a fire partially destroyed her old home. Viktor Nepomnyashchiy, director of the Khakassky Nature Reserve, made a helicopter visit to the hermit to check on her wellbeing as the deepest winter sets in. “We delivered parcels, letters, presents and a solar , which was installed by volunteers,” he said.  “Agafya showed me the new house. “These days she has six goats, three cats and a dog called Tsvetochek .” Agafya has refused repeated attempts to persuade her to move to “civilisation” in a town or city. The improvements in the iconic Russian woman’s le have been funded by billionaire Oleg Deripaska, say reports. It was in  that her lost family were spotted by Soviet geologists flying over the remote mountains.  Special measures are being taken to avoid Agafya catching Covid- from occasional visitors, not least because it was the contact with Soviet people after four decades that led to her family members catching infections that killed them. “We all take extreme care when visiting Agafya,” explained local official Alexander. “Virus or no virus - she is like a Mowgli who has never come across modern day infections and diseases. “We know how disciplined and cautious we must be in making sure she stays safe.”  Agafya was the fourth child of Karp and Akulina Lykov, and for the first  years of her le she had no contact at all with anyone outside her family. Her mother died in , her father passed away in . Old Believers split from the Orthodox Church in  after protesting against reforms, and many moved to remote areas of Siberia in tsarist times.

Jessica Leidolph was left disfigured by the attack which almost cost the -year-old her le.She was mauled by the creature and after the animalaposs claw caught her carotid artery, it caused her to lose pints and pints of blood. She now has three metal plates on the right side of her face having attempted to bring out the product to raise funds to support unwanted animals. Now Jessica has decided to publish the calendar - despite the torment the shoot caused.  The page for August will always be etched in the modelaposs mind as within seconds of posing, the big cat called Troya pounced, biting her face and head. Jessica, who also worked as an animal rights activist and a physiotherapist, was critically injured after Troja attacked her out of nowhere during a photoshoot at a retirement home for show animals in the German city of Nebra. She underwent surgery after she was taken to the nearest hospital by helicopter on th August. But Jessica, who will reportedly have to carry the attack scars forever, begged the authorities not to put the big cat down, saying: I donapost want the animal to be killed, it just followed its instincts. It was unfortunate. I am glad there was no request to euthanise the animal. Jessica entered the leopardsapos enclosure at the aposSeniorenresidenz fur Showtiereapos - a retirement home for show animals - when the -year-old leopard suddenly attacked her.  Troja and another leopard living in the enclosure named Paris, , had once graced TV screens in an advert for multinational electronics giant Panasonic before they were moved to the retirement home in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt. She said: He attacked me, I couldnapost look that fast. I was sitting by the tree trunk and all of a sudden I was lying on the ground. He bit into my cheek, ear, head, and then again and again on my head. And then I screamed, put my hands in front of my face. At some point, he let go of me for a moment so that I could roll away and get out of the cage. A little while later, the ambulance and helicopter were there.  Jessica, who was brought to the hospital with severely bleeding wounds and was immediately operated on. She said she lost consciousness and the next thing she heard was the helicopter airlting her to hospital. However, instead of holding grudges, Jessica, who will reportedly have to carry the attack scars forever, has now shared images of the photoshoot as her new calendar is printed ahead of the new year. She said: I have been making yearly calendars with sexy photos of me and my proteges for many years. The sales will be used to maintain my private animal sanctuary.

Its destination: Mars.Touching down on the Red Planet on earth day February  , the two robotic companions began their lonely journey together trundling and hovering across the surface of the planet.Their mission is to find signs of habitability, as humanity continues to seethere really is any possibility of le on Mars - either for us or for something .As it goes about its mundane daily work looking for signs of ancient extraterrestrial le in a bid to save the human race, Perseverance pauses from time to time to take in its surroundings.But what did the rover spot when it looked up into space  What did Mars rover Perseverance see  Looking up it saw one of Marsapos two moons, Demios. Deimos is tiny, an irregularly shaped aposmoonapos in Marsapos orbit and is smaller than its larger sibling Phobos. Perseveranceaposs time-lapse lasts for  seconds and picks out a shining star-like object in the sky - this is Deimos. Its team said: Sky watching is fun no matter where you are. I took this short time lapse movie to watch for clouds, and caught something : look closely and you’ll see Deimos, one of two moons of Mars.  Deimos is the namesake of the Roman god of panic and is a mere seven miles in diameter, making it shorter than Manhattan in New York. It orbits the Red Planet once every  hours and has an unusual shiny appearance - It looks smooth, especially when compared to our own moon. This is because when it is struck by rocks in space it doesnapost have the gravitational force to pull back dust knocked off from it - instead they float into space. The dust is held in place by Marsapos orbit, so when Deimos comes around and passes once again it crashes through a cloud of its own matter burying the craters on its surface like ruins in a sandstorm, softening its details and giving it a shiny appearance. It also looks a bit like a potato.  What is Mars rover Perseverenceaposs mission  The rover aims to collect samples from ious points of interest on the surface of Mars. This will be with the overall goal of finding evidence of ancient microbial le and further efforts to better understand the habitability of Mars, past, present and future. It collects its samples with a drill, and then stores and preserves them so that future missions could potentially retrieve them andthem to earth for analysis. Its mission will last around one Mars year or  earth days. At the time of writing it has completed  Mars days, known as sols.

In the video, captured by Terry Healy, the commercial jet can be seen swaying from side-to-side as it approaches the tarmac. It lurches up and then down as it gets closer, drting off its axis as it slowly makes its way down. While those onboard my have endured a nerve wracking end to their flight, the pilot manages to stick the landing. Dublin was one of a number of counties placed under a Status Orange alert by Met Eireann on Tuesday as Storm Barra hit Ireland. The weather front worked its way from West to East as Tuesday went on, bringing with it wind speeds of over mph.Weather warnings remain in place across Ireland, after thousands of people were left without power as wind and rain battered parts of the country for hours on Tuesday. Many schools, colleges and universities will remain closed today due to the dangerous weather. The UK is also expected to feel the affects of Storm Barra today. ScotRail has warned that some Wednesday services will be cancelled due to the storm. The Environment Agency has issued  flood warnings for England at locations including Hartlepool and Sunderland in the North East, Bournemouth and Weymouth in the South, and part of the Cumbrian coast. Some  flood alerts, for areas where flooding is possible, have also been issued across the country. The Scottish Environment Protection Agencyhas sent  flood alerts and five warnings for areas in the north-east of Scotland and the south-west. Natural Resources Wales has also issued  flood warnings and  alerts, mainly covering coastal areas. Schools in Dumfries and Galloway were forced to close because of the weather. Stranraer Academy was shut after the wind caused structural damage to the roof, the council said, and Drummore School closed after trees were blown down. However, temperatures will be mild for the time of year today, with London predicted to see C, C in Cardf, C for Edinburgh and C in Belfast.

Two dogs were found dead in the “tightly secured” shed with its door and window blocked up, with a “huge pile of moulding faeces” next to them. ISPCA inspector Fiona Conlon found the dogs on Christmas Eve  at the vacant property in County Carlow, Ireland. She told Carlow District Court she saw a small rusty coloured terrier running loose, before spotting the locked shed. She said it took her several minutes to remove the locks and tape holding the door closed.  When she got inside she found a larger Doberman cross and a white fawn terrier. Inspector Conlon described the dogs as “bony, gaunt and visibly undernourished”. There were empty containers and no food or water could be seen. She said she saw faeces which gave off a “horrendous stench”. The one live dog and two dead ones were removed and taken to a local vet. A post-mortem revealed the two dead dogs were dehydrated and emaciated with no body fat and no signs of food in their stomach before their deaths. Christine Browne, from Tullow, appeared at Carlow District Court on December  where she pleaded guilty to  offences under the Animal Health and Welfare Act . William Maher, who was acting on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture Food and the Marine, asked Inspector Conlon how she would rate the seriousness of the offences.  Inspector Conlon said the dogs were left to starve, dying a horrendous death while locked in a shed with no food or water. During sentencing, Judge Cephas Power said the evidence photos and statement from Inspector Conlon said the suffering the dogs endured was at the top of the scale. In addition to the disqualication, Judge Power imposed a five-month custodial sentence, suspended for one year and ordered that Browne pay a total of €, in court and ISPCA costs.ISPCA Inspector Conlon said: “As Animal Welfare Inspectors, we find dogs that are thin, injured or in need of veterinary care. You remove the animals from their bad situations, get them the attention they need and they have hope, hope for a better le.“In this case, there was no hope, the dogs were deceased. These two dogs were barricaded into a shed and deprived of the basic requirements to live, food and water. “These actions resulted in the poor dogs suffering a slow horrendous death the thoughts of which haunt me to this day.” Read MoreRead MoreMost ReadDont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON AnimalsDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Early religious writings tell the story that Thenew was a victim of her fatherrsquos cruel vengeance for what he believed to be her disobedience and wrongful behaviour.One early medieval account by Jocelinus, a monk from Furness, tells us: ldquoBy the kingrsquos command, she was led to the top of a very high hill called Dunpelder, that, cast down from thence, she might be broken limb by limb, or dashed to pieces.But that didnrsquot work, so she was instead taken to the shore of Aberlady and put into the small hide vessel, pulled from the shore and set adrt.Magsrsquo art captures the terror and desperation of Thenewrsquos situation, as her tiny boat is taken by the tide out to the open sea. It is rocked by waves and she clings on for le, the freezing water lapping over her.But thankfully, there is a happy ending to this story. Her small boat begins to drt inland, across the Firth of Forth, away from the kingdom of her abuser and towards the opposite shore, where she lands just in time. There, on the beach by Culross in Fe, she finds a fire with embers still giving warmth.Jocelinus tells us: ldquoThere were, in the neighbourhood, shepherds keeping watch over the flocks. And they beheld a fire lighted close at hand, and coming with haste found the young woman with her childbirth completed, and the child wrapped in rags, lying in the open air. They, moved by pity, took care of them by increasing the fire and supplying food, and procuring other necessarieshellipSt Serf took them in and cared for them, and Thenewrsquos child would become Saint Kentigern.This story is not provable history, of course, more likely itrsquos mostly legend making. Yet unknown truths often lie under the surface of legends and I for one have always seen the universal truths in this story.When I look into the faces of my children, I hope and pray they will never feel the fear and desperation that is on the face of Thenew of being cast at sea with the desperate hope of finding a safe place.And , God forbid, they ever do, I hope they will be met by people like those shepherds.Andever they, or I, were to meet someone in such a desperate situation, then I hope we would be like those shepherds and respond with kindness, understanding and compassion.That, for

The UK Government and devolved governments are expecting charities to fill the gap and are failing to do their moral duty to all their constituents and look after the deprived.There is something far wrong when millionaires have had substantial increases in their finances during this pandemic when so many have suffered. Since the end of the Second World War, company senior management and directors have increased their income by incredible percentages and have more money than any fair-minded person would agree was acceptable. Many of these people own more property and other goods than they can ever use.Privatisation of public utilities has led to poor services but large profits for shareholders. Scottish Water is one utility still in public hands and is endeavouring to bring facilities up to standard and is still keeping bills at a reasonable level.

The problem is that more than a third of the population of Scotland are at present unable to afford the current energy bills, let alone the alternatives, which have to be supplied and fitted at the householders expense.Admittedly a small and totally inadequate grant is available for the heat exchanger types, but these are untried and untested on any scale in this country. There are also drawbacks, such as the current radiators in houses here being unsuitable.The green lobby does not seem to care about what happens to people as long as their policies are fulfilled. However, I thought that the Scottish Government would have adopted a more responsible attitude to the matter of our people being able to keep their houses warm in winter.

Fundamentally, it comes down to declining player numbers across the board, allied with changes in lestyle and work patterns which mean that clubs need more personnel at their disposal now than, say,  years ago to last the course of a season. It is estimated that that it currently requires  registered players to be able to field two teams on a regular basis. Away matches are particularly problematic because less and less players are willing or able to give up chunks of their morning and evening as well their afternoon.The physicality of modern rugby ndash even at grassroots level ndash is surely also a factor. After the long Covid lay-off, it was inevitable that a substantial number of players, especially those in the older age brackets, would decide that they quite like waking up on a Sunday morning and not feeling like the have been run over by a bus. In many cases, people just got out of the habit of playing on a Saturday, and of leaving the house to train on a Tuesday and Thursday, so they ended up retiring almost by accident.Scottish Rugby ndash the gamersquos governing body in this country ndash is not responsible for this worrying trajectory, but it has a responsibility to do more to address the issue.The first step should be recognising what everyone at ground level knows: that there are not , active male players in the country. Massaging this stat makes sense from a PR perspective, especially when it comes to the challenge of persuading the Scottish Government, sportscotland and ious commercial partners that rugby is a sport worth getting behind. However, until the problem is properly acknowledged, we canrsquot possibly hope to tackle it.In fairness, Scottish Rugbyrsquos lsquoGame On Principlesrsquo initiative, which facilitates lower regional league matches and friendlies going ahead when a team has as few as  players, is a specic attempt to ensure that available players donrsquot miss out because they donrsquot have enough team-mates. But it is a sticking-plaster solution which doesnrsquot address the fundamental problem, and anecdotal evidence indicates that clubs are more likely to call-off than send out  players to fulfil a fixture.We need practical solutions ndash and that means money. It has been just under  months since the Scottish Government provided Scottish Rugby with a poundmillion grant and poundm low-interest loan ldquoto support rugby clubs across Scotland that have been affected by the pandemic, and despite assurances of openness from Murrayfield, we have still not had sight of how that money has been spent. There is also unease about the lack of clarity on what specically this money was meant to be spent on.A pound.m funding package for clubs was announced by Murrayfield in April ndash consisting of poundk for lsquorecoveryrsquo, poundm for lsquo to rugbyrsquo and poundm spread over five years for lsquogrowth and participationrsquo ndash with clubs to apply for specic grants.We have no idea at this stage how the distribution of this money is progressing.Contrast this with how the Scottish Government funding allocated to football at the same time was handled, with the full poundm grant for clubs outside the top-flight being immediately disbursed by the SFA directly to clubs ndash no need for an application process ndash at values based on the league each club plays in.Scottish Rugby chief executive Mark Dodson and chairman of the board John Jeffrey have told us how well the business has coped with Covid, so letrsquos see that translated into meaningful, direct investment in the grassroots. There are some great facilities out there, but far too many clubs are working out of crumbling relics from the s or earlier. Mini rugby clubs are competing for players againstyouth football teams who are operating in a dferent financial stratosphere, with paid coaches, state-of-the-art facilities andbrand-new kit. We need more development officers working inside clubs and schools, rather than pen pushers sitting behind desks at Murrayfield.Wouldnrsquot it be great to be able to give every kid in Scotland who joins a rugby club a new ball that they can practice at home with  That is something which could have an immediate impact on growing the game.Until we get a breakdown of how the government bail-out has been distributed, the suspicion will persist that the money has been used to prop up Murrayfieldrsquos finances, with layers of bureaucracy being created to justy a bloated payroll at head office, while the grassroots game is neglected."},{"url":null,"title":"liam-kelly-hailed-motherwell-boss-graham-alexander-ditching-qpr-first-team-football","story":"Many young footballers are snapped up by wealthy clubs attracted by their potential, only to find themselves wasting away on the periphery as short-term fixes and bigger names prevail.

Diesel trains continue to generate polluting emissions, and a network largely built in Victorian times clearly canrsquot be expected to fully align with st century environmental standards.Scotland has huge ambition when it comes to greening rail travel. It has set a target date of  for eliminating diesel across its  kilometres of track, though it is clear that meeting that deadline is going to be a challenge.At present, only % of the network north of the border is electried, compared to % across the UK as a whole. This means that some  kilometres of track in all have been identied as needing electrication.However, other novel solutions are going to be required to decarbonise in the required timescale, including hydrogen and battery power as well as the more traditional overhead wires.Siemens Mobility is working to help shape the future of the railway in Scotland, developing innovative technology that will create a network ready for the low carbon age.Justin Moss, the companyrsquos Head of Sales for Electrication, concedes that a timescale of just  years before diesel is taken out of the picture presents a challenge ndash but is not impossible.ldquoItrsquos not very long away. But we have some real experts when it comes to modelling, looking at areas such as power requirements. We are examining how we can electry further and faster, while being aware that we may not have everything completed by .ldquoWe are looking at the rolling stock we can use andwe can bring in hydrogen and battery power as a kind of sticking plaster to get the biggest reduction in carbon as quickly as possible, with electrication rolled out after that.It is easy to see why expanding the existing electried network is so daunting: it needs considerable infrastructure including overhead wires and existing structures such as bridges could have to be altered to accommodate these.ldquoAlso, Scotland is a country with hills and mountains and there is a challenge in getting power to those areas in the most cost efficient way possible. It may be better to use hydrogen power, for example on the west coast.ldquoWe are working with Transport Scotland and Network Rail to model the routes, look at the best solution to get to net zero as quickly as possible.As a large and specialised global company, Siemens has a recognised capability in areas such as signalling and rolling stock ldquoItrsquos a case of working together very closely as a team to come up with the most efficient solutions. We want to go as quickly as possible, Justin Moss explains.Routes need to be examined, identying which ones are the easiest and most cost effective to electry quickly. At the same time, low or zero carbon alternatives need to be considered for the more dficult ones, including those in remote areas.ldquoYoursquore not going to demolish or fundamentally change things like historic bridges, so itrsquos about how you solve the problem of how you put power there.Equipping a new generation of trains with hydrogen technology could offer an answer, but Mr Moss points out that it is a new and emerging low carbon offering for which there will be huge parallel demand from cars, heavy goods vehicles and heating.ldquoAt the moment, the infrastructure just isnrsquot there to fill the trains up with hydrogen. However Siemens Mobility is partnering with Siemens Energy to provide the full hydrogen rail system including refuelling and green hydrogen supply and currently has two hydrogen rail projects underway in Germany.ldquoElectrication currently offers the best solution as it provides the biggest carbon reduction, so that will always be our starting point. Butyou canrsquot use that technology, hydrogen could be a good route to take.It is likely that some of the trains of the future will be able to operate using dferent power sources ndash or in bi-mode, as the industry calls it.As well as working in the traditional electried way ndash picking up power from overhead wires through a pantograph on the top of the train ndash they may also have an alternative technology using a battery or hydrogen. This would mean their operation could be similar to a current hybrid car, running on one fuel source and then switching seamlessly to the other when necessary.As an example, the trains might run on battery power through stations, avoiding the need for the complex new infrastructure needed for electrication and cutting down on noise.A feasibility study is ongoing and development work currently taking place with Transport Scotland. Other parts of the rail network will also need to be upgraded, including the signalling infrastructure. Smart technologies can not only reduce emissions on their own, but also help to replace a lot of the existing physical trackside infrastructure.Replacing this with on-train and in-cab technology will help in a number of ways by driving cost efficiencies, providing better information for drivers and allowing for a greater frequency of trains, meaning that they can run closer together and consequently that capacity can be increased.ldquoI see signalling as an enabler for decarbonisation, says Campbell Braid, Siemens Mobilityrsquos Signal and Programme Director. ldquoBut itrsquos expensive and we have to deliver more efficiencies to make it an affordable part of the process.ldquoWe need to convert a lot of the existing mechanical infrastructure such as signal boxes, which means upgrading the technology to make it electrication ready. This will also bring benefits for passengers and freight.There is no single solution, Mr Braid says. ldquoWe need to find a way to deliver more efficiently in order to allow more trains to run to a timetable that allows passengers to move quickly. Thatrsquos where in-cab technology and train detection systems come in.Can Scotlandrsquos railway really be decarbonised as early as , though  ldquoI think the answer to that is yes. We do need to go faster and we need to be dferent, but through a mix and match of technology and rolling stock, wersquoll have a joined up system.www.siemens sustainablemobility------------------------------------------lsquoE-highwaysrsquo look set to be the direction of travelTHERE is no question about it: transport belches out carbon. As a sector, it is responsible for  per cent of global emissions. This means that radical thinking is needed to develop innovative solutions.One promising answer to the problem of pollution caused by road traffic is to build e-highways. These will cut emissions from HGVs, and a number of companies including Siemens have extensively tested them in Germany, Sweden and the United States.In some ways, this proposed technology harks back to the days of trolley buses some  years ago, though it is clearly more sophisticated.E-highways will use powered overhead wires, with lorries having pantographs fitted to draw the electricity.The power supplied would power an electric motor on the vehicle. At the same time, it would charge an onboard battery, allowing the lorry to use this when it drove off the directly electried route.A consortium including Siemens Mobility, is to undertake a pilot e-Highway project in Yorkshire. This is part of the poundm put aside for zero emission road freightfeasibility studies and aims to electry some of the major UK freight roads by .ldquoEffectively, we are taking rail technology and putting it on the motorway, but we now need to see how it will work in terms of logistics, says Siemens Mobilityrsquos Justin Moss.ldquoIt will be a way of reducing carbon output from HGVs, using the sort of overhead line you would find on a light rail system. This would be installed above the slow lane of the motorway for vehicles to attach themselves to.ldquoWersquove identied that the road link between Glasgow and Edinburgh, for instance, would work very well for this sort of technology. It complements the need for getting more freight on the railway.ldquoYoursquore not going to get rid of HGVs completely, but this solution would work in terms of agility.

The Scottish Government via Transport Scotland have funded around half the £. million costs.The council’s head of marine services, transportation and harbour master, Jim Buck, is confident that the new m modern fibre glass vessel will have been worth the wait.“We are delighted to be able to announce the start date for the Nordic Sea. The Golden Mariana has served the communities well, but it’s time now for a younger, more comfortable vessel to take over. At m, with a m beam, the Nordic Sea will be able to carry  passengers and is capable of running at between - knots, which is a little faster than the Golden Mariana. She has stabilisers installed to help with the motion and is a much more luxurious vessel for passengers and, very importantly, is fully accessible for those who require this.”The ship has attracted plenty of speculation, after long periods of being tied up since being purchased in April . COVID delayed a £, refit programme, and further complicating matters has been the retirement of the previous skipper of the Golden Mariana and the longer-than-anticipated recruitment process for crew to serve on the Nordic Sea.Mr Buck went on to explain why the process has taken longer than some had expected.“It would appear to have taken a long time but actually in respect of the certication process when taking a vessel from one country to another it has actually been remarkably quick. She is the first vessel of her type to go through that process and with that comes inevitable hurdles that need to be overcome. The Nordic Sea had a series of modications made to bring her up to the full UK Classication and Certication standard.“She was built to a dferent specication so had to go through the required checks and balances to ensure we met the current specications for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency’s current passenger vessel system.”He is confident that she will be a favourable addition to the fleet.“She is a really good sea keeping vessel with good properties designed with the right centre of height for that comfortable ride.”Councillor David Dawson, chair of the board of Orkney Ferries, said: “I would like to recognise the efforts of the team here in Orkney for getting us to this stage, particularly given the challenges added in by the pandemic, but also for the patience of the people of Papay. We must not forget the faithful service of the Golden Mariana and crew who have served the communities well.“From the information I have received from seagoing staff who have taken the Nordic Sea out in what could be described as ‘challenging conditions’, I have every confidence that the Papay community will not be disappointed in what is a first-class vessel.“We are grateful for the support we’ve received from the Scottish Government and Transport Scotland to enable the purchase of the vessel and are looking forward to the inaugural journey.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The craftmanship is outstanding and we now have an addition which befits this treasured building loved by so many near and far.”The cathedral#s stonework also enjoyed a facelt recently.Conservation works included repointing stonework with lime mortar on the interior and exterior of the west door. Samples of original lime mortars were found deep in the constructions joints of the building and were analysed by the Scottish Lime Centre in Fe. An appropriate mix was specied, to match in manner of strength, colour and aggregate size.For anyone wishing to visit there are signs directly through the side gate, please be mindful of the restrictions in place in regards to the pandemic such as the wearing of masks and social distancing while inside.St Magnus Cathedral is managed by OIC on behalf of the people of Orkney. Casey Construction Ltd. was awarded the contract to carry out the essential maintenance work and improvements.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There were no help groups, no mental health care, back then.“We went to my grannys to live for a while and then we came back to the house, the three of us, and that was it. It was a case of paddle your own canoe, really.“My dads going out to work every day as a painter and decorator and we were two young boys going out to school.“Its really just about capturing that time and the values he taught us as kids without ever really knowing he was doing it - or us realising what he was doing. The behaviours, we just kinda copied him.“Thats what I realised as I started to right this thing, that this is what it was...”Ironically, it was his grand daughters prompting that convinced him to put pen to paper in the first place.“About a year ago, my eldest grand daughter said to me - grandad, remember all the old stories you used to tell us when we were kids, about our grandad, racing the pigeons. She told me one of them, almost word for word. I thought, I really must capture those for posterity, for the family. RETIREMENT “Obviously, when retirement and lockdown came into play I had a lot more time on my hands so I sat down at the laptop to fiddle about and to write these wee stories.“As I started, this thing just took on a le of its own and became something completely dferent which was kind of a surprise to me, but a very pleasant surprise, as I really enjoyed writing it.”And I really enjoyed reading it, this simple tale of a hard-working father and his two sons making their way in the world.But the real stars of the book are the pigeons to whom Frankie cleverly lends human traits, such as the ability to talk - characters like Proud Boy, Warhorse and Bootsy.And, of course, Princess Sofia, who we come to learn resembles Frankie’s own mother.The trials and tribulations of the loft in attempting to win the biggest prizes in the sport resemble the struggles faced by Frankie’s family in an era when times were tough.But this isn’t a depressing tale rather, it is an uplting story of how families and, by extension, close-knit communities bandied together to overcome adversity. With a healthy dose of pigeon racing nostalgia thrown in for good measure.“Whilst some of the pigeon names and details have been changed the book is based on true le events,” continues Frankie.“It was never my intention to get the book published, I only started writing it as something to give the grandkids. “I really dont care about the business side of things – its just nice that people can read about my father.“I suppose people are quite surprised about the book but there’s more interest there than anything which is great.“Depending on the feedback who knows, there might even be a second one.”‘The Penzance Smash,’ published by Austin McAuley is out now."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1638889858358.jpg--covid_19___tue_7th_december_figures.jpg?1638889858000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20211207newscovid 19 tue 7th december figures","story":"The NI Department of Health dashboard shows five further coronavirus related deaths and  new positive test results.

Presents can be left under the tree in their Church Street shop until  December. Alternatively, vouchers for a haircut in the store can be donated.According to latest figures, around  young people, aged -, leave care each year in Northern Ireland. With more children in care now than ever before, the number is set to grow over the coming years.VOYPIC works across the region, supporting children in care and young people leaving care. The organisation runs ious groups and forums from its office on Garfield Place, as well as supporting inidual young people through coaching and an independent advocacy service.Iain Black, Northern Area Manager at VOYPIC, said, “Christmas is a happy time for most, but for some young people it can be tough. Young care leavers often feel isolated, and Christmas can be a particularly dficult time.“We know that young men leaving care can face a whole range of additional challenges, so we hope that by partnering with The Barber Collective we can start a conversation on how we can help them feel more connected and valued across our community.”Chris Power, from The Barber Collective, explained why the business has decided to support young care leavers.He said: “We realise that we are fortunate enough to be in the position to give and receive gts. Not everyone is as fortunate, but everybody should have a present on Christmas morning.”Gts should be suitable for young people, aged - years old. Presents for young men are particularly need this Christmas. Popular gts include hats, scarves and gloves, home essentials, toiletries, and sweet treats. Gt vouchers, including phone top-ups, utilities vouchers, and supermarket gt cards, are particularly welcomed by young people.Alternatively customers of the Barber Collective can ‘pay it forward’ by gting a voucher for a free haircut to a young man with experience of care.Stuart Forsythe, a care experienced Young Leader in VOYPIC, welcomed the initiative stating: “Sometimes, getting your hair cut can drop down the list of priorities, especially when money is tight. But, sitting in the chair, it gives you time to stop and take a breath, to have a chat with the barber, and to take some time for yourself.”“And, getting your hair cut- it just makes you feel better,” he added.Gts can be left under the tree at the The Barber Collective, Church Street, during working hours until Saturday  December.For more information about VOYPIC, visit www.voypic.org or search VOYPIC across social media.

At the same time, there were  Covid- patients in critical care beds and  Covid- occupied beds.Fast forward to yesterday and the seven-day case rate stood at ,, with five Covid- related deaths recorded by the Department of Health. There were  Covid- patients in intensive care and  Covid- occupied beds.So, even though the seven-day case rate this day last year was a quarter of what it is now, there were % more people hospitalised with the virus than there was yesterday.And while every death is a tragedy, it must be seen as positive that fewer Covid- deaths are being recorded now than at the beginning of the vaccine rollout.For her part, -year-old Joanna is humbled yet delighted to have been part of the team that has helped to deliver the vaccination programme to date – despite all of the challenges they have faced.“For me, this past year has completely been a success but only for the fact of the staff,” she said.“It’s been amazing to watch. We’ve had the director of nursing, the deputy director of nursing, they both gave up one day a week out of their own hours to come out and vaccinate like everyone  and it’s incredible to have seen the team do that.“To be able to say that one year on, we have done over a quarter of a million vaccinations just in the Royal Hospital, it’s completely crazy and it has been an absolute whirlwind, but we see how tired our colleagues are, how burnt out they are trying to keep the service going where.“To be honest, a lot of the days that we’re fighting to get as many people through as possible has been because we know it will take a bit of pressure off them.”Responding to concerns and misinformation about the vaccines has also been an important of Joanna’s role: Multiple times a day, the front door staff will come down to my office and say there is someone here who wants to speak to the nurse in charge.“It’s someone who’s sitting on the fence about vaccinations and they want a chat, they want the patient information leaflet, they’re sitting on the fence because they want to go on holiday, and the only reason they are getting a vaccination is to do that or because of the Covid passport.At times, I have actually said, ‘I don’t think it is a good idea for you to proceed to vaccination today because I don’t think you have thought this through’.I give them the information to take home and tell them to think about it. They may not get vaccinated that day but they know that we’re open and accessible.There won’t be a necessity to have a vaccination to travel when we come out of this, this is a short-term public health initiative in order to protect people.It’s exactly the same as Covid passports, it isn’t a way to prevent people from living a normal le, it is a way to try to keep the economy going as the only other option apart from lockdown, as well as keeping as many people as possible safe when they do go out.”Knowing that lives are being saved and witnessing the reactions of people turning up for vaccination, as well as the letters and cards from patients, have been a huge lt for the vaccination staff over the past year.We keep them all in a box and I even got a letter from someone in India who had seen me in a newspaper out there from when I was vaccinated and they wanted to say thank you.“There was also an occasion where a lady asked me to help her outside and when we got there, her daughter was standing crying in the car park at the thought it had made her mum a wee bit safer.It was so emotional, she was so happy that her mum was going to be better protected that she was crying in the car park.“We did a lot of the time have people coming through and they were very, very worried in the vaccination hall that they were going to be too close to people… but they were so grateful to have a conversation.“It was the first time they’d had a conversation with a real person for months and it was shocking but it really made the day for the vaccinators.“My workforce in the vaccination centre is % bank sht and overtime retired staff and for a long time throughout the pandemic, they had quite a bit of survivor’s guilt that they couldn’t do something to help.“They were sitting at home, they knew they could be helpful but it was going to be too high of a risk to go into an ICU and they finally felt this was something they could participate in and this was something they could give back.“When you have conversations like that, it really honestly made their day, made their year, it made them feel they had helped so much.”Most ReadStorm Barra: NIE confirm  homes remain without power as weather easesLidl gets green light for three new NI storesO’Neill: We were placed at a disadvantage by the anthemMan arrested after car drives into front door of Belfast shopStorm Barra named after BBC NI weather presenterTop VideosPlayWatch: Storm Barra makes landfall on Northern IrelandPlayFire fighters deal with the arson attack on Graeme Campbell#s homePlayWatch: Storm Barra live tracker mapLatest CoronavirusFirst three cases of Omicron Covid iant detected in Northern IrelandMargaret Keenan a shining example for the world, says niece of world’s first Covid vaccine recipientUnvaccinated over-s are playing Russian roulette, warns medic‘Unclear’ how much of £.m wrongly paid out in Covid support in Northern Ireland will be recoupedCoronavirus Northern Ireland: First three cases of Omicron iant detectedLatestUpper Crust owner continues journey to recovery as Omicron poses uncertaintyDaughter of woman who died alone a year ago voices fury at No  party videoCelebrities settle damages claims against publisher of News Of The WorldOleksandr Zinchenko wants to see a quick response from Manchester CityBelfast officers who arrested Troubles victim at Ormeau Road massacre commemoration will not face prosecution,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The low share of services in trade flows from Ireland to Northern Ireland is in contrast with the high overall services content of Ireland’s exports to other markets, ESRI report stated. Ireland is one of the main markets for services trade from Northern Ireland.   The reports, published on Tuesday, assess cross-border trade in services and “enhancing the attractiveness of the island of Ireland” to high-value foreign direct investment . The first of the set of economic reports examines the extent of cross-border trade in services on the island of Ireland and the characteristics of the firms participating in this trade. The main services traded include transportation and storage, business services and computer consultancy. Sales to Ireland account for % of services outflows from Northern Ireland and for % of services inflows to Northern Ireland, the report states. For trade from Ireland, Northern Ireland accounts for slightly less than % of total services exports from Ireland. This reflects the relatively small size of the Northern Ireland economy and the highly export-orientated and FDI-dominated structure of Ireland’s services sector. In terms of the balance of trade, the report found that more services are exported from Northern Ireland to Ireland relative to those from Ireland to Northern Ireland. Examining the characteristics of services firms active in cross-border trade, the report finds that exporting firms in services are systemically larger and more productive than non-exporters. The author of the report, professor Martina Lawless, said: “The patterns identied in this report suggest that there is considerable scope for expansion of cross-border trade in services. “The monitoring of the effectiveness of trade support policies would be greatly improved by expanding and coordinating the information collected on cross-border services flows.” This second research report provides novel evidence on factors and policies underlying the attractiveness of Ireland and Northern Ireland to FDI in high-value knowledge-intensive sectors.      This research also explores opportunities for policy coordination and cooperation on the island of Ireland that could enhance the attractiveness of both jurisdictions to high-value FDI. The research finds that FDI in high-value sectors in Ireland and Northern Ireland accounts for substantial shares of all new greenfield FDI projects. At over %, these shares are higher than the corresponding averages for Great Britain and the EU countries. Speaking ahead of the launch of the reports, Tanaiste Leo Varadkar, said: “We commissioned this research to provide a high-quality evidence base for looking, in real terms, at how we could do more, and do better together, across both parts of this island. “How we could align better, levelling up and taking the best of both jurisdictions. “The research shows that there is much more scope to ‘think all-island’ when it comes to the services economy and attracting foreign direct investment, accruing economic and societal benefits both North and South.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Maryrsquos GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Mary’s GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

The low share of services in trade flows from Ireland to Northern Ireland is in contrast with the high overall services content of Ireland’s exports to other markets, ESRI report stated. Ireland is one of the main markets for services trade from Northern Ireland.   The reports, published on Tuesday, assess cross-border trade in services and “enhancing the attractiveness of the island of Ireland” to high-value foreign direct investment . The first of the set of economic reports examines the extent of cross-border trade in services on the island of Ireland and the characteristics of the firms participating in this trade. The main services traded include transportation and storage, business services and computer consultancy. Sales to Ireland account for % of services outflows from Northern Ireland and for % of services inflows to Northern Ireland, the report states. For trade from Ireland, Northern Ireland accounts for slightly less than % of total services exports from Ireland. This reflects the relatively small size of the Northern Ireland economy and the highly export-orientated and FDI-dominated structure of Ireland’s services sector. In terms of the balance of trade, the report found that more services are exported from Northern Ireland to Ireland relative to those from Ireland to Northern Ireland. Examining the characteristics of services firms active in cross-border trade, the report finds that exporting firms in services are systemically larger and more productive than non-exporters. The author of the report, professor Martina Lawless, said: “The patterns identied in this report suggest that there is considerable scope for expansion of cross-border trade in services. “The monitoring of the effectiveness of trade support policies would be greatly improved by expanding and coordinating the information collected on cross-border services flows.” This second research report provides novel evidence on factors and policies underlying the attractiveness of Ireland and Northern Ireland to FDI in high-value knowledge-intensive sectors.      This research also explores opportunities for policy coordination and cooperation on the island of Ireland that could enhance the attractiveness of both jurisdictions to high-value FDI. The research finds that FDI in high-value sectors in Ireland and Northern Ireland accounts for substantial shares of all new greenfield FDI projects. At over %, these shares are higher than the corresponding averages for Great Britain and the EU countries. Speaking ahead of the launch of the reports, Tanaiste Leo Varadkar, said: “We commissioned this research to provide a high-quality evidence base for looking, in real terms, at how we could do more, and do better together, across both parts of this island. “How we could align better, levelling up and taking the best of both jurisdictions. “The research shows that there is much more scope to ‘think all-island’ when it comes to the services economy and attracting foreign direct investment, accruing economic and societal benefits both North and South.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Maryrsquos GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Mary’s GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

Butwe were all truly honest, isn’t it the side dishes we’re actually looking forward to most  googletag.cmd.push Pigs in blankets, bread sauce, cranberry sauce, roasted parsnips, stuffing… these tasty jewels beside the golden bird are arguably the best bit. We asked some celeb chefs and food writers to share their favourite festive sides, with tips for how to cook them too… . Ruby Tandoh adores a Yorkshire pudding       “My favourite side dish has to be the Yorkshire pudding,” says Tandoh, author of new cookbook, Cook As You Are. “Whether or not it’s strictly canon depends on who you’re speaking to, but I can’t imagine a better vessel for mopping up gravy. It’s the perfect counterpoint to the meaty savouriness of the Christmas dinner plate.” . Gordon Ramsay has very specic thoughts on stuffing      “Stuffing’s something that people think needs to be stuffed in the cavity of the turkey – that’s the worst place to cook a stuffing. It’s not good in there. There’s a reason why you don’t put much in that cavity,” says Ramsay, whose new recipe collection, Ramsay In , is out now.“To make a really good stuffing is something I do separately. And so, I get the ground sausage, the pork, the beef. And then from there we’ll put in some smoked pancetta, some beautully roasted pistachios, some chopped up apricot and bake it in the tray prior. And then as it comes out, we’ll add some resting juices from the turkey and let it sit and absorb.” . Donal Skehan appreciates the humble Brussels sprout…     “Brussels sprouts are my favourite. I love them every way,” say Irish chef Skehan, author of Everyday Cook. “I love them as a salad as well. Very much a winter salad – in a food processor, bag of sprouts, straight down the chute into the chopper, mix it together with some really good chunks of Pecorino cheese, and some dried cranberries or even pomegranate, would be lovely. And then just a light dressing and some nuts maybe as well, something to crunch, toasted walnuts would be nice. Youmix that together and it’s like a Brussel’s sprout slaw, but it is stunning.” . Same goes for River Cottage’s Lucy Brazier       “Sprouts with chestnuts, because I think that tastes like Christmas,” says food writer Lucy Brazier, whose new cookbook, Christmas at River Cottage, is all about the festive food season. “I could eat a bowl of that without anything .” . Gino D’Acampo gets excited about the roasted veg       “I’m a huge roasted vegetable fan at Christmas,” says the chef, celebrating his new series and cookbook, Gino’s Italian Family Adventure. “We do them with balsamic vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, parsley, a few capers, all these – amazing. Funnily enough I do like stuffing, because what is stuffing, sausage with herbs and a bit of bread  Very tasty, I like that. I hate Turkey. I don’t like turkey.” . James Martin has a buttery way with carrots       Chef James Martin loves carrots cooked in butter – Butter being the title of his new cookbook. He does them “in a style of Vichy – Vichy is a town in the south of France. They cook everything in mineral water, sugar, butter and salt to produce this amazing taste, butyou use the addition of star anise it makes carrots taste amazing.” . Mary Berry champions the good old celeriac       “I love celeriac,” says Mary Berry . “I just cook it until it’s soft. It’s knobbly. If you grow it, it doesn’t come to fruition until November. You can buy it earlier. And I cook it until it’s tender then add full-fat cregraveme fresh to it and puree it. It is delicious. It reheats well.” She also makes chestnut stuffing. “I do them the day before and I do it in small shapes and fry them, then all I’ve got to do is reheat them.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Maryrsquos GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Mary’s GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

And they’re not alone – the research found a thirdof grandparents buy unsuitable gts for grandchildren at Christmas, closely followed by aunties , distant relativesand friends .  By asking yourself a few simple questions you can nail the art of gt-giving to both children and adults, promises Kim Brookes, who ran an online gt-registry for more than  years.   Have kids so that instead of real gts you can give friends and family novelty photo items with pictures of your children they saw on social media  months ago. — Some Boys MotherDecember ,    “Now’s the time to show your family just how much you love them by way of the perfect gt,” she says. “This is an opportunity not to be squandered, but one that causes a lot of stress at this time of year, as we really want to get it right.” Brookes, who now runs the natural scent jewellery brand, Perfino, suggests people choosing gts ask themselves these questions… . Do they really need it   Think about the person you’re buying for. You want to give them something that’s meaningful, not just for Christmas. Something that won’t be part of the re-gting cycle any time soon. So, it needs to be something they really want, rather than a short-term fad. “Subscriptions are a good option for this,” says Brookes. “Perhaps a comic or magazine – a gt that reminds them of you every month.” . Just because you love it, does that mean they will  Remember who you’re buying for and always keep their tastes and preferences at the forefront of your mind. “They may not want the chemistry set when their favourite subject is art, or the history book when they love nothing better than a murder mystery,” stresses Brookes.  . Have you really put proper thought into it  Don’t rush to buy something just because it’s there, without giving any thought to the person you’re buying for, says Brookes. “This is the worst offence,” she insists, “as it shows little consideration. Try to find some time to think long and hard about the child or person you’re buying for, and you’ll know what’ll make them happy, evenit’s not to your taste. Thankfully we’re all dferent.” . Have you gone too big    Brookes points out that while a gt recipient might love a trip to an adventure park for Christmas, and be a bit put out with a stick of deodorant, you’ll have a sense of what’s right. “And be very careful not to escalate,” she warns, “as you’ll be digging a hole for yourself on future gting occasions.” . Is it really eco-friendly  This question now has to be at the front of everyone’s minds, for your own satisfaction as well as the good of the planet, says Brookes. “I find the easiest way to do this is to trust who you’re buying from,” she says. “Most businesses will now put their eco credentials front and centre and,they don’t, look for one that does. Once you trust them, you can buy with an easy conscience.” . Have they already got it  If a potential gt is new and super-popular, it’s possible your gt recipient may already have it. If the gt’s for your own child, there’s a chance someone  may have bought it for them. “The best way forward could be to make some subtle enquiries,” advises Brookes, “andyou take the leap and buy, at least keep the receipt and be upfront about how happy you’d be to facilitate an exchange.”  . Are consumables a good choice   “We have so much at this time of year, so I’d avoid more chocolate, more sweets, more of anything unless it’s an extra-special treat – something they wouldn’t normally have, but which you know they’d enjoy,” suggests Brookes. . Are smellies always a winner  Smelly oils, creams etc may work for older children, teenagers and adults – but onlyyou know they like that sort of thing, warns Brookes, who says that, again, such items need to be really special to be a good gt. “Bath oil is my favourite thing,” she says, “but obviously it’s not for someone who only takes showers.” . Is it really appropriate  Consider whether something is age-appropriate for children and, of course, avoid anything made from plastic, stresses Brookes. . Is it going to look fabulous under the tree   It’s a minor consideration, but Brookes saysyou make the unwrapping experience a joyful one it can add that little bit of lovely Christmas sparkle to yourgt. “Ribbons, fabric, or even a drop of festive essential oil on the wrapping paper always work wonders,” she adds.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Maryrsquos GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Mary’s GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

Specsavers is encouraging avid readers to have regular eye tests so they can continue to indulge their hobby. Presbyopia is the gradual loss of our eyes’ ability to focus close up as the lens becomes less flexible. A natural part of ageing, it usually becomes noticeable around the age of . The condition is common and typically isn’t a cause for concern. But some struggle to adapt, and find they need to hold their book at arm’sto read the page or direct a light on it to see the words more clearly. For most people, the answer is a simple eye test which will identythey need reading glasses, multi-focal glasses or contact lenses to make words clearer – and le easier. Maeve Walsh, director at Specsavers Crescent Link in the Waterside and Ferryquay Street in the city centre, says: “It can sometimes be dficult for people to assess themselves whether they have presbyopia, which is why we always encourage regular eye tests, usually every two years. “As we age, it’s completely natural for our eyesight to worsen and it shouldn’t be something we worry about, providing our eyes are in good health. “My advice to those with presbyopia would be to carry your specs with you at all times and get into the habit of having them close by. This will help with activities like reading, and will also ensure you’re not straining your eyes, which can sometimes cause other problems.” To find out more about presbyopia, or to book an eye test visit:https:www.specsavers eye-health presbyopiaandwww.specsavers stores derryorwww.specsavers stores crescentlink Top five signs you have Presbyopia .

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec   addthis, Lynch’s, the local family retailer which operates a number of Spar and Eurospar stores and supermarkets, have opened their third local supermarket bringing their total store number to eight across the North West and Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Lynch’s Eurospar, Greysteel is the third outlet from the retailer to open under the popular Eurospar brand and has allowed management to more than double the number of jobs available, now employing  locally. Acquiring what was previously a Centra store on the site, company director Paul Lynch says the community needed a larger format supermarket brand that would not only bring a host of fresh and local produce and ranges, but would be convenient and complemented with services vital to the local area. Paul said: “We have invested around pound, to bring our supermarket experience to the Greysteel area and are so proud to open the doors. “We have more than doubled the size of the space which allows optimum navigation throughout the aisles, where shoppers will find an increased iety and range of fresh and local foods including our own meat offering and pre-packed ranges. “Importantly, we have continued the on-site partnership with Nicholl Fuels to offer locals a -hour fuel service with pre-pay pumps and we have  parking spaces to allow shoppers to conveniently load their cars safely.” The team has also retained important services including the Post Office, ATM, Lotto and PayPoint and added even more amenities and initiatives to bring value and choice to the area. The deli now serves an extended range of hot and cold food to go alongside Barista Bar coffee and Spar bakery, and shoppers can take advantage of the many deals available including the current  Deals of Christmas campaign which drops the price of big name items and festive essentials every week in the lead up to Christmas. Paul continued: “Eurospar also price matches over a thousand branded products to Tesco each week, so paired with our consistent schedule of value deals, we’re bringing a huge amount of savings for shoppers.” As is the Lynch and Eurospar ethos, the team in-store will implement outreach initiatives with the local community, sponsoring and supporting local clubs and organisations, while also fundraising for charity partner Cancer Fund for Children. Paddy Doody, sales and marketing director at Henderson Group, which owns the Eurospar brand in Northern Ireland added: “We now have  Eurospar supermarkets in Northern Ireland, each one bringing a wealth of convenience in a large format supermarket to their areas. “The Lynch’s are experienced independent retailers and know how to engage with their local communities, with an incredibly high bar set for customer service. “Its fantastic to see the Eurospar brand thriving under our independent retailers and we wish Lynch’s the best of luck with their new business.” The new supermarket in Greysteel joins Lynch’s portfolio of stores including Eurospars in the Skeoge area of Derry and Draperstown in Magherafelt, plus Spars in Dungiven, Claudy, Newbuildings and Trench Road in Co Derry, and Clonoe in Coalisland.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Maryrsquos GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Mary’s GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

Owner of Ferry Clever, Christopher Ferry, said he believed it was more important than ever to shop local this Christmas. “Everything was in lockdown and a lot of small local businesses really got affected by that. I think this is probably the most important year ever regarding supporting local because a lot of businesses really struggled to get back on their feet after being closed for so long. “I think that people realise that, and they are really going all out this year to support local. A small business like myself doesn’t take it for granted, I really appreciate it and I would just really push to support local this year especially. Big operators like Amazon can be handy but your small spend makes a giant dference.” Ben Allen, owner of local record store ‘Abbazappa,’ spoke of the benefits of choosing to shop local. “I know my customers. I know them by name, they know me. The thing about a record shop is when a customer is with you evenit’s only for a few minutes, you’re that person’s best friend and you can talk about music, recommend things, and talk about all sorts. That doesn’t happen online. Online is completely soulless.  Ben Allen, proprietor of Abbazappa.  “The greatest thing on earth is being able to look through the products in the likes of a record shop or book shop physically. It’s a pleasure to do that. You can pick it up and seethe products okay before buying it. You can’t do that online, it’s a bit of a lucky dip.” Sinn Feacutein Foyle MLA, Paacutedraig Delargy, also urged the people of Derry to support local businesses this year. “On the back of the voucher scheme, we’re encouraging everybody to spend their pound in local businesses as it’s been such a tough couple of months for them. Anything that can be done to make sure these businesses get back on their feet, we need to do it and make sure we can support our local high street shops.” The new Ferry Clever store can be found at - Bishops Street, and Abbazappa Records can be found at the Yellow Yard on Palace Street.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Maryrsquos GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Mary’s GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

Owner of Ferry Clever, Christopher Ferry, said he believed it was more important than ever to shop local this Christmas. “Everything was in lockdown and a lot of small local businesses really got affected by that. I think this is probably the most important year ever regarding supporting local because a lot of businesses really struggled to get back on their feet after being closed for so long. “I think that people realise that, and they are really going all out this year to support local.

Mr Durkan had long lobbied for the provision to be removed and worked alongside a number of charities to get Sinn Feacutein Communities Minister, Deirdre Hargey, to change the current provision. The Social SecurityBill was granted accelerated passage at its second stage in the Assembly on Tuesday. Foyle MLA Mr Durkan said: “I have long campaigned for this cruel and unnecessary measure to be changed. To ask people who have been given a terminal illness diagnosis to jump through hoops in order to access help and support is unconscionable. That we are not doing everything we can to make things easier for those suffering from illness in the final months of their lives is callous in the extreme. “Through my work with Marie Curie on this issue I was made aware of one family that received a letter declaring their brother was fit for work on the very day of his funeral. This should never have been allowed to happen and I hope this legislation will go some way to preventing that and get those suffering from terminal illness the quick and easy access to welfare they deserve – it’s the least we can do. “The extension of this provision to people with a year to live is welcome and will help many, but it doesn’t go far enough. I would urge Minister Hargey to take a leaf from the Scottish Government’s book and consider permitting clinicians to make the call on determining whether their patients are terminally ill without worrying about arbitrary time limits.  “People living with Motor Neurones Disease, Multiple Sclerosis and other le limiting illnesses won’t obtain a better prognosis. For them, a six-month extension wont make much of a dference and will just add to unnecessary stress at this awful time. We should be focused on support for people who have received this devastating diagnosis and their families, not judging peoples need to access help based on the time they have left.”  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Maryrsquos GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Mary’s GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

The discovery of a new iant may also present new challenges so I would urge the Minister to revisit her approach to COVID in schools. High Efficiency Particulate Air filters remove contaminants such as viruses from the air, reducing airborne transmission in classrooms with poor ventilation. “It is clear that HEPA filtration is one of a number of mitigations which could help make our classrooms safer. “The Minister has dithered and delayed on ventilation for too long. It is crunch time for our schools. I am calling on the Minister today, to act urgently to examine the provision of HEPA air filtration for all of our classrooms. “The Minister keeps telling us she wants to keep schools open. We agree, but she has to be willing to do what it takes and that means HEPA filters in all of our classrooms, not just some ofthem. Sinn Feacutein will continue to work to ensure the safety of our children and young people as well as our school staff.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Maryrsquos GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Mary’s GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

SDLP leader Colum Eastwood tweeted on Tuesday: “We knew there would be cases of the Omicron iant here sooner rather than later. “We all need to follow public health guidance including mask wearing. But the most important thing you can do to protect yourself and the health service is to get vaccinated and get your booster.”   We knew there would be cases of the Omicron iant here sooner rather than later. We all need to follow public health guidance including mask wearing. But the most important thing you can do to protect yourself and the health service is to get vaccinated and get your booster. — Colum EastwoodDecember ,    The Republic of Ireland has introduced new restrictions – including the shuttering of nightclubs and a maximum of % capacity at entertainment, cultural, community and sporting events – partly amid concern among health officials about the new Omicron iant.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Maryrsquos GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Mary’s GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

The prizes to his name include the Nobel Peace Prize , the Martin Luther King Jnr Non-Violent Awardand the International Gandhi Peace Prize . His we Pat led the announcement and following her recent passing it is the continued wish of the Hume family and Foundation that they be loaned to and displayed in the city. Chair of the Business and Culture Committee, Councillor Conor Heaney, welcomed the key stage in the process of having the items displayed in the city. I am pleased that we have been able to approve the funding for the display of the John Hume Peace Awards in the Guildhall so that the public can view these internationally signicant items, he said. John is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the recent political history of Ireland and was one of the architects of the Northern Ireland Peace Process. He is the only person in the world to have received all three of these awards and their prominent display will give just recognition to that achievement and add to our offering to visitors to our City and District. The paper was presented by Head of Culture at Council,AeidinMcCarter, who added:The Hume Family wish for as many people to see the collection on display as possible and it has been agreed that the Guildhall will be the most appropriate and fitting venue to display them in.

John Hume was widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the recent political history of Ireland and one of the architects of the Northern Ireland peace process. The prizes to his name include the Nobel Peace Prize , the Martin Luther King Jnr Non-Violent Awardand the International Gandhi Peace Prize . His we Pat led the announcement and following her recent passing it is the continued wish of the Hume family and Foundation that they be loaned to and displayed in the city. Chair of the Business and Culture Committee, Councillor Conor Heaney, welcomed the key stage in the process of having the items displayed in the city. I am pleased that we have been able to approve the funding for the display of the John Hume Peace Awards in the Guildhall so that the public can view these internationally signicant items, he said. John is widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the recent political history of Ireland and was one of the architects of the Northern Ireland Peace Process. He is the only person in the world to have received all three of these awards and their prominent display will give just recognition to that achievement and add to our offering to visitors to our City and District. The paper was presented by Head of Culture at Council,AeidinMcCarter, who added:The Hume Family wish for as many people to see the collection on display as possible and it has been agreed that the Guildhall will be the most appropriate and fitting venue to display them in. Theyare expected to go on display later next year.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Maryrsquos GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Mary’s GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

It also states the need for increasing the notication period for utility companies to implement price rises and introducing a cap on energy company profits. On publishing the report, Ms McLaughlin said:“Households across the North are struggling right now. Between the cut to Universal Credit, increasing national insurance contributions, the runaway cost of oil, gas and electricity, people are finding it really dficult to make ends meet. To date, our First Ministers have shown no political will or, it has to be said, interest in tackling it. “The SDLP is publishing this action plan, setting out our view on how hard-pressed households can be supported in the short and long term. This includes direct support by extending the Winter Fuel Payment to Universal Credit recipients who have already had their payments cut by the Tory Government and facilitated by Sinn Feacutein Ministers. We are also proposing a Warm Home Discount Scheme that would reduce energy costs by facilitating the installation of insulation while decarbonising our housing stock. “We are also seeking to reform the structural issues that have led to successive price rises at short notice to households. That should include extending the period that companies must give notice to consumers before a price rise takes effect. This will allow families time to prepare for signicant increases rather than being caught on the hop at times like Christmas when energy use is traditionally higher. “I don’t believe that the First Ministers understand the scale of this crisis. Nor do they seem to be engaged in the action needed to relieve pressure on people across the North.  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Maryrsquos GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Mary’s GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

Its clothing perfectly suited to the GAA fan looking for something slightly dferent, without club crests and sponsor logos.Fergal, along with his twin brother Fergal and friend Paul Hughes – Chairman of Derrytresk– is happy with how their brand has progressed. Originally, they had planned to launch for Christmas, but a change saw them get the ball rolling in April, in time for the twins th birthday celebrations.“It gave us something to focus on and one of the jumpers has  on the back, to signy the year we were born,” Fergal told the County Derry Post.There was always an interest in designing and a clothing brand was never far from his thoughts. During his playing days, hed never be far away when new kits were being deigned. A retro jersey released as part of Slaughtneils gear range had his fingerprints on it.“We are from a farming background, it is not the sort of thing youd associate us with...getting into fashion,” Fergal jokes.“But, its always something we have been interested in. I just think a lot of the GAA gear is based on playing members and wanted to do something dferent to appeal to our non-playing members as much as players.“A lot of it will carry club badges and sponsor logos, whereas not everybody wants to wear that kind of product to go to games.”Still playing for the clubs recreational team, he coaches the U footballers and hurlers. There is a pride in pulling into Emmet Park and seeing the Gael Foacutersa range, across dferent ages and colours. Interchangeable caps. Beanies. Shorts. Sweatshirts. T-Shirts. Half-zips. From black to white and green to mango, there is something for everyone. “I am not necessarily going to pull on my club gear, but I still want to pull on something that will associate you with the GAA,” he explains of their brands unique selling point.The name – Gael Foacutersa #WeAllBelong – was spun out of that inkling he had all those years ago.“I always had it in my head, thatI ever did start up a brand, that Gael Force would be the name I would go with,” Fergal explains.“We wanted to keep the Irish slant on it as well. It is very important to the club and community.”And so, Gael Foacutersa – True Gael – was born. After some scribbling with the lettering, the logo eventually came to le by accident. “The plan was to launch it on the lead up to Christmas”, Fergal adds. “Then we thought, the idea is there and well get something out there. Me and Francis, it was our th birthday in April, wed give ourselves a date to work to, to have the product launched.“We are very thankful for the support we have got from everybody. You now notice now the orders coming in, even from other counties, so it definitely seems to be going the right way.”Nestled deep within the brand is the importance of knowing that the game is much more than being part of the squad and taking to the field. It is about identity. A sense of belonging and inclusivity. Being part of a community of like-minded people with a mutual love for traditions and heritage.“So much of our young children and adult lives have become about the constant need to train, to diet, to play, to watch, to support, to belong but ultimately to win,” Gael Foacutersa outline in the story on their website.“Gael Foacutersa is about getting away from these pressures and the responsibilities of the game.We want to take it back to the basics. It’s about the enjoyment of it all and putting smiles on peoples faces.“The Gael Foacutersa range offers high-quality, comfortable and eye-catching men’s and ladies leisurewear. It aims to reinforce the customer’s sense of identity. To be more than just about the game. It’s about being part of something bigger.” googletag.cmd.push For the full range, check out their website: www.gaelforsa.ie  *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Maryrsquos GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Mary’s GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

She took to Facebook in a search for information about the school after noticing it as she travelled up and down the road. “I had been passing this school every day and was just fascinated by it. I wondered what it was called, when it was up and running, when it closed,” she told the County Derry Post. “Wee country schools like that had generations of families in them, and it was just something I became fixated on. “I wanted to know what it was called, andanyone had any memories or photographs of it. It was really to get a lot of people talking about it. “I wanted to stir up a bit of nostalgia among the community that was linked to the school, and was hoping that it would bring a lot of people back in touch with each other. “One lady hilariously came back and said there were some she could do without getting in touch with, and that made me laugh.”  Councillors raise County Derry road issues with DfI officials  Department officials were speaking at a recent full council meeting.   Despite that particular womans reluctance, Julie was able to gather a huge amount of information on the old school, which had been in use for almost  years. Opened in , the school had undergone two extensions in its -year stint, and at the time of its closure, Mr Noel Cunningham, who had links to the RAF, was the principal. A Mrs Carson taught at the school around the same time, while there were two dinner ladies named Bertha Clarke and Greta McKinney. Julie said she had been contacted by  past pupils of the school during her search for its history. “I ordinarily wouldnt have been out this road, but now being on it every day, I see it, so I thought Id put it out and seewe got anything back,” she said. “People were putting up messages, tagging people and asking Is this the school you were at  and I wondered how long it has been since those people were in touch with each other. “I thought it was a really lovely site a quaint country school, and there arent many of them around. I know its up for sale so I thought Id like to know the history before anything happens to it.” The derelict site at Killure PS. Despite the relatively recent closure of the school, photographs have proved dficult to come by for Julie, with just one unearthed so far. She is appealing for anyone with information or photographs to get in touch with her via the Derry Post to pass on what they know. “If anybody had photographs it would be a lovely thing for me to be able to share with everybody,” she said. “It was just to see what I could get back about it for them. I dont know these people I dont know any of them, but theyve all been so lovely in coming back to me. “Surely to goodness, after all thatof time, the papers would have covered a school like that closing ” If you have any information or photographs relating to Killure School, Drumcoon Road, Aghadowey, get in touch with us via editor@derrypostor give us a call on .

Reporter: Staff Reporter Dec Email: editor@derrypost  addthis, A County Derry group within the Ulster Farmers Unionhave welcomed the further roll out of a local broadband provider into Mid Ulster. googletag.cmd.push Fibrus is currently developing full-fibre infrastructure in rural parts of Northern Ireland, and as part of the process, has struck up a partnership with the UFU. The company became affinity partners of the UFU, meaning their members are able to avail of special rates for its broadband services. James Graham, Group Manager of the South Derry Londonderry UFU said full-fibre broadband would have a major impact on how farmers in the area live and work. “Having access to effective and efficient connectivity services is now essential to those working in our industry,” he said. “This new network will help boost our mission at UFU to support a vibrant and sustainable farming economy. “Modern farming practices and administrative processes have become increasingly digitalised, so connectivity has quickly become a crucial utility on our farms. “We have secured an excellent deal with Fibrus which is available to all our members, so we hope many of them take up this beneficial opportunity - as I have already.”  INTERVIEW: Cllr McPeake: Broadband is a priority  The Mid Ulster councillor says Project Stratum needs to be carefully managed.  Liam Tunney speaks to local Sinn Feacutein councillor Sean McPeake about council pragmatism, his role models and helping St Brigids Mayogall go viral last year.   The live network was launched last week in Magherafelt, and Fibrus Brand and Marketing Manager Joe Diver said rural regions had been living in the digital darkness. “That’s why we are committed to connecting communities and equipping families and rural businesses - whether SMEs or farming businesses - with the tools to thrive in modern times,” he said. “We are already making our way across Northern Ireland, transforming connectivity in these areas and addressing the digital imbalance that exists between urban and rural. “Working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union has helped us to identy ways to support local farms and agri-businesses specically, which we know make up a major portion of rural economies. “We’re delighted to now be live in Mid Ulster and look forward to seeing those who need it most, reap the benefits of our hyperfast broadband services.” For more information on the work of Fibrus and the Ulster Farmers’ Union partnership, visit www.fibrus ufu.

One of his most memorable stories features in a book penned by Dennis Taylor when the Magherafelt man toppled the mighty Alex ‘Hurricane’ Higgins.” Tommys legacy stretches long beyond his playing days, and he was instrumental to ensuring the survival and development of the game within the Mid Ulster area. “When his best playing days were perhaps behind him he didn’t turn his back on the game,” said the club. “He organised the Mid Ulster Snooker League for + years, which is an unbelievable commitment and no doubt it was this dedication that kept the game alive in the area. “When he handed over the reins in the late noughties, the game was still in a healthy state and we are all indebted in a way to Tommy that the Mid Ulster league is still being played to this day.” As a symbol of their gratitude, the Mid Ulster League named a trophy after Tommy, and the club said seeing him presenting his own trophy was an emotional moment. “A few years back many of the players felt that it would be a fitting tribute to name one of the Mid Ulster league competitions after Tommy. “We consider ourselves fortunate that Tommy was able to attend to present his own trophy. “As a club we have our own piece of history on the wall in the club, Tommy produced a great article detailing the history of our own club from its founding in  and is well worth a read for any local. “It was also fitting that when the club was rebuilt in  that he played Joe Swail on the opening night. A fitting tribute for a great snooker man.”  Derry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,   Obituaries    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Maryrsquos GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Mary’s GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

One of his most memorable stories features in a book penned by Dennis Taylor when the Magherafelt man toppled the mighty Alex ‘Hurricane’ Higgins.” Tommys legacy stretches long beyond his playing days, and he was instrumental to ensuring the survival and development of the game within the Mid Ulster area. “When his best playing days were perhaps behind him he didn’t turn his back on the game,” said the club. “He organised the Mid Ulster Snooker League for + years, which is an unbelievable commitment and no doubt it was this dedication that kept the game alive in the area. “When he handed over the reins in the late noughties, the game was still in a healthy state and we are all indebted in a way to Tommy that the Mid Ulster league is still being played to this day.” As a symbol of their gratitude, the Mid Ulster League named a trophy after Tommy, and the club said seeing him presenting his own trophy was an emotional moment. “A few years back many of the players felt that it would be a fitting tribute to name one of the Mid Ulster league competitions after Tommy. “We consider ourselves fortunate that Tommy was able to attend to present his own trophy. “As a club we have our own piece of history on the wall in the club, Tommy produced a great article detailing the history of our own club from its founding in  and is well worth a read for any local. “It was also fitting that when the club was rebuilt in  that he played Joe Swail on the opening night. A fitting tribute for a great snooker man.”  Derry Death Notices - Tuesday, th November,   Obituaries    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Maryrsquos GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Mary’s GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

Hyundai’s newest offering is an appealing small SUV, which slots into position between the new i and new Kona in terms of its exterior dimensions.  googletag.cmd.push   Hyundai claim that the Bayon is a ‘small on the outside, big on the inside’ urban crossover SUV that is designed to make a lasting impression. Boasting best-in-class safety and connectivity features, the Bayon comes with lots of smart technology as standard.Eye-Catching ProportionsWith its sharp lines and eye-catching proportions, the new Bayon really stands out from the crowd. Sleek and stylish, it elegantly combines Hyundai’s award-winning SUV heritage with a visually stunning interpretation of Hyundai’s new Sensuous Sportiness design language — defined by the harmony between proportion, architecture, styling and technology.    The arrow-shaped headlamps and wide grille harmonise with the sleek air intake band and narrow LED daytime running-lights on top, to give the front a purposeful, unique look. A dynamic shoulder line provides visual drama to the Bayon’s sporty wedge-shaped profile while, at the rear, arrow-shaped LED rear lights are connected by a red accent line. Positioned far out to the sides, the rear lights enhance the visual impression of width.The new Bayon is shorter, narrower and lower than its Kona sibling, but stands a fraction taller than the i supermini upon which it is based. While the Kona is offered with an all-electric version, the new Bayon is powered solely by a .-litre MPIfour-cylinder petrol engine across all iants.The ingenious MPI system injects fuel at each cylinder, allowing much greater control over how much fuel the engine burns, leading to impressive fuel efficiency.Well-Appointed Trim LevelsThe new Bayon is available in a choice of three trim levels, namely Comfort Plus, Executive and Executive with a two-tone roof. Standard features from entry level include a rear spoiler, roof rails, sports-style driver and passenger front seats, driver seat height adjuster, height and reach adjustable leather-wrapped steering wheel, air-conditioning, auto light control , temporary spare wheel, cargo net, multi- steering wheel controls, central door locking, Bluetooth, DAB radio, cruise control, and a tyre pressure monitoring system, along with a host of safety features for peace-of-mind motoring.Upgrade to the Executive trimand additional standard features include ” alloy wheels, chrome belt line finisher, body coloured bumpers, shark-fin ariel, aluminium foot pedals, heated front seats, heated steering wheel, automatic air-conditioning, automatic window defogging , power-folding electric mirrors, rear privacy glass, auto wipers, remote central locking, voice recognition, Android Auto  Apple CarPlay, ” audio display, .” LCD supervision cluster, USB charger, wireless phone charger, rear parking sensors, and a rear view camera with dynamic guidelines, along with additional safety tech.Test CarMy test car was a new Bayon Executive .litre MPI, which was finished in elegant Aurora Gray Pearl paintwork that compliments its strong SUV design.Producing PSand Nm of torque, the Bayon can reach km h in .-seconds, while ing up to .mpgon a WLTP combined driving cycle.A low Co emission figure of g km translates to annual road tax of just €.On the road is where the new Bayon really excels, with a terric mix of comfort, control, poise and precision on offer. Road imperfections are dealt with swtly, while noises and knocks from the suspension are well isolated from the cabin.For a relatively small car, the Bayon’s motorway refinement and stability are impressive, while the car corners keenly on twisty roads. A precise steering response ensures that the Bayon is a delight to drive around town, while the standard rear parking sensors and rear view camera in my test car made parking a doddle too.The family-friendly cabin space in the new Bayon is impressive, with rear legroom deserving particular praise.Interior storage comprises a of a deep glovebox, front and rear door bins that can accommodate a large bottle, and a flat shelf for a smartphone at the bottom of the well-constructed dashboard.Boot capacity of -litres can be transformed into a ,-litre space when the rear seat backs are folded down, while an intelligent trunk cover can be stowed away safely within the boot when not in use.The new Hyundai Bayon is available in a multitude of stylish exterior colours, along with the option of a two-tone roof and matching door mirror housings in Phantom Black to create a car perfectly matched to inidual taste. The new Bayon truly is ready to reach new heights in the competitive small crossover SUV market segment.Hyundai’s comprehensive -year unlimited mileage warranty comes as standard, as does a -year AA Roadside Assistance and Free Vehicle Health Check package.   *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Maryrsquos GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Mary’s GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

At a media briefing, he stated there were inherent internal contradictions in the bans and said, Weve seen these before where you ban flights except for your own citizens. Is it that some passport holders will have the virus and some wont  Does the virus read your passport  Does the virus know your nationality or where youre legally resident  Our concern here is that we apply public health principles, not political principles to selecting measures that are used to control the spread of disease. He made the comments in the wake of tightening border restrictions across dozens of countries in response to the Omicron iant. WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, also called on countries to take rational and proportional risk-reduction measures. He said, Blanket travel bans will not prevent the international spread of Omicron and they place a heavy burden on lives and livelihoods. Dr Ryan suggested other ways to manage risk: There are ways that you can de-risk travel in terms of having increased testing, more testing before departure, more testing on arrival, quarantine until negative testing. There is a whole series of things that can be done that will manage the risk of importation of disease or even exporting disease to another country which fall short of blanket bans. The idea that you can put a hermetic seal on most countries is just frankly not possible. We all know that, weve seen that happen before. And certainly there has to be consistency.

They also provide underage hurling via St Patricks, an amalgamation with their parish neighbours St Colms Drum.When Derry won the All-Ireland title in , the countys most successful era, Richard Ferris was part of the winning formula and scored a goal in their opening round against Down that season. Joe Irwin won an Ulster medal with the county and Eunan Rafferty was also on Derry teams in that era.The clubs recent underage development work has provided Michael Mullan to Derrys Ulster minor winning team of , with Tiarnaacuten McHugh, Dara and Ruairi Rafferty part of the group who repeated the feat two seasons later on their way to the All-Ireland Final.Current senior captain Tiarnaacuten Woods has represented Derry at minor and U level, with McHugh and Ruairi Rafferty – who have played senior hurling with Kevin Lynchs – having also played the wee ball game for the county.On the camogie field, Una Rafferty and Aoe Kelly have represented Derry at minor and U level respectively. It has all comeas a result of the work being done at the club.“It is great to have Richard Ferris back involved again,” Shane adds. “He has set up a winter programme in place for the players in first to fth year , with the older players getting looked after under the senior  with their strength and conditioning.”The current senior group has benefited from the influx of youth as they have one eye on the Derry IFC Quarter-Finals later this month.McGonigle paid tribute to those who have sat on club committees down through the years and it has been bolstered with new blood coming on board in recent years to help with the clubs progression. Another great development has been an influx in new coaches coming forward at primary school level. Every bit helps. Like many other clubs across Ireland, Drumsurn reaches deeper into the locality. They are more than just GAA. Its a social hub that knits everyone together, regardless of age. It offers an identity.On top of their day to day club activities and s. Fitness classes, male and female, are a valuable facet of the club, while they also host Irish dancing and bowls.The club has also recently formed a mental health committee and have put in place a full winter program to complement this initiative. There are also plans for Irish language classes. There is never a dull moment. The clubs heart beats strong.“We as a club are very community focused,” Shane stresses. “In the past year we have brought the Action Cancer big bus for two days and also provided a defibrillator in a cabinet for our communitys use.”Since moving to their current premises, Billy Doran Park, in , they have added a training pitch and a club gym.The Club Committee set out a three-phase ground development plan in . The first phase of a new kitchen plus internal and external toilet blocks was completed in  with the changing rooms refurbished in .Phase , currently going through planning, includes a walking track, new floodlights and ball-wall. It all leads into Phase , a floodlit G pitch.“Our proposed ground developments are going to cost in excess of pound,,” McGonigle points out. “For a club of less than  members, this is a massive undertaking.”Drumsurn have set themselves a target of having phases two and three complete for their Centenary Year in .“Unfortunately, as with many other aspects of le, Covid has put a stop to conventional fundraising activities for the moment,” Shane outlines. “So we decided to set up Drumsurn GAC Competitions as a way of raising some much needed funds.” For more information and details on how to enter Drumsurns competition, visit www.drumsurngaccompetitions    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Maryrsquos GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Mary’s GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

They are true ambassadors of sport for their areas and for the Mid Ulster district.”  REACTION: Jack Cassidy win can be a springboard for senior success  Dungiven U manager James McNicholl reacts to their final win over Loup.    *Note: bannersOnText not working for Storytelling articles so append it to paragraph.* ..detachTo  ..detachTo\" ..detachTo\" ..detachTo Move Next button to be under first slideshow image..detachTopimg:nth-of-type\".parent Make slideshow image click to next page.pimg:nth-of-type\".on  --window.onscroll  sticky_share  document.getElementById sticky_share_top  sticky_share.offsetTop +  stickyShare .width  sticky_share_top .To  .To   sticky_share_top  -- To continue reading this article for FREE,please kindly register and or log in.Registration is absolutely % FREE and will help us personalise your experience on our sites.You can also sign up to our carefully curated newsletter to keep up to date with your latest local news!Register   Login DateDf  t  d.getTime parseInt ,inWeeks: t  d.getTime parseInt ,inMonths: dY  d.getFullYear dM  d.getMonth dM  d.getMonth -,inYears:-d.getFullYear CheckArchive article NOTE: meta tag for keywords in mobile is in body not head. docDateString  document.querySelector.getAttribute.substring docDate  new Date today  new Date isLoggedIn  . isArticleBlocked   docKeywords  document.querySelector.getAttribute paywall_days  .html daysOld  DateDf.inDayspaywall_days  console.logconsole.logconsole.log  paywall_days isArticleBlocked  true isArticleBlocked  .console.log.remove.toggleClass.slideToggle.hasClass For mobile Adds Thumbnails for Voting Responses . addThumbnails console.loganchorElement[index]  this.getogImage  .filterstartPos  data.indexOfstartPos  startPos + tagStartContent.contentLength  data.substring.indexOfogImage  data.substringconsole.log console.logconsole.logconsole.logconsole.log.parent.parent + \"addThumbnails . --ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"ADVERTISEMENT -- Id  \"default_mpu__banner\" alwaysRefreshImage  true image   link  switchtoday  new Date dd  String.padStart mm  String + .padStart yyyy  today.getFullYear hh  String.padStart min  String.padStart ss  String.padStart suffix  yyyy + mm + dd + _ + hh + min + ss  Set Imageconsole.log Set Linkconsole.log --googletag.cmd.push Advertise with Us After ad loads, allow it to receive clicks.  allow it to receive clicks.\".console.log allow it to receive clicks .\"Most Popular Jack and his sister Rebecca are set to star alongside each other on the ITV soapDerry NewsProud Derry mum as son and daughter land roles in Coronation Street overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  \" title\"Throwback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Maryrsquos GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner \" data-original\"https:www.derrynow resizer   true .JPG--.JPG \"width\"\" \"\"MultimediaThrowback Tuesday: Out and About @ St. Mary’s GAC Greenlough Anniversary Dinner  overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Browns Bonds Hill Chef patron, Ian Orr, accepting the prestigious invitationDerry NewsDerry restaurant becomes Northern Ireland’s only standalone‘Ireland’s Blue Book’ listing overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  MultimediaMemory Lane: Take a step back in time with the Derry News  archives overridePositionlocation.hrefcurrentLocation+-  :+overrideFirst+position+-+articleId  Pictured at the opening of Lynchrsquos new Greysteel Eurospar were Alastair Conner,Joanne Kerlin, owner Conor Lynch, Stephanie McElwee, Virginia Moore and Paul Deans, from Henderson Group.

Pic by Mary K Burke.Reporter: Liam Tunney Dec Email: liam@derrypost  addthis, Derrys Competitions Control Committeehas vowed to clamp down on the number of clubs moving fixtures for the  season. googletag.cmd.push In their report to the Derry GAA AGM, the CCC said that of  games played during the  season,  games had been moved away from their original date. The figure excludes changes made before the beginning of the season to accommodate club requests, and the CCCs report said clubs need to stick to the deadline for making changes. “A weekly fixtures list is sent to clubs and any changes for the incoming week should be notied by the given deadline,” they said. “There is a tendency for club managers to agree last minute changes among themselves, sometimes not even informing their club secretary. “The original referee is not always available for the changed date time and this is a headache for our Referee Administrator. “In  as per CCC policy there will be NO game changes accepted after Sunday night for the week ahead unless in exceptional circumstances.” Dungiven picked up the U Jack Cassidy Cup in , but the CCC have raised concerns about the age grade. Pic by Mary K Burke. Elsewhere in the report, the Committee stressed the need to take another look at the bridging competition between underage and senior, saying the U grade did not work well. They also urged clubs to be honest in choosing their grade, and said there were reports of players prevented from attending to ensure lower-sided games. “We ask clubs to ensure that they work with managers and team personnel when choosing the grade they enter for  , and that they aim to play  a side including all eligible players,” the report said. “There were worrying reports that some players were being told they were not needed on a given night to ensure a  a side game. “This should NOT be happening and especially not in the current climate when sporting activity is more important than ever.” Discipline has continued to be an issue, with figures provided by the CCC revealing one club had had  incidents dealt with during . The report indicated the CCC would deal with issues in the strictest manner possible. Our games are contact sports and accidental injury will inevitably happen, but a deliberate attack on an opponent or official, causing serious injury is inexcusable, and the fear is that one of these days something will go badly wrong, with terrible consequences for all involved, said the report. We need to hammer home to our players the danger of the one punch attack and instil in them a healthy respect for their opponents and officials. The disregard for the authority of referees, and the abuse directed at them, especially from young players gives rise for concern. These remain UNACCEPTABE and we will continue to deal with them in the strictest manner possible. We will implement whatever measures we need to protect players and officials and work to ensure our games are safer and more enjoyable for all. In his secretarys report to the AGM, Peter Keane said Derry was in a good place both on and off the field of play. He said the county was close to appointing their full time Head of Operations. “The County Executive will announce the appointment of a fulltime Head of Operations in the coming days,” said the report. “When we look at what has happened over the past couple of years which can be put down to a dedicated and hardworking Committee of volunteers backed up by determined sub-committees then this appointment can only lead to further development both on and off the pitch. “The appointee will have leadership skills, financial expertise, strategic planning skills, marketing skills -all attributes that will help Derry to achieve their objectives in the next few years.” The report also said Derry were in a fairly good financial position, pointing to the recent acquisition of a new sponsor and a number of appointments yet to come.  More recognition for All-Ireland winning Derry minors  A civic honours reception has been held in their honour.   “We have reaped the rewards of an excellent championship campaign which generated increased revenue compared with last year,” said the report. “Over the past few days we are glad to welcome the Errigal Group as the counties main sponsor for football and hurling for the next five years. “The Counties Marketing consultants Teneo are presently seeking further sponsors for Development squads and Naming Rights sponsorship for both stadia - announcements will be made soon.” Sean Keanes report ended with a rallying call for the coming year. “I look forward to working together with you all again next year as we play a vital role in putting Derry back on the map again,” he added.

Pic by Mary K Burke.Reporter: Liam Tunney Dec Email: liam@derrypost  addthis, Derrys Competitions Control Committeehas vowed to clamp down on the number of clubs moving fixtures for the  season. googletag.cmd.push In their report to the Derry GAA AGM, the CCC said that of  games played during the  season,  games had been moved away from their original date. The figure excludes changes made before the beginning of the season to accommodate club requests, and the CCCs report said clubs need to stick to the deadline for making changes. “A weekly fixtures list is sent to clubs and any changes for the incoming week should be notied by the given deadline,” they said. “There is a tendency for club managers to agree last minute changes among themselves, sometimes not even informing their club secretary. “The original referee is not always available for the changed date time and this is a headache for our Referee Administrator. “In  as per CCC policy there will be NO game changes accepted after Sunday night for the week ahead unless in exceptional circumstances.” Dungiven picked up the U Jack Cassidy Cup in , but the CCC have raised concerns about the age grade. Pic by Mary K Burke. Elsewhere in the report, the Committee stressed the need to take another look at the bridging competition between underage and senior, saying the U grade did not work well. They also urged clubs to be honest in choosing their grade, and said there were reports of players prevented from attending to ensure lower-sided games. “We ask clubs to ensure that they work with managers and team personnel when choosing the grade they enter for  , and that they aim to play  a side including all eligible players,” the report said. “There were worrying reports that some players were being told they were not needed on a given night to ensure a  a side game. “This should NOT be happening and especially not in the current climate when sporting activity is more important than ever.” Discipline has continued to be an issue, with figures provided by the CCC revealing one club had had  incidents dealt with during . The report indicated the CCC would deal with issues in the strictest manner possible. Our games are contact sports and accidental injury will inevitably happen, but a deliberate attack on an opponent or official, causing serious injury is inexcusable, and the fear is that one of these days something will go badly wrong, with terrible consequences for all involved, said the report. We need to hammer home to our players the danger of the one punch attack and instil in them a healthy respect for their opponents and officials. The disregard for the authority of referees, and the abuse directed at them, especially from young players gives rise for concern. These remain UNACCEPTABE and we will continue to deal with them in the strictest manner possible. We will implement whatever measures we need to protect players and officials and work to ensure our games are safer and more enjoyable for all. In his secretarys report to the AGM, Peter Keane said Derry was in a good place both on and off the field of play. He said the county was close to appointing their full time Head of Operations. “The County Executive will announce the appointment of a fulltime Head of Operations in the coming days,” said the report. “When we look at what has happened over the past couple of years which can be put down to a dedicated and hardworking Committee of volunteers backed up by determined sub-committees then this appointment can only lead to further development both on and off the pitch. “The appointee will have leadership skills, financial expertise, strategic planning skills, marketing skills -all attributes that will help Derry to achieve their objectives in the next few years.” The report also said Derry were in a fairly good financial position, pointing to the recent acquisition of a new sponsor and a number of appointments yet to come.  More recognition for All-Ireland winning Derry minors  A civic honours reception has been held in their honour.   “We have reaped the rewards of an excellent championship campaign which generated increased revenue compared with last year,” said the report. “Over the past few days we are glad to welcome the Errigal Group as the counties main sponsor for football and hurling for the next five years. “The Counties Marketing consultants Teneo are presently seeking further sponsors for Development squads and Naming Rights sponsorship for both stadia - announcements will be made soon.” Sean Keanes report ended with a rallying call for the coming year. “I look forward to working together with you all again next year as we play a vital role in putting Derry back on the map again,” he added.

Those behind the initiative have a long-term focus on addressing the pressing need for the transformation of our high streets.ldquoThe welcome initiative provides an important opportunity for everyone to have their say and influence the vision that will be required to breathe new le into high streets across the Newry, Mourne and Down area which will be crucial in a post-Covid world.Cllr Curran added: ldquoSadly, many of our businesses have borne the brunt of the pandemic and anything that can be done to help them and increase footfall in our town and villages is particularly welcome.

The resulting spot kick was coolly dispatched again by Robinson.At the beginning of the second half Omagh pulled level again and the sidelines were a hive of activity, with changes being rung by both sides.Left-back Jack Kelly delivered a deep cross into the Omagh box and the hardworking Tom Crudington recycled it out to Calam Mulqueen, who made no mistake when called upon to put Down High - ahead with the clock running low.But once again Down High became complacent as Omagh turned the screw and won countless corners. The pressure took its toll and a thoroughly deserved equaliser left the tie at - with the visitors left wondering what had gone wrong.At this stage, goalkeeper Alex Truesdale was busy keeping his side in the game and made one miraculous point blank save, resembling Jerzy Dudekrsquos heroics for Liverpool in the  Champions League final.Extra-time loomed large and with the floodlights now on both sides knew that one mistake or a well-placed pass could be decisive.After a cautious start to extra-time, Caolan Lennon stepped up to take a free-kick and scored a simply stunning goal into the top corner of the Omagh goal mdasha tremendous -yard thunder strike that encapsulated his class throughout the game.Omagh Academy pushed to get back into the game and were caught on the counter when that man Robinson pounced and rounded the rsquokeeper to score and put somne breathing space between the sides.Robinsonrsquos goalscoring exploits won him the man-of-the-match award, with Mulqueenrsquos midfield battling also worthy of high commendation.Lennon was a constant thorn in Omaghrsquos side while mazy runs from Josh Ward caught the eye, with Josh McMullan working hard too. Jamie Ferguson and Matthew Nelson also battled hard..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"Dunleath parkrun plans edging closer  ","story":"DETAILS of Downpatrickrsquos first ever parkrun event are being finalised, it has emerged.Dunleath Park is being lined up to host the event and while no date has been confirmed, it is hoped that it will take place next year after Newry, Mourne and Down Council agreed to provide financial support to organisers.The exact level of local authority support is currently being finalised and it is hoped that once the date of the K event and the venue have been formally confirmed that the parkrun will become an annual event for runners of all abilities.Hugely popular across the globe, the proposed Downpatrick parkrun also has the potential to provide the local economy with a boost.Downpatrick Town Committee is behind the ambitious plan for the new parkrun which it believes will bring the local community closer together and may encourage people who have never run before to get out and enjoy themselves in an event where there is no time limit and no one finishes last.Last month, the Town Committee issued an online appeal for ldquoenthusiastic and committed volunteers to come forward to help get the parkrun up and running and itrsquos hoped that the parkrun could become a weekly event and attract people from across the district to enhance their health and enjoy the great outdoors.Downpatrick area councillor Gareth Sharvin has welcomed the progress on establishing a parkrun event at Dunleath Park.He said parkruns have become popular with runners and walkers alike across the country and keen participants in the Downpatrick area have been planning the establishment of a similar event in the county town.Cllr Sharvin confirmed that he recently requested an update from Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos Active and Healthy Communities department on the progress of establishing the parkrunand providing financial support to the group setting up the event.ldquoI am happy to report that the financial contribution and approach has been agreed between all stakeholders and officers are working with the parkrun organisers to finalise the details, he said.ldquoWith this great news, it should not be long until we have our first parkrun event in Downpatrick, utilising the new trail around Dunleath.Cllr Sharvin added: ldquoA parkrun will also bring people from outside the area into Downpatrick spending locally in our shops and cafes, adding to our great array of social and leisure activities on offer.News that Dunleath Park could host the parkrun comes after recent confirmation that major investment is planned for this part of the town.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is planning to create a series of new facilities, including a dedicated running track, while also in the pipeline are a cycling pump track, skateboarding track, improved planting and a new play park.In addition, soccer and GAA pitches are in line for an upgrade as part of the plan to transform Dunleath Park into a sporting and recreational hub.Itrsquos understood that the area earmarked for the proposed pump track, skateboard track and play park sit outside the parkrsquos floodplain and will enable the local authority to move faster in putting a business case together and progress towards securing capital funding.The need for new G or G pitches mdash which can be used all year round mdash at Dunleath Park also been highlighted with council officials asked to investigate the potential for this particular investment to happen..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/29November2021-ADMakeItLocal.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C  December 5%2C 2001

unveiled a number of buildings at High Street which have been transformed in the project which was funded by the local group and the International Fund for Ireland.Killyleagh Development Association chairman Professor Bob Elwood officially received the keys for the buildings from developer Maurice Crawford during a ceremony on Friday afternoon.Professor Elwood confirmed that both apartments in the scheme had already been let, while a cottage at the top of the street had been sold.Four shop units are also available and Professor Elwood said the association was in negotiations with business people about potential projects.ldquoIt was essential that this area was refurbished and renewed in an effort to bring new businesses and new people to the town, he said.ldquoAlthough these buildings are new, they have been designed to blend in with the rest of the street which is Georgian in style.Former Killyleagh councillor Sam Osborne said he was proud to have been invited to open the new facility.ldquoOut of all the people that could have been asked to this, I find it was great honour that the community has given me the opportunity to perform this , he said.ldquoYou only have to go back to the beginning of the year to know that this area was an eyesore and to see it now I can hardly believe the transformation that has taken place.DOWNPATRICK ndash One of Downpatrickrsquos oldest bars is in line for a major improvement scheme which could top the pound, mark.Rearsquos Hotel in Lower Market Street has been bought by two local businessmen who plan to turn the property into one of the districtrsquos top entertainment attractions.The plans, which include a major refurbishment programme, will transform the current building which in its heyday was at the centre of attraction in the town centre.Brothers Mark and Bartley Murphy are confident the major investment will result in premises on a par with the very best Belfast has to offer and say the venture will be successful.Once the refurbishment programme has been completed, Rearsquos will serve food all day and there will also be aroom which will be hired for private parties and other similar s.ldquoThe aim is to provide a facility which willbe high class and top-of-the-range and the level of investment reflects this, said Mr MarkMurphy.ldquoThe premises have been bought and work to transform them could start early in the New Year.BALLYNAHINCH ndash Ballynahinch Lions Club have recruited the help of high school students in the town to launch their annual Christmas food appeal on behalf of the needy.Pupils from Ballynahinch High and St Colmanrsquos were on hand recently to back Lions Club president Eddie Russellrsquos appeal for pub lic support for this important service to the community.This weekend, members of the Lions Club and their supporters will be on duty at shops and supermarkets in the area asking local people to contribute to the appeal.Mr Russell said the Lions Club is inviting shoppers to purchase one or more items of non-perishable food and place it in the trolley or basket provided.ldquoAt the end of the collection, the Lions will sort out the food into hampers for the needy and these will be distributed in time for the festive season, he said.ldquoThe Lions believe that at this time of year, many people in the community are anxious to support those who are perhaps not quite as well off as themselves and this project is an ideal way of doing so.SPA ndash A Spa musician is preparing to launch her first CD. Isabel Keenan will publicly unveil lsquoGo in Peacersquo, a compilation of sacred music, at a special event in the Arnold Hall, Spa, on Friday, December , at pm.The guest artists at the special concert will be Crawford Bell and Ivan Black.

From the resulting kick-out Carew won possession before sending over a mammoth effort to put the Johnnies back in the ascendancy.With both teams displaying huge work rate, the challenge for the Johnnies was to play through the Fontenoy press and find space.Ryan Morganrsquos pace, and incisive angled runs were a crucial factor in carving a way through a Fontenoy backline that was being well marshalled by Queens Universityrsquos Niall McElroy.Cope and Madine combined to create an exceptional team score in the th minute, but the Fontenoy response was swt and the energetic Eoin OrsquoHare burst through to raise the green flag in the next phase of play.Caolan Burns and Eoin McCrickard kept the scoreboard ticking over with well taken frees for their sides.A key battle within the game was that of Johnnies centre half Oran OrsquoConnor against Michael McMullan. OrsquoConnor was readily available each time the full back line of Aaron Murphy, Adam Walsh and team captain Rory McMullan gained possession.McMullanrsquos brave block from a Shea Moorehead effort in the th minute typied the spirit within this young Johnnies team, his cousin Conor McMullan claimed the resultant rebound and found Cope who won a late free on the far sideline.From fully  yards out, Ryan Morgan launched a majestic effort that found its way to the Fontenoy net to leave just one score between the teams.

Together we can put a stop to illegal puppy farming. Buying a puppy from illegal breeders can have devastating results, she continued.ldquoOften puppies die a short time after purchase or end up with infectious diseases such as parvovirus which is expensive to treat and, often fatal. They can also suffer behavioural issues relating to fear and anxiety due to poor or no socialisation.Chief Inspector Ford said it can be tempting to buy a puppy in these circumstances and often purchasers will recognise that things are not quite right, asking people to remember that by lsquorescuingrsquo a puppy in these circumstances, they are fuelling and supporting what is a particularly lucrative criminal industry.She added: ldquoWe would encourage anyone who is aware of illegal dog breeding establishments to contact their local council and we would like to take this opportunity to thank those that have done so to date already.Council chairwoman Cathy Mason said the local authority was committed to working with its partners to address this issue.ldquoWe investigate all reports made to us, she said. ldquoRecently, animal welfare officers seized seven dogs from a property following reports the animals were kept in poor living conditions and a further  dogs were seized at an illegal puppy farm with associated poor environmental conditions.Cllr Mason said the local authority is currently investigating a case of failing to ensure the welfare needs of dogs and causing unnecessary suffering.She continued: ldquoThis is a particularly timely message at this time of year when many will be thinking of purchasing a puppy for Christmas.ldquoCouncils are the lead agency when it comes to animal welfare issues and we routinely work with other agencies such as police and Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs to help us tackle this serious issue.Cllr Mason also asked people across the district for their help.She added: ldquoIf anyone sees or is are aware of anything untoward, please report it to your localcouncil dog warden immediately so we can take appropriate action and seek assistance from relevant partners..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13278334.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Clockwise from top left, David Lloyd George Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, , Winston Churchill, Robert Barton, Michael Collins, Arthur GrfithLock it up carefully”, David Lloyd George said to his mistress and secretary, Frances Stevenson, in her room at  Downing Street, as he handed her the British copy of the historic Anglo-Irish Treaty just before  am on  December .Under its terms the Union of Great Britain and Ireland, as created by Pitt the Younger  years earlier, came to an end. Only the six counties of the newly formed Northern Ireland were to be permitted to remain within the United Kingdom. Their devolved Parliament, which had been opened by King George V the previous June , was given the power to vote them out of the all-Ireland settlement, based on dominion status, which the Treaty embodied.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.The document that was locked away in Downing Street bore the signatures of four members of the British delegation who had negotiated it. They formed a column headed by Lloyd George himself the others, drawn from his Liberal  Unionist coalition cabinet, were Austen Chamberlain, F.E.Smith, Lord Birkenhead , and Winston Churchill.Another column listed the signatures of three of their Irish counterparts, headed by Arthur Grfith, the founder of Sinn Fein in , and followed by the charismatic Michael Collins, the chief organiser of the IRA’s terrorist campaign against Britain, waged from  until July  when a truce was agreed between the two sides. The third Irish signatory, Robert Barton, a Unionist landowner turned Republican and an intimate friend of Collins, was the Sinn Fein delegation’s economic adviser. Never before had British and Irish representatives put their names to a formal agreement of this kind as complete equals. After the signing, which took place at . am, the two sides shook hands for the first time. Trust had replaced the deep suspicion with which they had first regarded each other. Irish leaders, who a few months earlier had been denounced as rebels and murderers, had come to enjoy the respect of the British delegation. Michael Collins had undergone an astonishing transformation from terrorist leader to statesman, gaining the admiration of two prominent members of the British team, Churchill and Birkenhead.Final agreement on the terms of the treaty had been reached in two intense negotiating sessions in the Cabinet Room at No , which ended two months of wrangling. The first session, which lasted over five hours, began at pm on December . Lloyd George employed all his formidable political skills to secure a breakthrough in all but one of the key areas that had hitherto defied resolution.The Irish gained the full fiscal and financial autonomy they craved. The British got what they wanted on defence: the use “in time of war or of strained relations with a foreign power [of] such harbour and other facilities as the British government may require”, combined with the permanent retention of what came to be known as the Treaty Ports , major strategic assets which Neville Chamberlainwas to abandon in a further Anglo-Irish Treaty in  to Churchill’s fury. Since the start of negotiations in October, the words of an oath of allegiance which Irish elected representatives would in future be required to swear had been through endless drafts. It was at last settled with a suitably convoluted rigmarole to spare the Irish republican conscience as much strain as possible: “I will be faithful to His Majesty King George V, his Heirs and Successors by law, in virtue of the common citizenship of Ireland and Great Britain, and her adherence to and membership of the group of nations forming the British Commonwealth of Nations.” This was the first time on which the customary reference to Empire was dropped from an official document.There remained just one make-or-break issue: Northern Ireland, with its devolved powers over local matters entrusted to it by Westminster earlier in . Sinn Fein were determined to get it into their independent state. Lloyd George was happy to give them all the help he could. In November, he had piled pressure on Sir James Craig, the Northern Ireland prime minister. In letters and conversations he tried, with all his accustomed craftiness, to get Craig to accept that he had a patriotic duty to remove the last barrier to peace in Ireland by joining a sovereign all-Ireland Parliament in place of Westminster, while retaining all the devolved powers that Westminster had provided.The Unionist members of the British delegation did not demur. Not for the last time, Ulster Unionists found that they could not rely on their English Unionist allies in high places . Austen Chamberlain said that separate arrangements for six of the nine Ulster counties were “illogical and indefensible”. He thought “the greatest moral pressure” should be put on Northern Ireland to bring it into a settlement that was “vital to the Empire”. His party chairman, Sir George Younger , believed “Ulster should take some risks and forget some of the past arguments against unity in Ireland”.These Unionist calls for compromisewere made against the background of a sustained press campaign, led by The Times, criticising Ulster Unionists for their intransigence. “Ulster blocks the way to peace” was the newspapers’ regular refrain. Craig described it as “ a press campaign against Ulster without parallel in the history of Great Britain.”But the Northern Ireland premier was unmoved. He told Lloyd George that a single parliament for Ireland was “precisely what Ulster has for many years resisted by all the means at her disposal”.Lloyd George tried another tack in November, concentrating his cunning this time on the leader of the Irish delegation, Arthur Grfith. Here he had much greater success than in his attempts to manoeuvre Craig into an all-Ireland parliament. At a private meeting with Grfith on November , he got the leader of the Irish delegation to give a personal written pledge that,Northern Ireland refused to accept an all-Ireland settlement, it would remain under the British Parliament, “but in this case, it would be necessary to revise the boundary of Northern Ireland. This might be done by a Boundary Commission ... to make the boundary conform as closely as possible to the wishes of the people.” What went unrecorded in the paper was the clear impression given by Lloyd George that Northern Ireland would lose so much territory that it could not survive as a separate entity and a united independent Ireland would as a result come into existence.During the course of the long afternoon session in Downing Street on December , Lloyd George reminded Grfith of what they had agreed.Proof was needed. A frantic search was made of the prime minister’s wardrobe, and “eventually an insignicant pocket cast up an envelope and a piece of paper.” On the strength of this written undertaking to establish a Boundary Commission whichwould undermine Northern Ireland, the leader of the Irish delegation agreed to sign the Treaty himself, but said that he could not commit his colleagues.At this, Lloyd George assumed a magnicently melodramatic air. He had told Craig in Belfast to expect news of the outcome of the discussions in Downing Street the following day. That could of course have been done by telephone, but Lloyd George now conjured up an elaborate plan to send the news in writing to Belfast in an attempt to force a decision out of the other two Irish delegates.“Here are the alternative letters which I have prepared, one enclosing Articles of Agreement reached by His Majesty’s Government and yourselves, and the other saying that the Sinn Fein representatives refuse to come within the Empire. If I send this letter it is war, and war within three days. Which letter am I to send  Whichever letter you choose travels by special train to Holyhead, and by destroyer to Belfast. The train is waiting with steam up at Euston ... to reach Sir James in time we must know your answer by ten p.m tonight. You can have until then, but no longer, to decide whether you will give peace or war to your country.”With these impassioned words ringing in their ears, the Irish delegates ed to their Knightsbridge hotel for anguished discussions amongst themselves, but promised to be back in Downing Street by the pm deadline. In fact, it was nearly .pm when they ed.Nothing more was heard about the special train waiting at Euston. Grfith announced calmly, “Prime Minister, the Delegation is willing to sign the agreements, but there are a few points of drafting which perhaps it would be convenientI mentioned at once.” The most important concerned the Boundary Commission redrafting increasedthe likelihood that Northern Ireland would collapse. At Iam on December , an agreed text was handed to the Downing Street typists.In England, reaction to the treaty was ecstatic. The Times led the way: “These are fitting peace terms to mark the close of an age of discontent and distrust, and the beginning of a new era of happiness and mutual understanding.” In Ireland, discontent intensied and took a new form: the long quarrel with Britain was replaced by distrust and ision within Sinn Fein, which led to a bitter civil war the following year. In Northern Ireland, IRA terrorism increased, generating sectarian stre in  parts of Belfast came to resemble the battlefields of the First World War. The Boundary Commission recommended only minor changes, and its report was shelved. Englishmen looked away. “The country”, said Austen Chamberlain, “wants peace and is tired of Ireland and Ulster.” English politicians hoped they would never have to think seriously about Irish affairs again. For nearly  years they had their wish — which meant that that they were fatally handicapped by ignorance when the Ulster crisis of  erupted.l BIBLIOGRAPHY—D.G.Boyce, Englishmen and Irish Troubles: British Public Opinion and the Making of Irish Policy -and “ How to Settle the Irish Question: Lloyd George and Ireland -” in A.J.P.

Three Sinn Fein offices received payments from the fund, which have since been repaid.MP and MLA constituency offices were ineligible for the scheme.Northern Ireland’s Auditor General Kieran Donnelly said that while £. million of these payments under the Small Business Support Grant Scheme have been recovered, it is “not clear” how much of the money wrongly paid out will ever be recouped.Mr Donnelly’s report said that payments are likely to have been made to businesses which did not suffer Covid- related hardship because no assessment of need had been undertaken.Responding to the findings, the Department for the Economy insisted the scheme was an “emergency response to a crisis” and introduced at “extreme pace”. The department said that without the support many businesses may not have survived.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

In total the scheme made payments of £. million, with £. million of this given out through “push payments” directly into the bank accounts of businesses which had not applied for the grant.The report said that the decision to implement push payments to all businesses in receipt of small business rates reliefwas “inherently risky”.It continued: “It was likely that some public money would be issued to businesses which did not suffer hardship as a result of the Covid- crisis.“No evaluation was undertaken to quanty the potential level of funding likely to be issued to those who did not require it.”The report added: “On the same day that the online portal for applications went live, £. million was paid via push payments, directly into the bank accounts of those businesses identied on the LPS database as eligible for SBRR and which paid their rates via direct debit.“These payments were made without State Aid approval from the European Commission.”Following his audit, Mr Donnelly estimated that £. million could have been paid to recipients who were not eligible under the scheme rules.He said that to date, the Department for Economy and LPS have identied £. million of potentially ineligible payments.This includes £ million in duplicate payments, £, paid to landlords rather than tenants, and £, paid to wind turbine owners, an industry which was not impacted by the pandemic.The report said that communication and collaborative working between the organisations involved in scheme delivery could have been better.It said that important LPS queries on eligibility were “not being answered by the Department for Economy for weeks after they were received”.It also said that staff involved in the scheme’s design and implementation had been instructed to work from home during the pandemic but initially did not have key resources such as video conferencing facilities.Among those who wrongly received the payments included three Sinn Fein offices. The money was repaid after seven months.Several Sinn Fein representatives, including former Foyle MP Elisha McCallion and West Tyrone MLA Catherine Kelly, resigned over the matter.The report said: “These payments were part of the initial payments issued automatically, without an application being received.“These offices should have been excluded from the payment list but were overlooked.”At the outset of the scheme, the Department for Economy Permanent Secretary raised serious concerns over the value for money and the risk of fraud and error, the report states.However, in light of the perceived urgent need to get support to businesses quickly, then Economy Minister Diane Dodds issued a ministerial direction for the scheme to go ahead.The report said that “many of the concerns raised by the DfE Permanent Secretary came to pass”.Covid-Northern Ireland  \"       \"  Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up  Most Popular‘I was beaten out of estate with a baseball bat for being Protestant’ years of silence broken: sisters tell of anguish over IRA murdering their brother in bedSinn Fein rising star quit over paymentsBook extract: London is the cultural capital for the Irish, but that didn’t dim anti-British feeling back home over BrexitNI road closed due to ‘treacherous conditions caused by high waves’Most PopularHow to stay warm without using central heating - including blankets, hot water bottles and teddy bedding best men’s waterproof hiking trousers UK: stay dry hiking with trousers from Craghoppers, Berghaus, MontaneMS have announced their Christmas dinner range for  - here’s what’s available, on sale nowAldi releases two festive gin liqueurs for Christmas, including a Spiced Biscuit flavour - how to buyPremier League Winter Ball  : cost and where to buy new Nike football - from Sports Direct to JD Sports                       This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us on    ExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryNewspaper ArchiveUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter \" fill\"#ea\"  ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-kTUwUJ sc-dqBHgY ciFbrr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyModern Slavery Statement  News you can trust since Sign in   \"    Welcome backEdit Account-Sign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensPuzzlese-PaperCoronavirusMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessRecommended\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"  \" \"  \"  scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"      RecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPublic NoticesContact UsFree Happy AdsFollow us       \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

The consultation with key stakeholders will run for a period of  weeks.”The issue first arose inFebruary  when the council received a request from Abbeyville Residents’ Association for five Irish language street signs which was turned down after councillors voted in favour of a policy retaining street signs in English only proposed by Glengormley DUP councillor Alderman Phillip Brett and seconded by Glengormley Ulster Unionist councillor Ald Mark Cisgrove.Ald Brett stressed the importance of the council having a policy on the issue so thatthere were future requests, these could be dealt with “smoothly”.Ald Cosgrove said that given the facts and figures presented to members over the number of Irish language speakers in the borough, the request would be “preposterous” and street signs would look like a “dog’s dinner”.According to the  census,.% of residents in Antrim and Newtownabbey had some knowledge of Irish. In , it was reported that  people in Antrim and Newtownabbey spoke Irish as a main language.However, in September , the council was forced to do a u-turn after being challenged in the High Court by a resident who sought a judicial review over a “deeply held concern that the policy adopted by the local authority was unlawful”. Read hereThe borough councilinsisted that its policy was “not a ban in any way on the Irish language” and a new, “more detailed policy would be drafted for the council to consider”.Commenting on last week’s decision, SDLP group leader Councillor Roisin Lynch said: “I was disappointed that councillors decided to support this deeply restrictive policy. It is a shameless and deliberate attempt to slow down and stymy efforts for dual language signage.“There can be little doubt that this onerous policy is designed to obstruct efforts to progress the visibility of Gaeilge in our local communities. I am particularly disappointed that Alliance Party councillors backed a policy designed to restrict the growth of the language.“It is of vital importance that the Irish language is given the visibility it deserves and that anyone who wishes to see bilingual signage in their area has access to a fair and transparent process. This is a slap in the face to those in our communities, including myself, who know that we need to break down barriers to the visibility of the the Irish language, not create new ones.”Antrim and Newtownabbey Mayor Councillor Billy Webb commented: “This is not an Irish language policy. This is a multi-lingual policy. We are a erse community.“The policy is going out to consultation. We were looking for one third of residents of a street to instigate an application and then  per cent plus one in the actual vote. That is a normal and true democratic process. The DUP was looking for two-thirds.”Michelle Weir, Local Democracy Reporter--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this article.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe complaint to the Public Services Ombudsman for Wales against the Cardf and Vale University Health Board was lodged by the patient -referred to in the complaint as lsquoMr Drsquo -who was unhappy with the care and treatment he received at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardf during and after a scheduled admission for surgery to remove the right side of his colon.Mr D, who has Aspergerrsquos Syndrome, complained that hiscondition - at the time believed to be Crohns Disease -was not clearly diagnosed and that clinicians were slow to identy he suffered a post-operative bleed and needed further emergency surgery.He complained that information about his treatment and care was not provided clearly to him despite those caring for him knowing about his Aspergerrsquos Syndrome. He was also unhappy with aspects of his care after his discharge.Mr Drsquos surgery was carried out on the presumption that he had Crohnrsquos Disease according to the Ombudsman, but surgical findings suggested complex chronic appendicitis.The Ombudsman found that neither of these conditions needed the extensive surgery that Mr D was given. The Ombudsman also found there was no complete record of how his condition was monitored following his surgery and that his post-operative bleed might have been detected sooner.The Ombudsman also concluded that the clinicians were aware of the patientrsquos Aspergerrsquos Syndrome but did not clearly communicate the information about his diagnosis and treatment to him. The Ombudsman also found that the patient was not seen by a mental health clinician as requested by Mr D because it was not arranged.MORE NEWS:The Ombudsman did not uphold the complaint regarding Mr Drsquos care post-discharge.Nick Bennett of Public Services Ombudsman for Wales said: ldquoThis regrettable case highlights yet again the importance of one of the key principles of prudent healthcare formulated by the Welsh Government ndash lsquodo only what is needed and do no harm.rsquoldquoPhysicians responsible for Mr Drsquos care should have employed a lsquowatch and waitrsquo approach in which his condition would probably have settled without surgical treatment.ldquoInstead, Mr D, a vulnerable inidual, faced completely avoidable trauma of unnecessary surgery and post-treatment complications ndash a trauma which saw him seek mental health support. I anticipate that my findings will be extremely distressing for him. This is reflected in my recommendations in this case.The Ombudsman recommended that Cardf and Vale University Health Board provides Mr D with a detailed apology and a redress payment of pound,. Mr Bennett also recommended that the physicians and nurses involved in Mr Drsquos care have relevant training in the management of Crohnrsquos Disease and chronic appendicitis as well as the care and management of patients with Aspergerrsquos Syndrome.It was also recommended that the nursing team consider the importance of conducting and documenting post-operative observations and of preparing accurate and relevant care plans.The Ombudsmans report says Cardf and Vale University Health Board has accepted the findings and conclusions of the Ombudsmanrsquos report and has agreed to implement the recommendations.A spokesperson for Cardf and Vale University Health Board said: \"As a health board we would like to reiterate our sincere apologies to Mr D for the concerns identied in the report.\"We are implementing the recommendations from the Ombudsman and an improvement plan has been developed to monitor the delivery of all recommendations within the agreed timescales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"Comments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityExactly how fast the city should grow is up for debate as Cardf council launches a major consultation on its local development plan.Another issue is how many of these new homes should be built in the countryside or in urban areas.The development plan is a hugely important council document shaping how the city will evolve until , and the consultation runs for  weeks until February .The first phase of the consultation looks at how many new homes and jobs the city might need over the next  years, with three specic options. Currently developers already have plans for an extra , homesmdashwhich havenrsquot yet been builtmdashthanks to the existing local development plan.Although, itrsquos possible that not all of these will actually be built. Some additional lsquowindfall sitesrsquo are also likely to come forward, where developers build homes not allocated in the development plan.So factoring these in, the first option would mean an extra , homes needed, as well as , new jobs. That would mean , new homes built each year, for a total of , by .The second option would mean an extra , homes needed, and , new jobs. That would mean , new homes built each year, for a total of , homes by . This could mean more affordable housing.The third option would mean an extra , homes needed, and , new jobs. That would mean , new homes built each year, for a total of , homes by . This is based on population growth projections from the previous development plan, which some critics say were too high.Councillor Caro Wild, cabinet member for strategic planning and transport, said: ldquoThe replacement LDP is going to shape the look and feel of Cardf for years to come, so it was really important for us to hear as wide a range of views as possible. At this stage of the process, we are accessing a number of dferent scenarios on the possible levels of growth in Cardf up to , and the need for houses to be built to accommodate this growth..removeldquoIt is important that people understand the consequences of the options, as most growth scenarios will have pros and cons with regard to important issues such as land for employment opportunities, the impact on the environment, addressing housing need, supporting the delivery of community and transport infrastructure, and how many truly affordable homes that could be provided.People can respond to the consultation by visiting the website https:cardfldp.consultation.ai, while there will also be focus groups to gather views of people who donrsquot normally respond to council consultations.The next phase of the consultation explores eight options on how the city should accommodate a growing population, and how many homes should be built in the countryside or in urban areas.Option one would extend the existing strategic sites, built on countryside on the outskirts of the city. This would mean more affordable homes and a wider range of housing, due to the cheaper construction costs of building on greenfield sites.Options two and three would see new homes built mostly on urban brownfield sites, meaning land which has already been developed. This would mean denser housing, and could be more expensive to build with less range in size. Option four is similar, but focusing on building around existing district centres to create a lsquocity of villagesrsquo concept.Option five would see new homes built around existing transport links in urban areas while option six would focus growth around proposed transport improvements like the metro and planned new train stations, including on some greenfield sites.Option seven would focus on greenfield sites not already earmarked for development, on countryside on the outskirts of Cardf. Option eight would be a mix of using greenfield and brownfield sites, in urban areas and the countryside, to get the best of both.Cllr Wild added: ldquoAt this stage of the process, all of the options that are presented in the consultation are potential options, rather than preferred options. The preferred strategy could combine a number of these options together. All of the feedback from the public will be considered, alongside further technical work, which will help the council prepare the preferred strategy that will be consulted on with the public in autumn .This consultation follows a previous one held earlier this year, which focused on what the broader goals of the replacement development plan should look like. This included exploring how the city should face problems like coronavirus and the climate crisis. The final plan is expected to be approved in October . article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

However, the vaccines become less effective over time so itrsquos really important that people come forward to have a booster when invited to extend their protection.ldquoMillions of people have accepted the vaccine, it has saved lives and helped prevent serious illness in tens of thousands of people.ldquoI want to place on record my thanks to everyone involved in the vaccination programme in Wales for their hard work over the last year and for their help in the coming weeks..removeldquoPlease wait until you are invited for your booster and prioritise your appointment over everything  to support the hard-working staff and volunteers at our vaccination centres, who will be spending a second festive period to keep Wales safe.ldquoWith high levels of the Delta iant in the community and the emergence of the Omicron iant, you can continue to disrupt the transmission of the virus by wearing a face covering in indoor public places, getting tested, self-isolating when positive and getting vaccinated.The Welsh Government said that more than  per cent of people aged  and over have had their booster vaccination. They urge anyone in this category who has yet to have theirs to contact their local health board.They also urge people who have not yet had a vaccine and are eligible to come forward to receive their first dose.There are details on the Welsh Government websitepeople want to help the vaccine programme by volunteering.

Why not name it after yourself, your business, or a loved one \"Oryou really want, you can call our stadium The my mate Dave is a k**b Arena - knock yourself out!\"The lucky competition winner was named as Katie Louise Williams - the girlfriend of the clubs star striker Thomas Walters.Beautician Katie decided to rename Frampton Lane after her pet dog Moomin and chose the title Prince Moomins Palace.Ms Williams, , is planning to take four-year-old Moomin down to the next match to show him around his own stadium.She said: \"Im sure he will be very excited. We cant wait to take him.\"Ive been following the team for years and it was great to win the prize. Moomins name will be known to everyone around her now.\"The club confirmed Ms Williams - who is also the long-term partner of star striker Thomas Walters - won the prize.The club said: \"The stadium was named after her dog Moomin, who we are reliably informed is treated like a Prince.\"The competition raised vital funds in the quest for the club achieving a FAW Tier  License, with proceeds raised going towards much needed ground improvements such as floodlights.\"Reaction from fans has been positive, although much confusion on the stands last Saturday as to whether were still the Windmill Army or now the Moomin Army.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

BHF NI is the biggest independent funder of heart and circulatory disease research in NI and relies solely on the generosity of the public to continue its vital work.

RobinsonWednesday, th December , : am  \"       \"  MP Carla Lockhart and her Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Councillor colleague Darryn Causby gave a warm welcome to progress on the playpark.Mrs Lockhart said: “A new play park for The Birches is badly needed and it is something that I, along with my colleagues on Council, have been working on for some time.“This is a particularly exciting proposal given that the area has not had any investment in play over many years.Portadown DUP Cllr Darryn Causby with Upper Bann MP Carla Lockhart at the proposed site of a new play park in the Birches.“The Birches is a thriving little village area with a school, lots of new housing and an active community group. “It is wonderful to see that real progress is being made and the play park with a fair wind will be on site in .“ It was great to get an update yesterdayand hear of the very real progress with land acquisition and the scheme being worked up. “It will be such a major benefit to the area and particularly to the current cohort of kids both in attendance at the school and living in the village.“Investment in our children and local communities is critical and I am pleased to have worked along side our DUP council team who have been to the fore in championing and driving forward the play park replacement and looking at an overall play strategy. “We will continue to work hard to deliver on this election promise. “We also made the point concerning the need for inclusion of equipment for those children with physical disabilities. “All playparks need to be as inclusive as possible, ensuring all children have the opportunity to enjoy a fun day out at the park.” Councillor Causby added: “Parents in The Birches have been contacting me for some time around the need for a play facility and the proposals being brought forward by Council would ensure the delivery of a first class play park in the area. “I am committed to driving this project forward and trust all other parties will get behind the investment needed to make this a reality. “Play is so important for physical and mental health and development,” said the DUP councillor.Portadown charity shop in plea for
