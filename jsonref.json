Regulation 7 deals specifically with the temperature in indoor workplaces and states that: ‘During working hours, the temperature in all workplaces inside buildings shall be reasonable.‘However, the application of the regulation depends on the nature of the workplace, such as a bakery, a cold store, an office, a warehouse.’In addition, the HSE also requires that employers must keep temperatures at comfortable levels for employees and provide ‘clean, fresh air’ for them.How hot does it have to be to go home?Though no official, universal heat limits currently exist, both employees and employers must gauge when action should be taken to prevent serious health risks.‘If a significant number of employees are complaining about thermal discomfort, your employer should carry out a risk assessment, and act on the results of that assessment,’ the HSE states.Employees with preexisting medical conditions should also take extra caution in the workplace during heatwaves.In sum, although no universal heat regulations are currently in place in the UK, employees who feel uncomfortable should speak up and tell their managers. Having enough people to do compels the employer to act, per HSE regulations.What will happen when Prince Philip dies?Who is Joshua Kushner?

He bit on the lower lip, did lots of nodding and flashed a pair of dimples, working rising inflections into his tone. Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood and his stand-in Sir Mark Sedwill, along with civil service chief executive John Manzoni, speak in almost an identical way.John Whittingdale (Con, Maldon) claimed that ‘most ministers knew nothing’ of the soft-Brexit plan pulled out of the Chequers hat.Mr Robbins, meekly: ‘I don’t think so.’ He claimed Mrs May’s ‘engagement with colleagues was constant’. Constant but deceptive, perhaps.Mr Whittingdale said it looked as if Mrs May had tried to ‘circumvent’ her Cabinet. Mr Robbins, who began most of his answers with ‘so’, said ‘it’s certainly not a picture I or the Prime Minister would recognise’.    Theresa May’s head of the Europe unit at number 10 Downing Street Olly Robbins was undergoing a spot of parliamentary scrutiny today. He has been given powers that arguably usurp those of HM Secretary of State for Brexit, Dominic RaabMr Robbins’s enhanced powers were confirmed in a parliamentary written answer published a few minutes before yesterday’s committee hearing.It confirmed a ‘change of government machinery’ which all but emasculates the Brexit department.Craig Mackinlay (Con, S Thanet) said: ‘I feel a coup d’etat has been going on.’ Mr Robbins: ‘So, Mr Mackinlay, I honestly don’t recognise the picture.’Jacob Rees-Mogg (Con, NE Somerset) wondered when Mr Robbins had started writing his Chequers papers. ‘These papers had their origins in other papers,’ said Mr Robbins. See how sneaky they are at this sort of thing? He finally conceded that the first versions of the Chequers papers were written ‘about a fortnight’ earlier.Mr Rees-Mogg, with deadly politeness, said he did not hold Mr Robbins responsible for a ‘worrying’ breakdown in Cabinet government. Mr Robbins thanked him. Mr Rees-Mogg now said that he blamed Mrs May. Mr Robbins gave a pale gulp, wishing he had not been so quick to thank the Mogg.It is often said Tony Blair lied to ministers and to Parliament when he took us into the Iraq War, and that his dishonesty wrecked public trust in our political system.If Mrs May has just misled her own ministers, on a national strategic relationship with the EU which may impede our economy for decades, her reputation will sink as low as that of the sharply hated Blair.

Mr Donnelly asked the MP: ‘You asked what she and her partner would do intimately?’ Mrs Harris replied: ‘That’s not correct.’  Clarke, 42, (pictured) is on trial accused of forging Mrs Harris’s signature and fraudulently submitting a form to give herself a £2,000 pay rise and reduce her weekly hours from 40 to 37.5The MP denied claims that Clarke had asked her to stop posing sexual questions, and said she had not needed to out her because ‘it was quite obvious’.The jury of eight men and four women has heard that Clarke was hired by Mrs Harris the day after her election to the Swansea East seat in May 2015.Mr Donnelly accused the MP of earlier assaulting Clarke by shaking her violently and pulling her hair so hard that clumps came out in November 2014. Mrs Harris replied: ‘That’s totally untrue.’Jurors were told that Clarke later reported the alleged incident to police and made a statement about it in January 2016.The MP rejected suggestions that she had got down on her knees and apologised to Clarke.The court heard Mrs Harris wrote a letter to Clarke promising her a full-time position if she was elected as an MP, which the defence claimed was to ‘hush her up’. But the MP said: ‘I didn’t need to hush Jenny Clarke up. Nothing had happened.‘We had a good friendship. I did her a good many favours including giving her a television, a car, holidays in my caravan – it was a mutually beneficial friendship.’She insisted Clarke’s dismissal was in progress by January 2016, when a colleague forwarded forms highlighting the pay rise and reduction in hours. Clarke is also accused of writing an email to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority from Mrs Harris’s account, confirming the changes.In police interview, Clarke admitted signing Mrs Harris’s name on the form and sending the email but insisted both were done on the MP’s instruction.The trial continues."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/24/08/4E86CCC500000578-0-image-a-14_1532416452504.jpg","title":"Swedish student REFUSES sit plane realising man deported","story":"In an act of civil disobedience, the student took out her phone and streamed a 14-minute video where she walked about the plane explaining the man \u0027will most likely get killed\u0027 if he\u0027s deportedKnowing the flight would not be able to take off while she was standing, the activist refuses to take her seat until the Afghan man is let of the plane.Cabin crew and other passengers ask her to sit down at start of the clip, which she insists she will do as soon as the man is let go.

Politicians, on the other hand, operate on short electoral timescales. This makes it unconventional, to say the least, to hear Rees-Mogg pushing all hope of benefits from Brexit into the very long run when, as John Maynard Keynes jokingly pointed out, we are all dead.So what’s the game? Why would a politician representing the good people of North East Somerset – whose livelihoods depend on the stability of our economy and who would be devastated by the no-deal Brexit he is happy to promote – seemingly behave so irresponsibly? Could it perhaps have something to do with personal economic gain rather than national economic opportunities?Rees-Mogg’s hedge fund, Somerset Capital Management, is managed via subsidiaries in the tax havens of the Cayman Islands and Singapore. He has defended the use of such tax havens, saying “I do not believe people have any obligation to pay more tax than the law requires.” And the laws that look set to stand in the way are planned new EU regulations aimed at governing the behaviour of companies such as his own.He has also enthused about the potential to slash environmental and safety laws after Britain leaves the EU. Regulations that were “good enough for India” could be good enough for Britain, he has argued.To back up this worldview is a network of self-styled thinktanks, with opaque funding sources and a passionate commitment to classical liberal economics. Leading the charge has been the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), with which Rees-Mogg is associated. Its roots lie in attempts to oppose the Attlee-Bevan move to the left after the second world war that brought us the NHS and the welfare state. The IEA’s mission is to promote small government and freedom for so-called “wealth creators”. Or to put it more accurately, ultra-rich iniduals and corporations. The IEA saw Brexit as an enormous opportunity: a once-in-a-generation chance to create a more flexible, open and vibrant economy with less bureaucracy and protectionism, for which read signing up for trade deals that lower environmental and consumer standards.And Brexit seems to be offering enormous opportunities for Rees-Mogg personally. His European Research Group (ERG) has been accused by fellow Tory Anna Soubry of running the country after Theresa May caved in to Brexit hardliners over her Chequers plan.Jacob Rees-Mogg is often seen as the “respectable” face of the Conservative hardline right wing. His style recalls an era when the British empire was flourishing and merchants traded grain, but children starved, and – most importantly – there were no pesky democratic constraints to prevent the wealthy enjoying their freedom. Far from offering us our liberty, the Brexit he offers threatens to turn us back into corporate chattels, stripped of our hard-won civil and democratic rights.• Molly Scott Cato is Green MEP for the South West and the Green party speaker on Brexit."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/05bab29fe2c1a0d81f441d3ff21d8a61104066a2/0_87_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b57f9bf0c48ddb308f98246353cb3dad","title":"1976 long hot summer political upheaval","story":"Just like this year’s, the heatwave in 1976 arrived as Britain seemed to be approaching an economic and political abyss. During the spring and early summer, as the sun began to hammer down and the usual rain failed to fall, and the reservoirs began to shrink, the pound was lurching downwards on the markets. For almost three years, under Tory and Labour governments, the economy had been shrivelling alarmingly. Just as since the Brexit vote, a conviction had been building like a thundercloud among financial traders and business leaders, economists and commentators, in Britain and beyond, that the country was about to slip to a lower, less elite level, and stay there. “Goodbye, Great Britain,” said a much-read editorial in the Wall Street Journal in 1975, “it was nice knowing you.”To some pessimists about Britain’s prospects, the drought the following summer, which brought forest fires, crop failures, hosepipe bans enforced by policemen and vigilantes, and standpipes on street corners instead of mains water, was a further sign of crisis. In 1976, with impeccable timing, the American writer Paul Theroux published The Family Arsenal, a bleakly satirical novel about terrorists on the loose in a sweaty, rundown mid-70s London, its “decay pushing towards ruin”. Some sort of apocalypse, predicted one of the characters, was “certainly coming”.But the Labour chancellor, Denis Healey, was not one of the worriers. In the summer of 1976, after several exhausting months trying to defend his economic policies and the value of the pound, he went on holiday for most of August. He left sticky London behind and drove unhurriedly through England and Wales and up to north-west Scotland. “Not a drop of rain,” he wrote in his memoirs, “even in the Highlands.” In the hidden away lochside town of Ullapool, Healey checked into a hotel on the quayside and began to relax.That night, he was repeatedly woken by phone calls from Whitehall. In the US currency markets, the pound was collapsing again. The hotel had only one phone, so the chancellor stood in a hallway with a coat over his pyjamas, authorising the Bank of England to spend “up to $150m” (about £750m now) to buy sterling. The intervention worked: the pound stopped falling. Healey went back to bed, and then continued with his holiday.Hot weather does contradictory things to British politics. In parliament, with its stuffy rooms and sweaty dress codes, it traditionally sparks revolts, plots, panics and flashes of temper – a sense that things are coming to a head – as it has this summer. Yet away from Westminster, a heatwave can make politicians, and even more so voters, worry less than usual about the state of the nation. In an overcast country, sunshine often means contentment and escapism – and procrastination. During July and August 1976, despite the state of the economy and a widespread disillusionment with centre-left politics (which had been deepening since the late 60s), the Labour government pulled level with the Conservatives in the polls. Healey was generally seen as a tough, capable chancellor. The prime minister, Jim Callaghan, had an avuncular, calming manner that seemed appropriate to the summer lull. Voters called him Sunny Jim.Theresa May has none of Callaghan’s sly charm. But her situation this summer is similar in some ways. As in 1976, a ided government in a weak parliamentary position, wedded to increasingly contested ideas – for Callaghan, postwar social democracy, for May, austerity and the free market – has somehow made it to the welcome shade of the recess, despite many predictions to the contrary. The main opposition party remains ominously strong, but it has an intensely isive leader whom many voters see as odd and extremist: in this sense, Margaret Thatcher was the Jeremy Corbyn of the mid-70s.And, just as Callaghan did, May has managed to put off the most difficult political question of her government until the autumn. In 1976, this was whether Britain could afford to continue with its postwar levels of state spending now it is how to do Brexit. Yet during what might be a once-in-a-generation summer – as the sun keeps shining, day after day, and the parks are full of impromptu skivers, the pubs are full of workers having cheeky afternoon lagers, and even supposedly earnest protest marches feel more like carnivals – such national dilemmas can feel very distant.In the summer of 1976, the sense of ease was not a\u0026nbsptotal delusion. Twenty-eight years later, the respected\u0026nbspNew Economics Foundation created a measure for overall economic, social and environmental\u0026nbspwellbeing, and concluded that 1976 was\u0026nbspthe best year in modern British history.For those invested in the idea that the 70s were a nadir for Britain – pro-Thatcher historians, and hipper archivists of the punk rebellion against the mid-70s status quo – the summer of 1976 has always been an awkward piece of counter-evidence. Yet as Jon Savage pointed out in his 1991 book England’s Dreaming, still the best, most nuanced study of punk and its political and social context, the heatwave actually helped the movement. After dark, the rare warmth gave the first British punks a sense of possibility, and a freedom, as they roamed between squats and nightclubs. In a normal British summer, it would have been hard to stay out all night in punk outfits full of holes.The summer of 2018 feels less carefree. We know more about climate change and skin cancer now. This week, forecast to be the hottest of the season, the Met Office is advising people to stay out of the sun. And the world beyond Britain feels more genuinely apocalyptic, and harder to ignore. We face Trump and a Europe increasingly controlled by far-right populists in the summer of 1976, the continent was dominated by centrists, and the insurgent shaking up US politics was a mild, almost meek Democrat, Jimmy Carter. Even the cold war seemed to be abating, thanks to the disarmament treaties and subtle diplomacy of detente.But we shouldn’t idealise the summer of 1976 too much. Away from its unexpected pleasures, pressures were still building in Britain. In August the guitarist Eric Clapton near the peak of his fame, used a concert in Birmingham to make a speech defending the anti-immigrant prejudices of Enoch Powell. At the end of the month, the Notting Hill carnival in London turned into a battle between the police and black youths, a prefiguring of the many riots in the decade to come.Also in late August the heatwave finally disintegrated in a mess of thunderstorms. A soaking, grey autumn followed. The pound resumed its decline, the government’s finances deteriorated further, Whitehall panicked – or, some say, exploited the situation – and the government ended up drastically cutting its spending, and accepting a loan from the IMF and. The reputations of Healey and Callaghan, their government, and postwar social democracy, never quite recovered.Once the summer interlude of 1976 was over, Britain changed very fast – and in many ways not for the good.

It is not just Boris Johnson exclaiming “fuck business” – it is their furious and sustained response to the corporations threatening to disinvest after Brexit, exemplified by the resignation of the Welsh Conservative leader after his attack on\u0026nbspAirbus.Most remarkable – and least remarked upon – is an article in the Daily Mail a couple of weeks ago by the former party leader the former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, in which he rehearses what anti-corporate campaigners have been saying for decades. “The public,” he complained, “is urged to accept, without challenge, the views of corporations and their representative bodies such as the Confederation of British Industry.” According to this “fashionable narrative”, the opinions of corporate chief executives “should count for much more than the decisions of voters exercised through the democratic ballot box”.Who are the authors of this “fashionable narrative”? Among them is a certain Iain Duncan\u0026nbspSmith, as you can see from the speech he gave as party leader to the CBI in 2001. Oh, and just about every senior Conservative over the past four decades. Yet this astonishing article passed almost without comment in the rest of the billionaire press. What is going on?One of the hidden conflicts Brexit has exposed is the contradiction between what Conservatives claim to stand for – something called conservatism – and what they really represent. Everything conservatism is supposed to defend – tradition, continuity, community, national character, the physical fabric of the nation – is ripped apart by the demands of capital, whose permanent revolution the Conservative party assists and accelerates.The contradictions run throughout conservative Britain. As a young man, I was amazed to see the burghers of middle England look the other way as their beautiful market towns were turned into car parks and the glorious countryside that surrounded them into chemical deserts. They claimed to love a national character exemplified by independent butchers, bakers and greengrocers, but shopped at Tesco. They didn’t blink while our national institutions – universities, schools, the BBC, the NHS, the rule of law – were vitiated by corporate interests. As a road-building programme driven by the demands of construction companies ripped through ancient monuments and nature reserves, they did nothing, leaving hippies and anarchists to defend our national heritage.I began to realise that the whole thing was a racket. Conservatism professed to be one thing, but in reality was its opposite. Everything could and should be sacrificed to money and its organised form: corporate power. Stripped of its professed adherence to tradition and continuity, all that is left of conservatism is property paranoia, xenophobia and a patriotism so coarse and ill-defined that it loses all meaning. This makes it easy to manipulate. When transnational corporations cannot be blamed for ripping apart communities and national character, immigrants must be blamed instead. A paper by Italo Colantone and Piero Stanig at Bocconi University found that, while there was no relationship between the number of migrants in a region and the extent to which it voted leave, there was a powerful relationship between the leave vote and what they call “Chinese import shock”: the displacement of local businesses and jobs by imports. Brexit was driven, they say, by the uncompensated effects of globalised trade. But as the instigators of the leave campaign were beholden to financial interests, such effects were unmentionable. So scapegoats had to be found.It would be delightful to imagine that people such as Duncan Smith and Johnson are seeking to defend democracy and popular sovereignty from the perennial threat of corporate power. Nothing could be further from the truth. Intimately associated with the campaign to disentangle us from the EU is an effort to entangle us further with a more distant and less amenable power: the United States. Food, environmental and workplace standards must succumb\u0026nbspto the maelstrom of US corporate lobbying and the demand that everything on Earth is exchangeable for something else.As foreign secretary, Johnson granted free use of rooms in the Foreign Office to the Initiative for Free Trade, a group of dark-money thinktanks that see Brexit as an opportunity to rip down public protections. The trade secretary, Liam Fox, is seeking to force the UK into the Trans-Pacific Partnership, whose radical assault on standards, and secretive offshore courts, present a far greater threat to national sovereignty than does the European Union. US and UK banks have already seized their chance, threatening to walk away from London after Brexit unless they get further tax cuts and a new round of deregulation. They have plainly forgotten what caused the last financial crisis. Broadly speaking, Brextremists such as Fox, Johnson and Duncan Smith favour the most ruthless and antisocial businesses over more responsible ones.Even so, the unusual conflict between transnational corporations and senior Conservatives should also discomfit defenders of the European Union. Why are big companies so keen to stay in? Because the EU, in essence, is a vehicle for their expansion. By regularising standards within the bloc and striking trade deals that are, to a large extent, fashioned by business lobbyists, it helps big companies to sweep away smaller competitors, and extends corporate power at the expense of democracy. As I’ve long argued, as a Eurosceptic remainer, the EU is like democracy, diplomacy and old age: the only thing that can be said for it is that it’s better than the alternative. The alternative is hideous.If established corporate power is perceived as an obstacle by senior Conservatives, it is not because a higher principle is at stake. It is simply because it conflicts with There is a more immediate aim: a Brexit that can be played to the advantage of one faction and the disadvantage of another.But as the contradictions emerge between what the Conservatives profess to be and what they are, it is instructive to watch the party split, as it did around the repeal of the Corn Laws, over the competing interests of different forms of capital. Expect this struggle to continue. But don’t expect to see anything resembling conservatism to materialise, on either side. Perhaps it is time they renamed their party."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50860534a74fc2df0091b87e649eab1e298f6525/0_221_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c21a7b459620d679ac154ff7f0de379f","title":"man booker literature comics nick drnaso sabrina","story":"Nick Drnaso’s Sabrina has been longlisted for the Man Booker prize – the first graphic novel in the award’s 50-year history. I’ve spent six years writing and editing criticism of comic books (as we in the know like to call them) and this news inspires a great feeling. We made it in during the first half-century! All right!I’m being facetious, but the more present comics become in the established literary scene, the more people will be able to access the stories that are told best though the cartoonist’s art. The urge to share fiction that enlarges, uplifts or otherwise challenges the spirit is the reason for the existence of the Man Booker prize, so to include texts that contain strong pictorial elements does not seem egregious. Sabrina, a modern mystery about a missing woman, has been longlisted this year because it’s an incredible piece of narrative craft. This is good news for comics, cartoonists and literature in general.Drnaso is published by Drawn \u0026amp Quarterly, a company with a “literary” aesthetic, and Sabrina’s style is particularly refined. The Chicago Tribune said that “Drnaso’s simple, rigid drawings capture the bleak blankness of much contemporary life”. Indeed they do, as that studied use of image to describe atmosphere is how comics work. But it would be wrong to associate a particular aesthetic trend with literary value. Posy Simmonds, for example, is very different and just as talented, but she doesn’t receive quite the same sort of rapturous praise. (And it is worth noting that, were Drnaso to win the Man Booker, he would be the third American male winner in a row.)When these books are suddenly celebrated beyond comics-reader circles, we fans sometimes forget to appreciate each book for its own sake. Some will jump at the chance to prove that comics can be “serious literature”, and use this longlisting as proof, unwittingly implying that every other comic is lesser. Some will turn up their noses at any books that look like the type of comic that would be acknowledged as the worthy kind. It’s hard to stay focused on what we enjoy about the comics form when one book, hewing close to one stylistic ideal, ends up being seen as representing an entire form.Much of the praise lavished on Sabrina could be equally applied to other comic books: Hannah Berry’s Livestock is also a “masterpiece” about “our contemporary mitigated reality” Conor Stechschulte’s Generous Bosom is just as full of “ominous, dead quiet” Luke Healy’s How to Survive in the North has a similar approach to bodies and page layouts, though his is imbued with sherbet colour and a sense of climate. Simmonds, as mentioned, offers a fine, soft line in “fridge-humming domesticity and quiet dread”. Rather than being outraged at Drnaso’s longlisting, or defensive of his role in a particular literary tradition, let’s see his Man Booker nomination as a celebration of all these cartoonable and universal qualities.• Claire Napier is a critic and independent comics editor, as well as cartooning just for kicks"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bee3e36c97c082ca3ff4023b9b787e83407d3fe2/0_60_2835_1701/master/2835.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72e1fd608a52c4dea5a527937b69344e","title":"mesut ozil minorities identity germany football turkish heritage","story":"The Germany footballer has been criticised for showing pride in his Turkish roots. But why should people of colour have to ditch their national heritage?It’s often said that black people do so well in sport in countries where they are in a minority because it offers the only opportunity they have to compete on a genuinely level playing field. That’s a simplification, of course: the playing field is not completely level there, either the ongoing and countless stories of overt racism, from football to athletics and tennis, are testament to that. And if there’s one thing recent events have revealed, it’s that while sport may be more meritocratic than other workplaces, for people of colour the rewards are still conditional.The footballer Mesut Özil feels he is being penalised for his pride in Turkey, the nation of his heritage, by Germany, the nation of his citizenship. This episode has opened an emotive window into just how precarious national status can be. “I am German when we win, but I am an immigrant when we lose,” Özil said, announcing his retirement from the national team after criticism of his recent performances.Özil, a key member of the German team that won the World Cup in 2014, had faced a backlash before this year’s tournament after posing for a photo with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan – a hardliner widely condemned for human rights abuses. But the problem Germans have with Özil seems to be more about his statement of cultural allegiance with the Turkish nation.You don’t actually need to pose with a problematic president to experience this disowning. I will never forget the way in which Mo Farah – the British long-distance runner who was propelled to national treasure status after his two 2012 Olympic gold medals – immediately became “Somali-born Farah” when the integrity of his coach’s techniques came into question.There are many other examples. Ben Johnson, the 100m world record holder, was Canadian – until he was\u0026nbspbanned for doping, at which point he became widely\u0026nbspreferred to as “Jamaican-born”. Yannick Noah, the French Open tennis champion who at one point seemed set for world domination, became camerounais when the dream expired.The French experience is rather specific, as the row over the South African comedian Trevor Noah’s description of France’s World Cup triumph as a victory for the African continent – since that’s where so many players are descended from - reminds us. France has mastered the art of hypocrisy with its official “we don’t see race” stance. Instead, people of minority heritage are stigmatised as les issus de l’immigration – simply another way of othering them.This prejudice is hard-baked into terminology across Europe. Visible minorities in Britain are labelled “immigrants” or, if they’re born here, “second generation immigrants”. Yet “indigenous” is a nonsensical term for a nation formed by millennia of immigration. Meanwhile, Brits abroad are seen as “expatriates”.In the Netherlands, visible minority Dutch people were, until recently, allochtoon, a word many of them hate because – while it may initially have been well intentioned – it was always perceived as a way of distinguishing between white “indigenous” Dutch and non-white descendants of immigrants.In Germany there were Gastarbeiter – who were invited from Turkey to compensate for German labour shortages, but whose long-term presence in the country was not fully accepted. Not surprisingly, some of their children feel an emotional attachment to Turkey (“I have two hearts”, Özil has said), yet Germany has decided that dual allegiances are no longer convenient.Germany doesn’t get to decide what the children of those it has treated as second-class citizens for so long get to do with the rights they have now acquired. Nor do France and Britain. Nor do the leaders of European countries that invented racial categories – necessary for the purposes of their own plans for enslavement and colonisation – get to unilaterally decide that these are no longer relevant, now that it’s become inconvenient for them to face up to the legacy of their own creation.We get to define our identities, our allegiances and our relationship to our heritage. Özil’s identity as both Turkish and German – quite apart from being perfectly logical – is his by right to express. French people of African heritage have earned the right to their unconditional Frenchness, whether or not they play football, and no French person can stop them celebrating being part of the African diaspora.This matters. In Britain, for example, many black people benefit from the struggle our parents and grandparents faced to secure citizenship and economic security – although the recent Windrush scandal reminds us that battle is still not over – and now have the luxury of choosing how we want to self-identify. And many of us are actually growing closer to our countries of heritage, despite having never lived there.There is nothing particularly unusual about this. Similar connections can be found in the Irish and Italian diasporas in America, and in Jewish people everywhere. But for some reason it’s deemed more problematic when people of colour wish to organise around shared cultural or national heritage. It’s part of a belief that somehow Britain did us a favour by letting us come to this country, with our brown faces and strange faiths and all, for which we should be uniquely grateful.The problem is, European countries didn’t “let” their migrants in they needed people to rebuild their countries, offering in return low wages and poor living conditions. The descendants of those workers are still processing the racism, prejudice and disadvantage that resulted. But the one thing no one can take away is what we decide about who we are."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0d93739a706299f79085122535ba156ac8a510f3/153_129_3489_2094/master/3489.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6763e336e545d2db02fba8907498da5","title":"propaganda putin russia elections","story":"This summer, the World Cup created the illusion Russia was a well-run country with a contented population. But now the sports pageantry is over, Russians are back to the grey reality of everyday life, and a dire lack of prospects. And the idea of the nation being united around Vladimir Putin is fiction.Russia is often presented in binary terms: as a country ided between Putinists and liberals, rich and poor, rural folks and Moscovites, “slavophiles” and westerners. The Kremlin’s narrative hinges on the notion of a “patriotic” Russia constantly overcoming a minuscule opposition, depicted as a “fifth column” that is activated or manipulated by external forces. It is tempting for foreign observers to adopt such a black-and-white vision, in which the leader is dominant and admired while his doubters are an exception.In fact, there are three Russias. The first is Putin’s Russia, built on an oligarchic power structure and its massive propaganda machine. The second is the average man’s Russia, with its many facets but also its common problems. The third is of the professional elites and upper-middle class, who benefited from the economic boom of the 2000s and now have much to lose.The overwhelming majority of Russia’s 140 million people worry about declining living standards, falling health and education levels, material insecurity, and corruption. A few weeks ago, protests erupted in many regions and across social classes against a government plan to raise the pension age (polls show that eight out of 10 Russians oppose the reform). This demonstrated a swell of mistrust in the authorities, with many people doubting that the Putin system has their best interests at heart. Furthermore, sociologists at the independent Levada Centre in Moscow point to a rising pessimism. Despite TV propaganda – or perhaps because of it – more\u0026nbspand more Russians say they are gloomy about their\u0026nbsppersonal prospects, as well as about the country’s future. There is also concern about military involvement\u0026nbspin Ukraine and Syria, and the toll these conflicts are having on young soldiers.What about the elites? It is important to distinguish between the ruling group (Putin’s network of security services, officials and oligarchs), and the non-ruling elites and upper-middle class, which is made up of a few million scientists, intellectuals, local or regional civil servants, teachers and entrepreneurs. Against a backdrop of corruption and budget restrictions, these people often struggle to run a hospital, a school, a local administration, a factory they manage their own business, or teach, create, innovate. It is they who bear the difficult task of acting as a mediating layer between the people and the ruling class. Many of them feel powerless but remain loyal to the regime.Over the past decade, however, many professionals have packed their bags and left Russia. Tens of thousands now live in Europe, North America, Ukraine, Georgia and a few Asian cities. They follow events in Russia closely, and many hope to one day go back and be involved in a post-Putin Russia. However hard the Kremlin may try to dismiss this phenomenon (with its “good riddance” messaging), Russia’s brain and talent drain is a new and genuine challenge for the regime. Behind his bombast, Putin fears a combination of both grassroots and elite mobilisation. Popular complaints can become a threat if they’re amplified by intellectuals, journalists and opposition politicians. The exceptional popularity of Navalny and his anti-corruption foundation shows a new politics in the making. The navalny website has millions of followers. A video describing the Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev’s personal wealth has been watched more than 20 million times. A significant number of Navalny’s supporters are young and fearless.Domestic social anger, civic demands, youth opposition and “temporary diasporas” may converge to create difficulties for Putin. His options would then be limited: resort to more political repression, which would keep the country in a sterile deadlock, or he could seek compromise – but that would mean taking the risk of loosening his grip on power and wealth.As it is, Putin shows no intention of leaving the Kremlin or preparing his succession, no matter the economic downsides or the discontent of the upper-middle class. There are no prominent, serious reformers in the government he appointed in May, and it’s chaired by a weakened Medvedev. Economic experts expect low growth and mounting social problems in the years to come.Ultimately, the quest for global power may not be enough to unify a fragmented society and its various elites around the strongman. Russians expect better protection against declining living standards, and many suspect the purpose of the pension reform is to ert yet more money towards military expenditure and personal enrichment. The regime tries to deflect attention from a depressed domestic economy by provoking confrontations with the west, but it is costly, unproductive and not very popular. Putin will stick to this course, though, rather than take the risk of liberalisation and accountability.Russia’s leadership, worried elites and pessimistic society are in an unstable equilibrium. The three Russias are becoming more aware of how precarious the situation is. They’re watching each other closely. Putinism as a formula for stability has run its course."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/944c83f933fa0f24ec35e8f77e1e92a1513e51c5/0_127_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=db1139f795e70a6059551a090bf080a7","title":"children abandoned after school exclusions say mps","story":"Education committee report claims too many children are punished for minor incidentsAn increasing number of children are being unnecessarily excluded from schools and “abandoned” in alternative provision (AP) which too often fails to give them the education they need to thrive, according to a cross-party committee of MPs.A critical report by the Commons education select committee said that zero-tolerance behaviour policies meant too many pupils were being punished and excluded for incidents that should be managed within the school.While they agreed a zero-tolerance approach to drugs or weapons was entirely reasonable, MPs warned schools against overreacting to minor breaches of haircut or uniform policy which led to pupils being “punished needlessly”.The report also identified a “lack of moral accountability” on the part of many schools, with there being little or no incentive to retain challenging pupils. And it called on the government to address the problem of off-rolling – where pupils are removed from the register before their GCSEs to helpschools maximise league table scores.The publication on Wednesday of the committee’s Forgotten Children report follows government statistics last week which revealed a sharp rise in the number of children excluded from state schools in England. There have been more than 40 permanent exclusions a day in 2016-17, compared with 35 a day the previous year.The education committee described the exclusion rate as “a scandal” and raised additional concerns about “alarming” increases in hidden exclusions, where pupils are kept in internal isolation on school sites or informally excluded.It also called on the government to look into whether financial pressures and accountability measures were preventing schools from providing early intervention and support, and therefore contributing to the “exclusions crisis”.“The young people who are excluded are the forgotten children,” said the Conservative MP Robert Halfon, who chairs the committee. “Many already face a host of challenges, with children in care, children in need, children with Send (special educational needs and disabilities), and children in poverty, being far more likely to end up in AP. They deserve the best possible support but often they don’t get the education that they need to thrive.”The report called for a bill of rights to ensure better support for parents and pupils who find themselves at the mercy of a system described as “a wild west of exclusions” and weighted heavily in favour of schools.“We need much better provision,” added Halfon. “With teachers being encouraged to work in AP, and we need to strip away some of the stigma by renaming pupil referral units (PRUs) and genuinely seeing them as places for education, learning and support.”Nick Gibb, the schools standards minister, said the number of children being excluded was lower than it was 10 years ago but exclusions should only ever be used as a last resort.“The rules are clear that they should always be reasonable and justified. Where pupils are excluded the quality of education they receive should be no different than in mainstream settings.“We are taking a range of actions to drive up the quality of alternative provision, and have launched an external review to look at how exclusions are used and why certain groups are disproportionally affected.”Paul Whiteman, the general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, said a decision to exclude a student was always a last resort. “School leaders need the autonomy to decide when and how to exclude students to protect the health, safety, education or wellbeing of other pupils and staff.“This is an area where prevention is better than cure, but budgets are at breaking point so many of the measures that schools take to ensure good behaviour and adequate support for pupils are under threat.”Anna Feuchtwang, chief executive of the National Children’s Bureau, said: “The vast majority of disabled children, and those with special education needs, can and should be educated in mainstream schools. Yet the steep increase in exclusions comes as schools struggle to provide appropriate support for pupils that could enable them to retain their school place.”Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “The government needs to tighten the regulation of alternative provision so every child in an alternative setting has the same educational opportunities as pupils in mainstream schools.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbf7290d3c943547eee5f58a30b5f5879420b15b/0_104_5197_3117/master/5197.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d144233e7572253f78a4a1516f62770","title":"garden photographer of the year macro winners in pictures","story":"International photographic competition, which runs in association with the Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, London, awards special prize for the best close-up images"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4580ca9c41a63fd02bf92053e7aae1faf275ff22/0_0_3109_1865/master/3109.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8bb60eee206e0ad8878ed898af0a617","title":"french girl fashion bardot hardy","story":"The classic archetype has been remixed for the Instagram era – with lace, wicker baskets and cornflowers rather than smoky eyes and smouldering GauloisesFor most viewers of the World Cup final, Brigitte Macron was not the star – she was a footnote to the footy. But, for a small, fashion-conscious minority she stole the show. Brigitte, in skinny black trousers, oversized blouse, with artfully déshabillé hair, eyeliner and even more artfully bored smoulder, she was a classic French Girl.Over the last 10 years, the French Girl has become fashion’s muse. There are books written dedicated to her style, more than 4m posts tagged #frenchgirl on Instagram and endless articles on how to get various components of the look – from the hair to the under-eye circles to the jeans.Even if you object to the fact that she has remained a girl rather than a woman throughout her reign, there is little doubt the French Girl look is seductive. It is thanks to her that you own a Breton top and ballet flats and wonder if you have the “right” micellar water in your bathroom.Macron’s look is the familiar blue-chip version – the one usually accompanied by an unfiltered Gauloises cigarette, coffee and conversation about Simone de Beauvoir. But fashion has moved on – and it is all thanks to Instagram. In the social media age the French Girl has swapped her detached cool for a carefree smile and windswept hair. She is often to be found on the Riviera, sauntering around a cobbled town with a wicker basket full of artisan brie and cornflowers, or in a sun-dappled meadow. She is wearing a white broderie anglaise or lace blouse and, if you’re going the whole way, a XXXXL La Bomba straw hat, made by Marseille-born designer, Simon Porte Jacquemus. Think more Brigitte Bardot or Françoise Hardy on the beach than Juliette Gréco or Catherine Deneuve on the Left Bank.Have a closer look on Instagram, though, and the French Girl phenomenon is now so popular that the birthplace of anyone wearing the look is no longer important. See American fashion blogger Leandra Medine Cohen of the Man Repeller with a different wicker bag every day, British model and editor Lucy Williams in one of those blouses and Moldovan fashion blogger Beatrice Gutu in a La Bomba, often backdropped by a beach. Anyone can do the look – even if they hail from Hampshire, like Alexa\u0026nbspChung.This broadening-out has also affected brands. There are the French ones, such as Sandro, Maje and Sezane enjoying a renaissance. But others are also peddling the look without being French at all. High street favourites such as Marks \u0026amp Spencer and Urban Outfitters play on the aesthetic. Être Cécile, which trades on cheeky Bretons, was founded by two Australians living in London. French Girl Organics is a skincare brand based in Seattle. And Réalisation Par – the label behind this summer’s most-desired, and trés insouciant, leopard-print skirt – was also created by two Australians, and comes complete with that all-important accent in its branding, and a name that translates as “styled by”.Of course, this look owes an awful lot to the ultimate non-French, French Girl, Jane Birkin. Thanks to a love affair with Serge Gainsbourg, she was transplanted from London to Cannes in the 70s, and became a style icon for her basket, jeans and annoyingly perfectly imperfect hair. But even Birkin didn’t start it. She joins New York-born Josephine Baker finding a home in Paris in the 20s, and Iowan Jean Seberg in Jean-Luc Godard’s A Bout de Souffle in 1960 in the timeline of non-French French Girls. Because even if its latest home is on social media, the whole French Girl thing is timeworn, and links back to a universal, aspirational nonchalance. “All the Parisian women want the others to believe that she just woke up and is effortlessly beautiful in 10 minutes,” says Sézane’s founder, Morgane Sezalory. “Of course, it’s not true.”Beyond this little blanc lie, there are, of course, problems with this muse – she is, typically, thin, white and, as the name suggests, not allowed to age. But perhaps this shift to a sort of everywoman means the French Girl ideal is becoming more inclusive. Interestingly, though, she is no longer the only contestant in the fashion Miss World. Scandi style is almost equally as fetishised – with the requisite books and Instagram posts. A summer-in-Positano Italian Girl – sorry, Woman– is the latest muse to arrive on the scene. With Birkin now a familiar reference, Sophia Loren and Claudia Cardinale feel fresh. We will soon be trying to replicate their big hair, lowcut floral dresses and neckerchiefs. Beyoncé already is.

Or rather balm for your sunburn.The heatwave has created a need for cooling off that extends beyond a cold shower – and so the current trend for coldness in the world of wellness, beauty and exercise feels timely given that for years it’s been all about Bikram yoga, hot-cloth cleansing and saunas. But is this penchant for the cold more than a whim? Or is it simply the latest fad to be commodified by the wellness industry?Extolling the virtues of being cold is actually nothing new. Cold bathing, ground-zero of the movement, dates back to Hippocrates, with the proposed benefits as murky as any plunge pool – cold showers purport to increase circulation, reduce stress, kickstart your immune system and release endorphins as well as cooling you down. I started finishing my hot shower with an icy blast after a friend who takes cold showers every morning told me he had never felt better. Parking the science for a moment, the benefits were clear from the off. It follows the theory set by the French epigrammist Nicolas Chamfort: “a man should swallow a toad every morning to be sure of not meeting with anything more revolting in the day ahead”. In short, it’s rooted in unpleasantness but that’s precisely why you do it the rest of the day is a breeze from there.Even cold yoga is carving out a similar niche. Brrrn, a new fitness studio in Manhattan, which opened in May, has a yoga class performed in 16C (61F), as well as setting its gym temperature at 7C (45F). At Frame in London, yoga classes are now routinely taken with the door open, where the emphasis used to be on retaining heat.And then there are ice-rollers, designed to help de-puff your skin and reduce redness, although an ice cube may well also do the trick. “I’m reluctant to say coldness will actually change your skin, but it’s obviously pleasant to have cold things on your face,” says the skin expert Dr Mervyn Patterson. “And you could argue that if you have swelling under the eye, a cold compress might help.”In many ways, it feels like a fad. The wellness industry has blown up exponentially in the past few years – and dichotomising consumers and changing trends are good for business. There are those that follow an eight-step cleansing routine. And those who pride themselves on paring it all down and going back to nature.If this explosion feels out of step with feminist discourse – all the lotions and potions that are packaged, however covertly, towards making a “better you” – then it is possible coldness has sprung from the same well that being cold is the pinnacle of a pared down, natural – even macho – wellness. Wim Hof, the Dutch wellness guru, has a cult-like status for suggesting cold-body therapy is the key to good health.We will be sorry when the heatwave has gone, of course. But until that day comes, until the grass turns green and the sea returns to its icy norm – until this heatwave is over – thank goodness coldness is all the rage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5555deb3fa3846fa39ca945f3afd31433fd4e94/0_7_1546_928/master/1546.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d11d782c195338a2c4aeb83d5fc253bd","title":"judi dench timothee chalamet lineup toronto film festival amandla stenberg","story":"Dench plays a former Soviet agent in Red Joan, Chalamet is Steve Carell’s son in Beautiful Boy, while Amandla Stenberg heads the cast of The Hate U GiveTimothée Chalamet, Judi Dench and Amandla Stenberg will be among the names packing the red carpet at the Toronto film festival in September, it has been revealed, after the festival announced the first batch of its lineup on 24 July.Although the festival cancelled its traditional press conference after the shooting in the city on 23 July, the list of titles for its two headline sections, galas and special presentations, were released. Chalamet will star alongside Steve Carell in Beautiful Boy, about a father helping his son deal with methamphetamine addiction Dench will play Joan Stanley, a retired scientist and former Soviet agent, in Red Joan, a film inspired by the real life story of Melita Norwood and Stenberg has been cast as the lead of The Hate U Give, an adaptation of Angie Thomas’s novel revolving around the police killing of an African American teenager.All three films will be given a gala screening at the festival, and are world premieres although the jostling between the three biggest autumn film festivals – Toronto, Venice and Telluride – means the picture is not entirely clear. Two of Toronto’s most high-profile selections are definitely not world firsts: A Star Is Born, the latest remake of the classic story with Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga, and First Man, the Neil Armstrong biopic starring Ryan Gosling and directed by Damien Chazelle, both receive their world premieres at Venice. Widows, the Steve McQueen-directed remake of the Lynda La Plante 80s TV series, is billed as a world premiere, but may screen at Telluride (which runs a week before Toronto) like McQueen’s previous feature, 12 Years a Slave, as may If Beale Street Could Talk, Barry Jenkins’ follow-up to the Oscar winning Moonlight.Among the other world premiere screenings are High Life, a science-fiction thriller about a group of convicts sent into space, directed by Claire Denis and starring Robert Pattinson the Emilio Estevez-directed The Public, about a sit-in at a library, and Michael Winterbottom’s India-set The Wedding Guest, starring Dev Patel.Toronto has also avoided the conflict with the streaming giants that dogged Cannes earlier in the year. The gala section has two films from Netflix – The Land of Steady Habits, a drama about a retiree who decides to ditch his family, starring Ben Mendelsohn and Edie Falco, and The Kindergarten Teacher, the American remake of an Israeli film about a precocious pre-schooler and his teacher – and two from Amazon – the aforementioned Beautiful Boy and Life Itself, a Spanish-American family drama starring Oscar Isaac.The special presentations lineup contains a string of much-lauded films already premiered elsewhere, such as the Paweł Pawlikowski 1940s-set romance Cold War, Nadine Labaki’s fable of Lebanese child anger Capernaum, Hirokazu Kore-eda’s family-thief drama Shoplifters, and the Colette biopic starring Keira Knightley. Toronto is also likely to see the North American premieres of a number of heralded but as-yet unseen films: Sunset, the Hungarian drama from Sun of Saul director László Nemes Maya, from Things to Come’s Mia Hansen-Løve, and The Sisters Brothers, the first English-language film from Rust and Bone’s Jacques Audiard. Also screening will be the much delayed White Boy Rick, the informer thriller directed by ’71’s Yann Demange, and Where Hands Touch, a wartime romance from A United Kingdom’s Amma Asante, and also starring Stenberg.• The Toronto international film festival runs from 6 to 16 September."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a6d84003b3e920e34fb9875e1d16edde0fbf4d88/56_0_1665_999/master/1665.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa7bf77fa72bb52b6d96403184d00f15","title":"mike leigh peterloo first trailer for the drama about the 19th century massacre","story":"Mike Leigh follows Mr Turner with another period film, about the killing of protesters in Manchester in 1819 that led to the founding of the The first trailer for Peterloo, Mike Leigh’s dramatisation of the bloody 1819 “Peterloo massacre” in Manchester that resulted in 15 deaths, has been released on the internet.The film arrives in the run-up to the 200th anniversary of this foundational event in modern British political history, which was the result of a cavalry detachment charging into a 60,000-strong crowd in Manchester’s St Peter’s Fields to hear speeches demanding parliamentary reform.

The Spaniard also said that the club may consider legal action.He added that the Bordeaux president, Stéphane Martin, insisted on releasing a statement confirming the deal, and that Roma were “forced” to follow suit. He then claimed that after Barcelona submitted a higher offer, Bordeaux refused to let the player travel to Rome.Monchi also stated that Roma made a new offer, but ended negotiations when asked to increase it further, “because we don’t want a bidding war”.Malcom, who can play as a winger or attacking midfielder, will undergo a medical on Wednesday but has already been announced by the club as their third signing of the summer.The Spanish champions have also brought in central midfielder Arthur from Grêmio for a reported £35.5m, and French defender Clément Lenglet from Sevilla for £31m.Malcom began his career with Corinthians and was part of the Campeonato title winning side of 2015 before moving to France in January 2016.He spent three seasons with Bordeaux, scoring 23 goals in 96 appearances, and is yet to represent Brazil at senior level.Roma have moved to quickly put the disappointment of missing out on Malcom behind them, announcing the arrival of Sweden international goalkeeper Robin Olsen for an initial €8.5m (£7.6m) fee.Olsen, who impressed with his performances as Sweden reached the World Cup quarter-finals, arrives from FC Copenhagen on a five-year contract.

Gather them up in your hands, mingle together in a colander, place upon a plate and leave to exude their juices for at least 40 minutes.Meanwhile, using a frying pan, and in four separate stages, quietly stew the onion, celery, yellow and red peppers separately, each in 1 tbsp of the oil, until softened and only just coloured. For the fifth stage, wash and dry the aubergines and similarly soften in olive oil. Place all five vegetables in a bowl and mingle together.Now add the water, vinegar, sugar, tomato puree and raisins to the frying pan. Bring to the boil and simmer for several minutes until lightly thickened and the raisins have plumped somewhat. Stir in the olives and capers and tip the entire contents of the pan into the bowl of vegetables. Gently heat the pine nuts in a dry frying pan until golden brown. Add them to the caponata, season with pepper to taste and check for salt.

Cook the beans in this, drain them, then rinse in cold water. Put more water on and cook the peas. Drain them and mix with the beans. Both peas and beans will need barely more than a couple of minutes if they are small and sweet.Make the dressing by dissolving a good pinch of salt in the juice of the lemon, then using a fork to beat in the olive oil, balsamic vinegar and a grinding of black pepper (alternatively put all the ingredients in a screw-top jar and shake).Toast the slices of bread on both sides and tear them into short pieces. Drizzle a little olive oil on to each one, then shake over a light dusting of sea salt.Toss the salad leaves and mint in the dressing, then add the peas, beans and cheese shavings. Tuck in the toasted ciabatta and serve.From Tender Volume 1 by Nigel Slater (Fourth Estate, £30)Serves 2Rinse 200g spinach, removing any tough stems. While the leaves are still wet, cook them for a minute or two in a pan with a tight lid, so they soften in their own steam. If you are worried about them sticking, add a tablespoon or two of water. As soon as the spinach has wilted, plunge it into a bowl of iced water to stop it cooking, squeeze it dry with your hands, then roughly chop it. Bring a pan of water to the boil then add 125g sugar snap peas, let them cook for 2 minutes then remove and drain them.Bring a large pan of water to the boil, salt it, then cook 200g bucatini or other thin pasta for about 9 minutes till just tender, and drain.Cut 1 large courgette into thick slices and then into quarters. Melt 30g butter in a shallow pan then add 2 tbsp olive oil. Fry the courgette for 3 or 4 minutes until it starts to colour, then add the spinach leaves and the cooked sugar snaps. Roughly chop a small bunch of parsley and add it to the vegetables.Pour 25ml double cream into the vegetables and combine it gently. Let it simmer for a minute then pour it over the drained pasta and toss together gently. Garnish with lemon and pass round a bowl of grated vegetarian Italian hard cheese. The filling is also delicious on its own, as a vegetarian rice topping.

Transfer to a lightly floured work surface and gently knead for 1 minute, adding a little flour if needed, until soft and malleable. Wrap in clingfilm and leave to rest in the fridge for 30 minutes.Place a large lidded sauté pan on medium–high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of oil and, once hot, add the curry powder, caraway seeds, mustard seeds and cardamom. Cook for just a few seconds, stirring and making sure the spices don’t burn, before adding the onion, chilli and thyme. Cook for another 4 minutes, add the garlic and cook for another minute, stirring. Add the potato, carrot and parsnip, stir and then pour in the stock. Reduce the heat to medium, cover and cook for 5 minutes. Add the squash, sugar, ¾ teaspoon of salt and a generous grind of black pepper, and continue to simmer, covered, for 10 minutes, stirring from time to time, until the vegetables are cooked through and most of the liquid has evaporated: you should have about 3 tablespoons of liquid left add a little water if needed. Uncover, remove from the heat and set aside to cool totally before stirring in the cheese and coriander.Preheat the oven to 200Cgas mark 6.Use the remaining oil to brush the sides and bases of an extra-large 6-hole muffin tin (each hole should be 6cm wide and 4cm deep). Line the bases with circles of baking parchment and place the tin in the fridge. Roll out the pastry 2–3mm thick, cut out 6 circles, 14cm in diameter, and press down into the tin. Trim the edges, reusing the spare pastry to roll out for a second time. Cut out 6 more circles, 8cm in diameter – these will form lids.Fill each pie with about 120g of filling, brush the rims with egg and place the lids on top. Pinch the edges together securely, brush the lids with the remaining egg and prick each pie with a fork in a few places. Allow to rest in the fridge for 10 minutes. Place in the oven and bake for 30–35 minutes, until golden-brown. Remove from the oven and set aside for 5 minutes before serving warm or at room temperature.From Plenty More by Yotam Ottolenghi (Ebury Press, £27)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f12aa9f2a75145e4bf16a09c7125f5ef51d3a1c8/3_0_10661_6400/master/10661.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d595165f05204b9d5773587893919f76","title":"fish oil hype health planet supplements study no benefit","story":"Omega-3 is one of our favourite supplements – but a huge new study has found it has little or no benefit for heart health or strokes. How did it become a $30bn business?The omega-3 industry is in a twist. Again. Last week, Cochrane, an organisation that compiles and evaluates medical research for the general public, released a meta-analysis – a study of studies – to determine whether or not omega-3 pills, one of the world’s most popular dietary supplements, reduced the risk of coronary heart disease. After comparing 79 trials involving 112,059 people, the researchers could find “little or no difference to risk of cardiovascular events, coronary heart deaths, coronary heart disease events, stroke or heart irregularities”.I can’t say that I was particularly surprised. Over the past 15 years, more than 20 studies have shown a similar lack of effect. But what does surprise me is how we continue to look at the world of fish and seafood through the amber lens of a fish oil capsule. Omega-3s do something in our bodies – and probably something important. But without the larger context of the marine organisms that contain them, omega-3s get lost in the noise of human metabolism and modern marketing.The confusion arises in part from the historical baggage of fish oil and the $30bn (£23bn) industry associated with omega-3 extraction. Once upon a time, fish oil solved a major human health problem. But it had nothing to do with coronary heart disease. During the Industrial Revolution, a disease became increasingly prevalent throughout northern Europe: rickets. Malnourished children in sunlight-poor urban slums often ended up bowlegged by adolescence. Researchers eventually pieced the puzzle together and concluded that the disease was caused by a deficiency in vitamin D, which the body naturally generates in the presence of sunlight. And, as it turned out, vitamin D is stored in high amounts within the liver of codfish.A Norwegian pharmacist named Peter Möller seized upon this finding (and many other anecdotal stories about the curative properties of cod-liver oil). Using a patented chemical process, he arrived at a product that, he announced to the world, “didn’t taste fishy”. Möller and his advertising team then launched a campaign to institutionalise the regular use of cod-liver oil, regardless of whether you were at risk of rickets or not. The campaign was a success: a spoonful a day became common practice. Möller built his company into an international presence and died in 1869 with 70 cod-liver oil steam factories to his name, churning out 5,000 barrels of the stuff a year. By the time omega-3s started to be a focus of medical research, there was already a rosy feeling around fish oil.In the early 1970s, the chemist Hans Olaf Bang read in a Danish journal that there were extremely low incidences of cardiovascular disease in Inuit communities of Greenland. He and his assistant, Jørn Dyerberg, travelled to Uummannaq on the north-west coast of Greenland to investigate. At the time of the expedition, Bang didn’t quite know what he wanted to test for. They probed and palpated 130 local people, measured height and weight, and came home with a lot of blood.“We had these 130 precious samples of blood,” Dyerberg told me in his lab in Copenhagen recently. They estimated that in 20 years, the traditional Inuit diet would have changed to the western diet, and Dyerberg remembers Bang saying: “‘There will never be anyone who can do this again, so let’s do whatever we can!’ And we decided to do fatty acid analysis.”The result of their analysis was a hypothesis that is an exemplary “association study”. In an association study, multiple factors are logged and a hypothesis of correlation is drawn from the findings. In the case of the Bang and Dyerberg Inuit study, they found that: 1) Inuit people in Greenland had a diet high in omega-3 fatty acids and blood lipid levels of omega-3s much higher than their western contemporaries. 2) Inuit people also had, according to public health records, markedly lower rates of coronary heart disease. They hypothesised that therefore 3) omega-3s might reduce the risk of coronary heart disease.This was backed up by further laboratory studies that did show, in vitro, that omega-3s were involved in anti-inflammatory reactions. But – and this is a big but – while correlations abound for omega-3s and heart disease, the real trouble has always been in showing causation. That is where this latest round of studies comes in.The Cochrane study and the others that preceded it have one thing in common: they are meta-analyses of “randomised control trials” (RCTs). That is, trials where patients are given a supplement at random and tracked over time against another set of patients given a placebo. Most statisticians consider these trials to be the very top of the evidence pyramid. But it is these studies that have at times proven troublesome for Omega World. Each time RCTs come to light that show little or no effect, Omega World tends to blend its counterargument with evidence from association studies because, as a recent industry reply to the Cochrane report put it, “it’s all connected”.When it then turns to the RCTs, the industry, as would be expected, looks for different explanations as to why positive health outcomes weren’t reported. In the burst of RCTs preceding Cochrane, the Omega World line was that these most recent trials did not show benefits because things such as statins, stents and other forms of cardiovascular intervention masked the anti-inflammatory effect of fish oil pills earlier RCTs had shown a fairly significant effect, but none of those treatments existed at the time of those trials.The industry also, and I believe rightly, pointed out that studies often failed to look at omega-3 blood lipid levels before and after supplementation. In other words, it’s not really a fair trial if you don’t know where the patients started with respect to the omega-3 levels in their blood. If we only measure effect without looking at omega-3 levels in the blood at the outset, aren’t we doing the dietary equivalent of testing how far a car can drive without checking how much petrol is in the tank at the start?With Cochrane, the latest industry argument is that the study’s authors cut out a number of different forms of cardiac ailments, thus skewing the stats. In particular, it notes that Cochrane failed to include “sudden cardiac death” and “sudden cardiac mortality” in its list of outcomes. Since nearly half of all patients first report heart disease to their doctors by suddenly dropping dead, this is not an insignificant exclusion.But the fact that the industry’s arguments shift with each new, damning meta-analysis gives you pause. What is going on? Is there an international conspiracy to discredit omega-3s? Or does Omega World keep moving the goalposts? When I posed this question to Ellen Schutt, the executive director of the Global Organization for EPA and DHA Omega-3s, probably the world’s most prominent omega-3 advocacy organisation, she made it seem as if the problem didn’t even exist. “As a matter of fact, we track media sentiment … and have found many more positive omega-3 stories than negative, in general. Of course, the negative stories are the ones that catch people’s attention. As we both know, negative stories are much more interesting and the media is definitely guilty of sensationalist ‘clickbait’ headlines such as: ‘Omega-3s don’t work.’”As sympathetic as I am to the trials of Omega World, as studies continue to poke holes in aspects of the omega-3 cardiovascular argument, I can’t help thinking there is something else going on. Because, while the fish oil supplement business is a big deal, it is also a sheen on the surface of a much deeper pond. Long before omega-3 supplements became popular, an industry arose that used the same omega-3-rich creatures not for medicine, but for an odd array of agricultural and industrial purposes.Ultimately, it was this so-called “reduction industry” that created the oily-fish extraction system that now consumes millions of tonnes of marine wildlife every year. Today, one in every four kilograms of fish caught is reduced into oil and meal and used for agriculture, land animal husbandry and, most recently, fish farming, AKA aquaculture. The reduction industry has appeared in different forms under different ownership over centuries of human history. In the 18th century, it targeted whales, reducing northern hemisphere cetacean populations into isolated pockets of endangered species in order to make lamp oil and lubricants. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, it shifted to the southern hemisphere, reducing 390,000 of the 400,000 great whales that once roamed the Southern Ocean to margarine, nitroglycerine and other “marine ingredients”.Each decade brings a different use for all those anchovies. In the 1940s, they were used for fertiliser. In the 50s and 60s, chicken feed. In the 70s, pet food and pig feed. In the 80s and 90s, aquafeed for salmon and other carnivorous fish. And now, the most elite product of the reduction industry: dietary supplements.And it is not just Peruvian anchoveta that are reduced into fish meal and oil. All told, the reduction industry removes from the ocean 20m-25m tonnes annually – the equivalent of the combined weight of the population of the United States. The omega-3 industry argues that some vendors are turning to much more sustainable options, such as algae-based omega-3s and fish oil reclaimed from recycled byproducts.Nevertheless, the reduction industry marches on into new territory. Most recently, it has begun targeting Antarctic krill, the keystone prey species of the entire Antarctic ecosystem. Two years ago, when I asked the then chief executive of the largest krill extractor in the world why it had launched a $200m fishing operation in the Southern Ocean to take food out of the mouths of whales, he noted that krill oil is a “phospholipid” and making it much more “bioavailable” means that consumers can take a much smaller pill. Why was this important? Consumers who chose krill oil over fish oil would be much less likely to suffer the horrors of a fishy burp.Amid all the conflicting reports, there is one bit of data that shines out: fish and seafood can bring considerable health and environmental benefits. Fish, in addition to providing us with omega-3s, delivers protein with far fewer calories than meat: 100g of salmon contains 139 calories and 23g of protein. By comparison, 100g of beef contains 210 calories and 20g of protein.Harvesting wild fish from well-managed stocks requires a fraction of the carbon as farming terrestrial livestock. Similarly, fish farming puts a lesser burden on the Earth in terms of carbon and freshwater use than pretty much any form of terrestrial animal husbandry. We could make the farming of fish even more carbon- and resource-efficient if we used alternative ingredients for fish food based on algae and food waste. And if you consider growing “filter feeders” such as mussels, clams and oysters, the benefits are even more extreme. These bivalves don’t have to be fed anything, and make water cleaner even as they grow fatter. They provide protein 30 times more efficiently than cattle.Is the epidemiological evidence for fish-eating better than simply taking a fish oil pill? Again, we are stuck with the problem of correlation versus causation. It is very difficult to feed someone a fish in such a manner that they don’t know they are eating a fish. Hence an RCT of seafood-eating hasn’t really ever been done. Most of the studies around seafood are association studies. And, while one such study associated eating fish twice a week with a possible reduction in mortality of 55,000 lives a year, we don’t know what a fish-eater does with the rest of their life beyond eating fish.But what we do know is this: the omega-3 industry and the reduction industry that bred it removes fish from the water in a way that doesn’t put protein on our plates – it just puts pills in our cupboards.

My question is – can the amount in the Isa solely be used for the deposit payment, or can I also use it for legal and survey fees during the purchase without forgoing any of the bonus?If it’s the latter, it would be worth me transferring another £1,000 into the account to maximise the further £250 bonus available this tax year.

As to whether it would be a good idea, it depends on whether you need the £1,000 for your legal and survey fees.So you are right, to avoid a penalty on your withdrawal – which your lifetime Isa manager is required to pay directly to your conveyancer or solicitor rather than to you – all of it must be used for the deposit.You wouldn’t have been able to use any lifetime Isa money to pay stamp duty either.

However, he acknowledged that it would work with the food industry to ensure that a no-deal outcome would not disrupt supply.“We will look at this issue in the round and make sure that there’s adequate food supplies,” Raab told the Brexit select committee. “It would be wrong to describe it as the government doing the stockpiling … of course the idea that we only get food imports into this country from one continent is not appropriate.”While Raab emphasised that he viewed the risk of disruption to food supplies as minimal, his description of the government’s contingency planning will alarm those who fear that the UK will crash out of the EU without a deal.His admission follows Theresa May’s instruction that no-deal planning be stepped up after the Chequers summit, in part to show Brussels she was serious about leaving without a deal. The chancellor has already set aside £3bn for contingency planning.Also on Tuesday, health secretary Matt Hancock told MPs that the Department of Health and Social Care is working with industry to stockpile drugs, medical devices and supplies, with the focus on medicines with a short shelf-life that may need to be flown in if there is disruption at British ports.“We are working right across government to ensure that the health sector and the industry are prepared and that people’s health will be safeguarded in the event of a no-deal Brexit,” Hancock said.He said he was “confident” that a deal could be reached but added that it was “responsible” to prepare for a range of outcomes. Over the coming weeks, the government will unveil about 70 other contingency measures issuing advice, some of it likely to be alarming, to households and businesses on how to prepare for crashing out.The UK is hoping to reach a deal with Brussels on withdrawal by October, but the compromise proposals agreed by the cabinet are so far finding little support in Brussels or in parliament, increasing the likelihood of leaving without a deal.Transport officials are considering transforming the M26 in Kent into a lorry park for hundreds of HGVs to help cope with tailbacks from the port of Dover when up to 10,000 lorries a day suddenly need customs checks to enter the EU.There have also been suggestions that the Ministry of Defence has been looking into how the armed forces could be deployed to carry out various civil functions, including using RAF jets to transport food supplies across the country.Last week, Amazon became the latest in a growing list of businesses to express its concerns, when its UK boss warned the Brexit secretary that Britain would face “civil unrest” within weeks of leaving the EU without a deal.During sometimes terse questioning from MPs, Raab admitted there were some risks in the short-term from leaving without a deal but that the UK had “huge amounts going for it” and its “best days lie ahead”.He told MPs: “I’m not quite as pessimistic as some others, when I look to the medium and longterm. There’s no doubt that we would have to look at the uncertainty that we’d face in the short term.“I’m not going to wallow in pessimism about the state of this country in relation to Brexit. We’re going to go into these negotiations with economic confidence and political ambition. I’m not going to allow us to be cowed in a corner afraid of our own shadow.”Raab said that he would not “drip feed” information on planning for a no-deal Brexit but would instead rely on the series of technical notices over the summer to explain what the government was doing to mitigate risks to households and business.Brexit minister Martin Callanan was dismissive of food stockpiling claims: “It seems to me to be a fairly ridiculous scare story. There are many countries outside of the European Union that manage to feed their citizens perfectly satisfactorily without the benefit of EU processes.”What is the withdrawal and implementation bill?Officially known as the European Union (withdrawal agreement) bill, this will be the primary piece of legislation to enact the agreement the UK secures to leave the EU, and the ensuing transition period.What will it cover?That depends on what the final deal is. A white paper published on Tuesday mainly takes in areas already dealt with by the initial agreement with the EU – reciprocal citizens’ rights, the transition period, and the orce bill.When will the bill be introduced?Only after parliament has approved the deal negotiated with the EU. It must then be passed before 29 March 2019, so the withdrawal agreement has legal effect.What did we learn from the white paper?Dominic Raab, the new Brexit secretary, reiterated his warning the UK could withhold the £39bn final settlement if the EU fails to agree a trade deal. He also said there would be “no wholesale removal of rights of EU nationals” if there was no deal. He also said the implementation bill would reinstate parts of the European Communities Act – which first took the UK into the then common market – which is being repealed by the EU Withdrawal Act, so EU law can still apply during the transition.However, a cross-party business committee warned last month that failure to secure a free trade deal with the EU would be “disastrous” for Britain’s £28bn processed food and drink industry, while reverting to World Trade Organisation rules would have a “seismic” impact on the UK’s largest manufacturing sector.Germany foreign minister, Heiko Maas, said in an interview published on Wednesday the British government needed to get moving in Brexit negotiations. He told the Funke group of newspapers: In order for the departure to be carried out in as orderly a way as possible, the British government will need to move.” He added: “On the one hand on the issue of the border between Northern Ireland and EU member the Irish Republic, and, secondly, on the unided internal market, where Britain cannot cherrypick.”Maas made clear the time pressure was on the UK, saying: “We won\u0027t enter any deals that would be to the detriment of Europe.Meanwhile, the government sought to reassure businesses, universities and local organisations that any funding they secure through the EU, until the end of 2020, will be guaranteed by the government in the event of a no deal.Just hours after the government published its white paper on withdrawing from the EU, and as Raab appeared in front of the MPs, May announced she was taking back control of negotiations with Brussels from her new Brexit secretary.May said she would now lead the crunch talks with the EU while Raab, who was appointed two weeks ago, would be left in charge of domestic preparations, no-deal planning and legislation.The move was swiftly characterised as a “sidelining” of the Brexit secretary by No 10’s Europe unit, led by May’s chief Brexit adviser, Olly Robbins, with the prime minister also taking fewer than 50 officials from his department.Raab described the move as a “shifting of the Whitehall deckchairs” but said it was primarily about establishing “one team, one chain of command”.The Brexit secretary confirmed the government was prepared to make further concessions to reach a final deal – but warned there were limits to what the UK would accept and stressed the EU should take the offer seriously.“Of course it’s a negotiation, there’s no point saying there isn’t,” he said. “It would be too crude to say ‘meets the EU halfway’ but certainly is mindful of the considerations they have got.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b7881cbca3f1f9ba9a10b728204f71ff5a08bae/0_28_1682_1009/master/1682.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=513b8f43760354be425557cdab22b96e","title":"it dawns on raab hes now below the four pot plants in the food chain","story":"Brexit secretary didn’t initially seem aware of his demotion as he appeared before committeeMinutes after the prime minister had announced she was downgrading his Brexit department to little more than a Jobcentre Plus office for otherwise unemployable MPs, Dominic Raab found himself in front of the Brexit select committee.The news didn’t immediately appear to have been passed on to the new Brexit secretary who bounced into the room with the swagger of someone who was fairly confident he was a wee bit brighter than his predecessor. A little knowledge can be a dangerous thing. Being one step ahead of David Davis is still being several steps behind everyone else.The committee chair, Hilary Benn, looked embarrassed to confront Raab with the realities of his demotion and began the session by treating him as if he was still a cabinet minister. A kindness. Could he explain why everyone but him and a few other hardline Brexiters thought that a no-deal outcome would be an economic disaster for the UK?He couldn’t. Raab is a natural middle manager who can’t quite believe he hasn’t been made chief executive, and started babbling nonsense he had picked up from the assertiveness training module on a company away day. Everyone else was wrong because they were wrong and he was right. There were too many people talking Britain down. What was needed was a bit of mindless cheerfulness. Or cheerful mindlessness.The more Raab tried to explain how well he had mastered his brief, the more depressed the members of the committee became. He could offer no real sector-by-sector analysis of the effect of not having a common rulebook for banking and services because, although the department might once have considered the economic impact, their findings had got locked in a cupboard and no one could find the key. But he did hope to publish 70 different sectoral no-deal reports some time over the next six months.Benn looked over his glasses. He wanted to check that Raab realised the UK was supposed to be close to finalising the negotiations in October. Wasn’t there a danger that some of the analysis would be published far too late to be of any use? Raab nodded his head enthusiastically. He certainly hoped so. That way no one would ever bother to read them and find out they had never been of any value.There was one piece of good news, though. Raab was delighted to report that a few out-of-date tins of John West tuna had been stockpiled in Felixstowe so there were adequate supplies of food for at least a few days in the event of no deal. And in any case, everyone would be so thrilled that Brexit might turn out to be a tremendous success in 50 years’ time or so that they wouldn’t mind starving to death while they waited.At this point, the committee could no longer delay the inevitable. Someone had to point out to Raab that he was a minister in name only and that it was Theresa May and the man sitting next to him who were basically in charge. Raab was really there to carry the bags and put Post-it notes in the relevant pages of the files. The Tory John Whittingdale volunteered to take one for the team and put him right.“Aren’t you in effect the minister?” he said to Olly Robbins, the top civil servant who is the only person Theresa May believes has an outside chance of negotiating the least damaging deal for the UK.“Oh no,” said Robbins urbanely. He was far more powerful than that. Please don’t confuse him with a common or garden cabinet minister who knew next to nothing. About anything. Robbins then went on to talk the committee through the Chequers deal. It was completely untrue that the cabinet hadn’t been informed of the second white paper that he had written. Not that it was a white paper or that he had written it. Rather it had mysteriously appeared out of the ether and ministers had failed to notice it.By now, it had finally dawned on Raab that he was nothing more than a glorified bag carrier. And he didn’t like it. “We are one team and there is one chain of command,” he snapped, his back ramrod straight. Indeed there was a chain of command. And he was right at the bottom of it. Below the prime minister. Below Robbins. Below even the Four Pot Plants.“There, there,” said Robbins soothingly as they left together. “If you play your cards right, you’re definitely in with a shout of winning ‘most improved manager of the month’ at the south-west regional awards dinner.” Because he’s worth it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/017aee012f933fa1feeef44c0ad49d17b53e2225/82_0_1735_1041/master/1735.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26ca013fad8cdceb0a0fd7ddadb7b1ae","title":"labour and lib dems may suspend pairing deals after tory breach","story":"Two opposition parties hold talks about suspending pairing arrangements after recessLabour and Liberal Democrat whips have met to discuss suspending pairing arrangements for absent MPs when the House of Commons returns in September, the  understands.The two parties held talks in recent days about a possible suspension, but no agreement has been reached. Last week the Conservatives’ chief whip, Julian Smith, prompted a bitter row when he told his paired MPs to breach Commons voting conventions in knife-edge Brexit votes.The majority of MPs refused the request, which has been acknowledged by party sources, and only the Conservative chair, Brandon Lewis, went through the voting lobbies. Lewis was paired with the Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson, who was on maternity leave. He later apologised to her for the breach, as did Smith, and both said it should not have occurred.Pairing is a convention that allows MPs to cancel out each other’s votes when they must be away from the Commons. Tory sources have conceded it was an error to ask Lewis to break his pair.Labour sources said the party had not ruled out suspending the arrangements when parliament returns in September. A number of close votes are coming up in the autumn, including the final vote on any Brexit deal and on the withdrawal and implementation legislation.In the key vote last Tuesday when Smith asked MPs to break their pairs, the government won by six votes. Other votes that week were won with majorities of as small as three.A Labour source said the party was not ruling out any option from September. Another said it would not be fair to spring the change before a key vote and that the party would want to be clear in advance that it would not pair its MPs.Another senior Labour figure cast doubt on the effectiveness of such action, pointing out the party has three MPs either pregnant or currently on maternity leave – Laura Pidcock, Cat Smith and Holly Lynch – as well as a number of others with serious medical conditions or ongoing personal circumstances. The Lib Dem chief whip, Alistair Carmichael, confirmed his party was actively considering suspending pairing, though he said he was torn because it was the only way for the party to provide satisfactory maternity cover for Swinson. “There will have to be some step taken by the Tories, beyond what they have said already, for the system to work again,” Carmichael said. “I have had an apology but I also need an explanation. I cannot countenance ruling out suspending pairing until I get a better one than the government has offered so far.”No decision is expected to be taken until after the summer recess. A suspension of pairing would be difficult for both the government and opposition but would be likely to cause more trouble for the government, which regularly pairs ministers when they are away on official business.Labour and the Lib Dems would not be the first parties to withdraw from pairing arrangements. The SNP has a long-term policy that it does not make such deals. Theresa May’s Commons majority narrowed even further on Tuesday as MPs voted to suspend the DUP MP Ian Paisley for 30 days after he failed to declare two family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government. He will be absent for some of the key Brexit votes.The DUP has a confidence-and-supply arrangement with the government for its 10 MPs to support the Conservatives on important legislation.MPs voted in favour of a motion to suspend Paisley proposed by the Commons leader, Andrea Leadsom, after a ruling from the parliamentary commissioner for standards.May’s deputy, David Lidington, has promised the government will call a debate on proposals for proxy voting for new parents in September, which could lead to absent MPs being allowed to designate a colleague to vote on their behalf rather than abstain with a pair."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4916076fcc744963809f30738296f8369d23dcce/0_316_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=82effc5845c0035014b7215ee71877e6","title":"pictish coppersmith 1000 year old handprint found in orkney","story":"Metalworker would have plied his trade from small, half-buried circular stone structure, say archaeologistsThe grimy handprint of a sweaty metalworker and the smeared track of his dirty knees have been uncovered by archaeologists more than 1,000 years after the fires went out in his copper workshop on an island in Orkney.It would have been a hot, uncomfortable workspace: a small circular stone structure, half underground, in a substantial Pictish settlement on the island of Rousay. Archaeologists are racing against the tides, which are gradually eroding the surviving structures, to save as much evidence as possible.Stephen Dockrill, senior lecturer in archaeology at the University of Bradford, is joint leader of an excavation by staff and students working with archaeologists from the City University of New York. Dockrill said the discovery of such humbly human evidence of the structure’s former occupier took them by surprise. “Analysis of crucible fragments and the floor deposits demonstrated that a coppersmith worked in the building,” Dockrill said. “The analysis of the floor enables us to say with confidence where the smith worked, next to a hearth and two stone anvils. The biggest surprise came when we lifted the larger stone anvil and cleaned it we could see carbon imprints of the smith’s knees and hands.”Julie Bond, joint director of the excavation, said such personal evidence was an exciting discovery: “We are doing all we can to gather as much information on the site before it is destroyed by the sea. A handprint is so personal and inidual that you can almost feel the presence of the coppersmith and imagine what it must have been like working in there all those years ago.”The building has been dated to between the sixth and ninth centuries, but analysis of the soot may reveal more evidence of date and the materials he was working with.The coppersmith would have been almost in darkness apart from the light from his hearth. The building was reached by steps and a curving passageway, and closed off by a door: the pivot stone, door jamb and bar hole were all found intact, together with a stone set upright to protect the hearth from draughts.  The workshop was Pictish, built by a people renowned for their beautiful metalwork and stone carving. The archaeologists believe the space was deliberately darkened to enable the coppersmith to judge the state of the metal by its colour – but as the traces he left prove, it was dirty work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b3432d046354cc20d0ea47a5145ccfe9a7bcf80e/0_227_4176_2506/master/4176.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c8c49aa7cfab3362012cee8ec8d88cab","title":"ecb rejects claims 15 man teams the hundred","story":"• 11 players will continue to appear on teamsheets• ‘No final decisions’ made on beleaguered competitionThe England and Wales Cricket Board has rejected a new round of leaked reports that said the besieged 100-ball domestic competition would comprise teams of 12 or 15 active players where 11 are nominated to bat with the remainder permitted to bowl.The working group assembled to iron out the kinks of the new competition – known as the high-performance group – is chaired by Clare Connor, the ECB’s director of women’s cricket. It is understood its participants were encouraged to have a wide-ranging discussion at the beginning of the process, from which tinkering with the number of players was thrashed out.But insiders have indicated the conclusion of the conversation was that 11 players will continue to appear on teamsheets. Substitute fielders, however, could be formally brought in to assist bowling teams. A power play period comprised of just 20 balls at the start of the innings is also set to be endorsed by the group.In an effort to water down stories that made public yet more internal discussions, an ECB spokesman released a statement on Tuesday morning to confirm that “no final decisions” have been made on the city-based competition, scheduled to begin in the summer of 2020.“To develop the competition, there are a number of ongoing discussions, including within a high-performance group who are planning a series of pilot matches in September,” he added. “Ultimately, it is the Board of the ECB which makes the final decisions on the format and rules for the new competition and that is expected later this year.”“Later” is November of this year. But before the ECB board deliberates once and for all on what will be implemented, the high-performance group’s work will also need to be given the green light by the new competition’s main board, appointed in March a month before The Hundred had entered the public lexicon.The former England batsman Michael Lumb is serving as that committee’s cricket adviser a 10-person board that is also overseen by the ECB’s chairman, Colin Graves, alongside six independent directors external to the day to day running of the professional game.Last week it was revealed that the 10-ball over slated to finish the innings – originally described as adding a “fresh tactical dimension” to The Hundred – had been shelved in favour of five-ball overs bowled in pairs before changing ends each 10 deliveries.By requiring only 10 changes of end per innings, it helps prevent games taking longer than two and a half hours, the timeframe that the BBC – contracted to televise live 10 of the 38 men’s games and eight women’s fixtures in the new format – are supportive of. The players’ union, who were dissatisfied at not being consulted before the announcement of the competition in April, are also pleased to see the back of the 10-ball final set.The Professional Cricketers Association does have a formal seat on the high-performance group with its president Daryl Mitchell, the Worcestershire veteran, at the table. Andy Flower, currently the ECB’s acting director of cricket, and Paul Farbrace, assistant coach of the men’s team, are also members of the 10-person group.The model where 12 players are named with 11 nominated to bat but not field is not new in professional cricket, introduced to Australia’s domestic 50-over competition in the mid-1990s and surviving until 2003. It continues to be used widely in premier-level limited overs club cricket in that country. The logic runs that having more personnel to select from reduces the likelihood that bowlers will be required to struggle with the bat and creates more room to pick five specialist bowlers rather than requiring overs from an all-rounder."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc20960f8957285e3acdfb0626861579e427d767/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=25636af9a9c1db1a371950f3ede0eb70","title":"irelands ancient east experience its beauty on a budget","story":"With burial mounds dating back to 3,200BC, medieval castles, and centuries-old pubs, the east of Ireland is brimming with history. But you don’t need to break the bank to discover its richesIt’s no surprise that Ireland’s Ancient East casts a powerful spell over travellers. Think more than 5,000 years of history, spectacular natural scenery, dramatic ancient ruins and a rich local culture all framed by the majestic River Shannon and the rugged coastline of the Irish Sea. And, unlike many European destinations, Ireland really is a country where the best things in life are free … or, in the case of a perfect pint in a centuries-old Kilkenny pub, less than a fiver.For travellers on a budget, driving is easily the cheapest and most rewarding way to get around the country, and Ireland is a land that richly rewards travellers who get off the beaten track. Highlights for most visitors tend to be the places and faces they discover along the way that impromptu folk session in a tiny village pub, the local artist who invites them into the studio for tea, a deserted stretch of golden sand at sunrise. This makes Ireland a nation with plenty to offer visitors on a budget, particularly given that Irish Ferries services start from £79 per car – meaning that taking your car on holiday is easily the cheapest way to drive the Emerald Isle.This is an island fond of a good yarn, full of myths and legends about the epic adventures of heroes and villains, knights, kings, monks, Vikings, Celts and feuding family dynasties. Get a whole lot of history for €8 (£7) at County Kildare’s Castletown House, Ireland’s largest Palladian manor. Built for the wildly wealthy (and morally dubious) politician William Conolly, who rose from humble origins to own some 100,000 acres of land, Castletown became a symbol of his great wealth and makes for a fascinating introduction to Georgian architecture and design. Also in Kildare is the National Stud and Gardens visitors can take a guided tour of the farm and catch a glimpse of one of the equine sporting legends who call it home, such as the now-retired Hurricane Fly, one of the best hurdlers of all time. There’s also a world-renowned Japanese garden and Kids Zone to explore.To the north, in County Meath, you’ll find Newgrange, a dramatic passage tomb dating back to 3,200BC that predates the Egyptian pyramids. Mystery surrounds this large circular mound with an inner stone passageway and chambers at dawn on the winter solstice, a shaft of light from the sunrise illuminates the stone burial chamber, hinting at Newgrange’s religious significance in the past.History is never off the menu in Ireland and simply wandering the narrow lanes of Kilkenny’s Medieval Mile is a swift way to get to the heart of Ireland’s medieval capital, with Kilkenny Castle, St Canice’s Cathedral and Rothe House all in a compact quarter.No trip to Ireland is complete without nourishing the body as well as the soul, and, happily, Ireland’s Ancient East offers countless low-cost culinary delights. Ireland’s gastronomic scene is currently enjoying a resurgence, with exciting young chefs honing their craft overseas before returning to their homeland to launch pioneering new restaurants and pop-ups. The quaint harbour town of Dungarvan is a good place to start, perched at the mouth of the River Colligan in County Waterford and lorded over by the Comeragh mountains. Regular farmers’ markets and fairs showcase local suppliers, while chef Paul Flynn’s fine dining Tannery Restaurant offers a pleasingly affordable bite of Ireland. The multi-course €35 set menu is a particularly good deal.A more casual feast can be had at Foodworks in Kilkenny, which features a rotating menu of mostly local ingredients such as Irish venison, 21-day dry-aged Hereford steak and home-reared pork. Foodworks makes a particularly great feeding station before a tour of Kilkenny’s Smithwick’s brewery, which charts the 300-year heritage of Irish ale in beautiful Victorian premises.For classic Irish pub grub, make for Kyteler’s Inn in the heart of Kilkenny, where chef Margaret Kelly serves a poshed-up version of gamey Irish stew alongside plenty of beer on tap – while the occasional impromptu music session takes place in the corner. A highlight for road-tripping visitors in Ireland is the wide variety of affordable accommodation on offer, from historic village inns to grand Georgian country house estates. Springview Farmhouse was named Irish B\u0026ampB of the Year in 2017, and with prices starting from €30, this late 18th-century home, set in a working farm in County Kilkenny, makes a great budget option. Woodenbridge hotel \u0026amp lodge in the Vale of Avoca, County Wicklow, claims to be the oldest hotel in Ireland, dating back to 1608. With beautifully landscaped gardens overlooking the serene Aughrim River, just 44 miles from Dublin, it makes a great base for exploring Ireland’s Ancient East.Meanwhile, Finnstown Castle hotel is an ivy-strewn Georgian manor house set in a 45-acre estate. But don’t let the imposing architecture and grandness of the rooms fool you the pub and restaurant are beloved local haunts, making for a reliably convivial atmosphere.Explore Ireland from the comfort of your own car with Irish Ferries.

By Anna HartMain image: Durrow Viaduct, part of Waterford Greenway (Getty)Few European destinations are as culturally and historically rich as Ireland’s Ancient East, making it perfect road-trip material for travellers who crave experiences beyond the ordinary. Thanks to ferry connections at Dublin and Rosslare, it’s easy to bring your own car over from Great Britain, opening up a wealth of glorious drives through undulating hills and ancient forests. Add in stop-offs at prehistoric burial sites, spellbinding castles and characterful country pubs and it’s easy to understand why Ireland’s Ancient East is climbing to the top of the must-do lists of intrepid travellers. Here’s what not to miss …Binge on natural scenery Get a brand new profile pic at Powerscourt waterfall at the foot of the Wicklow mountains, Ireland’s highest cascade at 121 metres. It’s a scenic three-mile drive through the ancient forests of the Powerscourt estate – and look out for the giant sequoia. In Wicklow, charter boats leave regularly on dolphin-watching trips, which also showcase scenic and historic spots from a sea-based vantage point. If you’re feeling active, hire bikes and cycle the Waterford Greenway, a 28-mile bike route that traces a former rail track between Waterford and Dungarvan.Culture and creativity  For such a small nation, Ireland has a rich heritage of craft and design. The National Craft Gallery in Kilkenny’s Medieval Mile (which forms part of the Kilkenny Craft Trail) serves as a useful introduction to the Irish traditions of jewellery making, pottery, weaving and other cottage industries. The stable block at Kilkenny Castle is a working gallery and studio space, where you might catch young potters at the wheel, or meet other makers and producers.Exploring Ireland’s Ancient East by car immediately immerses you in some 5,000 years of history. Start with the Boyne valley, where you’ll find ancient burial mounds at Newgrange, Dowth and Knowth (which comprise the Brú na Bóinne Unesco world heritage site). Slane Castle and Slane Castle Distillery are worth a tour, but don’t miss Trim Castle, Ireland’s largest Anglo-Norman castle. Ireland is a country where myths and legends merge into history, and you’ll definitely want to make a pilgrimage to medieval Blarney Castle to kiss the Blarney Stone, which bestows “the gift of the gab” on all who climb the steps to press their lips upon it.Bed down in a country house hotel One of the chief pleasures of an Irish road trip is the array of elegant country house hotels to choose from, often at refreshingly affordable prices. The elegant Athenaeum House hotel in Waterford is a superb choice, a canary-yellow Georgian manor on the banks of the River Suir. In Clonmel in County Tipperary, stylish digs are found at Hotel Minella, another Georgian architectural triumph, dating back to 1863. And less than an hour from Dublin, just outside Naas, sits the stately Victorian Killashee hotel and spa, with views over the Wicklow mountains and the Kildare countryside. Irish Ferries offers three nights at the Hotel Minella with return cruise ferry for two adults and their own car, from £180 each £228 each for the Athenaeum House hotel or £226 for the Killashee hotel and spa.

In 2017, Donegal even topped National Geographic’s list of the coolest places on the planet. Anna Hart rounds up the 10 best things to do on a Donegal road trip Ireland’s most rugged and ravishing county has been a much-loved retreat for artists, bohemians, outdoorsy types and holidaying families for decades, but it’s only now that the rest of the world is waking up to the charms of traversing Donegal by car. Dramatic, secluded beaches, craggy coastlines, soaring peaks, shimmering lakes, verdant valleys and time-warp harbours – all dotted with atmospheric country pubs and quaint seafood restaurants – recently propelled this north-west county to the top of National Geographic Traveller’s Cool List. “It’s a warm-hearted place, but wilderness always feels just a stone’s throw away,” says National Geographic Traveller editor Pat Riddell. “And it is wilderness – world-class wilderness.” It’s definitely the coolest place on the planet right now if you’re a Star Wars fan. The region’s Inishowen peninsula was spectacularly showcased in Star Wars: The Last Jedi, with Malin Head being used to represent bits of Luke Skywalker’s isolated retreat, planet Ahch-To. This only added to the buzz around this long-overlooked corner of Ireland, further embellishing its hip credentials and making it the stuff of road-trip dreams. If you’re taking your car to Ireland by ferry to explore the attractions of Donegal, make sure you hop out at the following must-do spots.Sink a pint at McGrory’sUnassuming but atmospheric, 1920s family-run McGrory’s hotel in Culdaff has long been a local favourite, thanks to its open fires, a dazzling range of Irish craft beers and traditional music sessions. So much so that Daisy Ridley and the Star Wars crew had a night out there around filming, leading to a steady stream of Star Wars-struck visitors. Making the most of the welcoming atmosphere and seafood-heavy menu is now even more of a must.Swap four wheels for two While Donegal rewards road-trippers with sublime coastal scenery, isolated castles, private estates and ancient forests, it’s also a great spot to jump on a bike and blast some of that Atlantic sea breeze into your lungs. The peninsula at Horn Head, forming part of Sheephaven Bay, is perhaps the most scenic of all the Donegal peninsulas, where the cliffs rise to 180 metres (600ft) on the ocean side and provide breeding grounds for seabirds such as the European shag and razorbill. The Hornhead loop can be walked or driven, but biking is the best way to drink it all in, speeding past quartzite cliffs, mud flats, dunes and the salty New Lake area, complete with exceptional views of the Atlantic Ocean.Scale Mount ErrigalThe stark, striking quartzite mass of 751-metre Mount Errigal looms as you head east on the N56 from Gweedore. This is the tallest peak in County Donegal, and along with Mweelrea, is considered one of the most satisfying climbs in the county. Alternatively, drive to the coast and take a bracing walk at the highest sea cliffs in Europe – Slieve League. They stretch 600 metres (2,000ft) above the Atlantic Ocean at the highest point, with impressive views of the rugged coastline and Donegal Bay. Lose yourself in Letterkenny With a population of nearly 20,000, Letterkenny is Donegal’s most populous town, a confident and vibrant former market town famous for gothic-style St Eunan’s Cathedral – and its Hindu temple too. Donegal County Museum, housed in a 19th-century workhouse building, is a great place to get clued up on the county’s former industrial history, and, just south-west of town, the Newmills Corn and Flax Mills have a huge working waterwheel powered by the River Swilly.Picnic at Glenevin waterfallGlenevin waterfall is found at the top of a short hike of just over a mile through the woods in Clonmany, with nicely landscaped picnic areas, footbridges and stepping stones adding to the magic of this beautiful spot. Stock up on sandwiches, quiches and sweet treats at Claire The Bakers in Carndonagh beforehand.Explore Malin Head on the Inishowen peninsulaMalin Head, Ireland’s most northerly point, offers spectacular views, and the northernmost tip, Banba’s Crown, is one of the most photographed spots in the county. Sip a flat white from the Caffe Banba coffee truck (which also has a standalone cafe in Carndonagh) and see if you can spot scenery that made an appearance in Star Wars: The Last Jedi.Take a trip to Tory IslandTory Island, just 8.5 miles off the mainland, is an island steeped in history and folklore, where Irish is spoken and the locals elect a king, who acts as the community spokesperson. Seventy-four-year-old musician Patsy Dan Rodgers has been king for two decades now, ruling over this island of 150 inhabitants, a single road, one church, one grocery store, one lighthouse, one hostel and a social club.Surf the AtlanticThe Wild Atlantic Way is studded by tiny surf towns and beaches that have become legendary among the European surf community. Bundoran is widely considered one of the best surfing spots in Europe, and is fantastic for all kinds of water sports and horseshoe-shaped Magheraroarty Strand and sand dune-backed Ballyhiernan Bay are both suitable for windsurfing and surfing. Beginners can get to grips with the sport at Inishowen, which has some of the most consistent waves in Ireland, due to its exposure to rolling swells. Its long stretches of golden sandy beaches make for safe surfing conditions and a pleasant environment for newbies.Cook your catchCatch and cook your own dinner on a fishing trip with An Duanai Mara Boat Charters, based in the fishing town of Killybegs. On these deep-sea angling trips (combined with sightseeing trips around Donegal Bay), you’ll have the chance to reel in a cod, ling or turbot, watch the skipper fillet it, and then feast on it at nearby Kitty Kelly’s restaurant.Hike Glenveagh national parkGlenveagh national park is one of six in Ireland, encompassing some 16,000 hectares in the heart of the Derryveagh mountains. These lands were managed as a private deer forest before becoming a national park in 1975, and this is now bona fide wilderness, home to a lot of indigenous wildlife and rare plant species.Explore Ireland from the comfort of your own car with Irish Ferries.

But Dad’s Army became a TV phenomenon. We reveal how the Walmington warriors seized victoryTo explore the history of Dad’s Army, you have to enter a near-military environment. Speed bumps, vehicle checks and CCTV impede the route to the building in Caversham, Berkshire, where the paperwork about the show’s creation is stored. These levels of security are because the BBC Written Archives are housed on the grounds of BBC Monitoring, whose duties include listening to global media on behalf of MI6.But if the records of any TV show were to deserve such protective apparatus, it would be Dad’s Army, the BBC’s single most durably valuable programme. Next 31 July marks 50 years since the first episode was shown, while the last original show was screened in 1977 – but repeats still top the BBC Two ratings. The origins of this TV phenomenon are recorded in pink folders containing yellowed press cuttings, letters from viewers and internal memos typed on paper so flimsy the letter O sometimes goes right though like a bullet hole. The first documents trace the payment of £200 each to producer-director David Croft and co-writer Jimmy Perry for a script originally called The Fighting Tigers, based on the latter’s second world war experience in the Local Defence Volunteers, later called the Home Guard. Most successful British sitcoms have central characters unsuited to their profession: Basil Fawlty shouldn’t be running a hotel, Del Boy Trotter overestimates his commercial savvy, David Brent is a terrible boss. Dad’s Army set the template for this comedy of overconfident incompetents. Asked to defend Walmington-on-Sea while the real men are away, bank manager Captain Mainwaring acts out a fantasy of military command. Because the Home Guard included those too old and too young to be called up, the characters’ age-range was unusually wide: from 70-year-old Lance Corporal Jones, who has fought for the British empire in Sudan, to 17-year-old asthmatic Private Pike. The budget file for the first series shows that John Le Mesurier, as Sergeant Wilson, was initially regarded as the show’s star, and paid £209, nine shillings and sixpence, while Arthur Lowe as Mainwaring received £170 and 2 shillings. A letter from Michael Grade – later to run the BBC, ITV and Channel 4, but then a junior showbiz agent – agrees third billing and pay parity with Lowe for Clive Dunn, only 47 years old but looking twice that on screen as LCpl Jones. Ian Lavender, paid £51 and 19 shillings to play Pike, was only 22 at the time, which means he is now the only surviving member of the main cast. Lavender finds the lasting popularity of the series is “a continuous pleasant shock”. He thinks the main reason is that it was written to have universal appeal. “It surprises me that no one now seems to want to make programmes that all the family can watch,” he says. “Everything is so niche-driven: shops, films, TV. If I don’t like something, nobody cares because they say they weren’t aiming at me.” Although Dad’s Army is now regarded as the epitome of safe mainstream comedy – and often wielded as a corrective yardstick by those who find modern TV comedy too shocking – the show was considered controversial in 1968. Archived memos show that Paul Fox, controller of BBC One, was so concerned about potential offence to viewers who served in or were bereaved by the war, he ordered the removal of footage of Nazi troops and displaced refugees from the opening titles. This triggered a response from Michael Mills, BBC’s head of comedy, expressing “profound disquiet over your decision”, and complaining that the changes meant the show would no longer be able “to advance comedy output into new areas”. Fox tersely replied that he did not consider Dad’s Army to be “breakthrough territory”. Lavender says he only learned about these tensions through later books and documentaries. At the time, the cast was “unaware of any controversy”. When looking at the beginnings of a classic, the question is: “Did anyone realise?” With Dad’s Army, the TV critics mainly didn’t. Preserved in the Caversham files is the verdict of Peter Black of the Daily Mail, complaining that the first episode wasn’t “situation or character comedy, it’s only gag comedy, the easiest to write and the quickest wearing on the ear”. Michael Billington, now the ’s theatre critic but then covering TV for the Times, found the show to combine “bland sentiment and humour rather uneasily”. Yet one curling cutting in the file makes anyone who has worked as a reviewer want to stand and salute. In those days, critics phoned in reviews immediately after transmission. On that summer night 50 years ago, Ron Boyle of the  immediately declared Dad’s Army “a classic comedy series” that might even be “comedy’s finest half-hour”. The show quickly became a hit with the very audience the BBC had worried about: those with direct experience of the events it depicted. Soon after the first broadcast, a Home Guard veteran signing himself Private Huntley wrote to congratulate its makers, while many others sent in ideas (“a few funny things that happened in our village”). One even offered the loan of an “overcoat and battledress outfit”. Those early letters also reveal the cross-generational appeal that has been key to the series’ longevity. “Each of us in the house has a favourite actor,” writes a Miss Carruthers while a viewer from Helensburgh writes: “I watch with my teenage family. They know nothing of those daft days but they enjoy the programme just the same!” Five decades on, the same applies. By the third episode, screened on 14 August, the critics were catching up with public enthusiasm. The Western Mail called it “comedy of the very best sort, because it’s drawn from a rich fund of experience and not from the artificial hatching of a script conference”. As that insight suggests, the writer, Peter Tinniswood, was himself a comedy writer (I Didn’t Know You Cared, Tales from the Long Room). His review also makes a crucial point that had been overlooked by those making accusations of bad taste: he remembered the Home Guard being “a constant source of humour”. On 15 August, another distinguished comedy writer, Barry Took (The Army Game, Round the Horne) sent a note to Croft: “Dear David. I think Dad’s Army is one of the funniest shows I’ve ever seen. The scripts, casting and direction are absolutely great.”  Took’s professional eye had noted that, unusually, those three elements all involved Croft. Croft was what is now called a showrunner. That degree of inidual control can be clearly seen. As is common in British sitcom, Croft and Perry favoured catchphrases but, as director, Croft could ensure there was a double kick: first from Mainwaring’s “Stupid boy!” and then from Pike’s wounded reaction. The most famous line in the series – when a German PoW demands the young private’s name and Mainwaring snaps: “Don’t tell him, Pike!” – is funny not only verbally but also visually, due to Lavender’s panicked reaction. There was rarely time, however, to relish any particular moment, due to the pressure of studio recording. “We had a line to say,” says Lavender, “and it had to be right first time. No retakes. We were all like nervous kids as it approached, not wanting to be the one who cocked up!” Even as ratings rose, the BBC remained nervous about the show – an early episode was cancelled after the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia. But the one persistent controversy is the feeling that Dad’s Army was spoiled by “the repeated gales of inane laughter from the unseen audience”, as one viewer put it. To such complaints, Croft politely replies that, because his main actors have stage backgrounds, live studio reaction helps them to time – and to have confidence in – the jokes. That calculation reveals Croft’s perfectionism. Croft’s thoughtfulness towards his performers was not always reciprocated. Memoirs have revealed that Lowe took such a dim view of the script, he would hide it behind the rehearsal room radiator, or leave it with his driver overnight because he wasn’t prepared to have it in his house. During the shooting of the first series, Le Mesurier told fellow drinkers in the BBC bar it was “going to be a complete disaster”. Lavender, though, says they kept their doubts from the rest of the cast. “I never heard either prophesying disaster, although that was a general characteristic of Le Mesurier’s humour.”Five decades on, Lavender still has the knitted scarf his character’s mother gave him to protect his weak chest while on parade. “I was accused in one newspaper of having nicked the idea of the scarf from Tom Baker’s Doctor Who,” he says. “I think simple research will show that we were first. Deeply upsetting!” Some actors can end up feeling resentful when a role comes to define them, but Lavender has no such reservations. “I feel immensely proud to have been part of the beast. We still watch it. Not every weekend but, if we’re in, yes. We do find it funny and endearing – a pleasant reminder of a gentler time.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3457ce6d22ef0a7b9bdf4ce69b6e15158bb0e888/0_399_3843_2306/master/3843.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=19e56eefd2c1c46ff70c90ba70d314c2","title":"peaky blinders take chicago which british shows deserve a us spin off","story":"ITV’s Bletchley Circle women are relocating to 1956 San Francisco. If that works out, which other stalwarts should book a one-way ticket west?This is a big week for fans of soft reboots and relatively unheralded 2012 period dramas: the Bletchley Circle women – or at least half of them – are back. The series about a quartet of former second world war code-breakers resisting the starchy social strictures of 1950s Britain by teaming up to solve crimes has now crossed the Atlantic, with Rachael Stirling’s glam governess, Millie, and Julie Graham’s fastidious Scottish librarian, Jean, relocating to San Francisco in 1956. (“And I thought Edinburgh was hilly,” mutters Jean.)Why the abrupt transatlantic move? The plot sees the pair on the trail of a nefarious GI who, having previously strangled one of their Bletchley workmates, has apparently resumed his lethal ways in the shadow of the Golden Gate Bridge. The rather more prosaic reason is that The Bletchley Circle: San Francisco has been revived by an injection of cash from BritBox, a US streaming service specialising in repeats of old BBC and ITV shows. BritBox knows its subscribers love British accents, but are hedging their first move into original programming by guaranteeing an exciting backdrop of west-coast jazz clubs and cool, curvy cars rather than petrol rationing and the introduction of double-yellow lines. If it works, it could be the beginning of a new wave of transatlantic period drama. So what other British shows should dust off their vintage blue passports and “do a Bletchley”?Winston Graham wrote 13 Poldark novels set in Cornwall, so the latest BBC adaptation will not run out of source material any time soon. The day will come, however, when Aidan Turner hangs up his tricorn hat for good, and that might be the exact moment to pitch a Poldark prequel: something Cornish yet even more past-y. The broad outline is in the books – young Ross was arrested for brawling in 1780 and only joined the army to escape jail, ending up as a disgruntled infantryman in the American war of independence – but otherwise prequel writers could allow their imaginations to run wild. What sort of mischief did Ross get up to in 18th-century New York? What was his meet cute with loyal pal Dr Dwight? And, crucially, how did he get that scar?If Steven Knight’s world-conquering 1920s Birmingham gang saga can be adapted into a ballet it does not seem too much of a stretch to imagine a spin-off set in Chicago at the height of prohibition. Tommy Shelby currently seems to have his hands full pursuing a political career, but what if one of his henchmen lit out for the Windy City to escape prosecution at home? A hatchet-faced Brummie in a flat cap violently carving out a piece of the bootlegging action in one of the most corrupt cities in the world? Sounds like a rapid-fire hit.Christopher Timothy, Robert Hardy and Peter Davison created such a beloved chemistry on screen that to attempt to remake All Creatures Great and Small seems almost disrespectful. Better, then, to orce the series inspired by James Herriot’s autobiographical novels from its 1940s Yorkshire setting. What if, after graduating from Glasgow veterinary college, the young, eager Herriot rocked up in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1940, a city still dusting itself off from the effects of the Depression? True, pet ownership was probably not a priority for people in a city still dusting itself off from the effects of the Great Depression, but young Herriot would be required to get to grips with fearsome-looking longhorn cattle.A few narrative backflips may be required to coax Martin Shaw’s glumly principled 1960s copper from his Newcastle base all the way to Magic City, but watching him patiently operate against a glitzy backdrop of dapper mobsters, powerful mojitos and illicit gambling feels as if it would have some strong fish-out-of-water potential, especially if his impressively sideburned sidekick DS John Bacchus – a man always ready to indulge his vices – also made the trip.Julian Fellowes, the jolly Midas of period dramas, may be attempting to assemble as many original cast members as possible for his Downton movie, but it still feels like there would be plenty mileage in a US-focused spin-off, possibly centred on Lady Cora’s yacht-obsessed brother, Harold (Paul Giamatti).

Trump asks his attorney about financing when Cohen explains he will have to establish a business to buy the rights to McDougal’s story.“We’ll have to pay,” Cohen says, to which Trump appears to respond: “Pay with cash.” Because the audio is muddled, it is unclear if Trump was advocating for his attorney to pay with cash or not pay but Cohen is heard saying, “No, no.” What has Trump’s team said?The White House claimed from the beginning that Trump neither engaged in extramarital affair with McDougal and nor was he aware of any payment made to her. The response echoed the White House’s denials of an alleged affair between Trump and adult film actress Stormy Daniels, who was paid $130,000 in hush money by Cohen.The tape makes clear that Trump was at least made aware of efforts to purchase the rights to McDougal’s story. Trump’s mention of paying in cash, if proven to be his preferred method of addressing the issue, also appears to contradict statements made by Rudy Giuliani. The former New York City mayor, who joined Trump’s legal team earlier this year, claimed last week that the president sought to have the payment handled through a check so that it would be officially recorded.Giuliani also made contradictory statements about Trump and Daniels. Although Trump said he knew nothing of that payment, Giuliani said the president personally reimbursed Cohen. He later walked back his statement, but much of what Trump knew and when he knew it remains a mystery. Why is Cohen a key player?For years, Cohen acted as Trump’s personal attorney and self-confessed “fix-it guy”. A keeper of Trump’s secrets and the handler of dealings in both the president’s personal and professional life, Cohen’s loyalty proved such that he once said he would “take a bullet” for Trump.That devotion appeared to waver when Cohen became the subject of a federal criminal investigation for possible bank fraud, wire fraud and campaign finance violations. After it was revealed earlier this year that Cohen paid for Daniels’ silence about her alleged affair with Trump, a series of questionable dealings began to surface. Just before the 2016 election, Cohen set up a limited liability corporation (LLC), Essential Consultants, through which he made the payment to Daniels. He also struck a $600,000 deal with telecom giant AT\u0026ampT following Trump’s election in an apparent bid to peddle influence.Although he has not been charged with a crime, Cohen’s legal woes have made him increasingly likely to cooperate with federal prosecutors. Shifting tone, Cohen said earlier this month his only priority was his family: “My wife, my daughter and my son have my first loyalty and always will,” he said, adding: “I put my family and country first.”Where does this fit into the Russia investigation?The criminal inquiry into Michael Cohen is separate from the FBI’s investigation into Russian interference in the US election and potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. But there is potential for the two to intersect.Federal prosecutors see Cohen as a major target to flip, given his longstanding association with Trump and others in the president’s inner circle. The FBI have already seized a trove of materials during a raid on Cohen earlier this year, and any documents relevant to the Russia investigation would likely have been turned over to special counsel Robert Mueller and his team. If Cohen were to cut a deal with the US Attorney’s Office in the Southern District of New York, which is overseeing his investigation, information he provides could similarly be shared with Mueller.Cohen notably worked with Felix Sater, a Russian-born business associate of Trump’s, on an abandoned project to develop a Trump Tower in Moscow. FBI agents reportedly learned that during the process, Cohen was in frequent contact with foreign iniduals about the project — some of whom had knowledge of or were involved in the 2016 election meddling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd13726fd7da7f804f60968a58604fc24f0d87f0/17_428_4750_2852/master/4750.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=adbcce625f5ef8632dbb9569b711416e","title":"new zealand flag winston peters australia copy","story":"Acting PM further strains ties with neighbour, urging Australia to find its own designWinston Peters, the acting prime minister of New Zealand, has taken another swipe at Australia, accusing it of “copying” the New Zealand flag.Relations between the Pacific neighbours have been growing noticeably frostier since Jacinda Ardern’s leave of absence, amid Australia’s continual deportation of New Zealand citizens. Experts say the increasing tensions are fundamentally altering the once robust and “special” relationship.Peters – well-known for his blunt rhetoric – is now demanding that Australia change its flag because it is too similar. “We had a flag that we’ve had for a long time, copied by Australia, and they should actually change their flag and honour the fact that we got there first with this design, being decided by a prime minister and his legacy,” Peters told TVNZ.This is not the first time Peters has called on Australia to come up with a new flag design, arguing in a 2016 opinion piece that New Zealand’s flag should be restored to its “unique” status. “One argument used against our flag is that it is too like Australia’s, which borrowed our design in the first place,” Peters wrote. “However, since Australian political leaders have recently signed to have their own head of state it is Australia that will have to change its flag, and soon. That will rightly restore our flag to being unique as it was in the beginning.”The New Zealand and Australian flags bear a striking resemblance, with both featuring a royal blue background, a union jack in the lefthand corner, and the southern cross.The New Zealand flag is 50 years older than Australia’s and was adopted in 1902, replacing the union jack. The Australian flag was adopted in 1954, after going through three previous iterations since 1901.New Zealander William Stevens was one of five winners who submitted a design for the Australian flag in 1901, all of which were so similar they were described as identical at the time, with commentators joking that if New Zealand decided to become part of Australia changing the flag would be a simple process with another star added to the southern cross.Both the Australian and New Zealand flags are based on the British blue ensign.Bill English, the deputy prime minister at the time, said there had been a “robust democratic process” that allowed New Zealanders “to discuss who we are and how we want to be represented on the world stage”.The two flags have sometimes been mixed up on public occasions. Earlier this year the nine network used a graphic of the New Zealand flag during Australia Day coverage, while the Australian and New Zealand flags were mistakenly switched during a medal presentation at the Rio olympics."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c4df79671274a678f1bc98c64c99a642884870eb/35_0_3353_2013/master/3353.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e5fa7df9b54f70fb67c14f776c9f19dc","title":"us airline taiwan references erased china","story":"United and Delta expected to follow suit and change how they refer to the self-ruled islandAmerican Airlines Group confirmed it had changed how its website refers to Taiwan, a move expected to be followed by two other major US carriers in an effort to avoid Chinese penalties.A check of American Airlines’ website showed it now listed only Taipei’s airport code and city, but not the name Taiwan. Beijing has demanded that foreign companies, and airlines in particular, not refer to Taiwan as non-Chinese territory on their websites, a move described by the White House in May as “Orwellian nonsense”.China set a final deadline of Wednesday for the changes, and last month rejected US requests for talks on the matter, adding to tensions already raised by an escalating trade conflict.“Like other carriers, American is implementing changes to address China’s request,” American Airlines spokeswoman Shannon Gilson said late on Tuesday. “Air travel is global business, and we abide by the rules in countries where we operate.”Hawaiian Airlines had changed its website before the deadline so that searches for flights to Taiwan’s capital, Taipei, appeared as “Taipei, Taipei” in dropdown menus.United Airlines and Delta Air Lines still included references to Taiwan late on Tuesday.The US state department and White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment late on Tuesday.Numerous non-US airlines including Air Canada, Lufthansa, British Airways and Qantas have already made changes to their websites after China’s Civil Aviation Administration sent a letter to 36 foreign air carriers this year.Analysts see the result as an unfortunate situation for Taiwan and other private companies since China now enjoys more political leverage due to foreign companies’ reliance on its massive market. However, whether such a result would affect the Trump administration’s position on Taiwan was hard to determine.The announcement came as China further increased pressure on Taiwan, a self-ruled island considered by China as part of its territory. On Monday, a group of LGBTQ activists accused China of forcing organisers of the Gay Games to ban the Taiwanese flag at the competition in Paris next month. According to the group, the Federation of Gay Games (FGG) originally agreed to let the Taiwanese delegation compete under the name “Taiwan” and use its national flag, but last week, they were told the French government had concerns about showcasing the Taiwanese flag. Chinese state-run tabloid the Global Times said some powers in Taiwan disregard\u0026nbspother people\u0027s opinions. It proves they are hitting their heads against a wall. It’s a deserved lesson for them to break their heads and bleed.\u0026nbspReuters contributed to this report"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"In a land where bishops objected to \u0026lsquothe sin of Onan\u0026rsquo, first IVF baby arrived only in 1986Fianna F\u0026aacuteil leader says how Taoiseach operates \u0027all about optics, all about spinning\u0026rsquoSettlement costs likely to run to hundreds of thousands of euroFinian McGrath has visited Dr Bassam Naser in prison who is \u0026lsquovery remorseful\u0026rsquoEuropean Commission takes action against 17 EU member states including Ireland over EU directiveIrish charities have income of \u0026euro14.5 billionNew ESRI study looks at who is most likely to experience five barriers to social inclusionWildfires sweeping through the Greek resort town of Mati, east of Athens, kill at least 74Nursing Homes Ireland chief executive Tadhg Daly says move will make system fairerLicence fee collection to be reviewed in wake of evasion costs running at \u0026euro40m annuallyApp encourages homeowners and local businesses to help families attending hospitalSearches of Garda Pulse records indicate 150 cases at issue and require further examinationMichael Maguire from Cork died after being hit by a stray bullet from a machine gunMesh devices used to treat urinary incontinence temporarily banned in the UK earlier this monthCommentator and barrister Noel Whelan confirms he will not stand as candidateDonegal athlete one of first two Irish mountaineers to make safe descent of hazardous peakGAA top brass spent two hours discussing the proposal with organisers at a meeting described as \u0026ldquoopen and constructive\u0026lsquoI was told to come back in two to three days with a small suitcase\u0026rsquo"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3575454.1532461668!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ivf s slow irish birth it was not greeted with open arms","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t“When it works it is the best thing in the world.” Above, Marie, Brian and Padraig (8) O’CallaghanLouise Brown, the first in vitro fertilisation (IVF) baby, was born 40 years ago today at Oldham General Hospital in England.Known at the time as the first “test tube” baby, the circumstances of her conception, in which the egg is fertilised in a test tube and then inserted into the womb, was viewed at the time as a miracle of modern medicine.She was the only one of 457 egg collections to end in a live birth.Her birth gave hope to millions of infertile couples. To date an estimated six million babies have been born worldwide as a result of IVF.IVF was slow to come to Ireland: the first baby was born on January 14th, 1986, in St James’s Hospital at a clinic run by Prof Robert Harrison.The birth of a baby girl made the front page of The . Her identity was never disclosed. The Medical Council only approved IVF after years of wrangling, and only then strictly on the basis that it would be offered exclusively to married couples.The programme that led to the birth of Ireland’s first IVF baby had been suspended in May 1985 pending a review, but a successful conception had already taken place.The first successful programme of IVF in Ireland was from a clinic in Clane, Co Kildare, founded by Dr Tony Walsh in 1987. Dr Walsh said it was the first “real IVF clinic” in Ireland.“It was a very different Ireland and a very different time,” he recalls. “People were much more shy about fertility issues then.Dr Walsh went on to found the Sims clinic in 1997.Dr John Kennedy, the medical director of the Rotunda IVF and Sims clinics, said 5,000-6,000 IVF cycles happen in Ireland every year though some couples go abroad because of the cost.He said age is the biggest factor in successful IVF and the chances of successful pregnancies can be anything from 70 per cent for younger women to just 1 to 2 per cent in older women.He said the cost is still a hugely prohibitive factor in Ireland with each cycle costing more than €5,000. Successive Governments have hinted at making IVF publicly available, but nothing has come of it.“It is still very much in the private realm. There is always talk about bringing public funding, but I’m not holding my breath,” he says.Many couples who go through IVF experience a rollercoaster of emotions. For Marie and Brian O’Callaghan, who live in Limerick, the journey lasted four years and seven cycles of IVF, costing €50,000 in total.Marie, who is originally from Glasgow, was diagnosed with extensive endometriosis when she was 32.She and Brian began IVF treatment in 2006. They had four cycles of IVF, resulting in four pregnancies, but all were lost early. Two further cycles also proved fruitless.Finally, on the seventh attempt, they had a baby, Padraig, who was born in 2010, though even that pregnancy was a close call.Padraig is now eight and will soon begin second class in primary school.IVF, says Marie, transformed their lives “one million per cent”.“When you are going through it, it is the hardest thing ever, but when it works it is the best thing in the world. You forget the pressure, the cost and the emotion. We can’t imagine life without him.”"},{"url":null,"title":"summer sun britons make heatwave pictures","story":"As Britain continues to bake in heatwave conditions, a young man jumps in to the sea from a wall opposite Brighton pier.Sunseekers took to beaches and beauty spots across Britain at the weekend, as the fine and dry weather looks sent to continue for at least another week.Here we look at how people across Britain are making the most of the scorching temperatures while they can.Comment: The Proms give the perfect picture of the definition of sound and qualityRobson Green interview: ‘Actors have always been objectified’Donald Trump heard in lawyer\u0026#39s secret recording discussing potential payment for a Playboy model\u0026#39s storyJason Spencer, US politician pranked by Sasha Baron Cohen, to resign after yelling racial slurs in showFive charged over acid attack on three-year-old boy in Worcester Swedish student stops deportation of man to Afghanistan in plane protestComment: A new charge of treason would bring returning jihadists to justiceDemi Lovato \u0026#39awake\u0026#39 after being rushed to hospital following suspected heroin overdoseFormer Taliban hostage Caitlan Coleman returns to US with her childrenBritish jihadis should face new treason law, former Home Secretary, MI5 chief and Lord Chief Justice sayHaircut and uniform violations being punished by schools as severely as drug and weapons, MPs warnMet Office top minds split on whether climate change is the main cause of the summer heatwavesGreece wildfires a \u0026#39Biblical disaster\u0026#39: At least 74 killed near Athens as tourists forced to flee into seaGreece wildfires: \u0026#39We ran to the beach - then the trees burst into flames\u0026#398,000 counsellors to go into schools to protect generation crushed by digital pressures, Health Secretary reveals \u0026#39Grab her p----\u0026#39 University student \u0026#39quoted Trump before raping girl\u0026#39, court hears\u0026#39Snapchat Queen\u0026#39 who orchestrated boyfriend\u0026#39s killing and posted video of him dying guilty of manslaughterTaxpayers could be asked to pay lump-sum \u0026#39retirement levy\u0026#39 under plans being considered by ministers We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

Mr Boyle, 34, has pleaded not guilty to the charges filed against him. Ms Coleman is petitioning an Ottawa family court to grant her full legal custody of the children and a judge ruled on Monday that she could leave the country pending an outcome to her case, the broadcaster reported. The 32-year-old, who is reported to be pregnant, did not comment.Joshua Boyle speaks to the media after arriving at the Pearson International Airport in Toronto in October“I’m excited that my daughter and her children are finally coming back to the US after all the years of captivity,” Ms Coleman\u0027s father Jim told ABC News.The first thing we want to do is to help Caity establish a good and stable home and help her and the kids continue their recovery from captivity.”Having back-packed through Russia and central Asia to Afghanistan, Ms Coleman and Mr Boyle were captured in 2012 while on a hike in Wardak province, a Taliban stronghold near Kabul. Ms Coleman was pregnant at the time of their kidnap.The family were rescued nine months ago as militants brought them into Pakistan from Afghanistan, following a tip-off on their location from US intelligence, according to a statement from Pakistan’s army at the time. Ms Coleman said she and her family had spent “more than a year” in Pakistan before their rescue on October 11.Ms Coleman said shortly after her release that she was a victim of rape and forced abortion while held hostage. Mr Boyle was previously married to the sister of Omar Khadr, a Canadian man who spent 10 years at Guantanamo Bay after being captured in 2002 in a firefight at an Al Qaeda compound in Afghanistan.Freed Canadian hostage Joshua Boyle and one of his children play outside the Boyle\u0026#39s family home in OntarioResponding to the questions after his rescue, Mr Boyle said: I’m a harmless hippie and I do not kill even mice. I’ve been vegetarian for 17 years. Anybody who knows me would laugh at the notion that I went with designs on becoming a combatant.Mr Boyle was arrested on New Year\u0027s Eve for multiple charges, including physical and sexual assault of a woman and physical assault of a child.He was granted bail in June and is receiving psychiatric treatment as he awaits trial.Comment: The Proms give the perfect picture of the definition of sound and qualityRobson Green interview: ‘Actors have always been objectified’Donald Trump heard in lawyer\u0026#39s secret recording discussing potential payment for a Playboy model\u0026#39s storyJason Spencer, US politician pranked by Sasha Baron Cohen, to resign after yelling racial slurs in showFive charged over acid attack on three-year-old boy in Worcester Swedish student stops deportation of man to Afghanistan in plane protestComment: A new charge of treason would bring returning jihadists to justiceDemi Lovato \u0026#39awake\u0026#39 after being rushed to hospital following suspected heroin overdoseBritish jihadis should face new treason law, former Home Secretary, MI5 chief and Lord Chief Justice sayHaircut and uniform violations being punished by schools as severely as drug and weapons, MPs warnMet Office top minds split on whether climate change is the main cause of the summer heatwavesGreece wildfires a \u0026#39Biblical disaster\u0026#39: At least 74 killed near Athens as tourists forced to flee into seaGreece wildfires: \u0026#39We ran to the beach - then the trees burst into flames\u0026#398,000 counsellors to go into schools to protect generation crushed by digital pressures, Health Secretary reveals \u0026#39Grab her p----\u0026#39 University student \u0026#39quoted Trump before raping girl\u0026#39, court hears\u0026#39Snapchat Queen\u0026#39 who orchestrated boyfriend\u0026#39s killing and posted video of him dying guilty of manslaughterTaxpayers could be asked to pay lump-sum \u0026#39retirement levy\u0026#39 under plans being considered by ministers Ian Paisley suspended by DUP and Parliament following  probe into Sri Lankan holidaysWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/03/15/textile-waste-1.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/03/15/textile-waste-1.jpg","title":"burberry burns stock designer clothing fashion industry environment","story":"Created with Sketch.Upmarket British label has destroyed £105m of unwanted stock in past five yearsClick to followThe Independent OnlineBurberry burns £28.6m of clothes and cosmetics \u0027to protect its brand\u0027Burberry\u0026nbspdestroyed £28.6m of clothing and cosmetics last year as part of efforts to\u0026nbspprotect its upmarket brand and guard against counterfeiting.The luxury British label incinerated the equivalent of\u0026nbsp81,000 of its signature plaid scarves, according to its latest annual accounts, in a practice said to be rife among fashion houses.Industry insiders\u0026nbspsay high-end brands burn\u0026nbspunwanted stock to prevent their clothes being sold at knockdown prices and worn by the\u0026nbsp“wrong people”.But the fashion houses\u0026nbspsay surplus goods are incinerated to prevent them falling into the hands of counterfeiters.Burberry destroyed more than £90m of products over the last five years, and the amount burnt annually has increased dramatically. In 2013, Burberry incinerated £5.5m of unwanted stock, less than a fifth of last year’s total.“The stuff that Burberry is burning is not waste – it is surplus, which is a very different concept. It is perfectly useable stuff,” said Orsola de Castro, cofounder of Fashion Revolution, a not-for-profit group that campaigns for greater transparency in the supply chain.The fashion designer told The Independent clothing brands destroying “vast quantities” of stock was a “massive, massive issue” that was “absolutely not unique to Burberry”.“In the case of the big brands, it’s absolutely very negative for them to suddenly have the same product with slashed prices,” she said.“Burberry, I can imagine, is particularly concerned about this because we all know that it went through a huge image change from sort of shabby to high gloss, high fashion. So they are probably worried about making things cheap and rolling back the clock.“It is brand protection, in this case. They don’t want it to go to the wrong people.”Burberry’s clothes are priced at the high end of fashion retail, with men’s polo shirts selling for as much as £250 and its famous trench coats priced at around £1,500.The company also sells perfumes and cosmetics, which accounted for £10.4m of the products destroyed last year.Fashion Revolution in picturesDestroying stock has become common practice for the industry, with retailers describing it as a measure to protect intellectual property and prevent illegal counterfeiting.Burberry\u0026nbspsaid it only destroyed items that carried its trademark and only worked with specialist companies who were able to harness the energy from the process.A spokesman said: “Burberry has careful processes in place to minimise the amount of excess stock we produce.\u0026nbspOn the occasions when disposal of products is necessary, we do so in a responsible manner and we continue to seek ways to reduce and revalue our waste.”\u0026nbspBurberry\u0026nbsprecently joined the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s Make Fashion Circular initiative to help prevent waste in the industry, he added.Last year it emerged a Swedish power plant was burning unwanted H\u0026ampM clothes instead of coal.\u0026nbspThe plant in Vasteras, northwest of Stockholm, incinerated 15 tonnes of the retailer’s products in the first 11 months of the year.H\u0026ampM stressed it did not burn “any clothes that are safe to use” and said much of the destroyed stock was mouldy\u0026nbspor contaminated with lead.Ms De Castro called on the industry to be more open about the amount of clothing that was going to waste.She added: “We need to slow down. It doesn’t need to be drastic but it does need to happen, because whatever Burberry does with this stuff is not going to be environmentally friendly. There is no way of disposing of this amount of clothing in a way that is not environmentally invasive.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

So she started oneClick to followThe Independent OnlineAtes is also the author of 2009 book ‘Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution’, and has required police protection ever sinceSeyran Ates recalls the searing pain of a bullet tearing through her neck. She remembers wavering on the brink of death and telling God that she had to rejoin the living.A 21-year-old law student at the time, working at a women’s centre in West Berlin, she was nowhere near finished with the world.“\u0027I want to go back,’ I told God,” Ates, now a 55-year-old lawyer and women’s rights activist who is also studying to become an imam, recalled of that afternoon. “I still have a mission.”More than three decades later, that mission came to fruition a year ago when she stood before a congregation of Muslim men and women kneeling side by side as they recited prayers in the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque – the first Muslim house of worship in Germany where women, many with dark ponytails and long curls uncovered, are recognised as imams.Any Muslim is welcome to join: men or women, Sunni or Shia, transgender, gay or straight.“We want to send a signal to political Islam,” Ates, wearing a long, white tunic trimmed with gold, told a packed room on the opening day, when journalists outnumbered worshippers.“We want to show that another Islam exists, that has nothing to do with terrorism.”Over the past year, that something has grown into a congregation of 35 core members – many of them women. They help Ates organise weekly prayers, give tours to school groups and hold seminars on democracy, love and the concept of an open, tolerant interpretation of Islam and a forgiving God.Religious groups join together for interfaith collaborationHere\u0027s a reminder of what Donald Trump said about Muslims in the past When is Eid al-Fitr and how do Muslim people celebrate it?During Eid, it\u0027s important to reflect on Islam in BritainThree years after a wave of more than 1 million, mostly Muslim, migrants arrived in Germany seeking asylum, culture wars over religious identity and the possible threat posed by Islam have led to a rise in nationalist, populist movements.The government of Chancellor Angela Merkel was nearly brought down this week over a dispute with the Bavarian sister of her conservative party, which sought to turn back refugees at the border.The Bavarian conservatives of the Christian Social Union joined the far-right party Alternative for Germany in promoting a narrative that refugees pose a threat, after several highly publicised killings and sexual assaults in the country led to charges against Muslim migrants.The party ordered that crosses be displayed in all public buildings in the state, and Merkel’s new interior minister, Horst Seehofer – also a Bavarian – declared: “Islam is not a part of Germany.”Against the backdrop of these debates, Ates sees the survival of the Ibn Rushd-Goethe Mosque, which recently celebrated its first anniversary, as proof that Muslims living in Germany need and are open to an interpretation of Islam that reflects the values of the Western society in which they live.Tombs in the centre of Tarung village serve as handy laundry driers on a sunny Sumba morning.Each tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) represents massive expense in terms of ritual sacrifices for local families who observe the ancestral Marapu religionCatholic imagery on a tomb in Waihola village (near Nihiwatu) shows how imported religions seem often to have blended almost seamlessly with the ancient Marapu religion.In an effort to minimise economic strain the law stipulates that only 5 buffalo can be sacrificed at funerals - in reality many more are often killed and a big buffalo with a wide horn spread will often fetch close to $4,000.A royal tomb in Pasunga village is flanked by the smaller tombs where servants were buried (sometimes buried alive!) alongside their master.Village dogs - currently s but, more than likely, part of some future feast - on tombs in Pasunga village.A horse - another part of Sumba\u0027s ancestral warrior heritage - grazes among the tombs in Pasunga village.A more humble modern style tomb stands next to the kings burial place in Galu Bakul, Anakalang.A village dog relaxes on a tomb in Prai Ijing village.While still considered sacred the tombs very quickly become part of normal village life.

The Arabs will never allow it,\u0027” she said. Instead, hundreds of people from across Germany, Europe and abroad have visited or attended services.Those most committed to its survival have made donations, some as much as €500, Ates said, emphasising that the mosque receives no public funding.“Even atheists come here and appreciate this place, as a spiritual place, a place of peace,” she said recently, standing barefoot on the pale carpet of the mosque. “I had hoped, but never dreamed, that so many atheists would be interested. That was a positive surprise.”The criticism and rejection, in its fierceness and intensity, less so. Even before the mosque opened, her personal Facebook page and that of the mosque were flooded with derogatory messages and even some death threats.“May Allah put you on the right path, or destroy you,” someone writing under the name Xalo Bero said, in one of the friendlier remarks.Protection provided by the police and paid for by the city government, in place since she published the book Islam Needs a Sexual Revolution\u0026nbspin 2009, was increased to a personal security detail after the heightened threats on her life.Days after the mosque opened, Dar al-Ifta, an influential arm of the Egyptian Justice Ministry that issues religious verdicts, denounced the mosque and declared that allowing men and women to pray alongside one another violated Islamic law.Turkish news outlets reported that the mosque was a terrorist organisation with links to the Islamist cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom Turkey blames for a coup attempt in 2016 against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Despite a video message in which Ates states that the “the Rushd-Goethe mosque has nothing to do with the Gulen movement”, the rumours have persisted.She blames them for the fact that few Turks have joined the congregants, although they make up the vast majority of the estimated 4.5 million Muslims living in Germany.Despite the demands of running the mosque, she takes Arabic classes and continues to work as a lawyer. She considers achieving a degree in Islamic theology important to her recognition in the Muslim community.“I want to understand the words and know the meanings so no one can say, ‘She’s just a lawyer,\u0027” she said.Born in Istanbul to a Turkish mother and a Kurdish father, she emigrated with her parents to what was then West Berlin in the late 1960s, part of the first large wave of Muslim immigrants who came to fill the blue-collar jobs needed to rebuild the German economy after World War II.Ates was 6 when she and her four siblings moved into a one-room apartment with their parents.As she learned German and excelled in school, Ates says, she came to understand that it was not the crowded living conditions that she found suffocating, but the realisation that because of her gender, she was not afforded the freedoms of her non-Muslim peers.“I was a girl,” she wrote in 2007 in Zeit Online. “I embodied the family’s honour, and my hymen – for a long time I didn’t even know what that was – was more important to the whole family than my brain.”At 17, she fled her home, graduated from high school and started studying law at the Free University of Berlin. To support herself, she worked as a counsellor in a women’s centre.In September 1984, she was speaking with a client when a man wearing a trench coat entered the centre, pulled out a pistol and fired three shots. One hit the client in the stomach, killing her the other struck Ates.She survived to see the suspect, a Turkish bricklayer, acquitted for lack of evidence, which enraged her. For years, she struggled with the psychological fallout of the attack.Violent clashes leave ’86 dead’ in NigeriaFrench far-right group arrested over alleged plot to attack MuslimsShe returned to her faith, but was again alienated by Berlin’s traditional, conservative mosques, where women were forced to pray behind a curtain. She decided that if the faith community that she needed did not exist, she would create it.It took years of planning, fundraising and looking for a suitable space. While she received support from like-minded liberal Muslims from Switzerland to the US, the critics have remained.What keeps her going is the encouragement, not only from social media postings, but also from the visitors who go out of their way to find a place of worship that previously existed only in their dreams.​Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Heathrow Airport saw thermometers hit 36.7C three years ago.“If we did break the record, it would be on Friday,” meteorologist Mark Wilson told\u0026nbspThe Independent.And long-range forecasts suggested the above-average heat may continue for another month, he said. Any respite from thunderstorms or showers would not last long.“Early signs are that the next 30 days will remain drier, sunnier and hotter than average, although there may be some more unsettled, short-lived spells,”\u0026nbspMr Wilson added, while warning that the further into the future a forecast looked, the lower the confidence in its predictions.Sweltering conditions in recent weeks\u0026nbsphave turned fields brown, ripened wild berries months earlier than normal and precipitated an amber-level heat health warning, with people urged to stay in the shade.Social workers are on high alert to check on people having difficulties in the heat, council leaders said.But the Local Government Association (LGA) also urged the public to check on vulnerable or elderly neighbours, family or friends, warning\u0026nbspthat the elderly and those suffering from heart and respiratory problems were most at risk.Social workers, community wardens and maintenance staff were all on high alert to identify those who could be struggling, it said.Council workers will be making calls and extra visits to people at risk, but the LGA also urged the public to keep an eye on people vulnerable to heat.UK weather: Temperatures soar as heatwave intensifiesPeople relax in the warm weather on the beach in BrightonPeople enjoying the hot weather and sunshine on the banks of the River Thames in

To that end I am making some changes to the ision of functions between the Department for Exiting the European Union\u0026nbspand the Cabinet Office.“DExEU will continue to lead on all of the government’s preparations for Brexit: domestic preparations in both a deal and a no deal scenario, all of the necessary legislation, and preparations for the negotiations to implement the detail of the future framework. To support this, DExEU will recruit some new staff, and a number of Cabinet Office officials coordinating work on preparedness will move to DExEU while maintaining close ties with both departments.Ms May said that, from now on, Downing Street will\u0026nbspassume responsibility “for the preparation and conduct of the negotiations”.She said: “I will lead the negotiations with the European Union, with the secretary of state for exiting the European Union deputising on my behalf. Both of us will be supported by the Cabinet Office Europe Unit and with this in mind the Europe Unit will have overall responsibility for the preparation and conduct of the negotiations, drawing upon support from DExEU and other departments as required.Some staff will move\u0026nbspfrom the Brexit department to the Cabinet Office as part of the shakeup but\u0026nbspthe total number of Brexit department staff\u0026nbspwill not be cut, Ms May said.Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Brexit Resignation: July 10th 2018 Maria Caulfield MP Conservative Party\u0027s vice chair for women July 10th 2018Brexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conservative MP for Bolton West Chris Green MPBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Conor Burns MP next to Boris JohnsonBrexit Resignation: July 9th 2018 Steve Baker, EX-Minister at the Department for Exiting the European UnionBrexit Resignation: July 8th 2018 MP David Davis Ex-Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union The change follows\u0026nbspmonths of frosty relations between No 10 and the Brexit department, with Mr Davis having grown increasingly frustrated at the direction Mr Robbins was taking. Tory Brexiteers are suspicious of Mr Robbins, who they see as being a supporter of a soft Brexit, and\u0026nbspare likely to raise concerns about him assuming a greater role at the expense of Mr Raab, a vocal Eurosceptic.\u0026nbspThe move\u0026nbspis also likely to be seen as a sign of mounting concern among Ms May’s team at the prospect of failing to secure\u0026nbspa deal by the October deadline.\u0026nbspAsked about the changes while giving evidence to the Commons Brexit committee, Mr Robbins said Mr Raab would continue to lead talks with Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief negotiator, but that Ms May considered the negotiating strategy to be her “personal responsibility”.May will keep UK under EU laws for another 21 monthsNo-deal Brexit will make it ‘illegal’ to pay pensions to retired BritsCriminals could go free because of ‘catastrophic’ Brexit security dealMr Raab, appearing before the same committee,\u0026nbspadmitted there had been some “shifting of Whitehall deckchairs” but said he would continue to deputise for Ms May.

The party officers have decided to suspend Mr Ian Paisley MP from membership of the party pending further investigation into his conduct.“The party does not intend to make any further comment on these matters during the course of the above outlined process.”The North Antrim MP earlier vowed to fight for his seat if he faces the electorate over his failure to declare two luxury family holidays paid for by the Sri Lankan government.In March 2014, the senior Democratic Unionist lobbied against a proposed United Nations resolution to investigate alleged human rights abuses during a civil war on the Indian Ocean island without citing his financial benefits.“In view of the seriousness of this matter, we recommend that Mr Paisley be suspended from the service of the House for a period of 30 sitting days starting on 4 September 2018,” said the Commons standards committee said last week.MPs on Tuesday backed the recommendation from the committee meaning the suspension from the chamber will now go ahead.Patrick Corrigan, head of Amnesty International in Northern Ireland, said the victims were those killed in Sri Lanka.“Mr Paisley saw fit to lobby the prime minister against a UN investigation into gross human rights violations, including the mass killing of civilians at the end of the Sri Lankan war, for which no adequate investigation has ever been carried out,” he said.Committee on StandardsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

But critics said that\u0026nbspin some cases pay rises were below inflation.Members of the armed forces will receive an increase of 2.9 per cent (2 per cent consolidated, 0.9 per cent non-consolidated), with the award worth £680 in pay to an average soldier, plus a one-off payment of £300.Public sector pay rises: No more cap but the offer still falls shortFears of more government cuts as public sector pay cap lifted for 1mMay pledge to scrap public sector pay cap unaffordable, says analysisPublic sector pay cap hit spending power by £8.5bn in England- TUCAll prison officers will get at least a 2.75 per cent (2 per cent consolidated, 0.75 per cent non-consolidated) increase this year, with many getting higher awards.Unions and opposition parties raised concerns that the pay awards were not fully funded, warning of fresh cuts to services and jobs.Labour said the government was “raiding” already underfunded budgets of schools, hospitals, prisons, police services and armed forces for what amounted to a real terms pay cut.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: “By increasing the pay levels, albeit by less than the rate of inflation, that can only be paid for by cuts within the public services.“And so, if it’s local authorities or anybody else, they’re going to have to pay for it by either removing their balances, which they shouldn’t be doing, or by cutting services further.”Peter Dowd, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said that the announcement was a “mendacious PR stunt”. He added:\u0026nbsp“Today’s announcement shamefully takes money away from our schools, hospitals, prisons, police services and armed forces to fund pay allocations for valued public workers.“Real wages in the public sector are lower today than they were in 2010, yet the reality of today’s announcement is that on top of eight years of cuts to frontline services, and job losses, our police officers, some junior doctors, specialist doctors and dentists are being offered real terms pay cuts.”Matt Hancock, the health and social\u0026nbspcare secretary, said the pay rises for doctors and dentists recognised their “value and dedication”.From October, a consultant that started\u0026nbspwork in 2013 will have seen a 16.5 per cent increase in their basic pay, rising to a salary of £87,665 from £75,249, it was announced.Ministers said the pay rises were worth between £1,150 and £1,550 for consultants, between £1,140 and £2,120 for speciality doctors, between £1,600 and £2,630 for associate specialists, between £532 and £924 for junior doctors, and around £1,052 for a salaried GP with a median taxable income of £52,600.But the British Medical Association said it was “truly astonishing” that the government had “ignored” recommendations from the independent pay review body.Dr Anthea Mowat of the BMA said: “Just last week the new secretary of state talked about how ‘heartbreaking’ it was to see how ‘undervalued’ NHS staff feel.“Considering those words, doctors in England will rightly feel both anger and disappointment that sentiment has not been matched with action.“Since 2008, doctors have experienced the largest drop in earnings of all professions subject to pay review bodies, with consultants seeing a 19 per cent fall in pay, junior doctors 21 per cent and GPs 20 per cent.“The effective pay uplift this year for some doctors will be as little as 0.75 per cent, which will be widely seen as derisory.”Ministers also added that teachers would be in line for a pay rise of up to 3.5 per cent which equates to £1,366 a year.Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “Schools and parents will be dismayed that schools will have to find more than £250m from their already stretched budgets.“We are concerned, too, that the Department for Education will be forced by the Treasury to make unacceptable cuts to other parts of its education budget and we will monitor this carefully.”Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, said: “By abdicating responsibility for funding these awards, the Treasury has forced the Department for Education to scramble for money within their own department.“We will have to wait to see what cuts have to be made elsewhere to find this money but it seems like a false economy by the government.”UK news in picturesGreat Britain\u0027s Geraint Thomas cleans his eyes after tear gas was thrown at the pelaton during a farmers\u0027 protest who attempted to block the stage\u0027s route, during the 16th stage of the Tour de France, between Carcassonne and Bagneres-de-Luchon.

With the race expected to be tight, independents and other smaller parties - like the PPP\u0026nbspled by the son of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto - could yet play a key role in coalition.\u0026nbsp18 dead in suicide bombingA blast killed has at least 18 people in the\u0026nbspwestern city of Quetta in an attack targeting a police van, according to local media reports.Geo TV put the death toll at 18, while rival Samaa TV put it at 20, adding a suicide attacker was responsible.One dead in shooting between political rivals\u0026nbspPolice have confirmed to The Independent that a party activist has been killed in what is thought to be the first incident of deadly violence on election day.\u0026nbspWe are receiving\u0026nbspinformation from\u0026nbsplocal sources of a shootout in the northwestern city of Sawabi between staff of the PTI and secular Awami National Workers (ANP) parties.\u0026nbspPTI says that one of its activists was killed, and another four people were injured in the incident.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspLocal police confirmed that tally, but\u0026nbspsay\u0026nbspthe situation is now under control and voting is back\u0026nbspunderway in Col Sher Khan village.\u0026nbspOther minor incidents have also been reported. In Larkana, Sindh province,\u0026nbspan attack on PPP activists with firecrackers injured a few people, local party management sources said.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspPakistan\u0026nbspMuslim League chief Shahbaz Sharif cast his vote in the eastern city of Lahore soon after polls opened in national elections.\u0026nbspSharif, the younger brother of disgraced ex-prime minister Nawaz Sharif, took over the ruling\u0026nbspPakistan\u0026nbspMuslim League last year after his brother was found guilty of corruption. The ex-prime minister has since been sentenced to 10 years in jail, which he is serving while appealing the conviction.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspAfter voting he told reporters: Do not waste your time. Get out of your homes and cast your vote. We will change the destiny of this country through the power of people. If we come into power, we will end poverty, give education to everyone, make millions of homes and build the Bhasha dam. He added: China and Saudi Arabia are keen to help us.\u0026nbspHe said he believed today people will vote in support of\u0026nbspNawaz Sharif and his daughter\u0026nbspMaryam, who was also jailed, and prove they support democracy.\u0026nbspThe younger Sharif stood in line waiting his turn to enter the polling booth. In\u0026nbspPakistan, a candidate can run for elections in multiple seats. If the candidate wins more than one seat, a by-election will be held as a person can represent only one constituency.\u0026nbspSharif marked his ballot for both the National and Punjab provincial Parliaments and is contesting elections in four National Assembly seats and in two Punjab provincial legislature seats.Today\u0027s isive race is likely to come down to Punjab, the country\u0027s most populous province, where Sharif\u0027s party has clung to its lead in recent surveys.Let\u0027s test Imran as we have been testing others for the last several decades, said first-time voter Yousaf Ali, a 22-year-old medical student who cast his ballot for Khan\u0027s party in the city of Lahore in Punjab.An anti-corruption crusader, Khan has promised an Islamic welfare state and cast his populist campaign as a battle to topple a predatory political elite hindering development in the impoverished mostly-Muslim nation of 208 million people, where the illiteracy rate hovers above 40 percent.We are pitched against mafias, Khan, 65, said in one of his last rallies in the coastal city of Karachi. These are mafias who made money in this country and siphoned it abroad, burying this nation in debt.There have been positive landmarks to be found aside from the flurry of recriminations in the campaign. For the first time in history, five trans candidates will be standing for election, and there are also a record 171 women in the running, though they make a small minority of the 12,500 candidates vying for national and provincial seats across the country.Nonetheless, there will be a huge security presence trying to maintain order on the streets on Wednesday, with approximately 800,000 law enforcement and army personnel deployed.Of more than 85,000 polling stations across the country, around 17,000 have been declared “highly sensitive” and will receive special security measures.The majority of these – more than 11,000 – were in the populous Punjab and Sindh provinces, where the election is expected to be won or lost. Rights activists have also expressed concern that soldiers will be positioned inside booths where votes are cast.For Ayesha Siddiqa, a defence analyst and author of a book about the power and financial holdings of Pakistan’s military, the outlook is worrying. She said: “Whatever way elections run, I see a lot of instability.”Today\u0027s vote will be the first time Pakistan has ever achieved a second democratic transition of power in a row. Throughout its history, the country has oscillated between military and civilian rule.Yet while that should be being hailed as an unprecedented landmark of stability for the nation, there are warning signs to be found in a campaign that has been one of the most dangerous and distasteful in modern history.From social media to the streets, the vicious nature of the campaign has polarised Pakistani society into supporters of Mr Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek Insaf (PTI) party, and the incumbent Pakistan Muslim League – Nawaz (PML-N) of Mr Sharif.The chief election commissioner (CEC), retired Justice Sardar Muhammad Raza, on Tuesday assured voters that the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) was “trying its best to hold free, fair and unbiased elections”.In a video message released by the election body, Mr Raza urged voters to fulfil their “duty towards the nation” by casting their votes calmly and responsibly on polling day.Voters will decide\u0026nbsptoday between\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspformer cricket legend and playboy\u0026nbspImran Khan, and the party of ex-leader\u0026nbspNawaz Sharif, who has been\u0026nbspjailed on corruption charges that he says are politically motivated.Mr Khan\u0027s PTI\u0026nbspparty has positioned itself as an anti-corruption vehicle\u0026nbspof change - but Mr Sharif\u0027s PML-N\u0026nbsphas accused him of being the military\u0027s candidate.While PTI has held a narrow lead in polls leading up to the election, most forecasters are predicting a hung parliament that will require a coalition government.It means that independents and other smaller parties - like the PPP\u0026nbspled by the son of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto - could yet play a key role in coalition.\u0026nbspPolls were scheduled to open at 8am local time (3.30am BST)\u0026nbspacross the country, and\u0026nbspwitnesses and national media say that voting is now underway across many polling stations.Welcome to The Independent\u0027s live blog of the Pakistan election.

We reveal everything.Robert Thompson and Jon Venables were only 10-years-old when they became the country’s youngest murderers in 250 years.Little James was led away by the depraved duo while his mother was in a butchers shop at the busy shopping centre.A picture taken from CCTV footage shows the tot being taken by the hand in what would become one of the defining images of the shocking case.The killers walked James for two and half miles and were spotted by 38 people – some of whom challenged the pair.Venables and Thompson told passers-by that the distressed toddler was their younger brother or that he was lost and they were taking him to a local police station.The pair took James to a railway line and tortured, beat and sexually assaulted him.They poured modelling paint into his eyes, stoned him and clubbed him with bricks and dropped a 22lbs iron bar on him.Twisted Venables and Thompson then weighted his head down with rubble and lay him across railway tracks hoping he would hit by a train to make the murder look like an accident.Jamie, who suffered 42 injuries in total, was sliced in half by a train and his body discovered two days later.The tragic tot was born on March 16, 1990, in Merseyside.He was killed on February 12, 1993 - a month before his third birthday.Jamie would now be 27 years old.The couple split after the tragedy but both tirelessly fought against their sons killers being given anonymity and a new identity.Ralph pleaded with authorities on February 7 to unmask Venables before he can claim any more victims.Venables – now in his mid-30s – was sent back to prison for three years and four months after admitting having more than 1,000 indecent images of children aged 6-13.Ralph said giving him lifelong anonymity was “a failed experiment” and claimed the authorities could not manage him in the community.His solicitor Robin Makin said: “We are immensely concerned about the danger that Jon Venables would pose if he is released again.“Due to his innate nature, there has to be a fundamental reassessment of the injunction order.“It not only affects James’ family but the general public as well – and it involves astronomical amounts of money.“It seems to be perfectly obvious that Jon Venables can’t cope living the lie and the authorities haven’t been able to manage him in the community.“He’s already reverted to committing further offences and we have to wonder where this is going to lead.”Denise recently released a book called I Let Him Go to mark the 25th anniversary of her sons death.The book, which was released on January 25th, is a heart-breaking account of how she is haunted by the events of that day.Jamie has a brother Michael, who Denise was pregnant with at the time of the trial while still married to Ralph.He spoke out in 2013, saying: It upsets me to think that two ten-year-olds could do that to my brother. I will never understand it and I can never forgive them, but I am not consumed with hate or thoughts of revenge.I just want to get on with my life and look to the future, not the past. I don’t want to sink to their level.Denise met electrician Stuart Fergus when Michael was two and they married 20 years ago.They had two sons together called Thomas and Leon.Meanwhile, in 2013, Ralphs partner Natalie McDermott gave birth to a baby girl.

This week, Lib Dem MP Jo Swinson was “cheated” in a crunch Brexit vote by the breaking of her pairing pact.This is an arrangement where one MP agrees not to vote to cancel out the fact that another MP on the opposite side is unable to vote — in this case Swinson was at home with her three-week-old baby.The problem was, her pairing partner reneged on the deal and voted.Then there are the hours, which can be difficult if you have a family. Any woman would need a very understanding partner and family to do the job.Also, any MP is opening themselves up to the line of fire and a lot of personal criticism — which multiplies for female MPs.Some have to deal with endless comments and speculation about their appearance, as well as threats of rape and death on a regular basis. Just this week a man was arrested over abusive Facebook posts aimed at various female MPs.If it’s true voters are biased against women, any female has to be ten times as talented, determined and tenacious to get the job in the first place.It’s no wonder women are put off entering politics.But if we want true equality then more women need to go into Westminster and the culture needs to change.That is why I support the campaign group Women To Win and will be taking part in an event called The Voice Of Women In Politics.The idea is to try to encourage more women into Parliament, outlining some of the changes that need to take place to raise the number of female candidates.Getting more women into politics is a no brainer.Women tend to work collaboratively to solve problems whereas — in my experience — men are more likely to lock horns, point fingers and try to shout the loudest. All too often men are interested in progressing to be a leader, whereas women are more focused on getting the job done.And when women DO find their voice in politics, it can be very powerful, and they often hae the balls to say things that men just wouldn’t.Look at Tory minister Anna Soubry, who this week suggested the PM should take control of her hardliner MPs and stop pandering to the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg.I know she’s got a lot on her plate at the moment, but if I was Theresa May I would be spending a good proportion of my time and energy on making real changes to politics in order, specifically, to attract many more women.It could be one of the greatest legacies she could hope for.Thomas Markle is a concerned dad who just wants to be reconnected with his daughter.Meanwhile this HALF-sister has turned a constant shade of green and wants to get involved in any way she can.Is it any wonder she wasn’t invited to the wedding?MY heroine of the week is 21-year-old Emilia Holden a waitress in Georgia, US, who was at the end of a shift when a customer casually grabbed her bottom as he walked past.Her response? She followed him, grabbed him and body slammed him to the ground, then called the police – after which he spent two nights in a police cell.What a fantastic response. Good for her.But also, who are these men that think that they can just grab a woman’s behind just because they want to?But hearing about elaborate plans by Pixie Lott which include a total of 18 bridesmaids all wearing the same dress, left me feeling a bit stressed out.Apart from anything else, it will take them all an hour to travel up the aisle.JAMES GODDARD-WATTS, the businessman whose family founded the hardware firm Screwfix, is still locked in a multi-million pound divorce battle with his ex-wife, Julia.They reached an agreement eight years ago ­– following the end of a 13-year marriage – that Mrs Goddard-Watts should get a £3.25million house and a £4million lump sum.But she complained that Mr Goddard-Watts had not revealed the full extent of his wealth at the time of the settlement and court fights began.Critics say Julia is a leech, greedy and after his money.But when you consider the worth and value of building a home, looking after children and a family while supporting a spouse, that should be worth at least half of whatever the partner who didn’t do all of that has earned in the meantime.So why shouldn’t she take him back to court?The law states that assets are divided equally.So people who hide theirs from their spouse only have themselves to blame if said spouse feels forced to take them to court to get what’s fair.ELLE Macpherson’s diet regime is enough to make me reach for the pizza delivery menu.The model is up at 5am. She has warm water, lemon and cayenne pepper.She has no booze, almost no carbs, no meat and no dairy. She is such a follower of the alkaline diet – based on the theory you can change the pH of your body through food – that she checks the acidity of her urine.I’m sure the diet is good for her – but who wants to add years to your life if those years are going to be so, well, dull?“The only chance I have of being on TV again is if I were very ugly,” he said.“I think only old, ugly women can get on TV.

Or a crap remake of Fight Club — except they DO talk about Fight Club. All the time.Theresa May has the leadership skills of a damp dishcloth, no authority and no political vision.A strong leader needs a clear mission. You may not agree with it, but you know what they stand for.“Live each day like it’s your last,” is our Prime Minister’s political strategy, except she’s not dancing in the rain.She is waiting for the sharks to circle. And soon they will come for her.Buffoon-in-chief Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg — a man so old-fashioned he could have been dug up by Time Team — wait to pounce. And Brexit is a mess. Things are so bad, even Elon Musk is out of ideas. No one will be happy with where we end up.And because there is no party political or Brexit majority in the Commons, politics is stuck, trapped in what feels like a never-ending Brexistential crisis.Normally, I’m with “Brenda From Bristol” when it comes to more elections and referendums.But maybe a People’s Vote on the final deal or another election is the only way to unblock Brexit.Think of it like a political plunger — unpleasant, nasty but necessary.You’d think the Opposition would be gleefully capitalising on all this chaos. Think again. Instead of going after the Tories, Labour has decided to traumatise the Jewish community. Again.Labour has had a horrible problem with anti-Semitism, yet instead of healing the wound, it has poured vinegar on it by choosing not to adopt the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance code of conduct.These guys sound pretty authoritative and the code is good enough for government departments and the Crown Prosecution Service.Many Jewish groups and leaders, including the Chief Rabbi, are distraught, confused and angry. And you can see why.This shameful decision led to an angry clash outside the Commons chamber where Jewish MP Margaret Hodge confronted Jeremy Corbyn, allegedly calling him an anti-Semite and a racist.Hodge lost family in the Holocaust and fought off the BNP in her Barking and Dagenham constituency.Instead of acknowledging her pain and offering to sit down with her, Team Corbyn are taking disciplinary action against her.I bet they deal with her far quicker than they did with Ken Livingstone, who couldn’t stop banging on about Hitler.What dark times for Labour, which once had a proud tradition of fighting racism. They must sort it out.Then we have the Lib Dems, who have proved useless. They have one policy — stop Brexit.Yet leader Vince Cable and ex-leader Tim Farron missed crucial votes on Monday. Talk about Dem and Dumber.To top it all off, the DUP’s Ian Paisley Jnr has been suspended for 30 days — which hasn’t happened since 1949 — for failing to declare lavish holidays to that well-known Northern Irish stakeholder, Sri Lanka.And to think Theresa May planned to give MPs an extra five days off as a reward for all their hard work.The country has had enough of these fools’ infighting, incompetence and filling their boots. Especially when we face so many big problems, from NHS funding to housing.Parliament’s end-of-term report is a big, fat fail. British politics should be taken into special measures.THE premiere of Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again was sun-kissed, frothy fun –  and no one mentioned the ­Customs Union. Bliss.The stars were out in full, including Cher. She is magnificent, but it is a little odd that at 72 she has fewer wrinkles than any other cast member, including 29-year-old Lily James. And the baby.She told Lorraine Kelly it was down to not drinking, smoking or doing drugs. Yeah, right.We women may be naive when it comes to the quest for eternal beauty, but we ain’t stupid.WHEN you hear of people getting up in the middle of the night and queuing, you think of the Boxing Day sales or the release of the latest Apple gadget.You don’t think of childcare.Yet more than 100 parents queued from 3am – armed with chairs, flasks and biscuits – trying to bag their child a coveted place in the breakfast club at a primary school in Cardiff.For many working parents, breakfast clubs are a lifeline.They can drop off the children in a safe environment where they can get a decent breakfast, then make it to work on time themselves.Though parents have the right to request flexible working hours, many fear the sack if they come in late.These spaces were limited and dished out on a first-come, first-served basis, which is why the parents took such drastic measures.This shows how desperate parents are for childcare that matches their working hours.The scrapping of Labour’s extended school programme and the first real-terms cuts to schools mean all these extras that were provided are no longer affordable.Childcare isn’t a luxury.It’s a necessity for millions of families and they are crying out for more breakfast and after-school clubs.JEFF BEZOS, the boss of Amazon, is a man clearly in his “Prime”.He’s now the richest man in modern history.Good for him.I’m all for celebrating entrepreneurs and hard work – but shouldn’t that apply to his poor workers toiling away in his warehouses?They would probably give Amazon working conditions zero stars.I wish our business leaders remembered some of their forefathers, who felt a moral and civic responsibility to look after their employees and took some pride in that.It makes business sense too. Happy workers are better workers.So after Bezos pops open the champagne, maybe he could spare a thought for his staff, who told an undercover reporter they pee in bottles because the loos are too far away and they are afraid of being accused of time-wasting.C’mon, Jeff – that’s really taking the p**s. ONE school in Liverpool had to apologise after kids as young as four were left in tears when they were denied an ice cream treat because they didn’t have a 97 per cent attendance record.How mean is that? What if they were ill? And surely it’s the parents’ fault.CARERS got another kick in the teeth this week when the Court of Appeal overturned a decision that those doing sleep-in shifts should earn at least the minimum wage.If the decision had gone through, it would have cost the UK care sector billions – so charities and local governments were relieved.But it shows what a raw deal carers get.Judges said only hours spent awake counted as work – but that is completely out of touch with the reality of what carers do.Many of the elderly and vulnerable people they look after need their help through the night, whether it’s a trip to the loo, to take medication or dealing with more serious situations such as seizures. Carers can’t exactly fall into a deep sleep. They have to be alert and listening in case they are needed.The rooms they sleep in may not be comfortable and they will be away from their own families.Many carers are paid so little that they live hand to mouth and barely get by.When I met a group in the West Midlands, they told me they couldn’t afford to put the heating on in winter and had to take their kids to the grandparents’ for tea once or twice a week just so they would be fed.Some were struggling so much they had to visit food banks.But they also loved their jobs and took great pride in looking after their clients as if they were family.They get paid a pittance, with some earning just £30 for a ten-hour shift.These low-paid workers – the majority of whom are women – are unsung heroes and deserve more.New Health Secretary Matt Hancock must make social care a priority and enforce minimum-wage law properly.It’s time we took better care of our carers.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The spread of social media and other online communication, with its inherent anonymity, has only increased the misery for victims.But the speed of change has not been matched by a more robust framework to deal with it.Yes, we have tougher sentences — the Government was absolutely right to last year double jail terms for the worst cases from five to ten years.But progress has been too slow in recognising these crimes.In 2016-17, fewer than 1,000 prosecutions were commenced under stalking legislation.It was horrifying to read the account of Nicola Roberts from Girls Aloud yesterday.She told how she faced a barrage of more than 3,000 texts over five years from an ex-boyfriend, including threats to stab and burn her.Soon after being handed a lifetime restraining order, her ex began following her on Instagram.He “wanted me to know he was still watching me”, she said, chillingly.And yet the CPS saw no realistic chance of a successful prosecution for stalking because the social media activity was not taken sufficiently seriously, despite the obvious impact on Nicola’s life.As she put it: “I should be able to move on from an unhealthy relationship if I want and that’s not been able to happen.”She wants change — and she is right to.These kinds of messages leave you in fear for your life — feeling that someone is watching or following you is immensely distressing.A bunch of flowers is not a romantic gesture when sent by a stalker but a reminder that your persecutor is still watching and can still reach you.Stalking is a crime of obsession and fixation and it needs to be stopped before it becomes deeply ingrained.No legislation will be effective unless it is accompanied by training at the front line of policing and across the wider courts system.Victims must have the confidence to come forward at an earlier stage, for all forms of stalking to be recognised for what they are. It is my intention to make this happen.My Stalking Protection Bill will introduce so-called Stalking Protection Orders (SPOs) to help fill some of the gaps in the law.It will allow the police to act more quickly and to protect victims of so-called stranger stalking, where the stalker is not a former partner.Importantly, it will also take the onus off the victim to have to take action, as is currently the case for stranger stalking. At present many victims are left unprotected because they have to put protective measures in place for themselves, such as applying for a civil injunction to restrain someone from harassing them.Needless to say, many victims find this such a daunting task — not to mention expensive and time-consuming — that they end up not going through with it.If passed, the Stalking Protection Bill would allow the police to apply for an SPO through the magistrates’ courts on behalf of victims.Orders will require the civil standard of proof “on the balance of probabilities” but breach of an order would be a criminal offence, punishable in the most serious cases by a term of up to five years in prison.SPOs could set out requirements prohibiting certain behaviours, such as contacting the victim either directly or indirectly.It would be able to prohibit behaviours such as driving past the victim’s house, harassing friends, colleagues or family members, going within a certain distance of the victim or following them online.It could also set out so called positive requirements, such as attending a psychiatric assessment.In this digital age, the law would cover online contact from abroad and require that any IT equipment would be free from encryption, so perpetrators could not cover their tracks.Unlike the now-abandoned Police Information Notices, SPOs will have teeth, as they would be enforceable and breaching the terms of an order would have consequences.SPOs would also require stalkers to register all the names they use, as well as their address.While SPOs will provide better early intervention to protect victims, they are not intended to replace full prosecution for an offence of stalking.They will, however, enable police to better protect the safety of victims while gathering the full evidence for the CPS to prosecute a full stalking case.The Bill has almost completed its Commons journey but will not now return to the Chamber until late November.When the case for change is so pressing, and the Bill is backed by members across the House, I believe the Government should bring forward the final Commons stage so we can get on with delivering this vital change to the law — which will help to save lives.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Too often, and for good reason, men have been seen as the problem in the fight against Aids.So in response we have done so much to safeguard women and girls, and rightly so, but we cant solve the whole problem if were only addressing half the situation.If we want to end Aids once and for all, we must make men part of the solution.Today Harry praised the work that had already been done to tackle the virus and support those who are HIV positive, but warned there is still more to do.He told the session on Monday morning: For over a quarter (of a) century, Elton has worked tirelessly to fund research and services in communities around the world.And today he has come to Amsterdam to announce his latest endeavour - a billion dollar global partnership to break the cycle of male transmission of HIV, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.We stand here at a moment when the progress we have fought so hard for is at risk from a dangerous complacency.Too many around the world are still ignoring the damaging knock-on effect on education and other community services from not prioritising HIV prevention and treatment.This is a time when new, energetic and innovative solutions are needed more than ever before – and that is exactly what you are about to see from Elton and the Men Star Coalition partners.Yesterday the duke joined a session at the conference where youth delegates from countries including India, Zimbabwe and the US spoke about how Aids has affected their lives.At the end they all gathered for a group picture and Harry even posed for a selfie with one of them.Sir Elton John and Princess Diana first met in the 1980s and became close friends. In the years leading up to her death, they worked closely with each other to help destigmatise Aids by spreading awareness about the disease.In 1987, the Peoples Princess touched the unnamed man without wearing gloves, challenging the previously believed notion the disease could be passed via skin-to-skin contact. She was the first member of the Royal Family to touch someone with AIDS.She was quoted as saying: HIV does not make people dangerous to know. You can shake their hands and give them a hug. Heaven knows they need it.Diana was a patron of the National Aids Trust at the time of her death in 1997.Earlier this year, Sir Elton delivered the Diana Princess of Wales Lecture on HIV in her memory and the star continues to praise Princess Diana for using her royal status to normalise AIDS.Since her death, Sir Elton has continued to work relentlessly to fund research and services across the globe.(Words by Aisling Finn)Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He lost his life saving the lives of others – a danger you also faced.The Thai PM has written to me to say thank you for the fantastic job you did and I know that everyone in this country would agree. We are all very proud of you.”Mr Volanthen said: “It was an honour to join the incredible effort to rescue of these boys and their coach, and I would like to personally add particular reference to the skill and dedication of the many military groups and civilians we worked alongside, especially the Thai Navy Seals.“I would also like to extend my thoughts to the family of Saman Kunan.”The group joined the rescue efforts after being called in by Thailands Navy Seals.They were forced to find their way through flooded caves to find the patch of dry land where the 12 boys were huddling.The dangers of the expedition were highlighted when diver Saman Kunan died during the rescue attempt.But miraculously, the British-led team managed to get every one of the kids and their coach out of the complex, and theyre all on track to make a full recovery."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000333799479-e1532454665645.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"ministers should scrap the mot test because it doesnt save lives and costs drivers 180 a year report says","story":"The Adam Smith Institute said most car crashes are down to driver error rather than mechanical faults.Drivers would save nearly £180 on average if the tests were no longer compulsory, the think-tank added.In total, British motorists pay out £250million a year on MOT tests and unnecessary repairs which are needed to make cars pass, according to the report.The annual MOT was first introduced in 1960 and is compulsory for all cars which are at least three years old.Its supposed to improve road safety by making mechanical failures less likely - but the Adam Smith Institute said it actually makes little difference.Just 2 per cent of accidents are caused by mechanical problems in the UK - and in the US, where theres no equivalent of the MOT, the rate is the same.The reports author Alex Hoagland said: There’s no evidence that vehicle safety inspections improve vehicle safety.”The average MOT costs £33.60 - but according to the think-tank, motorists incur additional costs of £143 making minor repairs needed to pass the tests.As well as scrapping the MOT altogether, options suggested by the report include reducing it to once every three years, or applying it only to vehicles which are at least five years old.It also says ministers should put more resources into developing driverless cars which could save lives by eliminating driver error.Sam Dumitriu of the Adam Smith Institute said: “MOT tests are meant to prevent crashes and save lives, but they’ve never been put to the test themselves."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000348140687.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"top ten irritants summer heatwave jane moore","story":"First and foremost being the Met Office’s “Amber Alert” warning to stay in the shade, drink plenty of fluids and be sure to wear sunscreen and dark glasses.Come winter, of course, they’ll once again be treating us all like morons and doom-mongering about slippery pavements and hypothermia.Luckily for them, new research revealing the top ten list of what irritates us came out before their nannying nonsense and, therefore, a “sorry we missed you” note took first place, followed by the whirring wheel on a computer and losing work you didn’t save.Life’s irritants, eh?

He said: There was never a second secret White Paper” but “ministers had a series of papers before them”He insisted “there was not sudden twist in the road where one White Paper was done away with and another was written.”Dominic Raab is highly competent and a Brexiter. Naturally, he’s the last person No10 would want involved in talks.Instead our PM and her Remainiac aide Olly Robbins will do it. Raab’s sole role is preparing Britain for the outcome.We warned Mrs May after Chequers she will not survive one more breach of a red line. But we hoped Raab would be around to keep her and Robbins honest.The omens are grim.Tory Brexiteer Craig Mackinlay said: “Quietly somewhere was  a coup detat going on.”Labours Shadow Brexit Minister Jenny Chapman said: Dominic Raab has been sidelined by the prime minister before he has even had the chance to get his feet under the table.When Mrs May became Prime Minister in 2016 she promised that the negotiations with Brussels would be led by a Brexiteer.She said: I will create a new department responsible for conducting Britain’s negotiation with the EU.It will be led by a senior Secretary of State – and I will make sure that the position is taken by an MP who campaigned for Britain to leave the EU. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The 27 EU states, or most of them at any rate, might individually want good relations with us.But, in Brussels, there are plenty of officials who would rather see all sides suffer than watch Brexit succeed.If their view prevails, the implications go well beyond Brexit. For 70 years, Britain has been a European power.Although we kept our military ties with the other English-speaking democracies, our focus was the defence of Europe. It still is.There are, for example, British soldiers patrolling the borders of Poland and Estonia.The RAF is, to all intents and purposes, acting as Romania’s air force, responding to incursions into that country’s airspace. And so on.In intelligence and security, rather as with the Common Fisheries Policy, Britain puts a lot more than its share into the common pot.We have done so cheerfully because we saw European states as our allies, and felt that we had a stake in their security. But what if that feeling is no longer reciprocated?Visiting Germany on Monday, Jeremy Hunt, the Foreign Secretary, pointed out in measured and polite language that the EU could not expect to treat Britain aggressively without consequences.Now Mr Hunt is no Little Englander. He is an entrepreneur who made his money from language courses, is married to a Chinese woman and, after some soul-searching, came down on the side of Remain.But what he said is impossible to argue with. If the EU chooses to treat Brexit as a hostile act, the basis of European security will be undone — at the very moment that Donald Trump has made it clear that America is no longer interested in defending Europe.In almost every European speech since the referendum, Theresa May has said that she wants Britain to be the EU’s closest friend and strongest ally.But when have you ever heard those good wishes returned?The PM keeps saying she wants the EU 27 to succeed. EU leaders keep saying they want Brexit to fail.They mean it. Eurocrats are not offering Britain the kind of deal that they have with neighbours such as Norway and Switzerland.They think UK will just swallow what’s offered.If we want to remain in the single market, says chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier, then, unlike those countries, we’d have to give Brussels 100 per cent control of our trade policy — an impossible condition.But neither are they offering the kind of simple free trade deal that they have with, say, Canada and Japan.If we want a straightforward trade deal, Barnier says, we’d have to leave Northern Ireland under EU rules — an equally impossible condition.In other words, Britain won’t be allowed the friendly relations with the EU that other democracies take for granted.It is not for a lack of willingness on our side. In February, Theresa May told a Munich audience: “Europe’s security is our security. And that is why I say that the United Kingdom is unconditionally committed to maintaining it.”The EU’s response? To exclude us from the Galileo satellite programme on grounds that we could no longer be trusted.Well, fine. I never saw much point in the Galileo system, which was pushed by French leader Jacques Chirac to challenge the “technological imperialism” of America’s GPS system.Britain should now either go in with the Americans or create its own satellite system, possibly with friendly states such as Australia and Canada.But the point is, the EU’s logic goes well beyond satellites.If Brussels no longer sees us as an ally, we can hardly carry on behaving like one unilaterally, so to speak.While we talk of trade and co-operation, EU negotiators talk of border queues and grounded flights.Ireland’s prime minister, Leo Varadkar, even threatens to close his airspace.If such thinking wins out, we shall have no choice but to leave Europe to itself and turn our faces, as our ancestors did, to the open seas.That is not an outcome anyone should want, but we shall be ready if it comes.Understandably enough, you might say, given what feeble negotiators we have been so far. But Britain has a bad habit of switching from vague amiability to sudden resolve when it is almost too late.Such a moment is upon us.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

We are seeking to avoid a no-deal Brexit, but departmental preparations are accelerating to ensure people’s health needs are provided in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Challenged about the prospect of a no-deal outcome, Mr Raab said that while there would be uncertainty in the short-term I think long-term actually we would still be able to thrive.But he risked a backlash after warning he had ‘no idea’ what would happen if Britain fails to negotiate a trade deal by the end of the transition phase in 2020 - adding “it was a good question.”Mr Raab told the committee it would be difficult to judge precisely when talks had reached a position where it was inevitable there would be no deal.Im confident we can avoid it with ambition, pragmatism and energy on both sides, he said.I cant give you a precise moment at which it will be clear that there is no deal.And he insisted the UK would not cower in talks with Brussels following concerns that a no-deal Brexit was becoming more likely.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Labour have argued any pay increase that is not above the rate of inflation amounts to a real-terms pay cut - not exactly something that screams \"good news\".So no surprise that pay bumps for the armed forces (2.9%) and prison officers (2.75%) are being described by the Treasury as being \"well-above inflation\".But pick apart those figures and the claim seems a little misleading.But Labour\u0027s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Peter Dowd, dismissed the announcement as \"a mendacious PR exercise\".Another point of contention is how these pay increases will be paid for.In March, it was announced that some NHS workers, such as nurses, were to receive a 6.5% average pay increase over the next three years.But, that came with a pledge of extra money from the Treasury. Tuesday\u0027s announcements do not - they will come from existing departmental budgets.The government insists most departments will be able to meet the extra costs by diverting funds from budget underspends elsewhere, and in doing so will ensure the rewards are \"sustainable without an increasing burden of debt being passed onto future generations\".As she spoke in the Commons, Ms Truss was met with jeers from the opposition benches.Labour MPs stood up to raise concerns that lack of additional funding would lead to cuts to public services and redundancies down the line."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/18/07/2048x1152/skynews-kumba-kpakima-line-18_4370007.jpg?20180724210636 ","title":"line 18 face to face investigating londons gang life","story":"The first gang member I spoke to was a guy called JC, who belonged to 410 in Brixton.He showed up wearing a stab vest.

The Type 31e light frigate was trumpeted by ministers as a cheap replacement for an ageing fleet of anti-submarine vessels. Thirteen, Type 23, Duke-class frigates are being retired and replaced by just eight Type 26 Global Combat Ships. Ministers hoped to make up the shortfall in the Senior Service with five, \u0026pound250million smaller ships which they branded the Type 31e. The “e” highlighted their hope to export it to allies. But experts warned the budget for designing and building a brand new warship was too low - and just one firm was able to make a viable bid.  Now, the Ministry of Defence has been forced to relaunch the competition to create a ship. But the \u0026pound250million budget will stay the same. A spokeswoman insisted: “There have been no changes in our plans to procure a first batch of five new Type 31e frigates to grow our Royal Navy. “We still want the first ship delivered by 2023 and are confident that industry will meet the challenge of providing them for the price tag we’ve set. “This is an early contract in a wider procurement process, and we will incorporate the lessons learned and begin again as soon as possible so the programme can continue at pace.” While officials refused to reveal details of the bids received, citing commercial sensitivity, it is understood just one came in at the \u0026pound250million limit. Sources said the single bid made an “effective and robust competition” impossible.

Seriously ill Jude Carrington suffers from horrific symptoms when he eats - ranging from rashes to extreme abdominal pain. The young boy has been in and out of hospital in search of answers. Doctors have not been able to shed light on his illness and Jude relies on a feeding tube, which he calls Harold, to pump a hypoallergenic formula into his body for 19 hours every day. His family have been given an unexpected boost after a newlywed couple decided to lend their support - despite never having met Jude, from Hoddesdon in Hertfordshire.   His family are determined to raise \u0026pound50,000 to fund research into his condition in America – and have been given a \u0026pound5,000 boost, the Hertfordshire Mercury reports.  In lieu of gifts, Stephen and Nicky Broderick asked guests to support brave Jude’s journey after they were moved by his story in their local newspaper. The pair had tried for a baby of their own for years and after several rounds of IVF finally gave birth to daughter Grace, now eight. “We were about to get married in May and we were asked about wedding presents but we thought we had everything we need so decided to pick a charity instead,” said Stephen. “Then the next day I saw the story in the Mercury and it just touched a nerve.”  The couple made a commitment to guarantee \u0026pound5,000 and their guests raised just under \u0026pound4,000, meaning Stephen and Nicky put up around \u0026pound1,000 of their own. Jude’s mum, Joanna, who said they have had donations from business, friends and strangers in the town, has been overwhelmed by the support for her boy. “We met them [Stephen and Nicky] last month to say thank you, they were just so generous,” she said.elp.” The family are now up to \u0026pound17,000 and hope to get closer to their goal with a charity clairvoyance evening in August and with the help of local football team Soccer Rules, who have made Jude their charity of choice next season. The money could help the family to finally get to the bottom of their boy’s sickness, which causes his body to attack everything he eats and can leave Jude with bloody diarrhoea, among other symptoms.  “It has a massive impact on his life — so much of people’s social lives revolve around food,” Joanna explained in April, while choking back tears. “Jude’s never had a birthday cake, he’s never been able to have an ice cream when we go away on holiday. “We’ve just gone through Easter — he’s never had an Easter egg, there are no Easter egg hunts for Jude. “At school when there are birthdays I have to leave a bag of toys for him to be given when it’s time for cake so he doesn’t feel left out. As a baby, before the condition made itself known, Joanna and dad Steven said Jude loved trying different foods.  But as they pushed forward with weaning him onto a solid diet, the tot became “very unwell” with soon-to-be familiar symptoms including severe acid reflux, vomiting and abdominal distension, where his tiny stomach bloated uncontrollably. In addition to the symptoms he suffers when eating solid food, the Sheredes Primary School pupil also struggles with gastroesophageal reflux disease and gastroparesis. This means his stomach can’t empty itself fast enough and its contents spills back up into his oesophagus, meaning he has to be slow fed continuously whilst taking numerous medicines each day. “He can’t drink enough of what he needs to live, to grow and develop,” Joanna explained. “His stomach is not big enough to take it all in so we have to give him a pump to slowly feed him throughout the day. “His life is about medical routine. It’s always stop-and-start fun because he has to think about his medicine.” But despite everything Jude has had to go through, his parents couldn’t be prouder of his fighting spirit.

Steph Shaddick, had gone to the floating Caf\u0026eacute Onboard in Devon, with her two children Barney, one, and Nancy, five. She claims she was forced outside when Barney, who was crying loudly, became distressed. Captain and caf\u0026eacute owner Robert Hunter defended his decision saying he had asked the 30-year old to take her baby to the outside seating area after he screamed \u0027for around 15 to 20 minutes\u0027 next to a queue of 20 hungry diners. He claims Steph was sat on her mobile phone rather than calming the child down - and that he is sick of mum\u0027s letting children run riot.  But the shocked mum said she was treated badly when she was made to carry a pram, a child, drinks and two meals through the crowded business, reports Devon Live .   Steph said the experience was some of the worst customer service she had ever witnessed. She explained: We went for chips on the boat, and when my youngest went to eat them they were too hot and he cried. There were a lot of foreign exchange students queuing up for ice creams at the time. The owner asked to \u0027take that screaming baby outside, this is not working for me.\u0027 He made us go outside with our cups, the pram and food. I had to manoeuvre through the students and had to sit on the side of a table outside. I felt like I had been pushed out. She added: He was just generally rude. He pointed outside and told us to go out very unpolitely, my baby wasn\u0027t being bad until then - it was just that he wanted the food. I have never had an experience in a business like this before. They are meant to be family friendly, there\u0027s a sign which says so, and its next to one of the biggest parks in North Devon.  Captain Hunter, who has run the cafe for around four and a half years ago, says he has \u0027put his life and soul into it.\u0027 Now he says he has \u0027had enough\u0027 with poor parenting on his family-friendly floating caf\u0026eacute and even has a sign which reads: No barking dogs, no screaming kids and no loud mobile phones.\u0027 He explained: We had a mum come in and the baby was already crying while strapped into the pram. He was very close to the counter and the screaming got louder. It continued screaming and two people stood and asked my wife at the counter to do something about it. But we said it is up to the mother to do something. Then a queue began to form at the counter right next to the pram. The baby went ballistic at all these tall people towering over him. The mum did absolutely nothing, she was more focused on her mobile phone - she should have unstrapped him and carried him around. The screaming was so loud we could not hear what people wanted at the counter - the kid just go worse as he was overheated and distressed.

But unfortunately there are two big things which get in the way - money and work. While we can\u0027t fix the money part, there\u0027s a company in Manchester which is helping its staff out with the work bit.  Recruitment start-up GradTouch has taken flexible working to a whole new level and is now offering staff unlimited annual leave, reports the Manchester Evening News .  And bosses have found it\u0027s having a really positive impact on their business, which is now growing faster than every.  Last year the average amount of holiday taken by their 22-strong team staff totted up to 46 days. Co-founder Zac Williams explains: We\u0027re huge believers in having a great company culture and we\u0027re pioneering a new way to work. We don\u0027t have set hours in our contracts, instead employees agree to focus only on results. We have an unlimited holiday policy and we encourage our staff to work from wherever they want, whenever they want. This includes the freedom to work from home or trendy coffee shops and only pop into the Northern Quarter HQ when they are required at meetings. The 29-year-old continues: It\u0027s not something that works for everyone. You have to be comfortable with autonomy and you have to be self-motivated to work in that system.  We got rid of contracted hours so all it says is that staff will do what needs to be done to get the job done - but in more legal language. In order for us to build this business we needed to hire people that are better than us and let them get on with their jobs. If you hire properly then you can build a culture based on empowerment and trust. Zac and co-founder Joe Twigg introduced the policy two years ago after a gruelling investment round which brought in \u0026pound500,000. Zac said: Williams said: We were building the platform as quick as we could and a lot of people were doing really long hours.

The bones belonged to a plant-eating animal similar to the Brachiosaurus, star of the film Jurassic Park, scientists confirmed today. It comes from the sauropod family of dinosaurs, which had long necks and tails and were the largest animals to roam the earth. “Bigfoot”, found near Mount Rushmore, confirms brachiosaurs lived over a huge swathe of North America, from eastern Utah to northwestern Wyoming, 150 million years ago. Study co-author Dr Emanuel Tschopp, of the American Museum of Natural History, said: “This is surprising. Many other sauropod dinosaurs seem to have inhabited smaller areas during that time.  “There are tracks and incomplete skeletons from Australia and Argentina that seem to be from even bigger animals, but found without feet. “This beast was clearly one of the biggest that ever walked in North America.” The foot was excavated in 1998 but has been the subject of study for 20 years. The findings were published yesterday in PeerJ journal. Researchers from the US, Switzerland and Germany used 3D scanning to help compare the specimen to feet from different dinosaur species.

Highland Council responded to the ad, warning her that in addition to the \u0026pound559 licence, she’d need to fill in a lengthy application form, provide formal first aid cover and explain fully how the event would impact other beach users.

She said: “Everything for kids is so expensive nowadays, I thought we could have some good old-fashioned fun on the beach and bring a few families together. “The idea was for the kids to have an hour to make their sandcastles, they would all get stickers and we would get someone local to judge the best ones.” She had thought that parents would simply mind their own children, but Highland Council told her she would have to provide formal first aid cover and explain fully how the event would impact other beach users. “I was panicking when I got the email through, thinking I might need to cancel it and the kids were already excited. “There is too much red tape and so many barriers to get through to run an event, people will end up giving up.” The event was saved after she sought help on the Nairn Rocks social media page.

Images taken from CCTV cameras at the sweet shop have been blown up to A4 size and stuck in the window.  The word \u0027THIEF\u0027 is printed above each image in large capital letters and the posters are clearly visible to passers-by. John Keppie, manager at Sweet Thoughts in Bournemouth, Dorset, said he decided to take action after police failed to investigate the shoplifting, despite being offered CCTV images. Several members of the public have also given the names of the alleged offenders to staff.  But Mr Keppie said that since the three posters appeared he has received a telephone call from the police telling him he isn\u0027t allowed to have them up. He could be in breach of the Data Protection Act (2018) and liable to a fine. His actions come after other shop owners across the country claim police have given up investigating shoplifting incidents due to a lack of manpower. In some cases there has been compelling CCTV evidence. Mr Keppie said: It was me who put the pictures in the window because I\u0027ve had enough of it now. I\u0027ve spoken to the police and I know I\u0027m not meant to have them up but until someone actually comes down and makes me take them down then they will be staying up. The thee girls came in and stole three drinks from the fridge. I gave chase and they actually turned round and spat at me. I told the police but they said they have more important things that they have to deal with.  One officer came down here and spent literally seven seconds in the shop. Their response did not leave me best pleased. I know I\u0027m not meant to have the pictures up but if they\u0027re big enough to steal and spit in my face then they\u0027re big enough to deal with it. One of the things I\u0027ve done now is send the pictures to every school in Bournemouth and Poole asking if the girls attended there. I didn\u0027t need a name, just a yes or no. One got back to me and I passed that onto the police but as yet I\u0027m still waiting to hear if anything has happened. Shoplifting is a fairly common occurrence and you can spot the ones who do it from the minute they walk in the shop. Kevin Strudwick, the crime manager for Bournemouth Business Reducing Crime Partnership, a co-operative of local business, police and council, said the \u0027wanted\u0027 posters risked turning the resort into the \u0027Wild West\u0027. Mr Strudwick said: Unfortunately with Data Protection laws you have to be very careful with what you do. Putting \u0027wanted\u0027 posters on the wall is returning to the old days of the Wild West. The CPS would not look upon it as the right thing to do and the police would also take a dim view. I sympathise with any shop which has sustained losses as they are devastating but you have to follow the laws, simple as that. It would be a different story if the shoplifter was convicted and you showed the poster to staff at the back of the store but never on public display. You also could have the situation where someone\u0027s parents or grandparents could see the poster who had no idea about what had happened, which would a great shock for them.

Designers behind the fantastic furniture - which comfortably seats nine - were inspired by the stadium-style seating at Wembley Stadium and included a smartphone holder, complete with an in-built charger... and beer-resistant upholstery. Oversized pillows also keep sports fans comfortable as they settle in to watch a game on TV with their friends. The prototype was created by the EE team who were inspired through their partnership with Wembley Stadium, to mark the launch of EE’s new BT Sport offer, which gives customers the ability to cast BT Sport matches from their phone to their TV - wherever and whenever they choose, without a contract and with inclusive data. It comes after a survey of 2,000 sports viewers found 51 per cent would prefer to watch sports with friends in someone’s home rather than venturing out to the pub. More than half say it’s more comfortable while almost a third want to avoid being covered in beer by crowds during the celebrations.  Others would rather stay away from the pub because there’s no competition for space or chairs at home and to be able to rewind and re-watch key moments. It also emerged six in 10 enjoy playing host to friends and family to watch big sport events at their home with lots of snacks and plenty of drinks on offer considered key. Enough seats for all guests is also important along with having surround sound and good WiFi. Fifteen per cent even admitted they would be more likely to stay friends with someone if they had a good sport TV package they could use when there are big sporting events on. When it comes to foods, pizza, chips and dip and peanuts were named the best choices to serve up to guests.  Meanwhile, the average sports fan plans to get together with friends six times over the approaching football season. But despite one in five saying they would feel popular if friends came to their house to watch a fame, almost one in five admit they find it hard to play host. One in four feels stressed and one in 10 even feel nervous. The new three-tiered sofa prototype by EE, was trialled by BT Sport analyst and co-commentator and former England, Liverpool and Real Madrid midfielder, Steve McManaman. He said: There’s nothing better than watching sport with a group of mates and it’s brilliant that with EE you can now cast the best action from your phone onto your TV.  You’ll never miss any of the action. When I’m not in the BT Sport studio and have people around to watch a game - I make sure the sport is on the big TV, the snacks are out and this multi-tiered sofa would be an amazing addition to mine or any sports fans’ sitting room. Max Taylor, Managing Director of Marketing at EE added: “Watching the sport you love has just become a whole lot easier for our customers who can now cast the best live action from BT Sport straight from their phone to their TV. “With the first three months access to the app for free, and the data on us, sports fans no longer need to crowd around a small screen or go on expensive pub trips to watch the game if they don’t want to. “Now that our customers can watch the games on the big screen, we wanted to see what the ultimate at home casting experience looked like, so we developed this Wembley stadium inspired sofa design – the perfect living room accessory to share our new BT Sport offer with your mates.” "},{"url":null,"title":"uk weather met office issues","story":"NewsMet Office issues weather warning of thunder, lightning, giant hailstones and strong winds for millionsA severe weather warning for thunderstorms has been issued for parts of England from Friday, as the Met Office has warned\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByBrett GibbonsRachel Bishop15:11, 24 JUL 2018Updated15:13, 24 JUL 2018NewsVideo LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in 8CancelPlay now\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailBritain will be battered by thunderstorms and huge hail stones this week, bringing the country\u0027s scorching heatwave to a dramatic halt.

The Met Office confirmed that very warm, hot or very hot conditions will continue for another five weeks throughout the UK. This means that we could be bracing ourselves for the hottest summer since the record-breaking heatwave of 1976 - which was only topped by weather conditions in the early 1600s. Detailed weather maps and charts highlight the long-range forecast, with the sweltering heat and lack of rain making this the driest spell in recent memory.  Reaching the half-way point of the meteorological summer, the daily maximum temperature is 20.9C. Meanwhile the warmest complete summer recorded saw an average daily maximum of 21C. Between June and August in 1976, the Central England Temperature (CET) on average was 17.8C, while the average maximum temperature was 20.96C. However both figures could be beaten if the hot weather continues, which forecasters say “could well be record breaking” if above average temperatures continue.  Met Office meteorologist Alex Burkill explained that the warm weather is due to high pressure across the UK. Weather maps show this could hit 1024mb within days as warm air come across from Europe. He said: “Towards the east and southeast it is going to be mostly fine, hot and sunny through next week with highs of 31C (87.8F) or 32C (89.6F) from Monday. “We expect similar values on Tuesday but as we go through the week it is going to turn even hotter.

However, there were so many laughs and great times had along the way and once they crossed the finish line, I know they were so glad they took part. I can never thank them enough for this.”Fiona, 32, added: “There were some points where we weren’t sure if everyone was going to finish – our chat group was full of messages saying: ‘We can’t do this’.“But everyone who started made it to the end – including the one girl in the group, who was a real trooper.

Even Darren O’Dea has been helping me with my defending and Graham Gartland has helped a lot and every day I’m trying to learn.“If my chance comes I’ll back myself to do the best I can.”Curran came off the bench in the 4-0 win over Stirling last weekend and is hoping to make it appearance No 2 nice and quickly against the Pars on Sunday.He added: “Dunfermline have always been a strong team in the Championship, always competing to get promotion to the Premiership so it will be a good test after they beat Peterhead 3-0 the other night.“There was a great turnout to the Stirling game so, hopefully, we’ll get another good one this weekend.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b51aaeebafbd-480x564.jpg ","title":"betfred cup ties remain vital as dundee united work to get going","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFor Dundee United, this season’s Betfred Cup looks all but over but don’t trying telling stand-in skipper Stewart Murdoch the final two group fixtures are meaningless.The 28-year-old knows today\u0026#8217s Tannadice clash with Alloa and next week’s trip to Elgin will be vital games as the Tangerines work to make sure they are a force in the coming Championship campaign.And while the ties so far against Arbroath and Ross County have ended in disappointment in terms of results, he believes they provided proof they’re heading in the right direction.“I think the thing is it’s really early doors and the manager will tell you we are still building, that’s maybe why we haven’t had the results we wanted,” he said.“We are still basically in a pre-season phase, so, for us, Tuesday was a really good competitive game up at County and gave us an opportunity to see exactly where we are right now.“It was another 90 minutes for the lads together and to help get to know each other. When you get the penalty at 0-0 and late on, if you score you probably go on and see out the game.“We didn’t and it was disappointing to lose but at the same time everybody could see the other night that already we can compete and we can take that forward. Now we move on to the next game.”And that need to be ready for next month’s league kick-off against Dunfermline means, for Murdoch and his team-mates, the next two outings are massive.“It will be difficult to qualify from our group now but we will take every game the same way we’ve always done and that’s as big ones.“We probably need to win both games now to have any chance and that’s what we’ll aim to do.“And they are another two big games leading into the start of the season in the Championship. We can get match sharpness and we will have another few boys who’ve had wee injuries back available.“It’s also another opportunity as well for the gaffer to maybe tinker with the team a bit and get boys some game time.”And, despite what the Betfred group table suggests, his belief this rebuilt United side is going to be a force to be reckoned with in the second tier, is growing.“I think everyone is confident we are building a good team and the manager will be wanting a few more players – I’m sure he’d said that.“I think the more good players we add the better we’ll play and the more we play together the better we’ll become.“It gave us confidence going to a place like County and competing the way we did. It was a good performance, it was just the result that was poor.“We are all excited about the season ahead and I think it’s going to be a positive one.”In the absence of newly-appointed club captain Fraser Fyvie, who’s likely to be out for another month or so as he completes his recovery from knee surgery at the turn of the year, the games so far have seen Murdoch wear the captain’s armband.Well aware of United’s history and some of the greats who’ve undertaken the role, he regards even having it on a temporary basis as a big feather in his cap.“I was captain a couple of times towards the end of last season and to be handed it again while Fraser is still out is nice,” he added.“This is a massive club, so to lead Dundee United out in any game is a huge honour for me.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/04/5ad079a27c007.jpg ","title":"blow for arrogant brewdog as prized local pub sold to rival beer company","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe St Andrews bar that “arrogant” BrewDog founders declared as being their next pub has been sold – to a rival craft beer company.BrewDog announced plans to open bars in the Fife town and Perth at its AGM in front of 8,000 investors at the Aberdeen Exhibition and Conference Centre in April.The presentation by BrewDog founders James Watt and Martin Dickie to their “equity for punks” investors identified Rascals Bar on North Street as the location of a BrewDog pub to open this year.However, Rascals owner Colin Donaldson denied that a deal had been done and called the Ellon-based brewer “arrogant” for the premature announcement.

Definitely not.“I think this was to do with the changes we had to make and because we didn’t keep the ball in the front and be more simple.“Nicky Clark was tired and James Keatings has just come back from an injury so he got tired.

I’ve come down from Inverness to pay my respect, and I’ll be raising a drink in his memory tonight.”Born in Coupar Angus, Gilzean is considered one of the finest players to grace Dens Park and netted an unrivalled 169 goals during the halcyon days of the 1950s and 60s.His eye for a goal was a crucial factor in Dundee’s title-winning season in 1961-62, before the club went on to reach the semi-final of the European Cup.Season ticket holder George McLaren, 73, said: “He has been such a big part of Dundee FC. My favourite memories of him are probably the goals against Dundee United.“I was shocked to hear of his passing and wanted to come here today to pay my respects. He will never be forgotten. He proved himself here at Dens and at Spurs.“An absolute legend for both clubs.”Fellow fan Daniel Smith, 33, from Maryfield, added: “There’s been a good turnout of people paying their respects here today at Dens.“He is a Dundee legend. I grew up on stories about Gilzean through the years and the things he accomplished at Dens. He still holds a number of records at Dens Park.”A tribute on the Dundee FC website stated: “Everyone at Dundee Football Club was devastated to learn of the death of Dundee legend Alan Gilzean aged 79 after a short illness.“A true Dundee legend in every sense of the word, we may never see his goal scoring like again and the thoughts of everyone at Dens Park are with Alan’s family and friends at this difficult and sad time.”He made the jump from Tayside to Tottenham in 1964 for a £72,500 fee, lifting two League Cups, the FA Cup and the UEFA Cup.As well as the dark blue of Dundee, Hall of Famer Gilzean earned 22 Scotland caps between 1963 and 1971, bagging 12 goals.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/02/58b4009016985.jpg ","title":"dundee museum set to open for summer","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe D’Arcy Thompson Zoology Museum at Dundee University will be opening its doors to the public from this Friday until the end of August.The museum features the amazing collection of the city’s pioneer of life sciences, Professor Sir D’Arcy Wentworth Thompson.

We just captured events and places that we thought were significant,” he said.“There are photos of people, of events, the arts, dance activities, things such as the New Year’s Day Dook and a lot of buildings that we thought either were significant or would become significant.“I was given access to Dens Park, for example, because I imagine in 10 years or so it might no longer exist as we know it.“I’m quite surprised at what we’ve been able to achieve.”The Tele was given access to some of the archive and the differences in city life now and then are stark.The 1916 survey features street scenes in the city centre and atop the Hilltown – and couldn’t be any more different from the snaps from 1991.Many of the later images show the city at its post-industrial peak, complete with questionable fashion choices and a City Square yet to be pedestrianised.Red Sky’s modern day survey is packed with sights that are likely to be familiar now – the new railway station entrance under construction, rusted-in tram rails on the Murraygate and dance performances in front of Caird Hall.Rather topically, there are also photos of William Halley’s mill – now reduced to rubble.Alistair Wilson, of Dundee Libraries, said the relevance of these photographic surveys becomes very clear after just a few years, giving people a fresh perspective on a city that might have changed without them really noticing.“The 1991 survey was carried out by Dundee Photographic Society. It and the other surveys act like a social record of how the city was at that time,” he said.“Looking back at 1991, which doesn’t feel that long ago, you can see so many things have changed – the way people dress, the jobs they have, even the cars on the streets.“Once the exhibition finishes the plan is that it will move about so everyone can see it.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b51f0eac1ff6.jpg ","title":"dundee people pop up shop peps up charity","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA pop-up ladies boutique in Broughty Ferry has raised several thousand pounds for charity.The shop in Gray Street has raised £7,600 for the Cystic Fibrosis Trust (CFT) in just two weeks.Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition that affects the lungs and other organs.Morag Beckett, who set up the shop, said: “It’s been brilliant.

Many Lochee folk have raised the issue over recent years.“I hope as many people as possible have their say in the survey.“The old clock brings back memories and, like anything from our history, stirs up passionate opinions.“This survey is a way of ensuring every opinion is heard.”The city council said work would begin on a new clock in 2017 but it was instead put out to the public vote.The council had previously entered “detailed discussions” with the Lochee Regeneration Forum and agreed on a preferred design with members of the community.A post on the IYN Lochee Facebook page states: “We have prepared a very short survey (four questions) to get people’s views on the potential for installing a new clock on Lochee High Street.“For those who do not use social media, or internet, staff will be out and about with tablets and paper copies will be left in public buildings across the Lochee ward.“The survey will be open until the end of August.”Visit the IYN Facebook page to take part in the vote.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b3e36d73b758-e1532432769198.jpg ","title":"within five minutesof meeting josh hewas your best friend he just loved life","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA Dundee barman and student president described as “everyone’s friend” has died suddenly at the age of 27.Joshua Gregory, described as a “larger than life” 6ft 4in lad, was known among pals as a kind person who brought people together with his infectious laugh.He died of heart failure on Friday, leaving his parents, pals and girlfriend distraught but determined to ensure his legacy lives on.He won several awards in his time at D\u0026ampA College, where he also served as president of the students association.His mum, Paulette Mill, said her son had joined the ‘27 Club’ – the age at which many talented musicians, such as Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison died.She said: “He was just 27 – it’s almost like he was too talented. He played the guitar and drums, he’d been in pipe bands, tried to start up his own band, played piano and he could read music.“And he played basketball, he helped at the D\u0026ampA, he volunteered, he was an advocate for mental health, had finished his HND in petroleum engineering – he did everything.“He was a tall, broad guy, with a huge grin.“Everywhere he went, everybody knew he was coming.”Born in south-east London, Josh moved up to Scotland when he was still young and immediately set to work befriending everyone he met.Friend John King, who met Josh at D\u0026ampA College, said: “Within five minutes of meeting him he was your best friend.“He just loved life, being around everyone – and loved banter. Total banter, all the time.”Craig Nicoll, who works at the D\u0026ampA as a sports and wellbeing officer, said Josh was his “best friend” at both work and play.“He took what he did very seriously, and he was very good at it,” he said. “He could throw himself into anything.”“Last year one of the workers came in with a Santa costume for the kids at Christmas. We volunteered him for it – and he did it. You could depend on him. You could fill a novel with stories about him.”His girlfriend, Yvonne Nessel, said Josh had the rare ability to befriend everyone he met.She said: “He had friends everywhere – Dundee, Dunfermline – even people he hadn’t seen in years from school, and thousands on Facebook.“He had taken up fishing again a couple of weeks ago at Balmule Fishing Club and there’s already talk of them putting a plaque up there for him. After two weeks.”Paulette added: “Some people could be around for a year and you wouldn’t know them as well as you’d know him within two weeks.”The issue of mental health was one of great importance to Josh.However, he kept his own issues deeply private among only a handful of his closest friends – friends who said the happiness of others always came before his own.John added: “He was so focused on everyone else. It makes me sad, knowing that he could make so many people happy, but couldn’t make himself happy. But we always had his back.”Josh will be commemorated at a special 18+ event at Industry nightclub in Dundee, where he worked.The Friday night event, from 10pm, will play his favourite music and raise money for a trust in his name promoting positive mental health among men.Yvonne said: “It’s important for him to have a legacy. I think he would be so pleased that he could still help people now even when he physically can’t.”Funeral arrangements for Josh are yet to be finalised.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the Oscars","story":"                          Swindon\u0027 own Maisie Sly has topped off her trip to Hollywood in style, after the film she starred in, The Silent Child, was announced as the winner Best Live Action Short Film at the 90th\u0026nbspAcademy Awards."},{"url":null,"title":"11 things you d only hear in Glasgow","story":"                          There are some things you will only ever hear in Glasgow or Glesga, as us locals call it,\u0026nbspand this is our definitive list of the best."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-defender-mikael-lustig-jets-back-into-glasgow-to-help-ease-defensive-issues","story":"                          Mikael Lustig has jetted back into Glasgow in order to help shore up Celtic\u0027 defensive crisis although it is thought that there will be no cutting into the holiday time of Dedryck Boyata this week."},{"url":null,"title":"number-of-pubs-closing-across-the-uk-each-week-revealed","story":"                          CLOSE to 1,300 pubs have been shut down or converted over the past year as the industry suffers amid unprecedented cost pressures."},{"url":null,"title":"aek-athens-await-in-champions-league-for-winners-of-celtic-v-rosenborg","story":"                          CELTIC will face AEK Athens in the Champions League third qualifying round if they progress past Rosenborg."},{"url":null,"title":"spfl-confirm-make-up-of-two-reserve-leagues-ahead-of-the-new-campaign","story":"                          THE SPFL have confirmed that two Reserve Leagues will operate during the 2018/19 campaign."},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-glasgow-2018-championships-are-another-feather-in-the-citys-cap","story":"                          The World Cup, Wimbledon, the Tour de France \u0026ndash this summer has been all about sport."},{"url":null,"title":"3m-makeover-for-former-glasgow-printworks","story":"                          A CITY centre office block built on the site of a former printworks is set for a \u0026pound3 million makeover.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"bid-to-change-opening-hours-ruling-at-new-glasgow-harbour-site","story":"                          A MAJOR development at Glasgow Harbour is failing to attract new shop owners because of restrictive opening hours rules."},{"url":null,"title":"the-leading-contenders-for-the-201819-scottish-premiership-golden-boot","story":"                          Kris Boyd proved age is just a number with another prolific campaign in the Ladbrokes Premiership last season."},{"url":null,"title":"greggs-to-open-new-shop-in-east-ends-carmyle","story":"                          Greggs will create eight new jobs when it opens a new East End store this Friday."},{"url":null,"title":"celtic-fan-left-scarred-for-life-after-he-was-slashed-by-man-in-easterhouse-pub","story":"                          A KNIFE thug brutally slashed a Celtic fan who had earlier offered to buy him a drink."},{"url":null,"title":"style-service-is-a-scotland-first-for-ayrshire-opticians","story":"                          SPECTACLE wearers are set to be national style pioneers after an award-winning Ayrshire optometry group launched a new service."},{"url":null,"title":"tearful-five-year-old-creates-adorable-poster-of-lost-teddy-bear","story":"                          A TEARFUL five-year-old girl has made an adorable poster of her lost bear in a desperate bid to find it."},{"url":null,"title":"was-rosenborg-coach-rino-coolen-having-us-on-or-does-he-really-not-know-anything-about-celtic","story":"                          RINI Coolen either sold a dummy the great Jimmy Johnstone would have been proud of or the Rosenborg caretaker coach doesn\u0026rsquot know even a small amount about Celtic."},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/ResizeCache/00125000/00125302-124x067.jpg","title":"Claims that electricity substation is affecting house values","story":"Residents in a remote Inverness-shire glen are challenging a power giant over a massive electricity substation that is expanding towards their homes.The 12 or so residents at Auchterawe near Fort Augustus fear their idyllic homes\u0026rsquo value has been slashed and the peaceful area blighted as the Scottish and Southern Electricity (SSE) substation expands to become one of the biggest around.\"From a tiny substation it is going to become an industrial site,\" said Steve Lanning who is leading the fight for compensation from SSE.\"For years SSE has been developing the small substation into what promises to become a huge facility. It has completely blighted the community and many homes are now unsaleable.\"He said the proposed expansion would bring the substation boundary within 30 yards of the nearest property, and 75 yards of his home.He added: \"SSE refuses to acknowledge any fault or offer compensation of any kind.\"There appears to be no clearly established legal obligation for SSE to compensate, but there is a moral one, considering the substantial financial loss suffered by the residents and the spoiling of a peaceful rural atmosphere.\"He added that the planning authority, Highland Council, has expressed little interest in helping them.Mr Lanning said that in February he was forced to take his house off the market after a year because he could not sell it at \u0026pound40,000 below the market value.The substation began growing to accommodate the Beauly to Denny power line and the new renewable energy sources in the surrounding hills.Pensioner Mr Lanning, who has lived in the glen for 11 years, said: \"The substation has been enlarged about four times.\"There are liaison meetings but they are simply PR exercises.\"This is not just about me.

stakeholders based on a range of economic, environmental and technical considerations.\u0026nbsp\"As a responsible developer, we have listened carefully to the feedback during consultation, and to minimise the visual impact of the extension, we are proposing a gas-insulated switchgear solution, which significantly reduces the footprint of the site.\"We have also purchased additional land to

how many cycles we can accommodate. The only other place for them is on the footpath.

The stones would be patterned, partly to minimise slips and also to reflect foliage patterns from trees growing on the islands.A report from Inverness City Artworks Group states: \"While it was preferable to use natural stone, the cost might prove prohibitive and alternative materials might need to be considered.\"It was also minuted that if concerns were raised regarding the cost of this feature, the high cost of \"providing basic play equipment should be highlighted.\"The group was given assurances that the design would, when completed, look like part of the landscape, and members were told that Bespoke Atelier was confident that all aspects of the design could be met within the available budget.Path improvements in the vicinity are included in the application.Company director Yvonne Elliot-Kellighan said the stepping stone forms envisaged were inspired by the shape of the Ness Islands, and the stones themselves could be engraved with botanical patterns \"creating a ow and connection between stepping stones\".The children\u0027 feature is not far from MY Ness, a \u0026pound300,000 centrepiece which was unveiled as a concept in May and has still to receive planning permission.The River Ness Public Art Project is funded by Creative Scotland (\u0026pound305,000), Inverness Common Good Fund (\u0026pound250,000), HIE (\u0026pound66,000) and Highland Council (\u0026pound106,000).At a time of heightened concern about public spending, Highland Council has stressed that the vast majority of the money for the projects comes from third parties and cannot be used for other purposes, and the council\u0027 \u0026pound106k is from capital investment and not revenue spend.Wednesday 25 Jul 2018 7:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116731.jpg","title":"New cinema proposed for the Black Isle","story":"\u0026nbspA THRIVING film society on the Black Isle looks set to take its next big step after plans were submitted for a permanent cinema to cater for growing demand.The brand new cinema, which would be located on the seafront in Cromarty, will cater to Cromarty and Resolis Film Society events and serve as a base for the town\u0027 increasingly popular annual film festival.Cromarty Estate, which owns the land, has lodged the application in partnership the film society, which would act as its tenant.The plans feature two key elements. The first is the cinema, which would be built on land close to the ferry slipway and next to an existing boat storage shed.The cinema would seat roughly 30 people and host weekly screenings throughout the year, rising to twice a week in the summer. It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0027 growing film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country late every autumn.Cromarty Estate also plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema in a bid to cater for growing business demand in the town.In a supporting statement submitted by the estate alongside its application, its agents said: \"A dedicated cinema space will allow screening all year which currently is not possible using existing buildings with poor black out facilities.\"The cinema may also be available for other users to hire for screenings, presentations and lectures.\"They added that the cinema would also \"ideally\" feature an outdoor area \"for summer screenings and festival events\".Making the case for new office space in the town, the estate said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation with the result that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"Addressing this need... will make Cromarty a more balanced and sustainable community.\"In a statement supporting the application, the film society said that a survey of Cromarty residents found that 82 per cent backed a cinema in the town and the same number would go to more screenings if the venue was better than what is currently on offer.Justifying the decision to proceed with an all-new site for the cinema, the estate\u0027 agents said the site\u0027 position close to adequate parking and its location away from homes were both positives, as was the existing vehicle access from the harbour.The buildings would feature dark metal cladding to the walls of the cinema, with timber cladding on the office hub.If the plans are approved construction could start as early as spring next year.Wednesday 25 Jul 2018 7:36 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116735.jpg","title":"Pamiloo to make its first visit to Black Isle Show","story":"\u0026nbspCAMPAIGNERS have welcomed news that accessible toilets will be installed at this year\u0027 Black Isle Show \u0026ndash allowing people with complex needs to enjoy the event.Fiona MacLeod-Chiarini, whose brother Ewan MacLeod is severely disabled, contacted the show\u0027 organisers to ask about the availability of a Pamiloo (right), a mobile facility for those with profound impairments.Rod Mackenzie, the Black Isle Show\u0027 company secretary, immediately got in touch with the charity Promoting a More Inclusive Scotland (Pamis), which owns the Pamiloo, in order to make the event accessible for the family.Mrs MacLeod-Chiarini hailed the move, and believes facilities such as the Pamiloo can be life-changing.She said: \"We are absolutely delighted that the Black Isle Show have taken our concerns on board and have booked the Pamiloo.

There’s so much in Torry and we want to bring the community together by sharing the information and its heritage.”Mark Cranston, 55, is an enthusiast of the Scottish brick industry and has travelled all over Scotland looking for artefacts and information on the manufacturing process.The retired police officer from the Borders has since launched his own website with information on Scotland’s prominent role in the industry. He said the production history of the blocks was interesting since it was “quite major” for the north-east due to the use of granite.During the early 19th Century, Torry and Seaton were known for their brick and tile works. It was in 1883 that Seaton Brick and Tile Company moved from Seaton to Torry, to part of the area now covered by Crombie Road.Mark said Torry’s bricks in particular were interesting for their arched shape.He added: “The clay from Torry was described as of ‘fine quality, and well situated for manufacturing purposes’.

These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 25","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 23/06/18, 5:52 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,Labour and the Lib Dems must recognise and respect the recent vote in the Scottish Parliament and the views of their Scottish colleagues who refused to give consent to the damaging Brexit legislation proposed at Westminster.Labour amendments to former clause 11 of the bill require consent of the Scottish Parliament unless a UK Minister ‘has reasonable grounds for believing that regulations are required for the purpose of giving effect to any international obligations’.It would be catastrophic for Scotland if Labour left the door open for the Tory Government to breach the devolution settlement.Leaving Holyrood exposed to powers taken without consent in any area connected to an international trade agreement would be disastrous. This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

John got one back at the 11th and then another two at the 12th before a birdie at the 14th pretty much saw him home and dry.

His problems did not end there, though, as injury also ruled out Gordon Whyte, Thomas Whyte and Dunky Kerr although the latter was stripped as Kyles only substitute, while Robbie MacLeod was unavailable.Caberfeidh manager Jodi Gorski had Ally MacLennan back but he was also short of players, with Jamie Matheson and Colin MacLennan among his absentees and they lined-up with the Cabers with the second team.Kyles settled into the game with a goal on four minutes. There was a scramble in the goal area where Colin MacDonald fought for possession with Caberfeidh keeper Ewen Pilcher and defender Blair Morrison, and it was actually Luke Thornton who got the final touch to put the hosts ahead.Luke Thornton got Kyles and his second on eight minutes. Sandy MacKenzie played the ball across from the left wing forward position to Luke Thornton who smashed a shoulder-high volley past the Cabers keeper from 15 yards.Kevin Bartlett made it 2-1 on 13 minutes when he latched onto a loose ball in defence and carried the ball forward before thumping it past John Whyte from a central position.However Kyles restored their two-goal cushion on 42 minutes to make it 3-1 at the break. Former Skye Camanachd player Neil MacVicar, playing in attack, switched play from right wing forward to Sandy MacKenzie at left wing forward and he rifled the ball past keeper Pilcher from 18 yards.Grant Irvine got in on the act on 55 minutes. A ball forward from midfield was brought out of the air by Colin MacDonald, who slipped it out to the right wing forward position to the onrushing Grant Irvine, who swept the ball across the keeper into the right-hand side of the net.Sandy MacKenzie put gloss on the win with a rather fortuitous effort on 62 minutes. MacKenzie turned full back Blair Morrison and as keeper Pilcher came out to clear the ball, it rebounded off MacKenzie into the net.Donald Irvine was superb for Kyles, while Grant Irvine was an instrumental figure at full centre.Caberfeidh did not perform at the levels seen when they took shinty’s top flight by surprise in the earlier part of this season.\u0026nbspMarine Harvest South Division 1Title hopefuls the Kyles Athletic second team march on, beating Ballachulish 1-0 at the Jubilee Park.Balla’s Cain MacPhee was free of a one-match ban, while Kyles were without Luke Thornton who was on first team duty.The only goal of the game came on 19 minutes and it was a superb strike from Martin MacFadyen whose 25 yard piledriver from the middle of the park gave the keeper no chance.Balla’ had the chance to level on 35 minutes when referee Callum Duff awarded them a penalty, penalising a \u0026#8216kick\u0026#8217 inside the D.Lorne Brown took the penalty and he struck the ball well enough but his effort was superbly saved by Kyles keeper Douglas Nicolson. It was one of a number of great stops by the Kyles custodian.Kyles have a five point lead on second place Bute although they have played a game more.Bute 4 Bute scored three times in the final third of the game to defeat Aberdour 4-1 in their 12.30pm throw up at The Meadows.Bute’s Craig MacKay was unavailable as he served the second game of a two-match suspension.Aberdour travelled without Cameron McCue and David McDougal.James Craig gave Bute the lead after just five minutes and that proved to be the only goal of a tight first 45 minutes during which Bute goalie Kevin Queen saved well from David MacKenzie, tipping his effort over the bar.Referee Robert Baxter pointed to the penalty spot when Ruairidh Reid was wiped out inside the D, taking a stick across the knees, when he looked set to equalise. Angus Thorburn struck the penalty well but Kevin Queen made a brilliant save to keep his side in front.The visitors were awarded a second penalty shortly after when Roddy MacColl was felled inside the box. Angus Thorburn stepped up again but this time he did not catch the ball as he would have liked and his effort went past the post.The penalty misses were a blow for Aberdour and Bute took advantage and, with some good running and quick passing, they went on to score three more times.Robert Walker made it 2-0 on 65 minutes and Iain McDonald added a third with 15 minutes remaining.Chris Lawrence made it 4-0 on 80 minutes, although there was some consolation for Aberdour when Ruairidh Reid finished well a couple of minutes later. Angus Thorburn battled to get the ball to Reid and his powerful strike from just outside the D gave the keeper no chance.Bute were sharper on the day and they deserved the win but the final scoreline was a little harsh on Aberdour in what was only their second league defeat of the season.Bute now leap-frog Aberdour into second place in the league on goal difference and the Islanders have a game in hand.Kilmory 1 MacRae Park was in perfect condition to host the local derby between Kilmory and the Inveraray second team.A large crowd gathered to watch two teams filled with youth and experience.Kilmory started with top scorer Alister MacArthur in defence and they had young Andrew Innes up-front, supported by the more experienced Hal Jones.Inveraray went with a mature forward line which included Euan McMurdo, John MacKenzie and Neil Campbell but their back five were all aged under 18.But it was across the centre line where all the action happened in the first half.Referee Alex MacVicar had a busy afternoon and David Macpherson was first into the book for a cynical challenge on Sandy Leiper.It wasn’t long before Leiper joined him, yellow carded for a late swing on his fellow winger, young Ruaraidh Graham.Duncan MacBrayne was next to fall foul of the official for persistent fouling.In-between all the yellow cards, Alister MacArthur was dictating the play from the Kilmory defence, with young Hamish MacLennan doing the same for Inveraray and the first half ended scoreless.Inveraray came out the traps the quickest in the second half. A long range effort from David Macpherson was easily saved by the Kilmory keeper, but Neil Campbell was quickest to react and slot the rebound home to open the scoring on 48 minutes.Inveraray added a quick second following a well-worked set-piece routine on 56 minutes. Euan McMurdo’s free-hit found Campbell Watt, whose movement caused the Kilmory defence problems all afternoon, and he made 2-0 with fine finish.The goal sparked life into Kilmory who pulled one back on 65 minutes when Hal Jones blasted home an unstoppable shot from the edge of the penalty area to make it 2-1 and it was game on.After getting themselves back in the game, Kilmory’s discipline let them down soon after, with both Duncan MacBrayne and Sandy Leiper receiving their marching orders from referee MacVicar within minutes of one another.Inveraray capitalised on their two-man advantage and former Kilmory player David MacAllister scored his first goal for his new club on 69 minutes to make it 3-1.Euan McMurdo finished the day’s scoring off with a well-constructed goal to make it 4-1 with 15 minutes remaining.Inveraray will be happy with their league first win of the season, while Kilmory will be disappointed with the result and the fact that they will be missing two influential players over the weeks to come.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"cinema paradiso as screen machine parks up in lochgilphead","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/07/18, 1:31 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowA familiar large blue lorry rolled into Lochgilphead recently, offering the latest movies to the public for two nights.The cinema on wheels parked itself outside Kilmory resource centre for movie buffs to enjoy on Tuesday July 10 and Wednesday July 11, with screenings of Gnomeo and Juliet sequel, Sherlock Gnomes superhero epic Avengers: Infinity War Part I and LGBT rom-com, Love, Simon.The Screen Machine has a busy few weeks ahead.

It is also the story of a family trying to reunite cousins on both sides of the Atlantic.Except this is not fiction. This is the mysterious story of James Campbell Hay Robertson, known as Jim, who was born and raised in Lochgilphead, and who was so determined to make a fresh start in America that he never saw or spoke to his Scottish family again.Why Jim would cut himself off from his family is something his granddaughter Morgan has been trying to find out and she has asked the Argyllshire Advertiser to help solve this mystery.James Campbell Hay Robertson was born in Lochgilphead and lived in Calman Villa in Ardrishaig. He was the son of the schoolmaster, a noted talent on the Lochgilphead football team and an aspiring doctor. Born in 1896, he had just turned 18 when the Great War began. He enlisted and, when the call for new officer candidates came, he signed up, becoming a \u0026#8216temporary gentleman\u0026#8217 rising to the rank of acting captain in charge of a battery of 4.5-inch Howitzers at the Ypres front. When the war ended, he spent six months in the army occupying Germany near Bonn.Jim was a smart boy, who loved his parents, and he was especially fond of his older sister Alexandria – a very talented pianist. She is often mentioned in the Advertiser as leading musical events in Lochgilphead, and was known as \u0026#8216Miss Lala Robertson\u0026#8217. According to Jim, she went off to study piano around 1910 in London or Edinburgh, but returned to Lochgilphead by the time the Great War broke out.After the war, Jim left for America and banished all of them from his life. It is here the mystery begins: what caused Jim to turn his back on his family and keep their existence hidden, from leaving Scotland in 1921 until his death in 1995 at the age of 99?Jim had a long and happy marriage and he and his wife Ruth had four boys who have grown up without extended family and under the impression that no relations existed in Scotland, which is not true. On a visit to Lochgilphead, Morgan found cousins in Furnace.Jim did share some clues about his family, but they were not all they seemed. He said his older brother William was in the Navy during the Great War, but had become an alcoholic, fallen overboard and drowned. This was not true. William\u0026#8217s signature was on their mother\u0026#8217s death certificate, signed in Aberdeen in 1943. William clearly lived a long life after Jim left Scotland and perhaps had his own family, themselves unaware of their American relatives.Jim\u0026#8217s telling of Alexandra\u0026#8217s story is even more tragic, saying she volunteered as a nurse in the war, fell in love with a South African soldier and left for Cape Town, only to die of food poisoning six months after arriving. This too was false, as the Advertiser\u0026#8217s obituary for their father in 1926 stated he \u0026#8216is survived by three children\u0026#8217, including Alexandra. Part of the story was true, however, as the Advertiser noted in 1920 that she married Henry Beck of Cape Town, in Dorset.Why Jim wanted to make a clean break with his family to such a degree he pretended his brother and sister had died will never be known. But it is possible his brother and sister lived long lives and had large families. Jim\u0026#8217s family in the United States now amounts to three surviving children, six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.Jim\u0026#8217s father, William Robertson, came from a family of printers and dyers in Bonhill, Vale of Leven, and served as a schoolmaster from 1883 to 1920. He died in 1926, possibly in Kilmun, and, according to family records, was \u0026#8216buried in Dunoon\u0026#8217, but this may be another red herring from Jim.His mother, Wilhelmina, came from a farming family in Aberdeenshire. She moved to Lochgilphead in 1874 when she was 14, to live with her uncle, Alexander Cameron Robertson, the new minister of Lochgilphead Parish Church, a position he held for more than 50 years, from 1876-1933.There is one picture which could help crack part of the mystery. It shows Jim\u0026#8217s mother with two girls and appears to have been sent to him after his move to America. Part of the handwriting on the back is obscured but reads: \u0026#8216Hannan\u0026#8217s daughter, mom and myself taken last summer.\u0026#8217\u0026#8216Mom\u0026#8217 would refer to Jim\u0026#8217s mum, \u0026#8216myself\u0026#8217 the teenage girl whose age meant she could not be the daughter of Wilhelmina or the sister of Jim. Who was she and was she part of the story which caused Jim to cut himself off from his Scottish roots?If you have any information which could help solve this mystery please email the Argyllshire Advertiser editorial team at editor@argyllshireadvertiser\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"delighted scott reclaims toss title","story":"\t\tJoanne SimmsUpdated: 23/07/18, 12:00 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowScott Rider is once again World Caber Champion, after he had to toss for it at Inveraray Games on Tuesday.The former Commonwealth Games shot-putter and Olympic four-man bobsleigh team member won in 2013, 2014 and 2016.Judges at Winterton Park declared it was too close to call between the Englishman and Peter Bouma from Holland and it was down to a single toss of the caber each to decide the honour.The field of 10 was whittled down to a final five which also included Jamie Gunn, from Falkirk Lukasz Wenta, East Kilbride and Stuart Anderson, Lochearnhead.The event is sponsored by The George Hotel, Inveraray. Donald Clark from The George said: ‘It’s good on games’ day to see so many well-kent faces and to see new faces doing well in the games.’Once face missing from the games this year was the Duke himself he and his family are currently in India celebrating his 50th birthday.The honour of chieftain of the games was given to Rear Admiral John Weale OBE RASM, FOSNI, ACNS(SM) who heads the Royal Navy in Scotland and Northern Ireland.Amongst the guests this year was a contingent of members of the German branch of the Clan Campbell Society.More than 4,000 people attended the games the numbers held up well against other years and the visitors were rewarded with fine weather.They saw two records broken on the track this year: Jax Thoirs from Glasgow set a new open ground record for the long jump at 21 ft 7 inches and Aiden Quinn of Glasgow took the open hop, step and jump to 47ft 2½ inches.Numbers entering the solo piping contests were, like many other games, slightly down. Opinion in piping circles is that resurgence in pipe bands is seeing more pipers choose bands instead of pursuing solo careers.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"fed up residents called action","story":"NewsFed-up residents have called for action to put the brakes on speeding drivers before someone is killedNeighbours hit out at fast drivers who are using the street like a racetrack.\u0026nbspShareByGary Fanning07:00, 24 JUL 2018NewsCumnock.

Neighbours hit out at fast drivers who are using the town’s Emrys Avenue like a racetrack. The issue has been discussed several times at Cumnock Community Council. Community councillors say that an accident is waiting to happen unless something is done about the speeding motorists. Residents claimed that some motorists were driving at break neck speeds coming out of Emrys Avenue onto Ayr Road. One said: “Somebody is going to get killed. “They have 20mph signs in the street. “You would be better putting 200mph signs up. “They come out of Ayr Road. “It is getting beyond a joke and police say they are monitoring it. I have never seen them. “The speed is unbelievable.” A police spokesman who attended the meeting insisted officers have been targeting the area for speeding drivers. One said: “Two officers were out there from 5.40am to 6am. “They stopped 15 drivers and spoken to them regarding their driving. “The night shift officers were out and there was variety of folk going to work. “We were using education but we will still using enforcement. “A lot of the drivers weren’t aware of how fast they were driving at that time of the day. “I would rather use education first.” One resident added: “What concerns me is that at 4 or 5 in the afternoon come out of Ayr Road is like a race track and they are racing each other.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnCumnockAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12863891.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/8898834.jpg","title":"full time ayr united can","story":"NewsFull-time Ayr United can make their Mark in Ladbrokes ChampionshipThe Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:31, 6 JUL 2018NewsMark Roberts (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMark Roberts insists that being full-time could make all the difference for Ayr United this time round in the Championship. The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12935909.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_080618maragret_12JPG.jpg","title":"meet this weeks class act","story":"NewsMeet this week\u0027s Class ActAyr United striker Michael Moffat popped along to Queen Margaret Academy to visit the youngsters who were holding a Soccer Aid event.\u0026nbspShareByAbi Smillie15:12, 17 JUL 2018NewsMichael Moffat of Ayr United pictured with the senior sports leaders (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFooty fans and soccer stars joined together for a special charity event last month.

The pair met on a night out in November 2013 in Irvine town. Catherine said: “We exchanged numbers and the rest was history. “We dated for several months before Jamie settled into family life with my little boy David and since then the two of them have been inseparable.” The couple tied the knot on Friday, June 8 at the Gailes Hotel.  “We had a Rugby Glam theme with lots of sparkle,” said Catherine. “We had centre pieces with feathers, rugby balls going down the aisle and silver sparkly table covers. “My son David wrote and shared a reading at the ceremony, which no one knew about, for Jamie about how he has made his mum so happy and how he is proud that this man is his step dad. The bride wore a strapless princess ballgown with cathedral train and sparkly cathedral veil. The 32 layered dress was MoriLee from J’Taime Bridal in Stevenston. The groom and groomsmen wore full kilt attire from Kilts4U in Kilmarnock.

And United proved that underdogs can upset the odds by finishing sixth and leaving Aberdeen, Dundee United, Dundee and St Johnstone in their wake. It was a stunning effort but McSherry, who was signed by Ally MacLeod on a free from Kilmarnock, reckons Ayr can once again confound the pundits and enjoy a great season. United kick off the league at home to Partick Thistle on August 4 and midfielder turned publican McSherry expects them to be up for the challenge. He said: “Consolidation should be the aim but there is no reason why Ayr can’t rise again and enjoy the good times that we enjoyed in the 70s.” An old team picture that surfaced in McSherry’s Wee Windaes got punters rewinding the years and reliving past glories. It was taken at the start of season 1975-76 and showed Ayr in their change kit of Barcelona strips. Proudly standing tall are, back row – Davie Wells, Alex McAnespie, Ally MacLean, Hugh Sproat, Rikki Fleming, John Murphy. Middle row – Alex Ingram, Gerry Phillips, Johnny Graham, Johnny Doyle, Hugh Cameron, Jim McSherry. Front row – John Dickson, Danny MacDonald, Davie McCulloch.   Jim recalled: “No one could work out why the team weren’t in their usual black and white if it was an official  team picture.  “We were also puzzled why there were 15 players in it, including two goalkeepers. “Then one of my regulars, Stephen Robb, came up with the answer – it was taken before a pre-season friendly.  “We wore it in a 7-2 defeat at home to Celtic and it was never seen  again. I think it was binned as a bad omen.  “These were good times at Ayr and the team was loaded with some great players. “We were the only part-time team in the Top Ten and were quoted at 66/1, which seemed about right given the teams we were up against. “I remember Ally signing me on the wall at Central Station and then telling me to look out my passport. “He told me ‘You’re going on tour to Canada next week’. It was quite a start to my Ayr career.” Only three months into that season, Ally was lured to Aberdeen and replaced at the helm by Alex Stuart who quickly appointed McSherry as captain. Ayr sealed safety with a last-day 2-1 win over Motherwell, who were bossed by Willie McLean and Craig Brown. Gerry Phillips got a dramatic late winner to spark euphoric scenes at a packed Somerset. The second season of top-flight football saw Ayr again more than hold their own.  They finished eighth in the table on 30 points, three ahead of Hearts and a distant 13 more than rock-bottom  rivals Kilmarnock.  Season 1977-78 marked Ayr’s third campaign in the top flight, a remarkable achievement considering they stayed part-time. Robert Connor, Ian McAllister, Derek McCutcheon and Iain Sim were called up from Ayr United Boys’ Club. But Ayr were always up against it and their life in the Premier League ended when they finished second-bottom on 24 points and were relegated along with Clydebank. Now as a new league season beckons with renewed optimism and a totally full-time structure, it’s time to dream again.

Prestwick Airport were delighted that the UK Space Agency (UKSA) continued to support their plans to be one of the UK’s three horizontal space launch sites. This follows the Space Agency’s announcement that Sutherland will be the UK’s first vertical spaceport, a significant step for the UK space industry. Prestwick bosses believe they are by far the most suitable spot for horizontal space launch in the UK in terms of location, capability and the thriving satellite manufacturing industry that exists on their doorstep. An independent assessment said most of the anticipated infrastructure required for space launch capability is already in place at the site, meaning that they could move speedily to achieve a licence once the legislation is defined. Airport bosses say the development of a spaceport at Prestwick is a real opportunity for the Scottish and Ayrshire economies. The spaceport project is an integral part of the Ayrshire Growth Deal and supporters say it would attract new investment to the aerospace cluster located around the airport, safeguarding existing jobs and creating many new ones. Stewart Adams, chief executive of Glasgow Prestwick Airport, said: “We are extremely grateful for the support we have from South Ayrshire Council and look forward to our continued collaboration with them and our other partners as we look to successfully deliver on our joint vision, a vision that places Glasgow Prestwick Spaceport as a centre of excellence for the space and aerospace industries. “We will be having further discussions with all our stakeholders to review our strategy and how to take our plans forward in light of the additional funding available. “We will also be talking to potential customers and launch partners willing to support operations at Prestwick.” South Ayrshire Council leader Douglas Campbell said: “Prestwick is still the most advanced site currently in the running for the UK’s first horizontal space launch and we’ll seek to use the development fund to cement our position. “Our focus will continue to be on supporting our partners to ensure Prestwick can deliver the significant levels of jobs and investment that we know can be realised.” Ayr MSP, John Scott, said: “The case for Prestwick hosting this facility is a strong one, including the availability of a 2,987m runway and many aerospace businesses already on site with and land to accommodate more.” And MP Bill Grant added: “I am delighted that Sutherland in North East Scotland has been selected for the UKs first vertical take-off Spaceport facility and equally important is the fact that Glasgow Prestwick is still in the running for a Spaceport licence for horizontal take off facilities.” The commercial space sector is worth an estimated \u0026pound3.8billion to the UK economy over the next 10 years.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnPrestwick AirportSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12953553.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Craig-Ferguson-Promotes-American-On-Purpose.jpg","title":"talk show host holds giant","story":"NewsTalk show host holds giant showbiz party at his South Ayrshire mansionAnd the telly alter egos of two of the guests were certainly more at home in a council tower block.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston15:23, 20 JUL 2018NewsStill Game stars Isa, Jane McCarry, and Tam, Mark Cox (Image: AYRSHIRE POST)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailFamed American talk show host Craig Ferguson has staged a giant showbiz party at his South Ayrshire mansion. And the telly alter egos of two of the guests were certainly more at home in a council tower block. For Tam and Isa actors in Still Game - Mark Cox and Jane McCarry - were among those clinking champagne glasses. It was staged at his country mansion near Dailly which has become the Scottish seat of Ferguson. The party follows shooting of his new movie has been filmed in Argyll. Along with 140 cast and crew he was staying near Arochar while filming for ‘Love You To Death’ at locations around Argyll and Bute.  Stars include male lead Craig, Craiglang favourite Ford Kiernan and Liz Hurley Producer Matthew Weiner - the creator of the hit TV series Mad Men, said: “Our experience of filming in Argyll and Scotland as a whole has been phenomenal, we have never felt so welcomed and supported as Americans.” Sources say the party was a grand affair, with “lots of great people.” One guest said: “Craig really put on a show and his house is incredible. “As well as actors some of the Ayrshire gentry were there. They had a ball . . . and it was so funny to see ‘Tam and Isa’ there. “Craig is a huge fan of Still Game and appeared in it alongside Jane and Mark. “While Jane and Mark had no problem fitting in to the glamour surroundings, Tam and Isa would have been completely overawed.”  Craig bought his Ayrshire property for \u0026pound2million cash six years ago, bidding over the \u0026pound1.85m asking price. The 56-year-old was once the highest earning talk show host in the US, taking home \u0026pound8m a year. He fell in love with the mansion in the Girvan Valley and was keen to have a Scots base for his three sons. The house is 336 years old and has 14 receptions and 15 bedrooms over four floors. But it also boasts facilities fit for a Hollywood superstar with cinema, games room, billiard room, gym and tennis court. Craig has kept a low profile since, but four years ago popped up to watch the panto at the Ayr Gaiety with the family and wife Megan. Amazingly he actually trod the Gaiety boards 20 years ago in a touring show, starring with the late Gerard Kelly in ‘The Odd Couple.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"true-blue-mollie-honoured-on-her-99th-birthday","story":"PEEBLESSHIRE\u0027S longest-serving political campaigner has celebrated her 99th birthday this week.\nAnd Mollie McIntosh, who is also an active of her Walkerburn community, was sent a card and flowers by the Secretary of State for Scotland.\nMollie, who was awarded an MBE for services to her community in 2009 and was named Tweeddale Citizen of the Year the year before, has never allowed age to stop he working for both Tweeddale and her beloved Conservative party.\nBorn and bred in Walkerburn, she became an active member of the Conservatives when she was just 18 years old.\nPaying tribute on her birthday this week was MP David Mundell.\nThe Secretary of State for Scotland said: \"I enjoy saying to Mollie that she is one of our most active \u0027Young Conservatives\u0027 and she still volunteers her services to her local branch at every opportunity.\n\"She\u0027s a remarkable lady who has never missed an election in her adult life, both as a party volunteer and a voter.

Galashiels has been especially hard hit, with its proportion of vacant retail units now standing at 15% representing a total of 37 empty stores.\nHawick and Selkirk lag not far behind, with 14% apiece of their shops lying empty, and 13% of Jedburgh\u0026rsquos shops are also going spare.\nPeebles, Kelso, Duns, Melrose and Eyemouth have all kept their proportion of empty shops in their town centres at 8% or below, though.\nThe purpose of the town centre core activity area pilot study is to suggest updating the council\u0026rsquos planning policy in a bid to save the region\u0026rsquos high streets.\nIn it, lead planning officer Charles Johnston says: \u0026ldquoRetailing patterns continue to fluctuate, and the role of town centres is changing\u0026nbsp for example, the increase of online shopping and competition from larger national retailers.\n\u0026ldquoThe impacts of the current challenging economic climate are being felt across the country, and these trends are not unique to the Scottish Borders.\n\u0026ldquoPlanning policy must adapt to these changing circumstances.\n\u0026ldquoIn recent years, the council has amended its town centre policy in its local development plan to adapt to such changes, and whilst these changes have helped, it is acknowledged that a further review of relevant planning policy could be tested via this pilot study.\n\u0026ldquoThere are specific immediate concerns regarding Hawick and Galashiels, where reduced footfall and vacancy rates have had a detrimental impact on how these town centres have performed.\n\u0026ldquoThis is of particular concern as Hawick and Galashiels are the two largest towns within the Borders and have a strategic economic and social significance for the region.\nThe report recommends the council tries out pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels, either scrapping or altering their core activity area status marking out the boundaries of their commercial centres to allow a greater range of activity to take place within them.\nPlanning permission is usually only granted in such town centres if proposals are for business use in keeping with the surroundings of the sites in question, but\u0026nbspabolishing core activity area status would allow non-commercial enterprises to occupy empty high street properties.\nIn Hawick, the report says, a radical approach is needed, so it recommends councillors to vote to abolish the core activity centre there altogether.\n\u0026ldquoReducing the core area completely would, in essence, allow a greater number of other uses within the town centre, it says.\n\u0026ldquoWhilst there is the threat that complete removal of the core activity area may cause longer-term footfall issues, it is considered that some significant action is required in Hawick.\n\u0026ldquoTo implement this as a test case via a pilot scheme would seem an appropriate course of action in the circumstances.\nIn Galashiels, it is recommended that core activity area is retained but that the scope of activity allowed be expanded to include professional service businesses, non-profitable institutions and leisure activities.\nThe outcomes of those proposed pilot schemes in Hawick and Galashiels would then be used to draw up similar proposals for other towns.\nFootfall figures % change from 2007 to 2017:\nHawick

minister, members of the lower house of parliament and four provincial assemblies after an acrimonious campaign.\nThe leading contenders are former cricket star Imran Khan and his right-of-centre Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Party (PTI) and the right-of-centre Pakistan Muslim League, the party of disgraced prime minister Nawaz Sharif.\nSharif is in jail serving 10 years on corruption charges and his younger brother, Shahbaz Sharif, has taken control of the party.\nThe third-largest party in the running is the left-leaning Pakistan People\u0026rsquos Party, headed by Bilawal Bhutto.\nHe is the son of late prime minister Benazir Bhutto, assassinated by Pakistan\u0026rsquos Taliban militants, whom she had vowed to eradicate.\nRights groups have warned that a rancorous election campaign and widespread allegations of manipulation imperil the wobbly transition to democratic rule and raise the spectre of bitter post-election challenges of fraud.\nThe unprecedented participation of radical religious groups, including those banned for terrorist links but resurrected and renamed, has also raised fears the space for moderate thought may shrink further in Pakistan.\nAttacks against minorities have increased in recent years.\nOne candidate, Jibran Nasir, an independent from Pakistan\u0026rsquos financial hub of Karachi, received death threats and even had a fatwa \u0026ndash a religious edict \u0026ndash issued against him.\nHe had refused to condemn Ahmadis, who are reviled by mainstream Muslims as heretics because they believe the messiah promised in Islam arrived over a century ago.\nIn Pakistan it is a crime for an Ahmadi to call himself a Muslim after a 1974 constitutional amendment declared them non-Muslims.\n\u0026ldquoI am speaking for the millions of Pakistanis who are too afraid to confront religious bigotry, he said in a telephone interview.\nHe also said that no arrests have been made of those who threatened him.\nElection officials say more than 11,000 candidates are vying for 270 seats in Pakistan\u0026rsquos law-making Lower House of Parliament and 577 seats in four provincial assemblies.\nThe 85,307 polling stations opened at 8am on Wednesday (4am BST) and will continue for 10 hours, an hour longer than in the 2013 polls.\nVoting for two parliament seats and six seats in provincial assemblies has been postponed due to attacks on candidates or disqualifications.\nThere are nearly 106 million eligible voters in Pakistan, with 59 million men and 47 million women.\nPakistan\u0026rsquos election commission reminded candidates their elections will be nullified if the female voter turnout does not reach 10%.\nThe requirement was imposed after the 2013 elections when several areas banned voting by women, mostly in Pakistan\u0026rsquos religiously conservative north west.\nSome candidates were elected without a single woman marking a ballot.\nElections will be nullified if the female voter turnout does not reach 10% (AP/B.K. Bangash)\nThe commission issued its reminder on Tuesday after veteran rights activist, Tahira Abdullah, said local jirgas, or councils, of elders from 60 areas of the country, representing 16 different constituencies, had signed agreements banning women from voting.\nCiting security worries, the election commission announced internet and mobile phone services in several districts in southwestern Baluchistan province has been suspended because of security issues.\nSome of the worst violence during campaigning occurred in Baluchistan, where earlier this month a suicide bomber devastated a political rally killing 149 people including the candidate, Siraj Raisani.\nVoting in that constituency is suspended.\nElection commission secretary Babar Yaqub told reporters late on Tuesday that threats against polling stations, staff and even candidates have been received.\nHis statement came just hours after militants threw grenades and opened fire at a military convoy escorting election staffers and voting material in Baluchistan\u0026rsquos district of Turbat, killing four troops.\nAt the request of the election commission, Pakistan\u0026rsquos military is deploying 350,000 troops countrywide outside and inside polling stations.\nWish all Pakistanis a peaceful Election Day

will monitor voting.\nThe European Union Election Observation Mission has 120 monitors at polling stations in major centres across Pakistan, with the exception of southwestern Baluchistan province where a suicide bomber earlier this month killed 149 people, including a candidate.\nUnder Pakistani law, separate seats are reserved for women and for non-Muslim minorities, which comprise 4% of the population.\nVoter turnout in 2013 was 54.8%.\n(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\u0027GoogleAnalyticsObject\u0027]=ri[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new

trapped by the threat of rising water if the rains come.The weakest is their coach as he ensured the boys had what little food was available and took nothing for himself.Sadly one of the first divers

well.Evidently the boys will be invited to the final of the World Cup itself, and maybe they can dream that one day they might play in this famous tournament themselves.I hope the teams in the final

More of the same please.It was a good day for the Argyll favourites. A positive start which should continue at Kintyre Park against Pollock under 19s tomorrow with a 2pm kick off.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.

A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.

Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.

He has been making artworks for public places since 1991 and has now completed more than 180 commissions for both rural and urban sites throughout the UK and Ireland.  Mr Goodfellow added: \u0026ldquoThis is a work of outstanding beauty that truly complements the town and its cultural heritage.  East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Arts Service formed a working group to select and commission artists to create the new public artwork. The group included representatives from Musselburgh Area Partnership, Musselburgh and Inveresk Community Council, Musselburgh Conservation society, East Lothian Council officers, councillors and other community representatives.  The artists were commissioned to undertake the work, which is being funded by Tesco with \u0026pound38,000 for each of the two sculptures, as part of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art Policy."},{"url":null,"title":"coffee-shop-opens-at-historic-tolbooth-in-musselburgh","story":"  Mr Martin, who lives in Musselburgh and played Eric in the show, was invited to officially open The Coffee Gallery in the historic Tolbooth at the Old Town Hall, leased from East Lothian Council.  The outlet is run by Gibraltar-born Arcon Patron.  He said: \u0026ldquoI have been in Edinburgh for nearly 20 years and now live in Musselburgh. So far this year I have passed my driving test, bought my first car, moved house, opened my first business and am getting married.  \u0026ldquoI was looking to open my own place, partly because I wanted to be my own boss and partly because I wanted to explore more.  \u0026ldquoI have had several people approach me over the years to invest in me, so I eventually took the plunge.  His partner in the business is John Edmonds, who opened Fat Sam\u0026rsquos restaurant in Fountainbridge in 1986.  Mr Patron said working in the old Tolbooth was special as he loved history. He said: \u0026ldquoThis building is fantastic.  In keeping with the building\u0026rsquos heritage, he is displaying coffee related antiques in the shop, including a 200-year-old coffee roaster and, to mark a forthcoming golf exhibition in nearby Musselburgh Museum, is hoping to exhibit and sell golf prints.  \u0026ldquoOnce we are up and running we are going to devote a wall to local artists to exhibit their work. The gallery is going to be a big aspect of it, he added.  Mr Patron added that it was also hoped to commit to give a proportion of The Coffee Gallery\u0026rsquos profits to local charities."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8054672.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"vision-for-winterfield-parks-future-is-revealed","story":"  Proposals to revitalise Winterfield Park, off the town\u0026rsquos North Road, have been drawn up by East Lothian Council, with a series of images and information boards on display at the town\u0026rsquos Bleachingfield Centre.  Dunbar and East Linton ward member Councillor Norman Hampshire encouraged members of the public to go along and have their say.  He said: \u0026ldquoThere is a high demand for the parks that we have in Dunbar.  \u0026ldquoAs the town grows in size, we have got to make sure we make best use of every bit of green space that we have.  A proposed theme for the park would be to celebrate the varied geology of the county.  Information cairns and distance markers could be created around a circular path.  The creation of paths, additional trim trail equipment and the retention of the putting green are among the ideas highlighted, as well as a new football area with permanent goals.  However, potentially the most ambitious aspect of the scheme is the creation of a new pavilion with access to public toilets.  The potential of a pavilion comes after Winterfield Pagoda, which dated back to the 1920s, was torn down in March last year.  Capital investment could also be made in a tree shelter belt, rural parkour \u0026ndash or free-running \u0026ndash elements in timber and additional benches and seating.  Another major project could be the creation of \u0026ldquoa low-key but iconic \u0026lsquogateway\u0026rsquo feature which would welcome walkers off the John Muir Way and into the park. That would require special funding applications.  Stuart Gibb, area manager of Dunbar and East Linton Area Partnership (DELAP), said that consultation had already taken place with groups such as DELAP and the town\u0026rsquos community council, as well as various departments of East Lothian Council.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe area partnership is supporting the acknowledgement that the town is getting bigger.  \u0026ldquoFacilities and amenities need to be on the ball in terms of that growth to ensure that we have suitable and sustainable facilities moving forward."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8055467.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scottish-open-the-renaissance-club-to-stage-2019-tournament","story":"  This year\u0027s tournament is due to get under way tomorrow (Thursday) at Gullane Golf Club and, in 12 months\u0027 time,\u0026nbspwill move just three miles along the coast as it is played at the Renaissance Club, at Archerfield.

Five of those who lost weight suffered a \u0026ldquosignificant loss, according to the report by the Care Inspectorate officers who visited the home during an unannounced three-day inspection in May.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership confirmed it had suspended admission to the home following the report, which has now been fully revealed, after it emerged last month the home had been ordered to make urgent improvements after inspectors raised \u0026ldquoserious concerns.  HC-One, which operates the home, says it has introduced a new home manager and it pointed to some of the more \u0026ldquopositive comments in the report which acknowledged staff were praised for their approach to residents.  A spokesperson for HC-One said: \u0026ldquoThe health and wellbeing of our residents is our highest priority and we take all feedback from the Care Inspectorate extremely seriously. We are pleased their full report included some positive comments about the home, particularly noting our staff team are \u0026lsquokind and caring\u0026rsquo in their approach to residents.  \u0026ldquoWe also recognise we need to do better in some other areas. To do this, we have a new home manager in place who is being supported by the wider management team, and we continue to work closely with the Care Inspectorate and relevant authorities as we implement our improvement plan.  \u0026ldquoWe are pleased significant positive progress has already been made, and are confident the home is in a better place than at the time of the original inspection.  \u0026ldquoWe will continue working hard each and every day so that we are consistently providing the standard of care that Residents deserve.  \u0026ldquoThe Care Inspectorate have recently returned to the home to commence a new inspection, and we look forward to demonstrating the positive changes to them.  Drummohr is the second nursing home in East Lothian operated by HC-One to have admissions suspended in two years.  In 2016, Tranent Care Home was temporarily stopped from admitting new residents by the partnership, which oversees adult care services, after reports of residents being ignored as they asked for help to eat, with others eating with their fingers because of a lack of cutlery or being unable to cut their food themselves, while others were seen wearing clothes soiled or left unchanged after spilling food on themselves.  The report into Drummohr said: \u0026ldquoThere was a lack of oversight and management of food and fluid intake in the home. Nineteen residents were recorded as having lost weight in March 2018. Five had significant weight loss.  \u0026ldquoWe observed instances where residents did not take their meal and nothing else was offered, teas were often left cold and untouched and one resident walked around taking others\u0026rsquo meals and drinks.  \u0026ldquoWe also noted that there was specific guidance in a care file from the dietician in respect of food and fluids that one resident could have. The instructions were not followed. These issues, together with the lack of guidance to staff in respect of monitoring, recording and evaluating intake, is concerning.  The report added that \u0026ldquosome of this lack of care could be attributed to a lack of staff.  Drummohr scored a 2 out of 5 on all four areas inspected, a score regarded as \u0026lsquoweak\u0026rsquo. The four areas were quality of care and support environment staffing and management and leadership.  An East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe wellbeing of residents is always our paramount concern and in this case we will continue working closely with Care Inspectorate to ensure that HC-One delivers the required improvements as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoAs an interim measure, we have decided to suspend new admissions to Drummohr to enable staff there to focus on what needs to be done. They will be supported in this by a multi-disciplinary team from the partnership."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8061096.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"bus-mounts-pavement-in-tranent","story":"  The 62-year-old, who was driving an empty Prentice coach at the time of the incident, is understood to have taken ill at the wheel as it pulled out from a bus stop.

WHAT do we remember of our childhood in our later days? Think for a moment of the key happy memories which have framed your childhood. They are often simple ones involving play outside. Sadly, research is showing that children are increasingly less able to explore and play in the outdoors.  There are various reasons for this and there is a horrible irony at the centre of it. We have become far more obsessed with material things, it\u0026rsquos all around us. We are literally buying into the idea that happiness is about purchase and we are passing this on to our children.  It\u0026rsquos in our brains that the economy needs us to spend our money on things we don\u0026rsquot need. We are fed an ideology that spending money on stuff is not just a pleasure but a civic duty. It keeps the economy going and makes us all prosperous. That\u0026rsquos what we are made to believe.  But the result is that more than ever, for our children and ourselves, we are enslaved to the interests of corporate profit at the expense of what really matters: simple time to be and enjoy free pleasures.  These were my thoughts as I set off for the second of this summer\u0026rsquos journeys of discovery. I didn\u0026rsquot share them at the time, and of course I stopped thinking about them as the magic of the wood engulfed us.  We began our journey amongst yew trees which surrounded the ancient kirk of Garvald. It was a scorching day and the shade of trees was such a relief. The plan was to spend the day exploring the wood and discover Stoneypath Castle.  Garvald Kirk has a simple beauty. While parts of its wall are 800 years old, it has been subject to renovation and alteration over the last 200 years. There is a welcoming atmosphere inside and I reflected that when not being used for services it would make a perfect storytelling venue.  By the door there is a reminder of how religion can change its spots. A set of jougs hangs on the wall: an iron collar and chain once used to humiliate and degrade \u0026lsquosinners\u0026rsquo by chaining them up. The victims of this would have been mainly young women who became pregnant out of wedlock.  It\u0026rsquos right that it remains there, I think, as a reminder that religion can be used as a justification for intolerance, hate and cruelty as well as a source for love and compassion. The choice of which version to adhere to is a human one.  We followed the rabbits which scattered from the kirkyard into the wood. I was surprised that the Papana Water, which flows through the wood, was so full given there had been no real rain for weeks  It\u0026rsquos impossible to be bored in a wood. Hours were soaked up under the cooling shade of the tree canopy. It was quite simply a day of utter magic. We had our picnic under the shade of two giant Scots pine trees with the sound of running water in the background. It was the only real quiet moment in what would be hours of constant play. The kids just sat for a while, listening to the running water, and looking up at the trees. It was a communion of simple joy.  The walk isn\u0026rsquot so long in distance but it took us around five hours to complete. It could be done in 20 minutes or less if you just walk. But we didn\u0026rsquot just walk, we explored. There are three bridges which cross the Papana. Each one had a different attraction. Shoes were soon off and clothes got wet but the heat meant none of this mattered. A new game was devised when our youngest, Lewis, tried to use a piece of half-eaten banana as a substitute for a stick while playing \u0026lsquoPoohsticks\u0026rsquo . The girls rushed into the river to reclaim it, but then came up with a new game \u0026lsquohunt the banana\u0026rsquo.  After spending time at various points by the river, getting wet and discovering lots of things, we finally reached the walk\u0026rsquos end: Stoneypath Tower. It suddenly appears above the trees as if out of a fairy tale, its newly restored red walls and parapets a contrast to the green we were surrounded by.  There is much history in the castle, but then again there is history in the woods and hills.  As we headed back to Garvald the kids were quieter, tired by adventure, but in a joyful way. The image of my kids standing in the water, playing and searching for fish seemed to symbolise something immemorial: a powerful and simple truth that what we really need is an immersion in nature, not stuff that hijacks our wellbeing in the name of profit.  We surely stepped on the footprints of Robert Neillans on our return. He was a well-known cooper who lived in Garvald over 200 years ago. Perhaps he came foraging here, I thought. As the water sparkled in the sunshine I reflected that the making of \u0026lsquoillicit whisky\u0026rsquo was once common hereabouts and that Robert was, according to local historian Irene Anderson, one of those involved.  We walked past the house he built on the banks of the Papana when we returned to Garvald. What tales this village could tell!  We\u0026rsquod been \u0026lsquoaway\u0026rsquo for a total of nearly six hours in a magic place. But we\u0026rsquod met only one person walking her dog. In one sense that was a joy, and the absence of litter was another.  But it was tinged with a sense of sadness that the magic is something being lost to so many of us, and indeed that so many of the magic places are themselves being lost.  But my melancholy did not last long. It was a day of joy and we thanked the wood as we left."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8067093.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"day-two-of-the-aberdeen-standard-investments-scottish-open-at-gullane-golf-club","story":"  Rock is 13-under-par, two shots better off ellow countryman Tyrell Hatton.

The early proposals, which will be unveiled to the public later this year, show about 300 homes, with a quarter of those being affordable.  Included in the plans are provision for roads and drainage infrastructure, off-site road improvements, as well as land being set aside for play areas and open space.  The Proposal of Application Notice (PAN) is the first step in the planning process, with the idea of housing on the site, off the A6093.  The land outlined for the development is identified for housing in the new Local Development Plan and, according to the developers, will be designed to integrate with the Letham Mains development.  The public exhibition will give both housebuilders the opportunity to share their proposals for the development with members of the public and other interested parties, and for feedback to be passed to the developer.  A detailed planning application is expected later this year.

Susan said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom the runner in the family and I have always done a fundraising event every year.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was a great supporter, she was not a runner herself but she would tease me about the time I had done at the event.  \u0026ldquoShe was a huge supporter and always contributed generously to what I was running for.  \u0026ldquoAfter she had the terminal diagnosis, one thing we talked about was that I would organise some kind of running thing for the family.  \u0026ldquoIt was her choice to go with Edinburgh Maggie\u0026rsquos Centre because she had such amazing support there.  The charity, which has been based in Edinburgh since 1996, offers support to people with cancer and their family and friends.  The centres offer not only practical advice about benefits and eating well but qualified experts provide emotional support and the centres offer a chance to meet people or simply sit quietly with a cup of tea.  Team Jenny, which includes seven-year-old Isla, will in varying combinations be clocking up nearly 200 kilometres of timed runs throughout the summer.  Originally, the plan was for the seven family members to take part together in the same event.  However, with the family spread out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Coleraine, it proved impossible.  Instead they are taking on half a dozen different events before combining both the distance and fundraising totals together.  Elaine, 32, has already completed the Baker Hughes 10k in Aberdeen, while Kara, 28, and her husband, Duncan, will be joined by Clare, 32, Elaine and Susan at the Run the Blades event at Whitelee Wind Farm, near Eaglesham, this month.  Meanwhile in Portrush, Northern Ireland, Susan will join Laura, 36, together with her daughters Ciara, 13, and Isla, at the Portrush Park Run.  Clare, Elaine, Kara and Susan will all take part in the Great Aberdeen Run 10k next month before Susan\u0026rsquos attention turns to the Scottish 10k, which starts and finishes at Musselburgh Racecourse in September.  Finally, Elaine and Susan will take on the Great Scottish Run Half Marathon in Glasgow, with Laura\u0026rsquos husband Barry competing in the Belfast City Half Marathon in September.  The family set an initial fundraising target of \u0026pound1,000 before increasing that to \u0026pound3,000 but both have already been smashed, with nearly \u0026pound5,000 already raised.  Susan said: \u0026ldquoIt is amazing.  \u0026ldquoPeople are just so incredibly generous and I think that is a measure of Jennifer and Maggie\u0026rsquos and the affection and respect people have for Maggie\u0026rsquos.  \u0026ldquoWe are very fortunate it is a very close family.  \u0026ldquoJennifer was very caring, had a great sense of humour and she was honest.  \u0026ldquoYou could always depend on her \u0026ndash it might not be what you wanted to hear but what you needed to hear.  \u0026ldquoShe had that ability to be completely honest without ever being harsh or unkind.  \u0026ldquoShe was incredibly supportive of the family and everybody in it.

Mrs Reid, known as Kit, told how she exchanged early memories of her nursing career and the transition into the NHS with the royal guest.  She said: \u0026ldquoMy first pay was two pound notes and a 10 shilling note. The week before national health it was seven (shillings) and six (pence).  Mrs Reid, of Haddington worked as a nurse from 1946 until 1952 and spent some of her career at Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Royal Hospital for Sick Children. The grandmother of five, with triplets in Seattle and a grandson in Saskatchewan, Canada, and a further grandson at the University of Edinburgh, said: \u0026ldquoThe Duke was absolutely normal.  \u0026ldquoHe spoke to me and asked various things about the work I had done.  \u0026ldquoObviously he had been briefed because he asked me about the pay and for what felt like a long time he spoke to me.  \u0026ldquoHe was just so charming \u0026ndash it was the thrill of a lifetime, the whole thing.  \u0026ldquoI met so many wonderfully interesting people \u0026ndash people from Orkney and Shetland, from all over Scotland, with their own stories to tell.  \u0026ldquoIt was just absolutely wonderful \u0026ndash I even got to walk on a red carpet.  Mrs Reid said that the NHS had made a massive difference to the way of life across Scotland and said she was \u0026ldquoall for the NHS.  The 90-year-old, who also met Scotland\u0026rsquos new Health Secretary Jeane Freeman MSP, added: \u0026ldquoMy first memory of work was the knowledge that the hospital was getting much busier and there were more children coming in and going out cured. Before that, the parents couldn\u0026rsquot afford medical help and were leaving it too late for their children to come in and many of them didn\u0026rsquot make it.  \u0026ldquoAlso I remember saying to the sister I was working with at the time: \u0026lsquoThe parents coming in now have lost their terribly haunted look because they know now they can bring their children in.\u0026rsquo  She told how the nurses had to live on-site in those days and would therefore tend to give up work when they became married.  Mrs Reid added: \u0026ldquoWe weren\u0026rsquot allowed to live out of hospital, we had to stay in the nurses\u0026rsquo homes.  \u0026ldquoI loved it \u0026ndash I loved the camaraderie, I loved the company, I loved everything about it.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot all drudgery and hard work, we had lots of fun into the bargain.  The evening reception, attended by 700 people, was one of a series of events taking place around the UK to mark 70 years since the health service was founded.  During the engagement, Prince William watched a short film about the history of the NHS and listened to singing by the NHS Forth Valley Nurses Choir."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8064994.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"rugby-stars-take-on-golfers-at-gullane-ahead-of-scottish-open","story":"  Scotland caps Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings faced off against South African Dean Burmester and New Zealander Ryan Fox in a \u0027rugby vs golf\u0027 challenge.\u0026nbsp  Kinghorn and Hastings kicked rugby balls around the championship course, while Fox and Burmester got some practice in earlier this week, with the rugby stars coming out on top 2-1.\u0026nbsp  Below is a video of the challenge. . .\u0026nbsp      Rugby \u0026#127386 Golf    With @LeuchieHouse and @MNDoddie5 as the official charities this week, we decided to have fun with a little #RugbyGolf challenge \u0026#127945\u0026#9971 pic.twitter/eCH0KBEjin  The Scottish Open\u0027s two charity partners this year are the My Name\u00275 Doddie Foundation, set-up by former Scotland rugby star Doddie Weir following his diagnosis with Motor Neurone Disease and Leuchie House, the North Berwick-based national respite charity of which Adam\u0027s dad Gavin Hastings is patron."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8070351.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"all-the-latest-from-day-three-of-the-scottish-open-at-gullane","story":"  He carded a two-under-par 68 in his third round today (Saturday) to lead the tournament at Gullane Golf Club.\u0026nbsp  He\u0026rsquos a shot clear of a six-strong group that includes American Rickie Fowler, the 2015 Scottish Open\u0026nbspchampion at Gullane.

Sharif is in jail serving 10 years on corruption charges and his younger brother, Shahbaz Sharif, has taken control of the party.  The third-largest party in the running is the left-leaning Pakistan People\u0026rsquos Party, headed by Bilawal Bhutto.  He is the son of late prime minister Benazir Bhutto, assassinated by Pakistan\u0026rsquos Taliban militants, whom she had vowed to eradicate.  Rights groups have warned that a rancorous election campaign and widespread allegations of manipulation imperil the wobbly transition to democratic rule and raise the spectre of bitter post-election challenges of fraud.  The unprecedented participation of radical religious groups, including those banned for terrorist links but resurrected and renamed, has also raised fears the space for moderate thought may shrink further in Pakistan.  Attacks against minorities have increased in recent years.  One candidate, Jibran Nasir, an independent from Pakistan\u0026rsquos financial hub of Karachi, received death threats and even had a fatwa \u0026ndash a religious edict \u0026ndash issued against him.  He had refused to condemn Ahmadis, who are reviled by mainstream Muslims as heretics because they believe the messiah promised in Islam arrived over a century ago.  In Pakistan it is a crime for an Ahmadi to call himself a Muslim after a 1974 constitutional amendment declared them non-Muslims.  \u0026ldquoI am speaking for the millions of Pakistanis who are too afraid to confront religious bigotry, he said in a telephone interview.  He also said that no arrests have been made of those who threatened him.  Election officials say more than 11,000 candidates are vying for 270 seats in Pakistan\u0026rsquos law-making Lower House of Parliament and 577 seats in four provincial assemblies.  The 85,307 polling stations opened at 8am on Wednesday (4am BST) and will continue for 10 hours, an hour longer than in the 2013 polls.  Voting for two parliament seats and six seats in provincial assemblies has been postponed due to attacks on candidates or disqualifications.  There are nearly 106 million eligible voters in Pakistan, with 59 million men and 47 million women.  Pakistan\u0026rsquos election commission reminded candidates their elections will be nullified if the female voter turnout does not reach 10%.  The requirement was imposed after the 2013 elections when several areas banned voting by women, mostly in Pakistan\u0026rsquos religiously conservative north west.  Some candidates were elected without a single woman marking a ballot.  The commission issued its reminder on Tuesday after veteran rights activist, Tahira Abdullah, said local jirgas, or councils, of elders from 60 areas of the country, representing 16 different constituencies, had signed agreements banning women from voting.  Citing security worries, the election commission announced internet and mobile phone services in several districts in southwestern Baluchistan province has been suspended because of security issues.  Some of the worst violence during campaigning occurred in Baluchistan, where earlier this month a suicide bomber devastated a political rally killing 149 people including the candidate, Siraj Raisani.  Voting in that constituency is suspended.  Election commission secretary Babar Yaqub told reporters late on Tuesday that threats against polling stations, staff and even candidates have been received.  His statement came just hours after militants threw grenades and opened fire at a military convoy escorting election staffers and voting material in Baluchistan\u0026rsquos district of Turbat, killing four troops.

They found 16,000 jobs were lost across Scotland with just five out of 32 local authorities reporting an increase.  The SRC has called on local and national government to take rapid action to influence the pace of change and buy time for new investments.  CBI Scotland director Tracy Black said said more needs to be done to support business growth and long term investment to breathe new life into town centres including a \"more competitive\" business rates regime.    \u0026ldquoThe figures obviously give cause for concern, with many of the firms affected having a large economic footprint in local communities \u0026ndash particularly in terms of jobs. Not only are we seeing the sustained impact of tough conditions for retailers but also major changes in the way that people shop,\" she said.  Stuart Mackinnon, external affairs manager for the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) in Scotland, said it was time to re-examine the Scottish Government\u0027s town centre review to find out if public bodies are abiding by the \u0027town centre first\u0027 principle agreed four years ago.    \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos independent shops on our high streets are under pressure, mostly due to changing shopping habits, the collapse of many big retail chains, and the withdrawal of many big private and public organisations from our town centres,\" he said.  \u0026ldquoTo ensure that our local places are a success in the years to come we need more diverse local high streets with a broad base of retail and non-retail, big business and small business, and private and public.  \u0026ldquoIn some areas, there\u0026rsquos a glut of now empty chain stores but a shortage of housing or offices. We need to examine what the barriers are to putting these premises to better.\"  Among those bucking the trend were Midlothian and East Dunbartonshire with retail employment rises of 14.71 per cent and 2.78% respectively.  The average drop in shop jobs across Scotland was 6.3%, which Edinburgh and Aberdeen were above but Dundee and Glasgow fell below.  The worst falls were in Inverclyde, which lost of quarter of its retail workforce, and Falkirk, which fell by 27.27%.  The SRC found some link between falling shop numbers and a reduction in retail employment, with Falkirk having the highest reduction in shop numbers at 15.24% and Inverclyde shortly behind at 14%.  Across Scotland, only three local authorities - East Lothian, East Dunbartonshire and Midlothian - recorded a rising number of shops.  Ewan MacDonald-Russell, SRC head of policy, called for more action, including scrapping plans to charge extra business rates on out-of-town shopping centresand for more councils to use a discretionary rates relief system.  \"This analysis demonstrates how retail change is affecting the whole of Scotland, but in very different ways,\" he said.    \"For some communities this is leading to new opportunities with investment in new jobs, more productive and interesting work, and different business models.  \"However, we should not be blind to the serious repercussions these changes can have for local communities.  \"We are seeing shop closures and job losses which will reduce retail involvement in some town centres.  \"That change is inevitable, and presents a real challenge to government and local authorities.  \"They have the power to influence the pace of change, buying time for new investment and developments, but only if the scale of this transformation is recognised, and swift and coordinated action taken.\"  Scottish Labour\u0027s economy spokesperson Jackie Baillie said the figures were \"troubling\" and that it would look to support more retail apprenticeships and create a dedicated minister for small business as part of a plan to \"make the economy work for the man, not the few\".  \"The SNP has failed to support Scotland\u0027s high streets and small businesses for too long, damaging our wider economy and employment levels. That is unacceptable.  \"Scottish Labour has been calling for a retail strategy for some time now and the SNP has responded at a glacial pace. This level of complacency is shocking.\"  Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie added: \u0026ldquoWe need a transformational investment in education to deliver the highly skilled high wage Scottish economy of the future.  A Scottish Government spokesman said: \"We want local authorities to do all that they can to support businesses in their high streets, including giving full consideration to any request to use their powers to create local business rates relief or using any additional income they generate through the Business Rates Incentivisation Scheme.  \"We are doing all we can to support the Scottish economy, including maintaining a competitive non-domestic rates regime for businesses in Scotland and we provide the most competitive rates relief in the UK, worth around \u0026pound720 million, including the Small Business Bonus Scheme, which alone lifts 100,000 properties out of rates altogether.\"  The study also showed that Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow had fewer shop closures than the Scottish average of a 7.55% reduction while Stirling recorded a 9.23% drop.  Retail turnover analysis proved slightly more positive, with Edinburgh and the Lothians recording strong growth over the seven years of between 23% and 56%.  The Scottish average was a 8.8% increase but turnover fell in 11 local authorities, with Inverclyde the worse, down by almost half (48.76%)."},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-set-to-enjoy-new-renewable-energy-boom","story":"  UK Ministers yesterday announced that wind power projects on some of Scotland\u0027s furthest-flung outposts will be able to apply for subsidies which would remove the element of financial risk that comes with building away from the mainland.  The amount of offshore wind around the UK is also set to double in the next decade after the Government confirmed support for the industry.  A new auction for companies to bid for subsidies for offshore wind farms will take place in May next year, with auctions every two years, providing up to \u0026pound557 million in support.  Island schemes will become eligible for a \"Contract for Difference\" (CfD) with the UK Government, which covers the shortfall between the cost of investing in infrastructure in remote locations and the average market price for electricity in the UK market.  This ensures electricity generators have stable revenues while customers are insulated against rising bills.  Many Scottish islands are ideal locations for the development of wind power given their naturally stormy environments.  Now ministers have announced that for the first time, onshore wind farms on remote islands such as Shetland and Orkney will also be able to compete in the auctions.  The move could deliver up to an additional two gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind per year in the 2020s, to bring total capacity up to 30GW by 2030 from current levels of 7GW in operation, and 7GW in construction or with contracts.  That will be enough to meet more than a third of the UK\u0027s power needs, boosting jobs and cutting costs for consumers, industry bosses said  Industry body RenewableUK\u0027s chief executive Hugh McNeal said: \"Boosting our ambitions for offshore wind is win-win for consumers, as the industry\u0027s success at cutting costs mean that offshore wind is now one of the cheapest options for new power in the UK.  \"Today\u0027s announcement confirming the budget and timing of new auctions, sets us on the path to deliver the tens of billions of pounds of investment that will be needed to meet our ambition of at least 30 gigawatts by 2030.  \"This is good news for domestic supply chain which can look forward to a pipeline of new offshore wind projects that will support tens of thousands of jobs across the UK.\"  The auction system has seen the price for electricity from offshore wind more than halve in just a few years to as low as \u0026pound57.50 per megawatt hour of power.  One scheme which could see a huge benefit from securing a CfD is the proposed Viking windfarm on Shetland, a 103 turbine windfarm being built by the community in partnership with power company SSE.  Shetland\u0026rsquos vast oil fund which was set up in the late 1970\u0026rsquos has a half stake in a planned 103 turbine wind farm on the islands which would raise around \u0026pound10 million a year for the local community.  UK Government Minister for Scotland Lord Duncan said: \"Wind projects in the remote islands of Scotland have the potential to generate substantial amounts of electricity and cut emissions, supporting economic growth and delivering lasting benefits for communities.  \"Enabling these projects to compete in future auctions will reinforce the UK\u0027s position as a world leader in renewable generation, as well as providing Scottish jobs in any projects supported.  \"I urge local communities, developers and other stakeholders to work together to ensure that such projects deliver lasting benefits to the islands.\"  Energy and Clean Growth Minister Claire Perry said: \"The UK renewables sector is thriving, with more offshore wind capacity here than anywhere else in the world and 50% of electricity coming from low-carbon sources last year in what was our greenest year ever.  \"For the last decade the Offshore wind industry has been a great British success story: increasing productivity, raising earnings and improving lives in communities across the UK and today the sector gets the certainty it needs to build on this success through the next 10 years.\"  Sir John Armitt, the chairman of the Government\u0027s independent advisory National Infrastructure Commission, welcomed the announcement of a long-term pipeline of support for offshore wind, which he said would help give investors confidence in the market and maintain the UK\u0027s leading position in the sector.  But he urged: \"But if renewables are to make up at least 50% of our energy mix by 2030, I would urge ministers to go even further and extend this support to other technologies including onshore wind and solar power.\""},{"url":null,"title":"new-tourist-route-for-scotlands-most-southerly-tip","story":"  The Rhins of Galloway Coast Path will be a 64-mile coastal walking route from the Mull of Galloway to Loch Ryan for visitors to explore and enjoy the rich natural and cultural heritage of the peninsula.

Such is the demand for Scots products, the Chinese even have their own names for Highland Games, strongman kilty party, baa baa pudding, haggis and malt whisky which they cryptically call Trail Fragrant Liqueur Lane. Now as the Chinese spending power grows, wealthy tourists are being offered bespoke tours which are aimed at boosting visitor numbers, as well as selling more to China.  Chinese visitor numbers to the UK are expected to rise by almost 50% - from 260,000 to 384,000 - over the next five years, VisitBritain predicts.  Scotland currently accounts for almost one fifth (17%) of all of those coming to the UK from the country.  VisitScotland says the rise in visitors from China is expected to be driven by the young adult traveller, saying \u0026ldquomillennials are seen as a growing target market.  New figures show how important Chinese tourists are becoming to the Scottish economy. Spending by Chinese tourists increased by 414% between 2007 and 2016, from \u0026pound7 million to \u0026pound36 million.  Over the same period the number of Chinese visitors to Scotland increased by 192% 41,000 visits were recorded in 2016.  Pernod Ricard is targeting the country\u0026rsquos younger generation and its expanding middle classes who have higher disposable incomes.  More than 750 Chinese tourists will land later this week for a four-day tour that will see them immerse themselves in all aspects of Scottish culture.  They will visit the most famous whisky region of Speyside where they will tour the Strathisla Distillery, the world-renowned Glenlivet Distillery which was the first licensed one in the area and then Aberlour.  The visitors will also be invited to don kilts and sashes at a Highland dinner where they will have the opportunity to taste some of the best Scotland has to offer. Other excursions will include a trip to Loch Ness to try to spot the famous monster and no trip to Scotland would be complete without a visit to a football match and the group will take part in a tournament at Inverness Caledonian Thistle\u0026rsquos stadium.  The trip is part of a drive to improve sales in the vast Communist state with the country representing more than half of the global whisky trade with 25 bottles of Scotch exported to China every minute.  Neil MacDonald, Brand Experience Director, Chivas Brothers, said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted to be able to host our colleagues from China and show them all the wonderful sights and industries we have to offer here in Scotland.  \u0026ldquoVisiting the birthplace of our brands and becoming immersed in their craftsmanship and heritage really is the best way to understand what makes each of them unique.  \u0026ldquoThe experiences that our Chinese colleagues have in Scotland, the people they meet, the Scottish celebrations and being at our distilleries will fuel their personal story-telling to colleagues, consumers and trade back in China.  \u0026ldquoThis creates even stronger opportunities for our brands and Scotch whisky as a whole.  \u0026ldquoChina is a very important market for us, and we expect its significance will only continue to grow over the coming years.  \u0026ldquoBy fostering even stronger ties with our colleagues, we\u0026rsquore confident this trip will help us build on our solid partnership for the future.  It comes as the number of visitors travelling to the UK from China is expected to soar from fewer than 500 in 1996 to almost 500,000 by 2026, a report from VisitBritain states.  Chinese tourists spent more than \u0026pound513 million in the UK last year, but the figure is set to rise sharply.  Visits abroad have more than doubled in five years, from about 41 million overnight stays in 2011 to 85 million by 2016. By 2020 it is forecast to exceed 110 million trips overseas, In Scotland, visitor numbers have been boosted by the popularity of whisky, which has resulted in a surge of visits to distilleries.  The number of visitors to Scotland\u0026rsquos distilleries reached an all-time high of 1.7 million in 2016, an increase of 8% on the previous year, and the Scotch Whisky Association recognises the Chinese influx played a part in this increase.  Research shows the average age of Chinese visitors to the UK is younger than the average age of inbound travellers.  In 2016, half of Chinese visitors were aged 25-44 and it is estimated that 60% were aged 18 to 34.  Edinburgh, Glasgow and Inverness are known to be the favourite locations in Scotland for Chinese travellers to visit.  A growing number of Chinese have an estimated \u0026pound20million or more in liquid financial assets who are below the age of 30.  Whisky sales in China leapt in 2017 with imports of 17.4 million litres, representing a year-on-year growth of 19.5%.  Whisky is the third most popular alcoholic drink among Chinese people, with consumption growing more than 83% over the past five years."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/6863338.jpg?type=article-full","title":"utterly-shocking-blow-to-scots-shipbuilding-as-plan-for-new-frigates-is-halted","story":"  A team led by Rosyth yard owners Babcock,\u0026nbsp had unveiled a proposal for the \u0026pound1.25 billion Type 31e general purpose light frigate programme just last month.

SNP Defence spokesman Stewart McDonald MP said that news was \"utterly shocking\".    He said:\u0026lsquo\u0026rsquoSuspending this vital programme on the very last day of parliament is the kind of thing we have grown to expect from this deeply cynical untrustworthy government \u0026ndash but it is still utterly shocking.  \"The Ministry of Defence has been unable to answer the most basic questions about the cost of this new Type 31e frigates and today they have had to own up to their own chaotic failures.  \u0026lsquo\u0026rsquoThis has deeply serious consequences for our naval defence capabilities and the future of the shipbuilding across the UK.  \u0026lsquo\u0026rsquoTime after time the Tories make claims about shipbuilding being safe in their hands only for the workforces to be hammered by u turns - lies and broken promises.

It\u0027s disappointing that the Secretary of State did not choose to inform the house.  \"Just as we have seen with the Fleet Solid Support ships the Government is failing to support our industry and provide the\u0026nbspreassurance needed for our shipbuilding industry to invest to be world class.\u0026nbsp  \"We have a huge opportunity to achieve that with Type 26 being built on the Clyde and Type 31e, yet their adherence to free-market dogma above all else is squandering it going back to the bad old days of insecure jobs and lack of investment that plagued our shipyards through the 1990s.\"  It appears that the Type 31e project is not completely dead, as the MoD says it will seek a new \u0026ldquostreamlined competition as soon as possible.    Scottish Conservatives leader Ruth Davidson said during the 2016\u0026nbspHolyrood\u0026nbspelection campaign\u0026nbspthat the \"light frigate order\" would definitely be going to the Clyde.  In a statement the MoD said: \"Making this decision now and starting a new procurement is the right thing to do to deliver the best outcome. We will present plans for a new streamlined procedure imminently.\"  The MoD added:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoThere have been no changes in our plans to procure a first batch of five new Type 31e frigates to grow our Royal Navy.  \"We still want the first ship delivered by 2023 and are confident that industry will meet the challenge of providing them for the price tag we\u0026rsquove set.  \"This is an early contract in a wider procurement process, and we will incorporate the lessons learned and begin again as soon as possible so the programme can continue at pace.  The decision to move to Type 31e came after the MoD undertook a shake up two years ago of how warships will be built for the Royal Navy that aimed to spread the work around the country.  Proposals floated by industrialist Sir John Parker in his review of the sector in 2016 were backed by the Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon in a move intended to deliver budget vessels to the British military that are also aimed at being attractive to foreign buyers.  Under the National Shipbuilding Strategy, Britain were to buy five \u0026ldquoType 31e general purpose frigates \u0026ndash a cut-price warship \u0026ndash to bolster the Royal Navy\u0026rsquos depleted fleet, with the first one intended to enter service in 2023.  Sir John recommended the new vessels be built at shipyards around the country, using the \u0026ldquomodular system employed to construct the huge Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carriers.  This saw giant blocks fabricated at sites around the UK, before being towed to Rosyth in Scotland were they were integrated into the 65,000-tonne ships by the Aircraft Carrier Alliance, made up of BAE Systems, Babcock and Thales working with the MoD.  Announcing the plan, the MoD said a \u0026pound250m-per-ship price cap had been set for the vessels, which were revealed in the last defence review when the Government said it would purchase only eight of the more capable Type 26 frigates, with the Type 31 making up numbers."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/2275658.jpg?type=article-full","title":"estate-agents-latest-casualties-on-the-high-street","story":"  But just as those businesses have slowly retreated from formerly vibrant town centres, it now appears that estate agents are following suit.  New research has found that failures among property businesses are on the rise in the UK, with more than 50 going bust each year in Scotland since 2013.  Across the border the situation is even worse, with 2,446 estate agents in England and Wales closing their doors during the same time frame as they come under pressure from rising costs and competition from the internet, according to research by property management firm DJ Alexander.  And it may be that office-based estate agents are going for good, with researchers finding \"generational\" shift in the way people look for property.    David Alexander, managing director of DJ Alexander Ltd, explained: \"For most people under 40-years-old, the idea of wandering from shop to shop in city centres\u0026rsquo is alien to them and they conduct many of their purchases on their phones, tablets, or computers.  \"This situation is only likely to continue, and we can see that High Street outlets such as estate agents are suffering as a result and will continue to suffer over the next few years.  \"Online competition has had a dramatic impact on the High Street with its lower cost base and its generational and cultural shift from on street to online shopping.  \"The internet has undercut much of the High Street in the retail and other sectors over the last five years and this is likely to continue.  The research covers a period when exclusively online estate agents such as Purple Bricks became established, proving that the model does work.    By cutting out bricks-and-mortar premises and handling everything electronically, firms such have these have been able to cut costs while serving clients needs, Mr Alexander said.  He added: \"The loss of the High Street estate agent does not mean less service, in fact it means more, with a greater focus on the needs of the client.  \"The online client is simply using a different method of accessing the housing market, but their demands remain as high, if not higher, than before.  \"But the market remains buoyant for those offering clients an up to date online service fully catering for all their needs from initial advice, consulting, managing, advertising, and promoting with their key legal and financial needs met.  \"It is a brave new world but one in which estate agency will continue to exist but not in the way it has in the past and these failures are a sign that there will be closures along the way as the market adjusts.  Gavin Mochan, Sales Director for s1Homes, said that the rise of online estate agents had gathered pace in recent years.  He said: \"Initially, when online portals came to pass the pure online agent seemed inconceivable given some of the key ingredients were missing.  \"A great example of a missing fundamental was data. Back then finding out how much your house was worth was reliant on the local knowledge of your estate agent and the process was purely physical.  \"These days portals such as s1homes can tell you the purchase price of every house in the street giving you very credible estimates.\"  However, he said that the estate agents who are doing best are those who have developed a hybrid approach using both an online and a physical presence.  Andrew Perratt, Head of Residential Property at Savills in Scotland agrees, saying that even with their wide-reaching work on the web, there is little substitute for a face-to-face meeting.    He said: \"Savills is currently seeing the strongest market in Scotland for a decade and having a powerful website with global reach is more important than ever.  \"That said, it is ultimately about listening to our clients and our research tells us that they continue to want the convenience of their agent on the high street.  \"The most successful agents are combining the benefits of powerful online marketing with a first class personalised service from people they can actually meet face to face.  He added: \"You can\u0026rsquot do that by hiding behind a pc. As long as consumers want the convenience of speaking to a local agent with in depth local market knowledge, we\u0026rsquoll continue to offer a branch network which puts our agents at the heart of their local communities.\"  Malcolm Leslie, Head of Residential Agency for Strutt \u0026amp Parker in Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoThere is no doubt that businesses across every sector need to adapt to a changing marketplace and find ways of responding to new challenges.  \"The residential property sector has recently been going through a visible period of disruption and change, with the \u0026lsquoonline\u0026rsquo agency models reaching the headlines, and \u0026lsquoproptech\u0026rsquo companies appearing at a rapid pace.  \"To ensure we stay in touch with our clients\u0026rsquo needs and expectations, we are responding and adapting to those challenges through the use of that technology.\"  He added:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoWe think there is a place in the future \u0026nbspfor both online\u0026nbspagents and traditional agents.  \"There will be sellers who choose to market their properties online, which realistically allows vendors to sell their home themselves, and those who are willing to pay for a complete service, with the additional hope that having a dedicated expert will result in a better sale and higher price."},{"url":null,"title":"questions-piling-up-over-scots-tory-donations-says-snps-pete-wishart-as-david-mundell-insists-rules-followed-assiduously","story":"  The escalating row centres on the role of the Scottish Unionist Association Trust[SUAT], which has given the Tories in Scotland nearly \u0026pound320,000, and which is now being examined by the Electoral Commission, the elections watchdog, to see whether or not it is a permissible donor. Critics have branded SUAT donations \u0026ldquodark money.  The SNP\u0026rsquos Pete Wishart has written to the commission to enquire about the extent of the SUAT\u0026rsquos property portfolio, which, he suggested, could disbar it from being a permissible donor.  The backbench MP has called on Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Conservative leader, to reveal if any of the SUAT donations were used in the 2017 General Election campaigns of Tory MPs John Lamont, David Duguid and Douglas Ross, all of whom took seats from sitting Nationalist candidates last year.  Asked on the BBC\u0026rsquos Good Morning Scotland programme if SUAT cash was used to fight seats in the General Election, Mr Mundell said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Conservatives have registered and appropriately declared and set out all the funding they have received from the SUAT and all other sources of funding.  The Scottish Secretary made clear he had not personally received cash from the SUAT and stressed that he was confident that all money received during his time in politics had been \u0026ldquoappropriately declared and that the Scottish Conservatives had followed the rules \"assiduously\" if anyone had evidence to the contrary, they should take it to the commission, he added.  But Mr Wishart insisted Mr Mundell\u0026rsquos responses had failed to provide a satisfactory explanation over whether or not the Scottish Tories had \u0026ldquoused dark money in last year\u0026rsquos General Election to bankroll campaigns in key target seats.  The Perth MP went on: \"Transparency over party financing is absolutely essential in any healthy democracy the public need to have a clear understanding of who helped put their elected representatives into office.  \"As each day passes, more and more questions are piling up for the Scottish Tories it is time for Ruth Davidson to break her silence and answer the questions that her colleagues are refusing to answer.  \"Was dark money used in last year\u0026rsquos election campaign? And if it was, are the Tories satisfied that the election expense returns of John Lamont, David Duguid and Douglas Ross were correctly completed?

Male users were more likely to report feeling sad because they are missing out on adventure and exploration.  Researchers from the Universities of Edinburgh, Exeter and Falmouth, and Stockholm School of Economics analysed data from people aged between 18 and 70 years old.  They found negative emotions prompt differing reactions among photo browsers according to their age.  Older users \u0026ndash those born before 1980 \u0026ndash said travel envy motivates them to book a holiday.  Those born after 1980 said they were more likely to go on a digital detox and cut down on their Facebook use.  The younger users also report feeling motivated to do other things to make them happy, such as shopping online or revisiting their own snaps from previous holidays.  Lead Researcher Dr Ben Marder, at the University of Edinburgh Business School, said: \u0026ldquoThese findings help us understand the emotional and behavioural outcomes of viewing travel posts.  \u0026ldquoThey show how those somewhat idyllic posts by friends on social media are likely to make us feel sad in our own lives and take measures to make us feel happier.

While I appreciate that Inverness is the larger and most busy airport, there is a real public perception that, at present, Inverness gets a lot of public money spent on it in terms of development and jobs, to the detriment of other regional airports.The Caithness, Sutherland and Ross MSP added: \u0026ldquoI have consistently made the case that Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport should be considered as a real possibility for the future of the air traffic control service in the Highlands, not least because of the real benefit and impact it would have on the socio-economic climate of the county.\u0026ldquoWe need sustainable, quality jobs and I am worried that this decision will limit many who have seen themselves as having a career in the aviation industry in the Highlands to only being based in Inverness.Mrs Ross added: \u0026ldquoIn May, the rural economy and connectivity committee, of which I am vice-chair, took evidence on this issue and were assured by the then minister, Humza Yousaf, that a full consultation and scoping exercise would take place and that there would be no decisions made until this work was carried out.\u0026ldquoI was very disappointed to learn of the decision to base the new service in Inverness, which seems like a real kick in the teeth to smaller airports that have been working hard to train, support and develop the expertise in their ATC staff.Trudy Morris, chief executive of the Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was also unhappy with the decision.She said: \u0026ldquoWe were extremely disappointed by the Hial board\u0026rsquos decision to select Inverness in principle as the location for a planned centralised air traffic management facility. Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport would have made an excellent base for this facility, and would have offered an opportunity for Hial to reverse the trend of centralisation of public services in Inverness.\u0026ldquoIt is our understanding that Inverness offered significant benefits to Hial with regard to retention of existing and recruitment of new staff, and we can appreciate why this proved to be a significant factor in the decision-making process. Unfortunately the end result will be a loss of skilled jobs from the rural communities which most need them.Ms Morris added: \u0026ldquoAt a time when the future for the north Highlands is looking bright, with significant investments in oil and gas, renewables, tourism and indeed the airport itself, we feel this is a missed opportunity to maximise these. We will be working closely with Hial, public agencies and local businesses over the coming years to understand and address the impact that this decision will have on the north Highlands.Inverness was picked as the preferred location for a new state-of-the art air traffic control centre following a study by consultants.Wednesday 25 Jul 2018 7:38 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"New record set for Lands End to John OGroats cycle run","story":"THE record for cycling from Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats has been broken by Michael Broadwith.The 40-year-old from Hertfordshire did the marathon bike run in 43 hours, 25 minutes and 13 seconds \u0026ndash more than 30 minutes faster than the previous record held by Gethin Butler.His record of 44 hours, four minutes and 19 seconds had stood for 17 years.Veteran local cyclist Alasdair Washington was a record-keeper for the Road Records Association (RRA) at the north end of the trip.Mr Broadwith, a maths teacher, joins a select number of people to break the record since George Mills, riding a penny-farthing, made the first successful end-to-end attempt in 1886.Broadwith also broke the RRA 24-hour record with 507.511 miles covered at an average speed of 21.1 miles per hour.Bill Mowat, vice-chairman of the Dunnet and Canisbay Community Council, congratulated Mr Broadwith on his remarkable achievement.The women\u0026rsquos record holder is Lynne Taylor who lives in the West Midlands. \u0026ldquoShe is the only one with a Canisbay parish relative to do so, said Mr Mowat, who pointed out that the RRA only recognised female racers in the late 1930s.

Its expertise is thought to have formed part of the case for siting the facility at the Moine, which is about 40 miles west of Dounreay.Cavendish Dounreay Partnership (CDP) and its subsidiary Dounreay Site Restoration Ltd (DSRL) have invested resources in the spaceport proposal as part of its bid to identify and develop new jobs after the closure of the plant.Mr Craig said: \u0026ldquoEvery single one of us here at Dounreay recognises the importance of seizing opportunities like these to create new job opportunities, not just for this generation but the one that follows when Dounreay is gone.He added: \u0026ldquoOur skill sets in engineering, environmental science, programme management and a range of technical disciplines are easily transferable to industries such as the space sector and I am committed to working closely with the developer and operator to make the most of this amazing opportunity for our people.CDP chairman Simon Bowen said: \u0026ldquoDecommissioning a complex nuclear site like Dounreay is about more than getting it into a state that is safe for future generations \u0026ndash it is also about securing the social and economic prosperity of future generations.\u0026ldquoThe UK vertical launch facility is a key priority, with the potential to deliver high-value employment and supply chain opportunities.Sutherland was one of three potential spaceport locations to submit outline business cases to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) earlier this year. The others were Scolpaig on North Uist and Unst in Shetland.All three were assessed by independent consultants with specialist knowledge of the space sector.Each one met key criteria, including the ability to stage north facing launches over the sea into both polar and sun-synchronous orbit.However, the business case for Sutherland was judged stronger overall, including being successfully awarded UK Space Agency funding for its proposals in collaboration with potential launch operators.HIE chief executive Charlotte Wright said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore very clear that we want to work with others to ensure the benefits of a spaceport in the Highlands and Islands are not confined to Sutherland, but extend well beyond.\u0026ldquoA central part of our approach as we develop this project will be to explore opportunities throughout our region.Wednesday 25 Jul 2018 7:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Vet finds Major mess on record paddle run","story":"A VET caused a bit of a splash when she swapped her stethoscope for a paddleboard to complete a memorable Land\u0026rsquos End to John O\u0026rsquoGroats journey.Cal Major was paddling along the seas, rivers and canals of Britain in order to raise awareness of plastic pollution in our waters and to also raise money for mental health charities the Samaritans and Vetlife.The 30-year-old completed her momentous journey inside 59 days \u0026ndash as she\u0026rsquos the first to do this by paddleboard, she is now the official world-record holder.Cal, who hails from North Devon, is keen to highlight not only the untidiness of plastic litter left on our beaches and in our seas but also the damage it can do to both the sea wildlife and the environment.She found many examples of plastic pollution along the way to John O\u0026rsquoGroats and hopes people will give more though to their use and disposal of plastic products.\u0026ldquoThere was plastic wherever I went. I found countless deserted and remote beaches piled high with it \u0026ndash plastic bottles, cotton-bud sticks, fishing gear, plastic bags, she said.\u0026ldquoThe worst-affected beaches in Scotland were on the west coast. On the east coast there was noticeably less on the beaches, but I was still paddling past beaches with nesting birds that had multicoloured plastic littering them.\u0026ldquoPaddling up the north-east coast, and particularly around Duncansby Head, I picked up several large plastic bags.\u0026ldquoThe inland canals were the worst affected. One morning in Wigan I counted 691 plastic bottles just in the first hour of paddling.Cal admitted that the marathon paddle was not without a scary moment or two.She added: \u0026ldquoThe Mull of Galloway paddle was one of the more terrifying moments. Storm Hector was approaching, so I had just one window to get around the Mull.\u0026ldquoI set off at 11.30pm, just as it had got dark, and paddled 14 miles across Luce Bay.\u0026ldquoThe darkness made it very hard to navigate so I used GPS and, once I could see lights on the opposite landmass and the lighthouse at the Mull, I focused on that.\u0026ldquoWith the Isle of Arran, I set off with a five-hour window to get to Arran before a storm was due to come in.\u0026ldquoThe winds were strong the entire time, mostly behind me but enough of a crosswind to make the paddling incredibly challenging and painful. When I was 12 miles across, the waves were almost as big as me and the storm came in early. I was very scared and felt very alone \u0026ndash panic was starting to set in.\u0026ldquoOnce I was within a mile of the island, and knew I was safe, fear turned to exhilaration, and the feeling of being propelled along by 20-30 knot winds was incredible.Wednesday 25 Jul 2018 7:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Wick River green slime passed safe for canines","story":"THE Scottish Environment Protection Agency (Sepa) has allayed fears that an algae that has appeared on the surface of Wick River is harmful.Dog walkers in Wick had voiced concerns about the \u0026ldquogreen slime following the poisoning death of a dog by blue-green algae in the River Conon in Ross-shire last week.A spokesman from Sepa said that officers had confirmed the presence of enteromorpha in Wick River.\u0026ldquoEnteromorpha is a type of green algae\u0026nbspwhich, unlike blue-green algae, is not harmful.

This means 42 per cent of all eligible LFASS 2017 claims have now been paid, with more payments to follow in the coming weeks.Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing said: “Given the pressures that farmers and crofters continue to face, due in part to the extreme weather conditions during the winter and summer periods, I’m glad to see these important payments starting two months earlier than last year.“Earlier in the year we provided a loan option for farmers in advance of these payments, to help provide cashflow and financial certainty. Farmers are the backbone of Scotland’s rural economy and the Scottish Government is committed to supporting them wherever possible.\u0026#8221On behalf of the Scottish Farmers Union, NFU Scotland, LFA Committee Chairman, Robert Macdonald, welcomed the news saying: “The news that LFASS payments will be reaching farmers and crofters is welcome, particularly for those who did not apply for or receive an LFASS loan of 90 per cent through the LFASS loan scheme. The current prolonged period of extraordinary weather, and the economic impact that it brings, once again underlines the importance of these payments to business stability.“As we look ahead its vital that support for the less favoured areas, for hill farms and crofts, continues. NFU Scotland continues to press the Scottish Government for a timetable for payments, delivered in a timely manner to allow farmers and crofters to efficiently plan their cashflow.“Whilst these payments will bring relief for some, NFUS continues to highlight to farmers and crofters the importance of planning ahead for straw and feed supplies with three key messages — Plan ahead, Be flexible and collaborate.”\u0026nbsp\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

A spokesperson for the judges said:\"He is someone who thoroughly deserves to be recognised for the great contribution he has made to both the industry and the community. A wonderful role model and ambassador.\"Stories shared by his colleagues when nominating him, included times when he dug out roads during a storm to deliver bottled gas and a generator to a terminally-ill customer delivering flowers to a customer who had recently lost her husband, and caring for a customer who had suffered a severe stroke.\"For me, it isn\u0026rsquot about going above and beyond, it\u0026rsquos about doing what I feel is the right thing to do and making sure our customers are cared for and supported when they need us most,\" said a modest Mr Sutherland, who said the award was as much recognition for the Highland team as for himself. \"I\u0026rsquom delighted to take this award home to my wife and girls, who have supported me along the way as I disappeared for days during storms, sometimes missing important events and occasions at home. It\u0026rsquos all worth it as I\u0026rsquom glad to say I still love my job as much as I did when I joined 44 years ago as an apprentice.\"Colin Pirie, SSEN\u0026rsquos head of Region for the Highlands and Islands, added: \"Mike is without doubt the most dedicated, conscientious person I have ever met in my 28 years with SSEN.\"He genuinely cares for everyone he meets. His selfless attitude and his devotion to customers, colleagues (especially young people and trainees) and his family is well known. He is an example to us all.\"Mike is a great colleague but more importantly a great friend to all of us in the Highlands.\"Since their launch of the Utility Week Stars Awards in 2014, the annual event has grown to become the de facto celebration of dedication, ingenuity and teamwork in the UK utilities sector.SSEN picked up another gong, as the SSEN Safety, Health and Environment team won the Health and Safety Initiative award for the roll-out of an influencing behaviours training programme and safety licence across the division.Wednesday 25 Jul 2018 7:39 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The first is the cinema, which would be built on land close to the ferry slipway and next to an existing boat storage shed.It would seat roughly 30 people and host weekly screenings throughout the year, rising to twice a week in the summer. It would also be used to help house Cromarty\u0026rsquos growing film festival, which attracts fans and famous faces from across the country every autumn.Cromarty Estate also plans to build an office hub alongside the cinema in a bid to cater for growing business demand in the town.A statement submitted by Cromarty Estate said: \"Cromarty has a thriving entrepreneurial community but this is not matched by suitable office accommodation, with the result that many find themselves having to move their business bases from Cromarty to Dingwall, Tore or Inverness when they outgrow their own homes, with the resulting loss of employment opportunities in the town.\"Addressing this need... will make Cromarty a more balanced and sustainable community.\"Film society trustee Tanya Karlebach said the group was \"really excited\" to reach this milestone and the move would help increase the frequency of screenings in Cromarty.She added that there is still some fundraising to do before the \u0026pound240,000 cost of the venue is covered, but that by lodging the application now, they are hopeful permission will be in place to begin as soon as the target is met.They hope to hear about their remaining grant applications and other fundraising by late autumn.She added the society had opted for a new-build because none of the existing sites in Cromarty were suitable for conversion.

People living near Edinburgh Airport or under the flight path say planes leaving and arriving late at night or in the early hours of the morning are disturbing their sleep.            The airport has admitted the noise nuisance from night flights was an issue.            After meeting airport bosses Edinburgh West Liberal Democrat MP Christine Jardine said she had received assurances that they would be taking action to reduce night-time flights.She said: “There has been a marked effort by the airport to engage with the public and I am glad they are taking positive steps. Night flights and the disturbance they cause are an issue frequently brought to me by constituents. I look forward to seeing the package of measures the airport propose.”READ MORE: Glasgow man ‘humiliated’ during body search at Edinburgh AirportMs Jardine conducted a survey earlier this year, which showed 295 out of 710 people who responded said they were affected by night flights and 449 said they would support restrictions on further night flights. She said: “I am delighted the airport has taken on board the findings of my survey and the complaints of those who live near the airport and under the flight paths.Helena Paul, of campaign group Edinburgh Airport Watch, pointed out the new flights to and from Beijing, which started last month, were effectively night flights, leaving from Edinburgh at 11.10pm and arriving from Beijing at 5am.            She said: “Edinburgh is unusual as an airport in that it doesn’t have any operating hours restrictions. There are multiple flights taking off and landing between 11pm and 7am. Many of them are charter flights because it’s normally cheaper at these times. And a lot of cargo goes out at night.“People are being wakened up at 4.30am and once your sleep in interrupted that’s it.”She claimed a majority of residents would support a ban on flights during the night. “If Edinburgh Airport is serious about listening to the community they would listen to that. They could choose to operate their airport slightly differently  and not disturb people at night.”            A comparison of statistics on the number of night flights now and four years ago shows a steep increase in their frequency.The figures show a total of 138 take-offs and landings at Edinburgh between 11pm and 6am - the airport’s definition of night flights - during one week in July 2014.The equivalent week this month saw a total of 191 such movements between these times.READ MORE: Edinburgh Airport chief slams reader for written ‘attack’ on teamAn airport spokesman said: “We welcome Christine Jardine’s support as we examine how best to deal with community feedback on night noise.             “Edinburgh Airport consulted on the impacts of noise earlier this year as part of the updating of its five-year Noise Action Plan.“It was clear that noise at night is an area of concern in some local communities and we’re working with our airlines to explore how best to mitigate any impacts.“We should be in a position to discuss plans in more depth later this year.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4772982.1532420956!/image/image.jpg","title":"edinburgh rated one of europe s best cruise destinations for 2018","story":"        Edinburgh is renowned for its medieval Old Town, historic castle and playing host to world famous events such as the Fringe and Tattoo.                Tourists flock to grace the Capital’s cobbled streets from all over the world to take in its unparalleled beauty.            Many would expect the majority of visitors to arrive by coach, train or plane, but there is one mode of transport which is potentially overlooked yet provides a crucial part to the city’s economy. With ports in Leith and Rosyth and anchorages in Newhaven and South Queensferry, Capital Cruising has welcomed 114 liners into the River Forth bringing more than 150,000 passengers to the city in 2018.            Upon arrival, these tourists are in easy reach of the Capital’s bustling city centre and experience its unique culture.This has led to Edinburgh being recognised as one of Europe’s best cruise destinations for the very first time.The Capital has triumphed over stalwart cities Amsterdam, Belfast, Bilbao and Lisbon to land the top prize in Western Europe.READ MORE: Edinburgh Airport pledges action on night flightsJohn Donnelly, chief executive of Marketing Edinburgh said: “Edinburgh is a world leading and increasingly globally connected visitor destination – and becoming Western Europe’s Top Cruise Destination, in an industry said to be worth around £100 million to the Scottish economy, is another fine example of our Capital’s universal appeal. We take great pride in welcoming all types of visitors, and those stopping off for a day can easily navigate the Capital’s history and diverse leisure attractions through resources like the This is Edinburgh website, which covers all corners of city, from Leith to the Old Town and all the way to South Queensferry.”            The award, managed by Cruise Critic, is based solely on consumer ratings and reviews posted to the Cruise Critic website in 2018.Cruise Critic boasts the world’s largest online cruise community, with more than 350,000 cruise reviews, covering approximately 500 cruise ships and over 300 worldwide ports. Edinburgh scooped the top cruise destination in the British Isles \u0026amp Western Europe category at the Cruise Critic’s 2018 Cruisers’ Choice Destination Awards.Cllr Kate Campbell, housing and economy convener, said: “Everyone who lives in Edinburgh knows that we live in one of the most beautiful cities in the world. We’re really proud of Edinburgh’s beauty, heritage, culture and many other attractions – but it’s always good to have that officially recognised.“Tourism is incredibly important to our economy providing around 35,000 jobs – so the news that we are a top cruise destination is very welcome.”            Plans have also been floated to build a new cruise liner terminal at the site of the former Cockenzie power station.Backers say the move would open the door to new ferry services to northern Europe, create much-needed jobs for young people in the area and boost the economy by attracting thousands of tourists.Rob Mason, head of cruise for Capital Cruising in Scotland said: “This is a significant global recognition for Edinburgh and we are thrilled with the award especially as this is feedback directly from cruise passengers.“Our cruise business is thriving and we are seeing our cruise calls grow each year.“We are the only operator to offer the closest cruise connection to the beautiful city of Edinburgh and we have invested significantly over the past few years to provide the most direct access for liners of all sizes to Scotland’s Capital.

We are delighted that Edinburgh has pipped so many other wonderful Western European ports to the post to be crowned the best destination in the British Isles \u0026amp Western Europe. Not only does this highlight the rise in popularity of destinations more known for their immersive, educational and experiential offerings, rather than just their temperate climate or great beaches, but also shows just how attractive Scotland is proving to travellers across the globe.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4773314.1532458728!/image/image.jpg","title":"ayesha hazarika on brexit tories tell lies and corbyn sells unicorns","story":"        The Tories are telling lies while Corbyn has a bridge with unicorns to sell you, writes Ayesha Hazarika                Westminster is smoking hot.

MPs head off for their summer break this week and some of us would normally say it was “well deserved”, but they haven’t covered themselves in glory and leave behind what can be only be described as a genuine political crisis.Brexit has trapped us in a what Danny Dyer brilliantly described as a mad political riddle where the business of running the country has effectively ground to the halt. Although to be fair that hasn’t just happened this parliamentary term. Government ministers, advisers and the civil service haven’t had the bandwidth to focus on the rather difficult day job of running the country since David Cameron called the EU referendum because the toxic politics of the campaign took over. Ironically for a campaign which was dominated by the slogan “take back control”, domestic British politics has spun out of control. We have huge problems the length and breadth of these shores which need the best brains, focus, hard-work, determination and good faith – from funding gaps in the NHS to the lack of opportunities for young people to housing and infrastructure – and sadly our most of our leading politicians seem to be woefully lacking all these qualities.The Conservatives are the equivalent of a circular firing squad and are so busy fighting over Brexit and jostling for who will succeed Theresa May, who will be out the door faster than you can say “strong and stable” once some deal is done on Brexit – although, her words “no deal is better than a bad deal” are proving to be rather prophetic. READ MORE: David Mundell: There’s no alternative to the Brexit White Paper            A ‘no deal’ and crashing out of the EU on WTO terms is now a growing prospect. If this happens, it won’t be because the EU won’t accept a deal, it will be because hard-right Tory Brexiteers won’t. After Chequers, she sent Ministers out on the airwaves to say that this was the absolute, final Cabinet position, then the very next day she gave in to Jacob Rees-Mogg. With this kind of the steel, I bet the EU are sh****** themselves. She then conceded that she would have to probably give way to the EU on further areas, which is true but how do you think the hard-right in her party are going to take those concessions? They are emboldened, and they will not give way. They never have. Ever since the days of John Major, who was out over the weekend calling for a second referendum.I am much more sympathetic to this notion now, but it won’t magic away all the problems – it would simply unblock the Brexit impasse we have in Parliament. What would the question or indeed questions be? How many options would have you have? Would you even include the option to overturn the decision and remain in the EU or would that be seen as undemocratic and unfair? And remainers like me might get a nasty shock – a second referendum may deliver an even bigger margin for leave because, if people hated Westminster in the run-up to the referendum, you can bet your bottom dollar they would want to give it an even bigger two-fingers after two years of arsing around.But it may be the only option if politics can’t find a way though. To give you an idea of how messed up the Government’s Brexit plans are, yesterday it was announced that the Brexit Department will no longer be negotiating Brexit. You literally could not make this stuff up.READ MORE: Food safety controls under threat from no-deal Brexit            Speaking of which, a special mention must go to Vince Cable, leader of the Lib Dems who last week managed to miss a critical vote on Brexit because he was allegedly at a dinner discussing setting up a new party to stop Brexit. Former leader Tim Farron also missed this important vote because he was busy making a speech about homosexuality and the church. It’s great to see the political titan whose only contributions to the last general election was the phrase “smell my spaniel” and a massive row about gay sex is back out there on his “it’s a sin” tour.But things took a more sinister twist when the deputy leader of the Lib Dems, Jo Swinson, was swindled out of her vote at a knife-edge moment because the Tories basically lied to her. She has just had a baby and is still on maternity leave. Julian Smith, the Tory Chief Whip, promised she would be “paired” with MP Brandon Lewis during a crucial Brexit vote. This is an arrangement where if an MP is sick or they can’t be in parliament for an important vote, their “pair” from the opposing party agrees not to vote so that they cancel each other out. It’s based on trust and honour ... Lewis then broke that promise and voted. This is outrageous. The Tories are saying this was an innocent mistake. Do me a favour. We weren’t born yesterday like Swinson’s baby! Lewis and Smith clearly lied, and should be sacked. It’s polite to give up your seat for a pregnant woman – they should be made to give up theirs. Permanently. What a low moment for politics.And don’t look to Labour for any comfort on Brexit. Yesterday Corbyn showed his true Eurosceptic heart by making a speech where he tried to sell us the economic “benefits” of Brexit, which got praised to the rafters by the Leave campaign. He also has a massive bridge to sell you, with a unicorn waiting for each and every one of you on the other side. So, the chances of Labour blocking Brexit or backing a second referendum or a ‘people’s vote’ are pretty slim. Mind you. They have bigger fish to fry right now. Like picking the mother of all rows with the Jewish community over anti-semitism and trying to make communism fashionable again.I really do despair. Never have we needed better politics. And cooler weather.

Shocking, I know. It\u0026#8217s been ages since I\u0026#8217ve gotten any abuse from Scottish nationalists.                 Even longer since I dished it out. It’s been nice not waking up and immediately plunging into a state of panic if I have more than 20 notifications on Twitter.            But I was given a brief reminder of what some of my comrades continue to face last week, when former Commonspace trailblazer-turned-Sunday Herald news editor Angela Haggerty made the mistake of tweeting a New York Times profile in which I was, for the first time in my nearly 20 years in music, described as a “British” rapper.            The second I saw it, I immediately retweeted it, adding “I’ve never been called a ‘British’ rapper before”. Because it’s been so long since I’ve been in a scrape with anyone of an ultra-Scottish nationalist persuasion, I thought nothing of it. Then followed the inevitable misinterpretation that my tweet, about being referred to as “British”, was also attributing that reference to Haggerty – as opposed to the automatically generated New York Times headline. Confirming, at least in the minds of a few Scottish nationalists, something they had long suspected: Angela Haggerty is, in fact, a mole, working for the British State. Comedy ensued.There are a few layers to this that I must carefully unpack. The first is the fact I am, at least in part, British. I have a British passport, a British provisional driving licence and am guaranteed security by a British military. I live in a city where many of my fellows regard themselves as British. The UK dash in my Scottishness is not something that either bothers me or that I would dispute. Nor is it something I feel a need to either revoke or performatively purge myself of. If England pillaged the world during the years of the British Empire, then Scotland was looking on, holding her jacket. As I snapped out of a nationalist dwam, mid-2014, in which we valiant Scots were a uniquely oppressed class of maverick renegades, incapable of racism, it struck me that we may have entered our historically fiendish union with England in 1707 because we were too pished to carve out an empire of our own. Rather than some caged lion, we were more like the Richard Hammond end of a poorly balanced Top Gear equation.READ MORE: Rap tutorials help troubled Scots school pupils turn the pageHaving spent the last few months travelling the UK, I’m positive there are no significant cultural differences to speak of between Scotland and most of England or Wales. My commitment to Scottish independence is based solely on gaining proximity to the decision-making processes that impact my community and family. London has proven time and time again that it’s incapable of taking incoming calls. Interestingly, this cultural lop-sidedness, where London is concerned, also finds expression in the arts and why suddenly being referred to as a “British” rapper was strange. Understanding why requires a brief history of Hip Hop culture itself.             Hip Hop culture originated in The Bronx, New York, in the early 1970s. Comprising four pillars of DJ, Breakdancing, Graffiti and Emceeing, it emerged out of African American poverty and political exclusion. DJs would connect two turntables and, using identical records, create drum loops from the funk and soul hits of the day. These records often had sections where the song would “break down” singing ceased, guitars pulled out and focus would turn to percussion and horns, usually for around eight bars.This section was referred to as the “break”. By spinning concurrent records backwards, consecutively, DJs created “beats” for break-dancers to perform or do battle. These beats soon became audio-canvases to which emcees would rhyme or face off in tense, often hilarious and exhilarating verbal jousts. Hip Hop, at its core, was – and remains – about community, artistic expression and creativity and, ultimately, violence reduction creating a space for anger, conflict and aggression to exist without spilling over into something more serious.READ MORE: Watch SNP MP perform Brexit rap in WestminsterAfter the release of Wild Style and later Beat Street – cult films documenting Hip Hop as it swept the States – it wasn’t long before Hip Hop arrived here electrifying kids in lower-class communities, who identified strongly with its irreverent aesthetics, all-inclusive participatory ethic and pulsating sociocultural resonance. By the mid-80s, there were hundreds of ‘breaking’ crews operating in Glasgow housing-schemes alone.            After a brief pioneering period, when regional UK acts were more closely aligned – in part because so many imitated the Americans and there was no money involved – the UK Hip Hop community largely shunned its Scottish iteration. Which is why “Scottish Hip Hop” – specifically rap – became a separate genre. Not because it wanted to annexe itself from the UK (the opposite in fact) but because it was widely rejected by it.The idea of people rapping in a Scottish dialect was more laughable the further south you went. The idea Scotland could “do” Hip Hop was preposterous, despite being home to some of the best Hip Hop artists the UK has ever produced.In the context of music, I regard myself as Scottish because I’ve been conditioned to. And not by nationalists either – many of whom, ironically, berate me for being a “rapper” – but by an all-encompassing London-centric culture that subsumes not only the Celtic nations, but also many English regions, from which countless stunning contributions to Hip Hop have emerged – consistently dismissed or ignored for over 20 years. Hip Hop is about representing not only yourself, but also your “hood”. Which is why so many regional artists retain impenetrable dialects and obscure slang, despite commercial and cultural pressure to conceal or renounce them. I’m a “Scottish” rapper, not because I want to deny Britishness, but because I live in Scotland and perform in a thick, Glaswegian accent. It would be unthinkable to suddenly rebrand, throwing the very community that gave me a voice under the bus, simply because I’m enjoying some mainstream recognition.I’m a British citizen, tax-payer and feel a strong sense of connection to British culture, but I’m Scottish – something British Hip Hop won’t let people like me forget. And, as well as my dual national identity, I also identify strongly with Hip Hop culture a young, global movement which has its own unique and ever-shifting norms and values. Central to which is the thorough, fearless authentic expression of where you come from. Being called “British” isn’t anything to make a song or dance about. I’m at ease with it and understand why international media would refer to an unknown like me as such. But, when it comes to Hip Hop, I’ve always been (and always will be) a “Scottish” rapper."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4773335.1532459165!/image/image.jpg","title":"martyn mclaughlin podcasts are window into the weird and wonderful","story":"        The esoteric, niche world of podcasting has displaced live radio in my household, writes Martyn McLaughlin.                I have long considered myself an avid radio listener. It is a habit ingrained by weekend afternoons in my grandfather’s kitchen, where after a daunder back from the bookies, we would gather round the wireless and listen intently to proceedings from Ascot or Newmarket, where the rising pitch of the commentators vied for attention with the rush of hooves and the desperate, hopeful shouts of the crowd.            I should probably count myself lucky that I never developed an affinity for the gee-gees as a consequence, but I will always be grateful for that early introduction to a medium that felt more immediate than television ever could.            Growing up with one foot in the analogue age, I kept the flame burning, and with the advent of the internet and the proliferation of digital radio stations, my habit became hopelessly and permanently entrenched. I have lost count of sleepless hours given over to Ira Glass and John Hockenberry on National Public Radio’s Talk of the Nation, discussing obscure issues in a distant country in a way that felt relevant and intimate.Glass, of course, went on to create This American Life, a radio show which morphed into one of the world’s most popular podcasts. Even today, each episode is downloaded by around 2.5 million people. If that particular show’s success is well established, it would appear the popularity of its medium has yet to peak. The latest analysis by Rajar, the official body in charge of measuring radio audiences in the UK, shows that as of this spring, some six million adults across Britain listened to at least one podcast a week.That number might appear relatively small – just 11 per cent of the population – but when you assess it the proper context, its scale – and growth – is really quite something. Only last year, the number stood at just 4.7 million, and the number of people now downloading podcasts now outstrips the reach of BBC Radio 5 Live. READ MORE: From football to knitting: the rise of the Scottish podcast            Such statistics have led to 2018 being hailed by the BBC as the year of the “podcast boom”. Such a bold prophecy may be intended as self-fulfilling, at least on the BBC’s part. In March, the corporation announced the appointment of its first-ever podcast commissioner, Jason Phipps, and it clearly believes it can build on the 240 million annual downloads of its programmes. It, along with other broadcasters and media companies, faces a stern challenge in attracting a younger demographic who do not consume their media via linear channels, and podcasting is one the most obvious areas to focus on. Recent research by Acast, one of the main competitors to iTunes as the world’s leading podcast platform, found that two thirds of listeners are aged between 16 and 34. What is more, nearly a fifth of them have only started listening in the past six months. The success of the BBC’s evolving podcasting operation alone will not solve that problem, but it is a start.            It is hard, however, to see the projected ‘boom’ coming to pass. Podcasting is hardly a new, emerging medium. In one form or another, it has been a staple of our media diet for well over a decade. iTunes first started collating a directory of podcasts as far back as 2005, when the term was named as the Merriam Webster dictionary’s word of the year. Within the space of 12 months, the comedian, Ricky Gervais, helped propel the medium into the public consciousness, with millions of users downloading his comedy shows.  For a good few years, the podcast charts were dominated by such high-profile figures looking to emulate Gervais’s success. And while the podcasting world is still inhabited by any number of celebrities, its greatest treasures are to be found elsewhere. READ MORE: Podcast tells gory tale of Scottish crime writer’s lifeIn the past few days, I have listened to a 50-minute documentary about the economics of US dentistry, an hour-long interview with Kenney Jones, the former drummer with the Small Faces, and a two hour-long show devoted entirely to the 1978 arcade game, Space Invaders.Slowly but surely, such esoteric listening choices have displaced live radio as my audio go-to. I subscribe to more than 70 different shows, and on an average week, I will listen to around 12 hours of programming. Over the past year, the lion’s share of this has consisted of podcasts which focus on US politics, such as FiveThirtyEight, Pod Save America, Trumpcast, Trump Inc, all of which provide incisive takes on the Trump administration.            But so too, my podcast diet is supplemented by an ever-widening spectrum of programmes that embrace niche subjects. On the one hand, it includes the likes of Trade Talks, a weekly insight into international trade deals, and The Tip Off, which interviews leading journalists about how they came across some of their biggest stories. On the other hand, it takes in Wrestle Me, where comedians Marc Haynes and Pete Donaldson revisit every WrestleMania event from 1985 onwards in chronological order, and Cult of Geshcast, in which two Glaswegian friends, Gavin Spence and Phillip Maddison, discuss various cults and sects through the ages. These are my niche interests, but whatever you are interested in, or even curious about, chances are there is a podcast out there for you. There might not be a boom in 2018, but with the bewildering choice of programmes out there, it’s hard to see how podcasts will fail to become an increasingly prominent part of our media landscape."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4773112.1532429761!/image/image.jpg","title":"green msp andy wightman calls for controls on holiday homes","story":"        Private houses converted into holiday homes would need to gain full planning permission under changes to proposed legislation put forward by a Green MSP.

But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at. And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above. If the price of a stamp puts you off just email your entry to editorial@shetlandtimes\n: : : : : : : :\nEven those who detest cricket most may have raised a modest eyebrow last week when the Scottish team shocked England with victory in a one-day match at Edinburgh.\nReaders, whether they follow the game or not, may be interested that there was actually a player in the home side’s ranks with Shetland connections.\nA glance at the Scottish team sheet may suggest possible contenders – how about Michael Leask, Mark Watt or even Dylan Budge for instance?\nBut it was none of those. The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call (01595) 744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin (tin shed). Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen (left) and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships.

I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct.

His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois (Belgium) Benjamin Pavard (France), Raphaël Varane (France), Diego Godín (Uruguay), Ivan Strinic (Croatia) Ivan Perisic (Croatia), Luka Modric (Croatia), Jordan Henderson (England), Eden Hazard (Belgium) Cristiano Ronaldo (Portugal), Edinson Cavani (Uruguay).\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"vacancy kitchen assistant and dispatch assistant with sandwick baking co ","story":" We currently have a vacancy in our kitchen department assisting in making our range of filled products and also selected confectionery lines.\n We also have a vacancy in our dispatch department wrapping, labelling products and making up customers orders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"blue green algae found in tingwall ","story":"Another loch has been found to contain blue green algae, this time the Loch of Griesta in Tingwall.\nNotices will be posted next to the loch warning against contact with the algal scum.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s environmental health department received notification of the discovery from the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency.

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government will be free to make its own arrangements regarding the design and collection of any replacement tax\u0026rsquo, yet, as we have seen time and time again with this Government, the arrangements on offer, limits the ability of the Scottish Government to make changes to benefit the Scottish economy.\u0026nbsp\nIn his response to the Highland MP, Mr Jenrick confirmed that his department was willing to work closer with the Scottish Government to find a solution to the problem, recognising the commitment outlined in the Smith Commission.\nResponding after the debate, Mr Hendry said: \u0026ldquoI am glad that the UK Government recognises it has failed to hand over APD in a workable way, and that Airport Departure Tax cannot be implemented by the Scottish Government without a solution to this problem.\n\u0026ldquoI hope that the assurances from Mr Jenrick today, are followed up by meaningful action from the UK Government, to enable the Scottish Government to introduce its reduced Airport Departure Tax, while protecting the Highlands and Islands exemption.\"\nWednesday 25 Jul 2018 7:44 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/IMG_0946-e1530785665580.jpg","title":"harold davis 1933 2018 from the korean front line to footballing glory and a spot of fishing in wester","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\n\nHis surname should in fact better reflect the Wester Ross area he’s called home for almost 40 years.\n“I like that to be known up here in MacKenzie country,” he notes from his home near Badachro, on the shores of Gairloch. “My mother was Catherine MacQueen Kirk, and my father was Angus Davis, though originally he was born Angus MacKenzie. The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-the-visitor-large-1.jpg","title":"top four prepare to lock horns in ross cup","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe top four teams in the Skye and Lochalsh League will meet this weekend with two places in the Ross Cup Final up for grabs.\nLast season\u0026#8217s league champions Kyleakin will travel to Broadford to play Sleat and Strath, while Mallaig host Portree Juniors in the early kick-off.\n\n In what is their debut season in the Skye and Lochalsh Football Association, Mallaig have made a marked impression in the league \u0026#8211  where they currently sit fourth \u0026#8211 and in the associated cup competitions \u0026#8211 in which they are seeking to reach their second final today.\nWith six wins from their eight league fixtures so far, the Lochaber side are keeping pace with the top teams in the league. Having beaten Juniors twice already this season \u0026#8211 2-5 and 0-6 \u0026#8211 Jamie MacGregor will have faith that his team can make it a hat-trick of success and book their place in the final.\nIn their last semi-final outing, Mallaig defeated Sleat and Strath 10-8 in an incredible game to secure their place in the GF MacRae Cup Final. The blues, however, will be keen to avoid a repeat of their performance in the final which saw Kyleakin run out 4-1 winners in a disappointing and underwhelming showing by Mallaig.\n\n \u0026#8220Another tough game for us, but it’s the type of games we wanted to be involved in at the start of the season. We now have a great opportunity to make a second cup final this season.\n\u0026#8220The season, in general, has been a learning experience but a very enjoyable one. The lads have picked up a lot quite quickly and we have had some good wins this season especially on our travels. It’s good to be back playing at home especially in such a big game, especially after being away for so long\n\u0026nbsp\nWith four wins from their last five matches in all competitions, and 37 goals scored in the process, Juniors have really hit their stride and will approach their third meeting with Mallaig with great confidence.\nNow just four points point off leaders Sleat and Strath with one game in hand, Phil McCaherty will hope his team can transmit their impressive league form into today\u0026#8217s cup match against the only side who have beaten them domestically this season.\nWhile Juniors\u0026#8217 recent free-scoring display will have given Mallaig some food for thought in their preparations for the match, the Portree side must avoid the lapses in concentration which cost them in their heavy defeats at home against Mallaig in the league and Loch Ness in the Highland Amateur Cup.\n\nIt\u0026#8217s a tough task for us away to Mallaig who have beaten us twice already 5-2 and 6-0. We are going with the same squad (minus Angie MacPherson and Paul MacKinnon) that played GA United in last round, with Nick Flanagan added for goalkeeping duties to free up backup goalie Will Brown to his normal defensive duties. I am hoping that David Potter doesn\u0026#8217t get lost this week!\u0026#8221\n\nIt\u0026#8217s been a fantastic season so far for the Broadford-based side who are the current league leaders, joint top scorers, and have the meanest defence to boot.\nWith an average of 5.2 goals a game in the league, Sleat and Strath have developed a ruthlessness in front of goal and appeared to have a strong belief when they take to the pitch that they can beat any team whether it be at home or away. Their most recent win in which they turned a 3-0 lead at half-time into an emphatic 12-0 victory in last week\u0026#8217s quarter-final tie against much-improved Glenelg is evidence they have the weapons to transform a tight match into a comfortable victory.\nHaving put in impressive defensive displays against both Kyleakin and Portree Juniors in the league, DL MacKinnon\u0026#8217s team have proven they can stand firm when required against tough opponents. That said, he will still be mindful of his side\u0026#8217s loss in their last semi-final encounter against Mallaig \u0026#8211 in what has been their only defeat so far this season \u0026#8211  and will be keen to avoid missing out on a second final.\n\n \u0026#8220It\u0026#8217s going to be a battle at our tight pitch. Key to the result will be our ability to defend set plays, which is not our strong point as we are a very small team. If we can keep Gordy (Mccarroll) and Innis (Thompson) quiet we will hopefully cause them problems with our pace.\u0026#8221\n\u0026nbsp\nWith Sleat and Strath having burst out of the blocks in the league and new boys Mallaig also making their mark, it is perhaps easy to overlook the fact that Kyleakin is not only very much in contention for the league title but have already won a piece of silverware this season with a convincing victory over Mallaig in the GF MacRae Cup.\nWith 22 goals in their last three matches, which included their 10-2 quarter-final win over Kyle, the reigning league champions know how to win games, and ultimately trophies. As well as being well-deserved, their 4-1 victory in the GF MacRae Cup Final against Mallaig was a superb example of game-management against difficult opponents on a big occasion.\nAlthough Kyleakin have put themselves in a good position to challenge on all fronts, they will have to address their inconsistency this season which has seen them held to draws recently by Glenelg and GA United.\nWith back-to-back matches coming up against Sleat and Strath in the cup, then the league, the reigning champions will look to draw on their past successes in the big games.\nBy Adam Gordon\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/david-mundell.jpg","title":"recruitment highlighted as a priority at first emergency services","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n\nRepresentatives of all the emergency services on Skye held their first ever partnership meeting in Broadford last week to discuss how they can support each other.\nPictured (left to right) are Dave Philips from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, Nick Mort from the British Red Cross, Station Manager Mike Colliar from the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, Sgt Andrew Shaw from Police Scotland, Neil Urquhart from Skye Mountain Rescue, Inspector Lynda Allan from Police Scotland, Area Service Manager Alan Knox of Scottish Ambulance Service.

That problem here emanates from so-called dissident elements who are behaving in a manner that no person could describe at any stage to be a republican behaviour,\" she said. \nShe also called on those orchestrating the violence to listen to the voice of the local community and stop immediately. \n\"The important thing is that they listen to the people of Derry because these street, this place is their home, this is where they have grown up, generation after generation, raised their kids, made good lives in what is a fantastic city often in very difficult circumstances and I tell you this, particularly the older residents, have said \u0027we are not having this, nobody every broke us and the dissidents and their sick approach will not break us either\u0027 so I hope they hear that, not from me, but from the people of the Bog.\" \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27416  ","story":" Caolán McGinley\n\n“I welcome acknowledgement by RTÉ of the growing frustration among people in the north at the constant blockage of sports programmes on satellite TV.  - Sinéad Ennis\nSinn Féin MLA Sinéad Ennis has called on RTÉ’s new Head of Sport to take the concerns and growing frustration among northern viewers on board when negotiating deals for GAA coverage with satellite providers. \nThe block on major sports programmes for northern viewers is continuously causing anger among sports fans, this was increased with the recent geo-blocking of The Sunday Game on RTÉ. \nThis frustration is matched by a recent cut in coverage by the BBC to the 2018 GAA Ulster Championship from seven live games to two has causing huge anger among GAA members and fans in the north. \nGAA fans expressed their frustration on social media as BBC provided no live coverage of Super 8 games, despite a clear public interest for coverage with three Ulster teams competing in the competition.\nWriting in the Gaelic Life, RTÉ’s new Head of Sport said they “don’t geo-block” citing that your internet service provider address governs whether or not you have access to a particular outlet. \nSinn Féin’s Culture, Arts \u0026amp Sports spokesperson Sinéad Ennis said she recognises the complexities in licensing and broadcasting rights, but that there is a responsibility on RTÉ to address the “digital partition” of Ireland. \n“I welcome an acknowledgement by RTÉ of the growing frustration among people in the north at the constant blockage of sports programmes on satellite TV. \n“RTÉ negotiate deals with satellite providers such as SKY, therefore they are in a position to renegotiate the terms to meet the needs of northern viewers,” she said. \nThe South Down Gael recently launched the ‘Fair Play For Ulster Gaels’ campaign to ensure that the 250,000 Gaels in the north would no longer be left behind when it comes to viewing rights. \nThe campaign, which included a Twitter poll, was endorsed by 95% of those who voted.

TRADES Council has recently reformed in a bid to give a voice to local trade union members.\n  \nSpeaking after the monthly meeting Communications Workers Union and Chairman, Lawrence Huston, said, Ballymena needs jobs not empty words.\n  \nHe also spoke of the great sadness of members as they watched the Michelin factory being stripped of the machinery that once provided so many local people with employment.\n  \nThe aim of the group is to discuss the challenges posed by a declining industrial economy, lack of opportunities for young unemployed people and the serious concerns that are being raised over Brexit.\n  \nLucy O’Hagan, a local NIPSA representative, and secretary to the group expressed the views of the group saying that there was a real feeling of despondency among local people as they tried to deal with the increasing pressure of the rising cost of goods and services while pay remained static.\n  \nThe group are encouraging local people to support the ICTU campaign “Better Work Better Lives”.\n  \nLexie Scott, Ulster Teachers’ Union representative on the Council, urged people to go to the campaign website www.betterworkbetterlives.\n  \norg/pledge-support and

John is a long established Councillor and his views have always been respected by the Party and its leadership.

Stewart said that: Alex had a long life, lived well, and had been a great supporter of the community through his lifelong involvement in many organisations and though his many friendships.\nOne of the many mourners at the service, was Mr Donal O\u0027Hanlon Chair of the Newpoint Players, Newry who have performed at the Ballymoney Drama Festival for 30 years in a row.\nMr O\u0027Hanlon said: We have attended 30 festivals on the trot and the linch pin for us in that was Alex as secretary.\n\u0026#8220Whether there was good adjudication or bad Alex was always there in the tea room to give support and say all that was good about the performances.\nSpeaking from London, Director of Newpoint Players Sean Treanor added Ballymoney will never be the same without him, especially at\u0026#160 festival time. We have lost a man of great intelligence\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ?

It was the first time he had competed since withdrawing from the Isle of Man TT Races back in May.\nDunlop was a revered competitor who had more than one hundred wins to his name at both national and international level. 15 of those came at the County Dublin circuit which ultimately claimed his life on Saturday afternoon during practice for the Open Race.\nWhyte said that after some lacklustre seasons where fans only got to see sporadic glimpses of his ability shine through, 2018 looked set to be the start of something special as Dunlop joined forces with Tim Martin in the Superstock and Superbike classes. \nThe team was being built around Dunlop, with Martin ending his sabbatical from the sport after just one year.\n\u0026#8220Tim threw everything he had at it for William, Whyte told Chronicle Sport.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying: \n\u0026#8220People use food banks for many and varied reasons and it would be misleading to link them to any single cause.\n    \n        \n        \n\n\n        \n\n        \n    \n          \n\n full newspaper \u0026#187\n\n    \n\nSend this page to a friend \u0026#187\n\n  \n// \n\n\n      \nSend to a friend\n  \nPlease complete the following form to inform a friend about this page.\n  \n    \n    \n      \n        \nYour Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n      \n        \nYour E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s Name\n*\n\n        \n      \n              \n        \nFriend\u0027s E-Mail\n*\n\n        \n      \n                      \n        \nComment\n        \n\n      \n                    \n                  \n      \nIn order to process your information we must ask you to enter the letters in the image into the box:\n      \n        \n          \n            \n            \n\nplay audio version\n\n            \n\nReload Image\n\n          \n          \nVerify Code:\n          \n        \n      \n    \n                   \n          \n\n*\n Mandatory field - please complete\n          \n              \n      \n    \n  \n\n    \n  \n     \n        \n      \n        \nNews Search\n        \n          \n          \n        \n        \nsearch news, sport and features across all publications\n      \n    \n                      \n      // \n      \n                                                                                                                                        \n                      \n      \n        \n\nNorthern Constitution\n\n        \n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n          \n\nMagherafelt\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\n\n\n        \n          \n\nAntrim\n\n          \n\nBallymena\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n      \n        \n\nThe Chronicle\n\n        \n          \n\nBallycastle\n\n          \n\nBallymoney\n\n          \n\nColeraine\n\n          \n\nLimavady\n\n        \n        \n\nClose this menu \u0026#187\n\n      \n                  \n      // \n      \n      \n        \n          \nSubscriber Login\n          \n            \n              \nUsername:\n              \n            \n            \n              \nPassword:\n              \n            \n          \n          \n            \n          \n        \n      \n            \n              \n\n\n                          \n\n\n            \n\n\n                      \n\n\n          \n  \n    \n    \n\u0026copy Copyright 2018 Alpha Newspaper Group\n    \n\n        // \n        \n\n    \n      \n        \n\nTerms \u0026amp Conditions\n\n        \n\nPrivacy Policy\n\n              \n    \n  \n      \n    var gaJsHost = ((\"https:\" == document.location.protocol) ? \"https://ssl.\" : \"http://www.\")    document.write(unescape(\"%3Cscript src=\u0027\" + gaJsHost + \"google-analytics/ga.js\u0027 type=\u0027text/javascript\u0027%3E%3C/script%3E\"))    \n    \n    var pageTracker = _gat._getTracker(\"UA-4764369-20\")    pageTracker._initData()    pageTracker._trackPageview()    \n      \n\n      \n              \n  \n    \n  \n\n      \n  \n\n"},{"url":"http://www.antrimguardian.co.uk/fs/img/articles/250px/jbllegiofdoolfna1.jpg","title":"65370  ","story":"    \nARMOY Road Races Clerk of the Course Bill Kennedy says this weekend\u0027s 10th anniversary event is a \u0027massive milestone\u0027 for organisers.\nRace Week continues apace until this weekend with practice on Friday and Race Day taking place on Saturday.\nIt\u0027s been a massive achievement for the club, said Kennedy.

This is because Cameron’s health has declined over the last few weeks and we have just been fully focusing on giving Cameron everything he needs at this time.\n\n“It is with the greatest of pains in our heart that we share his journey is near over. We don’t know how long we have left with our beautiful boy but although he is sleeping mostly now he still is fighting with all his might when he is awake. He is in no pain and is just restful. We plan to be at home surrounded by family where he will be happy.\n\n“We can’t thank you all enough for everything you have done for our sweet boy. Because of the love, help and support we received Cameron’s life was greatly extended and in those times he had amazing days that we where so blessed to be apart of.\n\n“We hope to honour Cameron by continuing Cure4Cam. He has spoke of things he wants us to do in his charity and we hope we can do him proud by helping other kids with cancer and funding help and awareness for DIPG as well as much more.\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nAll the time in the world would not be enough with our amazing son. But we are thankful and honoured to have had the time we have had. We are filled with pride on the young man he has become. He fought this battle with more strength and courage than we could have.\n\nAs our hearts are shattering we ask for prayers. Prayers for Cameron in all that he needs right now, for his sisters and for us and our whole family. \n\n“We are going to take some time out.

This was the first time in 32 years that the Twelfth celebrations were held in Donaghcloney.\n\nCarla Lockhart said: “We have once again been treated to a great cultural display on the Twelfth in Donaghcloney. I want to congratulate the officers of Lower Iveagh West Orange District and their organising committee, Donaghcloney Linen Greer Association. I know many hours of planning and preparation went into this event but to good avail. We had a real effort this year by the committee and residents of the village to ensure this was a week long festival and were treated to features for people of all ages with the Songs of Praise, A Drummers Tribute, a night of remembrance, the community fun night and then the Twelfth July celebrations. \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n“A great turnout of Orangemen and women, bandsmen, Lambeg drums and spectators with plenty of variety for children of all ages in the demonstration field. This is what our culture is all about. No one should be offended by it. I look forward to it returning again to Donaghcloney and I have no doubt that it will not be so long the next time.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n            \n    \n"}]
