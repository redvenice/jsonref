But there were repeated reports that officers felt \u0027uncomfortable\u0027 at having to drink to Andrew\u0027s health at the end of regimental dinners.Lt Gen Walker also said in his email: \u0027Buckingham Palace have informed me that in due course the colonelcy, along with the duke\u0027s other titles and affiliations, will be reallocated to another member of the Royal Family.\u0027He added that he would write to Andrew \u0027to thank him for his time as colonel\u0027.Formed in 1656 by Charles II, the Grenadier Guards have fought in almost every major campaign of the British Army, including the Napoleonic, Crimean, Boer, First and Second World Wars.York Racecourse yesterday confirmed it will rebrand one of its most historic events, the Duke of York Stakes, in a bid to distance itself from Andrew.The six-furlong sprint was first staged in 1895 and derives its name from Prince George, Duke of York, who became George V.The racecourse\u0027s head of marketing and sponsorship, James Brennan, said: \u0027It has never been directly about Prince Andrew. However, we are going to explore how we can make the name a lot clearer about its history – and that the name refers to an entirely different Duke of York.\u0027Andrew was a patron of the course, and a regular attendee at flagship fixtures, until he relinquished the role in 2019.The prince has now been forced to withdraw entirely from public life in the wake of his association with disgraced paedophile Epstein and his sex trafficker girlfriend, Maxwell.Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre claims she was lent out by the pair and forced to have sex with Andrew three times when she was 17. She is now suing him for rape and sexual assault in a civil court.The prince has always vehemently denied the claims. He was last week forced by the Queen to hand back all his royal privileges in order to fight the US case as a \u0027private citizen\u0027."},{"url":null,"title":"Father just started breathing without oxygen support year caught Covid","story":"Share this articleLondon\u0027s \u0027sickest ever\u0027 Covid patient who spent nearly a year in hospital only just able to walk again - MyLondon"},{"url":null,"title":"Mr Wokeford Labour activists revolt Tory MP Christian Wakeford joining ranks","story":"Share this article However, the chairman of Bury South Labour Party, Paddy Heneghan, welcomed the MP.‘Members of our constituency party will be meeting tomorrow to discuss how we will be working with our new Labour MP to fight for the interests of residents and secure a future Labour government,’ he said.While the row over No10 parties had been the final straw for him, Mr Wakeford highlighted issues including free school meals, the row over Dominic Cummings’ behaviour during lockdown, the cost-of-living crisis and the Owen Paterson affair, for his decision to defect. He said Tories were ‘trying to defend the indefensible and they are doing so gladly’."},{"url":null,"title":"Another blunder Boris PM spotted wearing No10 face mask upside down","story":"Share this article Following a joint media appearance with Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, Mr Wakeford said the Tories are \u0027a party trying to defend the indefensible\u0027 as he explained his defection.A Labour spokesman said the party had been in talks with Mr Wakeford for \u0027some time\u0027 and would welcome an election, after Mr Johnson said the Tories would win back Bury South.He declined to say whether there are more Conservative MPs considering defecting, while the Prime Minister\u0027s press secretary said she was not aware of any.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps suggested there should now be a by-election in the constituency, telling ITV\u0027s Peston Mr Wakeford \u0027should front up to his constituents\u0027.In the Commons, Mr Johnson apologised again for the partygate saga, which threatens to be the death knell for his time as Prime Minister.But he said it was for Ms Gray\u0027s inquiry \u0027to come forward with an explanation of what happened\u0027, while facing particular scrutiny over the \u0027bring your own booze\u0027 party in the No 10 garden on May 20 2020 that he has admitted attending despite the lockdown.The PM has insisted \u0027nobody told me that what we were doing was against the rules\u0027 and he believed he was attending a work event.But former aide Dominic Cummings alleged Mr Johnson was aware of the event in advance and was warned it broke the rules in place at the time.The May 20 event is one of many subject to Ms Gray\u0027s inquiry, and Tory MPs were urged by ministers to wait for her report before deciding whether to move against the Prime Minister.Health Secretary Sajid Javid told a Downing Street press conference he \u0027fully supports the Prime Minister\u0027 as awaits the Gray report.Mr Javid, who ran against Mr Johnson for the leadership in 2019, did not rule out another bid in future, saying: \u0027We have a leader.

And in the meantime to make sure that we\u0027re caring for anyone who\u0027s been affected and to protect all of our people to the best of our ability,\u0027 he added.   The European incidents now add to the list of roughly 200 reported cases of the yet unexplained illness, colloquially named for its first reported case in 2016 at the US Embassy in Havana, Cuba.Almost half of the cases involved CIA officers or their relatives, nearly 60 have been linked to Department of Defense workers or relatives, and about 50 involved State Department.In October, three Havana Syndrome sufferers came forward to share the agonizing symptoms of the disease, with two of them claiming it left them brain damaged and destroyed their promising diplomatic careers.Tina Onefur, Kate Husband, and Husband\u0027s partner Doug Ferguson were all working for the US State Department, stationed in Cuba\u0027s capital, when they found themselves afflicted with the mysterious malady.The syndrome first surfaced at the embassy in Havana in 2016 - months before Onefur, Husband, and Ferguson were diagnosed. The three described their debilitating symptoms - which include hearing loss, severe headaches, memory issues, dizziness, grogginess and even brain damage - in detail during an interview with NBC News last year. Onefur, sobbed as she spoke and recalling the fact she can now only work two hours a day from home due to doctor-diagnosed brain damage, and said she was washing dishes one night in March 2017 at her home in Havana when she suddenly found herself overcome with pain.\u0027The kids were upstairs playing, and I was standing at the kitchen window, and all of a sudden I felt like I was being struck with something.\u0027When asked what the sensation felt like, Onefur said the pain was like nothing she had ever felt before in her life, and explained, \u0027It was gripping - it was like I\u0027d been seized by some invisible hand, and I couldn\u0027t move.\u0027When asked by interviewer Andrea Mitchell how her health is today, Onefur, choking back tears revealed that her symptoms were still as strong and prevalent as ever, even after more than four years.\u0027It\u0027s not easy to talk about our health because it\u0027s an invisible injury,\u0027 Onefur said,\u0027It\u0027s four-and-a-half years of of excruciating headaches, it\u0027s four-and-a-half years of stumbling losing my balance, four-and-a-half years of vision degradation,\u0027 Onefur asserts of the illness, while breaking down in tears.In a nearby neighborhood in Havana in the winter months of 2016, Kate Husband and Doug Ferguson were working in the US embassy by day, with their nights spent together at their shared home.But nights for the couple - who both hail from Michigan - would often be strangely interrupted, by a high-pitched, piercing noise seemingly coming from their backyard.\u0027It was persistent, kind of at the same level all the time,\u0027 Husband said of the shrill sound, which they never managed to identify, adding it was \u0027very, very loud\u0027 and \u0027nothing you can sit with.\u0027Ferguson, however, managed to capture the mysterious noise on his phone and played it back for Mitchell during the interview.The sound on the recording - a high-frequency ringing that somewhat resembles a dog whistle - is strikingly similar to a sound previously released by AP in a 2017 covering the then just-surfaced syndrome.When asked if any other people in her neighborhood had heard the same sounds and was afflicted with similar symptoms, Husband said they had.After feeling a slew of symptoms in the coming months, the couple was later examined by neurologists at the University of Pennsylvania.In early 2017, Ferguson was cleared to go back to work, but Husband was diagnosed with brain damage by doctors, and was subsequently sent to receive treatment.Husband told Mitchell that during the diagnosis, a doctor told her, after analyzing scans of her brain, \u0027it\u0027s like you aged 20, 25 years all at once.\u0027She later retired from her work for the State Department on the grounds of a medical disability.Husband further revealed during the interview that she still suffers from balance issues associated with the brain damage she suffered after the 2017 diagnosis - a sensation that would trigger violent bouts of nausea, and a fogginess that makes even the most basic tasks difficult.  "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/166d20e07ecdc9576d0c5c05410babf0287824d0/0_0_4814_2891/master/4814.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=c6634d292475cf02df753819b60056f8","title":"abf escalating costs energy inflation primark uk economy stock markets us jobless business live","story":"UK manufacturer Premier Foods has hiked its profit forecasts after its Mr Kipling cake brand recorded its best-ever Christmas sales. Premier Foods benefitted from a jump in spending during the festive season, helped by an increased number of family gatherings over the festive period, and demand for less sugary treats. Mr Kipling is now heading across the Atlantic, Premier Food says. Will Shu, founder and CEO of Deliveroo, said the company finished 2021 with a strong Q4 performance:  Bar operator Revolution was also hit by Omicron in the crucial festive period. Revolution, which runs 67 bars, adds that many of those cancelled corporate parties have already been rebooked for early in 2022, as companies look to hold late Christmas festivities. Rob Pitcher, CEO of Revolution Bars Group, said: The fashion retailer has launched a consultation with staff as part of its plans to simplify its UK store retail management structure (see previous post). It is looking to make the management structure consistent across its estate of over 190 stores in the UK, and those changes are likely to leave it with around 400 fewer retail managers. Kari Rodgers, Primark retail director for the UK, said:  Rising raw materials and commodity costs, supply chain tensions and the energy price crunch are all hitting businesses, adding to the cost of living crisis facing households this year. Associated British Foods, which owns Primark plus grocery, sugar, agriculture and ingredients businesses, has reported this morning that all its businesses have seen inflationary pressures in the last few months.  ABF, which makes Twinings tea, Ovaltine, Patak’s curry pastes and sauces, Kingsmill bread and Jordans biscuits, has lifted some grocery prices to absorb these rising costs. In a trading update this morning, ABF says these rising costs are eating into its profit margins too: World food prices hit 10-year high last year, according to the UN, pushing up inflation, with rising demand, weak harvest and pandemic disruption all driving up costs. Primark is now seeing a rise in footfall in UK and Ireland, after Omicron caused some disruption as shoppers stayed away from the high street. ABF explains that cost cuts have helped Primark absorb higher costs - and is proposing further job cuts: Yesterday, Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey warned that inflation pressures may last longer than first thought. Bailey told the Treasury Select Committee that financial markets don’t expect energy prices to start easing back until the second half of 2023, which could mean inflation says higher for longer than expected.

Sliding scale of points allocated for victories in T20, ODI and Test matches?!” Ah yes, sorry, I meant to say. Two points each for the white ball win, with four for the Test win. Whether the players themselves put more value on a Test fifty, you’d have to ask. T20 is really the currency of the women’s game though, especially domestically. Don’t really want to compare the men’s and women’s games but this amused me: An illuminating thread on the crowd from those that know. It certainly isn’t filling the seats - though half the ground is closed because of Covid. A distinct lack of crowd shots from the TV cameras too.  The floodlights are powering away though the sun is still blazing. Hmmm - surely not necessary.“Looking forward to this game,” writes Peter Salmon. “Even though it is T20, we’re expecting the highest score by an English team in Australia for weeks aren’t we?” The players are wired up and Alyssa Healy is the first poor sod who has to come up with interesting insights. Ah, the teams are out, a fair wind ruffling their trousers and the flags being held behind them. The Welcome to Country is being performedspoken by Isaac Hannam. Such a beautiful sound on the didgeridoo. Wow, and a very young man belts out Advance Australia Fair.  Lanning “ It looks a belter of a wicket, probably won’t change too much throughout the night. Alan King makes her debut, we’ve got Grace Harris, too, we feel like we’ve got a different look but hopefully all bases covered.” Knight, “I think we’d have done the same. Both teams would say it has been a very strange warm-up but we feel like we’re ready to play in this match.”It includes the full details of that “chaotic” preparation. “First, the schedule was rejigged at the 11th hour due to Covid, with the T20s brought forward, rendering England’s focus on red-ball practice during their camp in Oman irrelevant to the first leg of the series and leaving them with 10 days to acclimatise after landing in Australia. “Then England’s first outdoor training session in Canberra was conducted in pouring rain. Finally, over the weekend, they played two warm-up T20 games against the England A side that has accompanied them. They lost both, despite Tammy Beaumont and Danni Wyatt being given two chances to bat in the second match.”England, much as their male counterparts, arrived as underdogs. If anything, though, they are even more undercooked, after a preparation period that even the ever-diplomatic Heather Knight declared “ comical.”  Covid restrictions over Christmas left players relying on their dogs to load the bowling machines and mums to pick up a bat, while the fixtures were brought forward a week to give both teams enough time to complete their quarantine period in New Zealand ahead of the World Cup. England haven’t won an Ashes series since Charlotte Edwards was in charge in 2014 and Australia, in the swing of their domestic season, and recent winners of the T20 World Cup, have home advantage as well as momentum. They have though been hit by lack of form (looking at you Meg Lanning, Ellyse Perry, Perry,Ashleigh Gardner and Alyssa Healy) and injuries to Beth Mooney, Georgia Wareham and Sophie Molineux.

Recommendations included to “lift or ease international traffic bans as they do not provide added value and continue to contribute to the economic and social stress” of some countries.  Implementing blanket travel bans are “not effective in suppressing international spread” and “may discourage transparent and rapid reporting of emerging variants of concerns” the agency said in a statement.  Travel measures such as masking, testing, isolationquarantine and vaccination should be based on risk assessments and avoid placing the financial burden on international travellers, according to their recommendations.  The WHO also said the requirement to provide proof of vaccination against Covid-19 for international travel may not be needed as “the only pathway or condition” permitting international travel.  There are now clearly three camps of scientists voicing opinions on what is happening and what to do in the coming weeks. This can be confusing for the public. The first group still seem to see the virus as the same deadly one of March 2020, despite the massive scientific progress in managing it, and they suggest extremely cautious measures. The second say they’ve been right all along in that mass infection is unavoidable this is the “let it rip” group. They ignore the dramatic difference that mass vaccinations and treatments have made – avoiding serious illness from Covid-19 now is wholly different from 2020. The third group – where I sit – have evolved their position as the data and tools, namely vaccines and therapeutics, have also evolved to transform Covid-19 into something more akin to other infectious diseases that we control and manage. Read more here: Devi Sridhar – Now that science has defanged Covid, it’s time to get on with our lives She writes that diseases are endemic when they occur regularly in certain areas according to established patterns, while a pandemic refers to a global outbreak that causes unpredictable waves of illness. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that redefining the coronavirus as an endemic disease is still “a ways off,” according to Catherine Smallwood, an infectious diseases expert in the agency’s European headquarters in Copenhagen, Denmark. “We still have a huge amount of uncertainty and a virus that is evolving quickly,” she said earlier this month. The WHO does not technically declare pandemics. Its highest alert level is a global health emergency. For many countries, designating a disease as endemic means that fewer resources will be available to combat it, since it will likely no longer be considered a public health emergency. It’s likely the pandemic will be over when the WHO’s experts declare that Covid no longer qualifies as a global emergency, but the criteria for that decision are not precisely defined. “It’s somewhat a subjective judgment because it’s not just about the number of cases. It’s about severity and it’s about impact,” said Dr Michael Ryan, the WHO’s emergencies chief. Others have pointed out that designating Covid as endemic is arguably a political question rather than a scientific one, and it speaks to how much disease and death national authorities and their citizens are willing to tolerate.Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura said the prefecture would hold a meeting on Friday to determine whether to apply for measures referred to as quasi-emergency that allow governors to request restaurants and bars shorten business hours and stop serving alcohol. Yoshimura said he was coordinating with the prefectural governors of Kyoto and Hyogo on making a joint request. “I think the three prefectures will probably join together to request the quasi-emergency measures (on Friday),” Yoshimura said. Yoshimura said he expected Osaka would log roughly 6,000 new infections on Thursday, close to the record number seen on Wednesday. Reuters report that Japan added more than 41,000 new Covid infections on Wednesday as the Omicron variant spread, breaking a record for two consecutive days. New daily infections hit a new record on Wednesday as the Omicron variant spread further, but the government wants to avoid another national lockdown, since the country emerged from its fourth one only last month. “What is there to win in the vaccination lottery? Vouchers!” Chancellor Karl Nehammer told a news conference with the leader of the opposition Social Democrats, Pamela Rendi-Wagner, with whom the measure was negotiated. Nehammer said he wanted there to be a financial reward for those who get vaccinated, adding: “We have learned from the past and we have seen that a vaccination lottery is the best possible way to set up such a system.” The plan appears to be that members of the public, whether already vaccinated or not, would get a ticket for each shot they have had - three tickets in total for those who have had their booster shot. Every tenth ticket would win a €500 (£415) gift voucher, Nehammer said, without specifying what the vouchers were for.Hospitalizations for kids are soaring, although severe illness and death are much less likely for children than adults. “Tons and tons of kids are getting infected this time,” said Almaz Dessie, assistant professor of pediatrics in emergency medicine at Columbia University medical center. Yet vaccinations are lagging. After a short burst of children’s vaccinations soon after the shot was authorized for the five to 11 age group, progress dropped significantly. Read more of Melody Schreiber’s report here: US children’s Covid vaccinations lag despite record infections The Central Epidemic Command Centre said that from Friday entry into venues including bars and night clubs would require proof of full vaccination, either by showing a physical vaccine card or a new digital card. The centre said the move was needed to minimise the risk of community transmission as Taiwan deals with a small number of domestic infections of the Omicron variant. Taiwan has thus far kept the pandemic well under control with strict border measures enacted early on and a highly efficient tracing system. It has reported 18,041 cases to date out of a population of 23.5 million.Pressed again on whether it had been to criticise people earlier in the pandemic for comparing the coronavirus to flu, Javid said: When pressed by presenter Kay Burley on whether England would be dropping self-isolation in March, as Prime Minister Boris Johnson hinted at yesterday, he said that a decision would be taken nearer the time. He said: "},{"url":null,"title":"college","story":"Options to consider \u0026ndash and reasons to be cheerful \u0026ndash when selecting your move after the examYou need to register now to apply for college through the CAO, but you have until July 1st to make a final decision on your course choiceCAO 2022: Most applicants get an outcome which enables them to successfully progress to the next stage of their educational journeyFrom nursing to engineering and environmental studies, there\u0026rsquos plenty of choiceThe Higher Education Access Route and Disability Access Route to Education schemes offer equitable access to higher education.Languages, health and engineering among areas likely to be needed by 2026Many arts graduates now entering marketing, advertising, journalism, technology and lawInstead of taking the traditional route, Denisa Zima chose an accounting apprenticeshipSubject area profiles: Law and Business"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Some \u0026lsquodramatised\u0026rsquo shots in the BBC\u0026rsquos The Snow Wolf were implausibleStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"shared","story":"A new  series on the future of the island of Ireland begins todayFormer Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny eased the path for North\u0026rsquos re-entry into bloc in 2017Conversation about a shared island must have boundaries, many unionists argueStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"state","story":"State papers: Perception on the Shankill Road in 1990s was \u0026lsquofear of encroachment\u0026rsquo-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":null,"title":"state s handling of pandemic to be evaluated taoiseach confirms","story":"Taoiseach Micheál Martin has confirmed there will be an ‘evaluation’ of the handling of the Covid-19 pandemicTaoiseach Micheál Martin has confirmed there will be an “evaluation” of the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.I would prefer to call it an evaluation of how the country managed Covid-19, I think we do have to learn lessons, principally learn lessons for the future that other pandemics would happen,” Mr Martin said.He told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland: “I want to make sure that the spirit of any evaluation is open, decisions had to be made in the best public interests.“Sometimes people can be looking over their shoulder too much in a time crisis, have to be prepared to take action.“This pandemic is not over. We want to be in a better, stronger position if another pandemic arises.”Up to this point Mr Martin said he did not want key figures in the State’s pandemic response being pulled “out of the front line to be inside in some room going through presentations” as part of a review. .“I don’t want people during the next pandemic saying ‘there’s an inquiry coming’ and take a conservative approach,” he said. It was natural that mistakes would be made during a pandemic, but he was “satisfied” decision-makers had always acted in the public interest.The country had come through the wave of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 “better than we might have expected”, he said.The National Public Health Emergency Team (Nphet) is to meet today, with the group expected to give the go-ahead for the easing of restrictions.The Cabinet is to meet tomorrow, after which Mr Martin said he will make a “clear and comprehensive statement about what lies ahead, both in the short term and in the medium term”.CurfewIt is expected some restrictions, such as the current 8pm curfew on hospitality, may be relaxed from next week.Mr Martin said the initial plan to deal with the highly transmissible Omicron variant had been to introduce curbs on socialising and gatherings until the start of February. “I think we can look forward to an earlier lifting of restrictions than anticipated,” he said.The fact the number of new cases had been so high in recent weeks and the State was not in a lockdown was due to the impact of booster vaccinations, he said.“The booster has been the best weapon we’ve had against Omicron,” he said.Those who were unvaccinated, or who had not received their booster shot, were often the ones ending up in hospital with the virus, he said.Mr Martin said he was concerned that the booster uptake among younger people was lower than older cohorts.“It is a concern and amidst all the noise sometimes the message around vaccination can get lost. So there will be a doubling down on the campaign of vaccination,” he said.There could be “another chapter in Covid”, he said.The ending of requirements for people to wear face masks was “some day away yet”.“This pandemic isn’t over by the way,” he added.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"In one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"economic storm clouds gathering","story":"Amid his many travails, Boris Johnson must hope that a few more days will see the “partygate” furore subside, assuming the inquiry by the senior civil servant Sue Gray provides the wriggle room to escape.

Yet just a few months ago at the Tory conference in Manchester, Mr Johnson was extolling the emergence of a high-wage, post-Brexit economy. At the time, shortages of labour, especially drivers, were expanding pay packets. Bosses were told that their reliance on cheap imported workers had to end and they needed to “invest in their people”.On the jobs front there is better news, confounding fears that the pandemic would cause mass unemployment. In fact, employee numbers are at record levels though much depends on what sort of jobs these are. If they are predominantly in low-paid sectors, declining real wages will be problematic.Furthermore, the state itself is a drag on the economy with public sector productivity falling as vast sums were ploughed into the NHS and elsewhere to combat Covid. Mr Johnson is hopeful that a spurt of economic growth will be the harbinger of a high-wage economy in the run-up to the general election. As yet there is little sign of it.More from NewsPolitics latest news: Downing Street parties have \u0026#39damaged our democracy\u0026#39, says Sajid Javid as he admits events were heldCovid latest news: Sajid Javid casts doubt on Boris Johnson\u0026#39s pledge to end self-isolation in MarchPictured: enormous pristine coral reef discovered off the coast of TahitiBury South by-election should be held after Christian Wakeford defected as public deserve a choice, says Sajid JavidGhislaine Maxwell requests new trial over concerns about jurorTwo arrests in Birmingham and Manchester over Texas synagogue hostage attackMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"president biden has humiliated america","story":"It’s never a good sign when a US president throws out a bust of Winston Churchill from the Oval Office on the first day of his presidency. But that’s exactly what Joe Biden did one year ago today, following the example set by his Democrat predecessor, Barack Obama.It was evidently an omen. Once hailed as the man who would “restore America’s standing in the world”, Biden is overseeing the stunning decline of the world’s superpower. A year after taking office, he is flailing at home and abroad, and could well end up a lame duck halfway through his presidency.If the Republicans take the House of Representatives and Senate in the mid-term elections later this year, Biden will be practically powerless on the domestic stage to further implement his agenda. He will be reduced to conducting America’s foreign policy, which is already proving to be a monumental disaster.In the wake of the Afghanistan withdrawal debacle, America’s standing has sunk to lows not seen since the end of the Vietnam War. Even the Carter days look benign compared with the feckless Biden era.In the past few months, I have spoken to dozens of parliamentarians, officials and diplomats across Europe who have simply lost faith in American leadership. One very senior British MP told me last week that Biden’s foreign policy was “appalling” and “completely useless”. And this is coming from America’s closest friend and ally, the UK. With an unashamedly anti-Brexit stance, and an arrogant willingness to lecture Britain on the Northern Ireland Protocol, Biden has succeeded in undermining the Special Relationship. As for America’s enemies, they see Biden as a soft touch, whose time in office is a welcome opportunity to challenge America’s might and undercut the country’s strategic power. It is no coincidence that, with the former senator from Delaware in the White House, Russian forces are massing on the border of Ukraine, China is openly threatening to invade Taiwan, and Iran is rapidly building up its nuclear programme. Under Donald Trump, the adversaries of the US were far more careful not to pick a major fight with a president who was often unpredictable, and clearly ready to wield American military capabilities – as he did with the perfectly timed drone strike that took out General Qassim Soleimani, the commander of Iran’s feared Quds Force, at Baghdad Airport.But Biden’s weakness abroad has been matched by a reckless domestic agenda that plays to the far-Left of the president’s own Democratic Party. A huge expansion of government spending and massive increase in federal debt has helped fuel the biggest rise in inflation in 40 years. Americans have faced a 7 per cent overall increase in prices in the past year, with supply-chain issues resulting in the first major shortages in US supermarkets in several decades.Against this backdrop of economic turmoil, major cities across the country are experiencing soaring crime rates, the direct result of foolhardy Democrat-led “defund the police” initiatives, and dangerous liberal sentencing policies. Looting has become so commonplace in San Francisco and Los Angeles that it barely makes the national news bulletins.Biden’s America has become a byword for economic turmoil, urban decay, rampant lawlessness and far-Left policies that are tearing the fabric of the United States apart.Joe Biden’s first year in office has been catastrophic. With good reason his poll numbers are tanking, and the American people are increasingly turning against the most Left-wing presidency in US history. As witnessed in the dramatic recent election for governor of Virginia, a conservative revolution is coming to the US at both the state and Congressional level, with November’s mid-term elections likely to dramatically shift the balance of power on Capitol Hill.The United States will eventually recover, and it must do so for the sake of the American people and the free world. But we should expect three more years of relentless decline and retreat as Biden’s out-of-touch presidency continues to drive the country’s downward spiral and humiliation.Nile Gardiner is the Director of the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom at The Heritage Foundation.

Because some of the unclaimed coupons will be for youngsters aged under one year - whose parents are entitled to two a week - Feeding Britain believes the weekly unclaimed value is at least £m. It called for an automatic registration scheme so struggling families do not lose out. National director Andrew Forsey believed an overhaul would boost take-up of the scheme “and overcome barriers such as low awareness, bureaucracy, and stigma”. He said: “At a time when hard-pressed families need every bit of help they can get, itaposs appalling to see from these data just how many are now falling through the holes in the safety net.  “Those holes could be fixed at a strokethe Prime Minister shted the basis of Healthy Start from aposopt inapos, to aposopt outapos - thereby helping those families stretch their budgets further each week. “With automatic registration rightly deemed fair and just for some schemes, why not extend it to this one too ”Claimants are eligiblethey are at least  weeks pregnant or have at least one child under four-years-old and receive any of a series of welfare benefits, including Child Tax Credit, income-related Employment and Support Allowance, Income Support, income-based Jobseeker’s Allowance, Pension Credit, or Universal Credit -the family earns £ or less a month.Those who qualy are sent coupons they can redeem in more than , shops.

In some areas, such as Boston, Lincs Rutland, and Staffordshire Moorlands, take-up did not even hit %. Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said that “children growing up in poverty deserve better”.  He added: Rising child poverty and destitution are a shameful national scandal and falling take up of the vital Healthy Start voucher scheme is yet more evidence of Tory incompetence. “Every child deserves the best start in le.“With Universal Credit slashed, rocketing fuel bills, punishing tax rises and more cuts in support for children likely this April, Boris Johnson should be moving heaven and earth to help families hit hard by the cost of living crisis.” A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: “The Healthy Start scheme helps to encourage a healthy diet for babies and young children under four from low-income households.Around % of eligible people currently receive these vouchers and the work to digitise the scheme is ongoing to help even more families to apply for and benefit from the scheme. “Already, more than , families have begun to use their pre-paid card which is replacing paper cards.” How to apply for Healthy Start Who is eligible  You must be at least  weeks pregnant or have a child under four years old.

The Bury South MP blasted Boris Johnson and the Tories for being incapable of offering the leadership and government this country deserves in a brutal letter to the Prime Minister.His sensational departure to the Labour benches moments before Prime Ministeraposs Questions was calculated to inflict a further blow to Mr Johnsonaposs battered authority. The PM is fighting for his political le following the revelations over lockdown-flouting parties in Downing Street, with some Tory MPs openly plotting against him.Ex-Cabinet Minister David Davis rounded on Mr Johnson during the PMQs clash, saying: In the name of God, go.But Red Wall MP Jonathan Gullis claimed some MPs were now withdrawing their no-confidence letters in the PM.  But he told Sky News he didnapost know who they were or how many there were. Ashfield MP Lee Anderson told GB News: Iaposd like to say Iaposm surprised, butanyone was going to defect itaposd be Christian Wakeford - aposWokefordapos, as we call him in that place over there. Heaposs been very vocal in his non-support of the Prime Minister, heaposs upset colleagues quite a few times with some of his tweets and his messages and I say good riddance to bad rubbish. Brendan Clarke-Smith, Tory MP for Bassetlaw, told the Times: “Rather than cause ision, the defection appears to have galvanised many people. “I think it was overstated about actual letters going in, and most people are waiting for the Sue Gray report before saying anything further or making any decisions, which I think is the most sensible course of action.” And a cabinet minister said: “The atmosphere has totally changed. Wakeford’s defection has helped, it’s united the party. In the tearoom there’s total vitriol for those who are plotting to get rid of the prime minister. It’s schoolboy politics but the stakes are incredibly high.” A series of leaked messages emerged of Mr Wakeford criticising Labour, as his former Tory colleagues sought revenge. Mr Wakeford told the PM: I care passionately about the people of Bury South and I have concluded that the policies of the Conservative government that you lead are doing nothing to help the people of my constituency and indeed are only making the struggles they face on a daily basis worse. Britain needs a government focused on tackling the cost of living crisis and providing a path out of the pandemic that protects living standards and defends the security of all.It needs a government that upholds the highest standards of integrity and probity in public le and sadly both you and the Conservative Party as a whole have shown themselves incapable of offering the leadership and government this country deserves.He told broadcasters it was the most dficult decision I have ever had to makeaposapos The new Labour MP said he was not aware of other possible defectors but I am sure thereaposs a lot of soul searching. Labour has been in talks with Mr Wakeford about switching sides for some time and negotiations predate Partygate, a spokesman said. The party signalled there would not be a by-election - and a decision about whether Mr Wakeford will stand for Labour at next election was a question obviously for further down the line. His decision to join Labour led to calls for him to trigger a by-election, as he was elected in  as a Conservative MP.  In  Mr Wakeford supported a backbench Bill demanding MPs who switch parties face a recall petition. Asked whether there should be a by-election, the Prime Ministeraposs press secretary said: I think that that is up to the constituents of Bury South.Patrick Heneghan, Chair of Bury South Labour Party, said: “I welcome the decision of the local MP to quit the failing Conservatives and join the Labour Party. Mr Wakeford has rightly concluded that only Keir Starmer can provide the leadership that this country is crying out for.Members of our constituency party will be meeting tomorrow to discuss how we will be working with our new Labour MP to fight for the interests of residents and secure a future Labour government. But left-wing grassroots activist network Momentum said he should be nowhere near the Labour party. A Momentum spokesperson said: Christian Wakeford has voted with this hard-right Tory Government almost  times in just two years - voting against measures to stop climate change and tax avoidance and against enabling domestic abuse victims to have access to benefits.He should be nowhere near the Labour Party, and the decision by Starmer to accept him is an insult to the millions of working people who want to see a fairer country.Wakeford should be booted out of Labour and a by-election called immediately. Labour must back a candidate that will stand up for the people of Bury South and against this Tory Government.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Conservative PartyLabour PartyPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Health Secretary defended comparing the virus to flu despite over , UK deaths, saying it would become endemic in future thanks to vaccination and better treatment. He said Brits would “probably” need annual vaccinations against Covid like against flu. But he insisted he plans to axe mandatory isolation for infected people from March  - with a final decision on the date “in the next few weeks”.It comes as England’s Plan B work-from-home guidance - along with face masks in school classrooms - have both been axed as of today. From next Thursday England will also axe mandatory Covid passes for nightclubs, mandatory face masks in shops and on public transport, and face masks in communal areas of schools.The government has also vowed to scrap free lateral flow tests in future, with a leaked document suggesting this will happen from the end of June. But Mr Javid also said he would choose to wear a mask in a supermarket or on the London Underground, with guidance continuing to recommend them in enclosed spaces. And one exception is Mr Javid still plans to press ahead with plans to force frontline NHS staff to be vaccinated as a “condition of deployment” from April .Asked by Sky Newshe meant to compare Covid to flu, Mr Javid replied: “Yes”. He said: “If at the start of covid when we had no vaccines, we had no testing infrastructure, we had no treatments, people were comparing it to flu - that would’ve been wrong.” But he added: “We need to learn to live with it. Sadly people die of flu as well. In a bad flu year, you can sadly lose about , lives. “But we don’t shut down our entire country and put in place lots of restrictions to deal with it. We need to continue with our lives with sensible, appropriate and proportionate measures.  “The one thing we’ve learned about flu, because it’s been around for far longer, is we have annual vaccinations, for older people in particular, for children as well. We have good advice. “We may well have some kind of annual vaccination. I think that’s where we’ll probably end up, but it’s really dficult for anyone to say exactly in the longer term where we’ll be. He added: “Covid is not going away. It’s going to be with us for many many years, perhaps forever, and we have to learn to live with it.”Yesterday Boris Johnson confirmed to MPs that the remaining Plan B rules in England would be allowed to expire on January  as the peak of the Omicron wave appeared to be over.The under-fire Prime Minister suggested the country was shting towards living with Covid - like flu - as he battled to save his premiership.  The PM told MPs: There will soon come a time when we can remove the legal requirement to self-isolate altogether, just as we donapost place legal obligations on people to isolatethey have flu. As Covid becomes endemic, we will need to replace legal requirements with advice and guidance, urging people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others.Mr Johnson also told MPs the Government now intended to set out its long-term strategy for living with Covid- , adding: Explaining how we hope and intend to protect our liberty and avoid restrictions in future by relying instead on medical advances, especially the vaccines which have already saved so many lives.But to make that possible we must all remain cautious during these last weeks of winter. There are still over , people in hospital in England alone. The pandemic is not over.

The deputy Prime Minister, who is in charge of the justice system, referred to a May  gathering as a “party” in a nightmare interview with Sky News - before hurriedly backtracking. In an echo of his claim the sea was closed when he spent the fall of Kabul on holiday, he also complained claims the bash was thrown in his honour were “nonsense” because “I wasn’t invited”. Twitter users compared the Cabinet minister to Private Pike from Dad’s Army while shadow foreign secretary David Lammy said: “Itaposs like an episode of Columbo, ‘thereaposs just one more thing, Mr Raab…’.” It came as two serving ministers broke cover to offer criticism of the PM’s No operation - after six backbench MPs called for him to resign. Science minister George Freeman said people in positions of power shouldnapost seek to escape public responsibility or accountability, adding: The prime minister and his office should set the highest standards. Health minister Maria Caulfield said that whether or not rules were technically breached, the spirit of the rules was broken. Mr Raab was dispatched to defend his boss after ex-aide Dominic Cummings said Boris Johnson lied to Parliament about a BYOB gathering on  May .The Prime Minister told MPs he “believed implicitly” it was a work event. But Mr Cummings said principle private secretaryMartin Reynolds agreed to speak to Mr Johnson ahead of the event when another official said on e-mail that it broke the rules.Mr Cummings also said he personally raised the “drinks party” withBoris Johnsonand called No a “madhouse” but the Prime Minister waved it aside.Askedthe Prime Minister should resignhe lied to Parliament, Mr Raab told Sky News’ Kay Burley: “I’m not going to speculate on hypothetical situations.” Askedhe was aware of a drinking culture, the Justice Secretary replied: “No.” But he added: “People were working extremely long hours, so it doesn’t surprise mepeople, as you see in other walks of le, had a glass of wine or beer at the end of a very long week.”  Mr Raab then remarked: “There was speculation that the May  party was held in my honour to thank me, it’s just ridiculous.” When Kay Burley exclaimed “so it was a party!” he replied: “No, exactly, er, no, er, the, no no no no. “This is the claim that was made, it was nonsense, I wasn’t invited and I didn’t attend.”Speaking to Times Radio, the deputy PM defended Boris Johnson saying: Look, the suggestion that heaposs lied is nonsense.Heaposs made it very clear to the House of Commons, took questions on this, that he thought it was a work event.“Of course, Sue Gray is looking into all of this, so Iaposm not going to start commenting on every little snippet that is further trailed in. “Thataposs precisely why we have a proper investigation. And thereaposll be full transparency when it reports.” Mr Raab accepted “double standards” are “toxic” and he was well aware of public anger about the Downing Street bashes. But he claimed: “I think there is something of a caricature that is being depicted against the incredibly professional, dedicated, hard work that I saw.” Mr Cummings claims he toldBoris Johnson“you’ve got to grip this madhouse” after the invite was sent out asking around  staff to attend the BYOB party at No.He says at least two senior officials told Boris Johnson’s Principal Private Secretary Martin Reynolds to cancel the garden party on May , . Mr Reynolds then allegedly checked with the PM whether the event could go ahead, and was told that it could. Mr Cummings, a bitter foe of the PM since his departure from No in November , also claimed he had challenged Mr Johnson himself. If true, this means the PM lied to the house in his apology last week. The Ministerial Code says: Ministers who knowingly mislead Parliament will be expected to offer their resignation to the Prime Minister. Mr Johnson attended the party, it is understood with his we Carrie. He sparked widespread ­disbelief last week atPMQswhen he claimed he “implicitly believed” it was work related.In response to Mr Cummings’ claims, a No spokesman said last night: “It is untrue the Prime Minister was warned about the event in advance. As he said earlier this week, he believed implicitly that this was a work event. “He has apologised to the House and is committed to making a further statement once the investigation concludes.” But Mr Cummings’ allegations will increase the jitters of Tory MPs.  Senior Tory MP Steve Baker said his constituents were “about  to one against the PM” over the parties row. The MP said “rule-makers must obey the rules”, but he said he would wait for Whitehall enforcer Sue Gray’s report before taking any action. Several MPs told the Mirror they had received hundreds of emails from furious constituents about the PM’s apparent rule-breaking. Others said their local associations had urged them to put in a letter to kick off a vote of no confidence in Mr Johnson. One Tory told the Mirror: “The PM is fatally damaged, way beyond repair. Activists are refusing to campaign at the local elections until he is gone.” Sue Gray, whose report is expected later this week, is ­understood to have interviewed Mr Johnson, and No sources claim he has “shared what he knows”.

But that could move againthe virus throws another curve ball into the works, an official said. The government has declined to say what the tests cost, with one source suggesting it is £ for a seven-pack. It comes days after Cabinet minister Nadhim Zahawi insisted there were “absolutely not” plans to axe free LFTs.Downing Street today insisted no decision had been made on when to end free lateral flow tests. But the government’s autumn and winter plan said they would be ended at some point.And today, Boris Johnson announced he wants to ramp down some of England’s other key Covid measures. The PM told MPs he “very much expects” to scrap legally-binding isolation for all Covid-positive people from March  - or earlierhe gets the chance. The Times also reported the government is drawing up plans to shut down testing centres from the spring. The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: Lateral flow tests remain free to use and we continue to encourage people to access them. In our autumn and winter plan which we published last year we were clear that at a later stage the Government, as our response to the virus evolves, universal free provision of things like lateral flow tests will end and we will update once we are in that position. The spokesman added: Thereaposs been no decision made on when that will be, it will depend on what we see in terms of the epidemiology in this country and we will keep that under review. Mr Johnson said legal restrictions in place for two years will end in a statement to MPs today. He announced Plan B restrictions - working from home, masks on public transport and Covid passes for nightclubs - will end over the next week. He added: “There will soon come a time when we can remove the legal requirement to self-isolate altogether - just as we don’t place legal obligations on people to isolatethey have flu. “As Covid becomes endemic we will need to replace legal requirements with advice and guidance urging people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others. “The self-isolation regulations expire on March , at which point I very much expect not to renew them. “Indeed were the data to allow, I would like to seek a vote in this House to bring that date forwards.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Reuters AGThe TimesPlan BBoris JohnsonPublic transportFluPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

By putting up taxes, particularly National Insurance, and refusing to suspend VAT on energy bills, the Conservatives demonstrate with crystal clarity that they are not on the side of hard-working families and pensioners. As Money Saving Expert guru Martin Lewis points out, there is another way. The Conservatives are simply guilty of making bad, wrong choices. Slashing the spending power of households is doubly cruel after all that families are going through because of the Covid pandemic. Our economy is considerably weaker than the partying Prime Minister pretends. Reduced living standards will be one of many legacies of Conservative mismanagement their successors will have to deal with. Big dog’s done  If attempting to misuse the Royal Navy and dismantle the BBC are first glimpses of “Operation Save Big Dog” then the sooner Boris Johnson is put out of his misery, the better for Britain. The Prime Minister’s clumsy attempts to sht public attention from his law-breaking parties only emphasise what an untrustworthy, incompetent lightweight he is. Warships are for war, not for turning back desperate migrants in the Channel. And punishing the BBC for reporting his No boozy bashes is the revenge of a thin-skinned tyrant. Johnson demeans the great office of state to which he now clings. Princely deed  Family rts are painful in private – and excruciating in public. So decent people everywhere will wish the Prince of Wales well in his quest to improve the painfully strained relations with his son. If anyone has a chance of building bridges with Prince Harry, it’s his father.

According to swirling rumours, they were planning to all send letters to Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the  committee, expressing their lack of confidence in Mr Johnson. Still thereaposs no word of how many,any of them, have gone through with the plan. But that didnapost stop the PM calling them up, according to reports.  Mr Johnson is said to have cried as he begged for the group of  Tories to support him as he battles for his political le. When askedthe PM was in tears as he met the MPs, the PMaposs press secretary said: Iaposve seen that report, itaposs not true. The PMaposs Secretary admitted she was not there when they spoke. But she added a second time, itaposs not true.Christian Wakeford, who defected from the Conservative party to Labour this afternoon, was a Tory  MP who had been expressing his anger over the PMaposs handling of partygate for some time.Mr Wakeford was cheered by the Labour party as he sat on their benches.

Nearly  years after she became an MP, the frontbencher believes the party could be on the cusp of reclaiming the keys to Downing Street. As part of her plan to take over the Treasury after ousting the “high tax” Tories at the next election, she tomorrow outlines a five-point plan for boosting growth and creating a stronger economy. Speaking exclusively to the Mirror before her major speech in Bury, Gtr Manchester, she vowed to fire-up economic growth to boost public schools and hospitals. Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletter At the heart of the blueprint is reviving Britain’s industrial heritage - starting in the North where Labour desperately needs to win back “Red Wall” seats toto office. Citing technologies which will help meet the UK”s net-zero by  pledge, Ms Reeves promised to “invest in these new industries of the future that can create those good jobs and re-industrialise some of those parts of Britain - former industrial areas, coastal communities”.  She wants the UK at the forefront of manufacturing, competing against rival nations to build wind turbines, electric cars and exploit carbon capture and storage. “In the Industrial Revolution we led the world and thereaposs a risk today that other countries are going to steal a march on us, and I’m determined not to let that happen,” she said. “We can’t afford to lose that race.” Creating more and better jobs would boost growth and bolster tax revenues - giving ministers cash to pump into public services. Before the coronavirus bombshell, UK growth had dwindled to .% in  and , .% in  and .% in . While experts believe this year’s rate will be .% as the country bounces back from Covid-, the Office for Budget Responsibility predicts growth of .% in , .% the following year and .% in .  “The reason this matters is because we’ve got a cost-of-living crisis and we’ve also got public services - schools and hospitals - that have been starved of cash for the last decade or so,” said former Bank of England economist Ms Reeves, . “But without an economy that’s growing, it’s impossible to improve public services and improve people’s living standards.” The Tories are breaking two manesto pledges by suspending the pensions triple lock and are raising national insurance.  Other financial blows due to hit in April include council tax hikes and the freeze in the income tax personal allowance. The tax burden is set to hit .% - the highest level since the early s when the country was still recovering from the Second World War. “The Government has ended up being a high tax party because they have become a low growth party,” warned Ms Reeves. “That is resulting in people being even worse off than they would be with the increase in gas and electricity prices.” Optimism It has been more than a decade since she entered Parliament, but Rachel Reeves finally believes Labour could be marching back into office. She became an MP in May  as Labour was turfed out of power after  years, and has been in opposition all her time in the Commons. The Shadow Chancellor said: “For the first time maybe I am beginning to hope that this opposition malarkey might come to an end andmight actually see government.  “I didnapost come into politics just to oppose and to argue against and make a speech here and there. “I came into politics to make a dference.” She added: “I was born in , the year Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister - I didn’t see a Labour government until three months after my th birthday.  “My children were born in  and  - I don’t want them to go through their whole time in school under Conservative governments.” Partygate Partygate has stripped support from Boris Johnson and turned voters away from the Tories, according to polls. But how much of the boost to Labour’s ratings is down to policies shaped by the Shadow Cabinet  “People think about the sacrices they have made and yet they were partying it up at No, so no doubt that is having a big impact on how people say they are going to vote,” said Rachel Reeves.  “Butyou look at the polls it’s not just that the Tory vote share is going down, the Labour vote share is going up. “That is really encouraging because that is more than just Conservatives doing badly.” She added: “Because we are a bit ahead in the polls now, people are interested to hear what we’ve got to say. “It’s really important that now we have this opportunity, that we speak to the country about the dference we would make.” Red Wall Thursdayaposs speech takes place in Bury -  miles from Westminster. Symbolically, the Greater Manchester market town’s two constituencies were lost by Labour to the Tories at the  election as the Conservatives demolished the “Red Wall”. Rachel Reeves will be introduced by Greater ManchesterMayor Andy Burnham, dubbed the King of the North. The Leeds West MP said: “As a northern MP, you get frustrated when politicians are at the podium in London all the time.  “I think it’s really good to be taking Labour’s message around the country. “There are seats in Gtr Manchester, including two in Bury, that Labour need to win backwe are to form the next government. “There is no route to Downing Street for my leader Keirthat doesn’t go through Bury, and in my neck of the woods places like Keighley, Wakefield, Colne Valley and Calder Valley, then over to the east like Grimsby. “We have got to win back support in these parts of the country.” Buy British Buying British products for bumper government deals rather than importing from abroad is key to reviving Britain’s industrial sector, Rachel Reeves believes. She blasted the Tories for purchasing foreign steel, defence equipment and other vital goods instead of backing UK manufacturers. “We should be looking at, ‘Are those contracts delivering good jobs and apprenticeships and skills in this country ’ - andthey’re not, why not ” she said, promising a “real step change”Labour was in power.  “The Government is the biggest buyer of goods and services in our economy and too often those contracts are going overseas and not creating value in this country,” said the frontbencher. “If you want to support things like our steel industry for example, we need to ensure we are using procurement to help buy, make and sell more in Britain.”Cut VAT on energyLabour wants the Government to ease the looming energy price hike for families by slashing the % VAT on dual-fuel bills. The Mirror-backed demand would help households when they are slapped with average bills expected to be up to £, when the price cap is lted in April. The Shadow Chancellor said: “We should be insulating our homes properly so that brings down people’s bills permanently.  “We’ve got to regulate the market properly, we’ve got to invest in renewables. “But there’s also something you can do right now, and that is take VAT off people’s gas and electricity bills, and it’s expanding the Warm Homes Discount so pensioners and families who need the most support get a bit more as well. “We would pay for that by a windfall tax on the North Sea oil and gas companies who are making a fortune right now.” Five points for growth The Shadow Chancellor will outline five points to boost growth:Industrial Strategy - “The PM said ‘eff business’ - I thought at the time that was just a quip it turns out to be the organising principle of this Government.” Skills - “Every child should have the chance to go to a good or outstanding school. But there are many families who don’t have that option for their kids.” Investment - “We would put in the investment we need … in hydrogen, in carbon capture and storage, in electric vehicles.” Innovation - “Supporting the entrepreneurs and innovators - we want to create jobs and businesses in all parts of the country.” Britain in the world - “I want to buy, make and sell more in Britain. We should be using all the tools at government disposal to support British businesses and jobs in this country.” Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Andy BurnhamLabour PartyThe TreasuryBank of EnglandTaxCouncil taxPublic servicesBritish economyPoliticsRachel Reeves MP\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Moments after he pledged to win the next election, the Prime Minister said certain measures will come to an end from Thursday. His announcement comes as part of the latest move from Downing Streetaposs aposOperation Red Meatapos - a number of measures rolled out to win back Tory support. The PM has been accused of removing public health protections in the hope of saving his own skin.Dr Saleyha Ahsan, spokesperson for Covid- Bereaved Families for Justice, said: Whilst the Prime Minister removes public health protections in the hope of saving his own skin,  families have tragically lost loved ones to Covid in the last  hours. He isn’t prioritising saving lives and, evenhe was, no one would take him seriously. How can anyone think that this is how le or death decisions should be made But Mr Johnson outlined his plans to start treating Covid like the flu.He told the Commons: There will soon come a time when we can remove the legal requirement to self-isolate altogether, just as we don’t place legal obligations on people to isolatethey have flu.“As Covid becomes endemic, we will need to replace legal requirements with advice and guidance, urging people with the virus to be careful and considerate of others. So what Covid restrictions are coming to an end  Mandatory Face masksFrom next Thursday, people in England will not need to wear face masks anywhere.Tomorrow, January , secondary school pupils will no longer need wear them in classrooms. Instead, the Government will recommend people wear face coverings in enclosed or private spaces. But it will ultimately be their choice.Mr Johnson told the Commons: In the country at large, we will continue to suggest the use of face coverings in enclosed or crowded spaces, particularly when you come into contact with people you donapost normally meet, but we will trust the judgement of the British people and no longer criminalise anyone who chooses not to wear one.Teaching unions have said the move is premature.Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the NEU teachersapos union said: No-one wants face masks for any longer than they have to be on... but I think this is premature - pupils have been back two weeks... and back in full-time education for about  days. Working from home guidanceWorking from home guidance has been dropped as of midday.People have been encouraged to work from homethey could since December .But it was guidance, which means it wasnapost legally binding. But the Government began to encourage it as a means of getting Covid cases down.Tory ministers have repeatedly emphasised how much worth they place on going into offices in person. In an apparent bid to please many Tories who had been calling for aposfreedomapos Mr Johnson said people will be free to commute into work and into busy offices once again. Covid vaccine passesMandatory Covid passes will end next week Thursday just as all restrictions expire on January . Since December , nightclubs and large events like gigs and football matches in England have had to ask punters for proof of either a vaccine, or negative lateral flow test. Mr Johnson had previously suggested the definition of ‘vaccinated’ for a Covid pass would be updated from two to three doses.

Angry Red Wall MPs have been heaping pressure on the Prime Minister as Westminster buzzes with rumours over how many letters of no confidence have gone into the Tory backbench  Committee. Only  chairman Sir Graham Brady knows the true number but tensions are running high as Boris Johnson tries to win over his mutinous MPs. Six senior Tories have openly called for Mr Johnson to quit but reports of a Red Wall rebellion are adding to the PMaposs woes. Dubbed the pork pie plot as a meeting was hosted by the Melton MP Alicia Kearns, it underlines the level of anger among some of the  intake.And Bury South MP Christian Wakeford dramatically abandoned the Tories for the Labour Party on Wednesday. Here we look the new rebels making le dficult for Boris Johnson. What is a aposRed Wallapos Tory MP  The term loosely refers to the Conservatives who won their seats off Labour during Boris Johnsonaposs  election landslide. The Red Wall is a nickname for Labouraposs traditional heartlands in England and Wales, particularly seats in the North of England, North Wales and the Midlands . A swathe of these seats turned Tory in , including Tony Blairaposs old seat of Sedgefield, in Co Durham, Blyth Valley in Northumberland and Workington in Cumbria. These MPs were perceived as loyal to Boris Johnson but discontent has been mounting over broken promises on levelling up and rail reform. Partygate has also landed badly with voters, and some of these new MPs may be feeling vulnerable going into the next election. Who are the Pork Pie plotters  Alicia Kearns The former Foreign Office official has been outspoken about the UK’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and the handling of the crisis by senior civil servants. Ms Kearns, , MP for Rutland and Melton has hosted meetings of anti-Johnson plotters - leading to the plan being named after Melton Mowbray’s most famous export. Her , majority in the safe blue East Midlands seat allows her the luxury of plotting.  Dehenna Davison The PM’s then girlfriend and now we Carrie was pictured campaigning with Ms Davison in Bishop Auckland, Co Durham in the run-up to the  ballot. The -year-oldaposs stunning victory was the first time the Tories had won the seat in nearly  years. The arch Brexiteer presents a GB News show with ex-UKIP chief Nigel Farage.  Gary Sambrook The Birmingham Northfield MP is a Covid passport rebel and said the PM must consider his positionhe is found to have broken lockdown laws. As secretary of the  Committee, Mr Sambrook, , would be one of the MPs responsible for running a no-confidence vote and subsequent leadership race. Chris Loder The former train guard, , worked his way up through the industry to become head of new trains for South Western Railway. His majority of , in the Conservative stronghold of West Dorset should make him electorally immune to fury at the PM and Partygate. Christian WakefordThe Bury South MP didnapost attend the meeting but he became the first Red Wall Tory to say publicly that he had submitted a latter of no confidence.Within  hours he had defected to Labour, dramatically joining the party for Prime Ministeraposs Questions on Wednesday.In an excoriating letter to Boris Johnson, he said: Britain needs a Government focused on tackling the cost-of-living crisis and providing a path out of the pandemic that protects living standards and defends the security of all. It needs a Government that upholds the highest standards of integrity and probity in public le and sadly both you and the Conservative Party as a whole have shown themselves incapable of offering the leadership and Government this country deserves.He added: My decision is about much more than your leadership and the disgraceful way you have conducted yourself in recent weeks.

Get a daily morning politics briefing straight to your inbox.for the free Mirror Politics newsletter “The EU’s deal means they are enjoying a % price advantage over UK producers, which is unsustainable and threatens jobs. “The US is supposed to be our close ally and securing an exemption from these tarfs is well overdue.“ Government needs to sort this and join the US and EU in discussing measures to protect steelworkers from global steel overcapacity.”UK Steel director-general Gareth Stace said the trade body “warmly welcomes the news that the US and UK governments are now entering talks to end this trade dispute”.He warned: “Given the competitive disadvantage created by the EU deal, it is vital that these talks are concluded swtly to limit any additional damage to UK producers. “The tarfs have already reduced UK exports to the US by nearly %.  “Importantly, we hope the UK Government can put its new independent trade powers to full use, building on the terms of the EU’s deal and delivering the best possible outcome for UK producers. “As such, we hope that the US and UK negotiators work together in a spirit of cooperation to deliver a deal and remove these unnecessary barriers to trade. “A good deal is in everyone’s interests - not least US and UK consumers.” American tarfs were first introduced for EU steel - including from the UK when Britain was part of the bloc - in  on national security grounds under Section  of the  US Trade Expansion Act by then President Donald Trump. The US axed duties on steel from the EU on January , but Brexit meant the UK was not included and % tarfs are still slapped on British-made steel crossing the Atlantic. Experts believe President Joe Biden may be resisting cutting duties because of the ongoing deadlock over the Northern Ireland Protocol. Confederation of British Industry international director Andy Burwell said it was vital to agree a negotiated settlement to ease pressure on affected industries. With inflation rising in both the US and UK, both governments must focus on sustainable growth, while supporting the rules-based system which underpins the global economy, he added. A joint US-UK statement said: Both parties are committed to working towards an expeditious outcome that ensures the viability of steel and aluminium industries in both markets against the continuing shared challenge of global excess capacity and strengthens their democratic alliance. But Shadow International Trade Secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said: “The steel and aluminium sector in the UK has been calling for these damaging tarfs to end as quickly as possible.  “But they have been in place for nearly four years and now, from the start of January, companies inside the EU have a competitive advantage.“Labour will hold the Government to account until these tarfs are removed. “Conservative ministers have dithered and delayed, risking workersapos job security and the sectoraposs prosperity, and must now quickly deliver results from these talks.

No Prime Minister is able to survive for long in high office when they trigger scorn in every home, workplace, cafe and pub. A mate of mine, a retired welder in a red wall seat, sent a reworking of a joke about a dead man at the Pearly Gates and was informed by St Peter the hands on heavenly lie clocks ticked only when fibs were heard. The pointers on those of Mother Theresa, Abraham Lincoln and Nelson Mandela had never moved. “Where’s Boris Johnson’s clock ” inquired the man. “We’re using it as a ceiling fan,” replied St Peter. Sacricing the jobs of Downing Street staff to save his own skin will not work for Johnson. It feels like when nothe is booted out of No  by Tory MPs worried about their futures. Nor is he able to cower in a fridge again as the glass door on the front of No ’s wine-time Friday cooler symbolises the charlatan having hidden in plain sight for too long.  Suitcases of booze smuggled into Downing Street, drunken shenanigans on the eve of the Duke of Edinburgh’s funeral and an unprecedented apology to Buckingham Palace have a last days of Rome vibe to them. Labour leads of up to % in the polls are encouraging the opposition to go for the jugular, Keir Starmer justiably accusing the PM of breaking the law and lying. With jilted insider Dominic Cummings orchestrating much of the onslaught, there’s an irony in Johnson as co-author of his own downfall. Labour is aware it should target the Tories as much as Johnson himself when as rising star Wes Streeting acknowledged, the opposition’s best bet’s a mortally wounded PM limping on or the Conservatives will claim they have changed under Rishi Sunak or Liz Truss.What do you think  Have your say in the comments below.From coronavirus to Brexit, our daily politics newsletter is there to guide you these turbulent times.

They successfully played the trick in Government when John Major succeeded Margaret Thatcher, Theresa May followed David Cameron then Johnson came after May. I never bought the Johnson appeal but I understood why many voters did. Brexit, his main pitch, was another lie and anyway even many who wanted to quit the European Union these days avoid talking about the mess. Whatever magic Johnson displayed is gone and isn’t ing. The steady drip of awful rule-breaking, civil servant Sue Gray’s party report, April’s tax rises and soaring energy bills and May’s local elections all threaten fresh blows for a deflated egotist who cut a beaten figure on the ropes at Prime Minister’s Questions. Lting England’s Covid restrictions will earn little credit when he’s lost credibility. Johnson’s political obituaries are being written. Only the publication date is to be decided.

A Parliament probe last June found he had acted in a “threatening and intimidating manner” towards workers after a tech glitch meant he was unable to join a committee hearing. An Independent Expert Panelreport published in June, found Mr Kawczynski had been repeatedly aggressive, rude and impatient in calls made to the private mobile phone of one of the complainants.

If you want to change parties, you need to step down. “You always vote for the party you want in charge so I think it’s ridiculous to switch all of a sudden. “If you’re going to change your view, you should just step down.” And Hazel Donnelly, , said: “I don’t think it was very good at all, he shouldn’t be allowed to do that.  “It won’t change the way I vote because I am a Conservative. “I don’t think it’s a big deal what Boris did - there are much worse things that have happened recently. “There should be certain rules with these things. I think he has broken a rule but there are more important things going on at the moment.” But Barry Humphries, , backed the MPaposs decision. He said: “Good for him, I think he’s doing what’s right for him and he’s standing up for what he believes in.” And Ifkan Ahmed, , added: “I’ve always been happy with him. I think these days it’s okay to change your policies. “He has been very good for our area and I’m happy with what he’s done. It doesn’t matter to me that he has changed.”  Vickie Stone, , said: “If he wants to do it because of Boris Johnson then I think that’s fair enough. “If he doesn’t agree with the way Boris is handling the situation then that’s up to him. “I’m more bothered about the leadership, I’m worried about who is going to replace Borisit ends up going that way.” In Radclfe, the centre of the constituency, the MPaposs office, painted in true-blue Tory colours, was shuttered. Outside on the street, ex-Labour and current Tory voter Mavis Leach said: Well, Iaposm surprised. Are there others doing it, as well, getting out of a sinking ship before it goes down  Mrs Leach, who said she disavowed Labour because of a dislike for former leader Jeremy Corbyn, said Boris Johnson should stay on as Prime Minister.I know heaposs done wrong, done a lot of things wrong, she said. Boris has done a lot of things. We know that. But I think heaposs done a good job in other things,bringing the vaccinations in, and weaposre in a good place for that. Another local, Jonathan Boston, a Labour supporter, said Mr Wakefordaposs change in loyalty is really good news. Presumably, itaposs all to do with partygate, he said, referring to allegations of lockdown-busting parties within No , though a Labour spokesman has since said talks with Mr Wakeford began before the scandal hit. Mr Boston said: From what one hears, all the MPs have had millions of emails from constituents saying, aposItaposs terrible and heaposs got to go,apos so I donapost think any Tory voter, even in Radclfe, or Bury South or whatever, would be surprised at .probably the first of many, I would have thought, especially the newer MPs. I think a lot of the newer ones will do a similar thing. Meanwhile, Chris Holland said he rated Mr Wakeford as a local MP but had not voted for him. He said: Iaposve never voted Tory and I never would do. Iaposve messaged him a few times and he has got back to me. To me, heaposs not been doing too bad. Iaposd rather have a Labourthan a Tory. David Collins, who runs Marieaposs Coffee Shop, a stoneaposs throw from Mr Wakefordaposs constituency office, said: I probably wouldnapost vote for either of them anyway, Labour or Conservative. Theyaposre all as bad as each other. They all promise theyaposre going to do things and none of it ever materialises, does it  You wouldnapost think you were able to jump ship halfway through, would you   Tory voter Joan Humphreys said she feels like her tick at the ballot box has now been wasted. She said: I feel like going down there and saying, aposRight. I want to withdraw it.apos If he wants to become Labour, and he wants to support Labouraposs policies, we should have a by-election and see what the people say. If Boris had held his hands up at the beginning, people would have been far more forgiving about it, but heaposs not. But who are you going to have instead of Boris  I canapost see anybody .

After arriving in Parliament, he made more headlines than many of his fellow -intake colleagues. Last autumn, he admitted to calling rule-breaking Tory MP Owen Paterson a “c***” to his face after the former minister plunged the Conservatives into a sleaze row over his second job, which led to his resignation from the Commons.

Josh Wood, , was in his early twenties when he first downloaded Tinder and reckons he was one of its earliest users. Even being invited to the dating app’s launch party, Josh, originally from Surrey but now living in London, had high hopes for Tinder. But as the years went by and more dating apps like Hinge and Bumble crowded the field, Josh found himself with lots of potential interest - but very few real-le dates. Overall, Josh reckons he had  matches across dating apps in the years he was using them, but he was frustrated when hardly any of them led to dates.For more of the news you care about straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here “When I moved to London I continued to use dating apps for about a year. I’d tried them all but always had the same frustrations that girls didn’t reply,” Josh told The Mirror. He explained he thinks there are pros and cons to how apps have changed the dating scene. “I think they have obviously made it a lot easier to date and opened you up to a lot of new people. You can connect with someone so easily and there are so many success stories,” he explained. But he added: “People have a lot more choice and it makes people picky. They’re just looking for that absolutely perfect person because they can swipe through , people.” After giving up on the apps for good, Josh knuckled down at work and pushed the idea of finding love aside for about three years.But one day, while watching the Champions League final at a bar in Cha, Josh saw a woman who caught his attention - and decided to introduce himself the old fashioned way. The woman he said hello to was called Lisa - and the pair are now in a happy relationship. While Josh’s love le had picked up, he had also been busy with work, developing an app of his own. Bloc, which has now been operating for five years, is a social events app - that can lead to a datepeople want. Populated with every public venue in the world including arenas, stadiums, restaurants and bars, users of the app can ‘check in’ at the venue and then ‘swipe’ on other people who have also checked in there. “Although the idea of Bloc was sparked from dating apps, we didn’t want it to be a dating app,” Josh said. “We mainly reward people for checking in and attending venues. The byproduct of that is you can see all the other people who have checked in there.” Every time a user checks in using Bloc, they are gted the app’s currency, which they can then spend on the app’s store. “The biggest problem we’re solving is that you’re very likely to meet that person in that venueyou’ve connected with each other, whether you want to date them or not,” he said. Josh added the app had a “rollercoaster couple of years” when the pandemic hit and no one was checking into any venues at all. But since lockdowns have eased and le has tentatively ed to normal, the app’s activity is increasing - and it now has , users. Another issue that Josh hopes his app has tackled is safety - particularly for women. Every user goes through a verication check when they first sign up, and the team is working on adding more layers of security. He said: “The big dference is when someone meets a person on Tinder or Bumble, they go to meet them alone. “With Bloc, it’s about checking into a venue like a bar, which you’ll usually go to with your friends. “Maybe a boy and a girl would match on the app and the boy would ask the girl and her friends to hang out with him and his friends. “It’s usually in a group so there’s safety in numbers.”How did you meet the love of your le  Email jessica.taylor@reachplcWhile most of the app’s users are based in the UK, it allows you to check into venues around the world - and Josh wants to expand in the near future.

Alice said the lack of expertise led to some hurtful and unhelpful comments about her weight not being low enough and her generally not being poorly enough. That was really dficult for my parents to hear, she continued. Just as they were getting somewhere they were met with another barrier.  Eventually, Alice was able to find more suited professionals - but said the support in Wales is rather limited. When I did ask for help it often felt like I wasnapost heard which then made my eating disorder worse, she said. At first, she was pointed to a community mental health team involving support workers, psychologists and dieticians, but was too high risk and unwilling to engage with them. When she became more entrenched in her illness, Alice ended up having two inpatient admissions - one to a general medical ward and another to a mental health unit. She said such settings are not appropriate for eating disorder patients and place additional demands on staff there who arenapost trained to deal with such conditions. Aliceaposs le changed for the better when she was admitted to a specialist eating disorder unit in England where appropriately trained staff enabled her to make steps towards recovery. Despite being grateful for the help outside Wales, she said moving away was dficult during such a vulnerable time and believes her home country must look at providing similar specialised units. Fully recovered, Alice is now a second-year psychology student at the University of South Wales. I have now reframed my experience as it has shaped me in many wonderful ways, she said. The student now volunteers for the eating disorder charity Beat as an ambassador to promote awareness through my experience, but also as peer support for those currently struggling. Beat has published a new report this week which looks at the progress made since a review was submitted to the Welsh Government in . It found that while some progress has been made to expand and improve services for the , people in Wales with an eating disorder, this progress has been very uneven. Beataposs national officer for Wales, Jo Whitfield, said: We know that accessing the right treatment quickly leads to the best chance of making a full recovery, and it is encouraging to see that some progress has been made.Implementing our recommendations would enable the Welsh Government and NHS Wales to transform these services across the whole nation, ensuring that everyone affected in Wales can access le-changing support quickly.In response to the report, a Welsh Government spokeswoman said: We have continued to invest in eating disorder services and since , health boards have received an additional £.m to support improvements, in line with the  Eating Disorder Review.

The average night saw the -year-old sink up to eight cans of beer, as well as deep-fried chicken, pizza or Chinese takeaway. He said his beer belly got so out of hand it would dig into his belt when he fastened his shoelaces. During the second lockdown, Matthew realised he wasn’t happy with his weight and decided to do something about it. Despite having no experience in a gym, he signed up to Ultimate Performance Personal Trainers Leeds after walking past one day. He has since lost kg and achieved his goal of getting a body like the one Hollywood star Chris Pratt sported in Jurassic World. Matthew said: “It was a depressing time for everyone. The second lockdown affected my mental health. “I wasn’t enjoying my job, my weight wasn’t right. I ended up leaving my job and getting into fitness, things started to get better. It was hard at the time. “I was struggling to commit to a run by myself then decided it was time to join a gym. Being a tight Yorkshireman I wanted to get my money’s worth.” Prior to lockdown, Matthew would get up to , steps in a day, however, this plummeted to around , steps mainly from walking his dog.  After joining the gym and having a personal trainer, he was taught how to use the equipment properly and would do three one hour workouts each week, and he increased his steps to , a day. After  sessions in  weeks, he dropped all the weight and said he “feels a million times better”.His blood pressure has come down and he is now much more body confident and happy as a person, he added.Matthew describes what a typical day was like for him before he started his fitness journey A day in the le of me, on a workday – say itaposs Monday itaposs wake up, maybe I have some Pop-Tarts, so just sugary carbs, Iaposd have a coffee, probably three or four coffees in the morning. Breakfast, a couple of sausages, just on the fly with some hash browns. Again, just dirty food. ThatapossI had time to eat it. Lunchtime, again, we had a lot of naughty-type food, like deep-fried chicken and things like that, which would be on the menu. So deep-fried chicken, evenI had it as a salad. Itaposs just loads of hot sauce, and I didnapost realise the number of calories in hot sauce – just the worst ones with so much sugar in them. Get home, and then for tea, it might be a take-away pizza or Chinese. On average, Iaposd probably be having anywhere between four to eight cans of full-fat beer a night, not like Bud Light or Budweiser. Just every night Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday were even bigger blowouts. I wouldnapost even realise it because, throughout lockdown, it just became a norm to have constant drinks. When I came back into work, I was like, Oh, itaposs Monday. Yeah, we always have a drink on a Monday. So my mentality was, Letaposs have a couple of beers. The next thing you know, I would have about , calories in beer a day, on top of all the dirty foods.

Tom - real name Bokejon Akram - was a Russian soldier and school teacher taken as a POW by the Third Reich. They took him to the occupied Channel Island of Jersey as a slave but he managed to escape and was taken in by Phyliss and John. They risked their lives by hiding him in their house where he had trap door escape routes.Have your say on this story in the comment section He told their five young kids fairy stories and even kept a diary - just like the teenage Anne Frank in Amsterdam. The family called him aposTomapos and taught him English – partly by reading the Bible with him. He survived with them for three years and was repatriated to the Ukraine in  by the British. They lost touch after the war and the familyaposs story has now emerged as officials at Jersey Heritage try to discover more about him.

My grandmother used to talk about Tom all the time. It just shows what kind people they were. It makes me proud.  It was a time of crisis and they had German soldiers walking in whenever. aposaposThey still risked their own lives, and the lives of their children, to help someone who they didnapost even know and let live in their house as a member of their family. There was a little door under the staircase in the house with a trap door behind it - that is how Tom could get from one side of the house to the other.aposapos Phyliss and John are reported to have said: We trusted this man, he was the sort of man we could trust. The children loved him and, when he could understand some English, he used to read them fairy stories. Tomaposs journey began in July  when the young Ukrainian soldier and unmarried school teacher defended his country against German attack. During a two hour period , of his colleagues died and Tom alongside many other Ukrainians became a PoW. The German soldiers collected thousands of people and used them as slave labourers to quarry stone and build coastal defences.  Tom then found himself with , others taken to St Malo in Jersey in July . He was put into hard labour but managed to run away and was found in St Mary - by Phyliss, John, and their four very young children.

Dulcie, who was four when the Occupation began, remembers Tom like a favourite uncle. In May , before repatriation to the Ukraine by British forces, Tom promised to keep in contact.  Three letters arrived in June  from Guernsey where Tom was last known to be - but then nothing. Years later John was one of  Jersey men and women awarded a gold watch by the Soviet government for their courage in helping to shelter Russian and Ukrainian escapees.

You never know what stories are going to come out after  years.It’s always fascinating to hear a new piece of information or research, and add it to the stories that we tell each year to remind people about this signicant part of the Island’s history.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterMORE ON Uncle TomAnne FrankEducationSoldiersNazis\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I couldnapost see her for a long long time and that was really upsetting.She was on her own and she did need the help and we had to abide by the rules.  Andhe was having parties etc, but he was denying he knew it was going on at his own house. He needs to go, Iaposm sorry heaposs got to go. You know whataposs going on under your own premises, Iaposm ever so sorry. Does he really need to be told  Heaposs the Prime Minister, he knows whataposs going on. Others have echoed Mindyaposs calls for the Prime Minister to resign. Katie Halgreen, another Plympton resident, told PlymouthLive: I think he should resign because heaposs making an idiot of himself, and idiots of all of us. I think itaposs really disgraceful.

You have sat too long here for any good you have been doing. In the name of God, go. Mr Johnson replied: What I can tell him - I donapost know what quotation he is alluding to - what I can tell him is and I think have told this House repeatedly, I take full responsibility for everything done in this Government and throughout the pandemic.

James, , from Walsall, West Midlands, believes he contracted coronavirus during a night out in Birmingham and was left in a -day coma as a result of the virus. The fitness fanatic suffered headaches, loss of appetite and light-headedness before recording a positive lateral flow test. His condition quickly deteriorated, reports Birmingham Live. “I was sweating and I couldn’t stand up properly,” said James. “As I was going home my throat was tight and I was struggling to breathe, so I called .” At Walsall Manor Hospital, James was told there was a long wait for admission and decided to go home before ing the next morning.  Two more trips to AE followed after James suffered hallucinations. He was still feeling unwell and light-headed, and the second time, he passed out. James added: “I was having nightmares, and the next thing I knew, I was in ICU. “They told me I had a lack of oxygen to the brain and at one stage I was told I had died and they had to resuscitate me. He was placed in an induced coma for  days and spent more than a month in hospital before eventually getting on the road to recovery. But then he was dealt another Covid-related blow. Recalling the horrying experience, he said: “A doctor asked, ‘can you walk ’ So I tried but I collapsed like a newborn donkey. “I really struggled to talk too because I was so out of breath.”  After  days in the hospital, he has become so weak that he now needs carers to support his everyday needs. Reflecting on being so scared at what happened to him, he had no hesitation in getting the vaccine after also being encouraged to do so by family members.“I am fit, healthy and as fit as a fiddle and I caught Covid- with no underlying health problems whatsoever,” he said.“Having Covid- is no joke and it’s not going anywhere. The reason I had the vaccine was to lessen my anxiety because I’ve just been in ICU and I really don’t want to go into hospital again. “Anyone who doesn’t have the vaccine is an idiot. Having some help to protect you is better than having no help –you just rely on your body to fight it, it’s not enough.” James now encourages friends to follow suit. “Some of my mates who know my situation now take it more seriously and have now been vaccinated,” he added. “I text them saying ‘make sure you do’. I was lucky – I came out of it the other side. Normally I am someone who thinks they can just sleep these things off but I am a transformed person and I’m glad I listened to my family. “As someone from the Afro-Caribbean community, I would urge everyone to forget any stubbornness about it because that won’t keep you alive.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON HospitalsFitnessCoronavirus\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get our daily coronavirus email newsletter with all the news you need to know direct to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The footage of Primrose Court has racked up more than five million views.A voiceover on the video, which was created by a TikTok user scrolling on Google Street View, says: Look at the f****** state of this street in Liverpool.It shows derelict homes with their windows boarded back in September , while music from the horror film Dead Silence plays over the top of it, the Liverpool Echo reports.Residents living in the area said they feared for their safety due to gangs torching houses and setting fires in the street.The issue of crime coupled with fly-tippers targeting the area has caused many people to move out of the area.  One man, who did not want to be named for safety reasons, told the ECHO: I feel unsafe. Thereaposs a gang - they donapost want to see this area getting better. All the time people are bringing their rubbish and they make fires. I canapost describe it to be honest with you, it looks like Beirut. Iaposm looking for a safe le, Iaposm not looking for trouble. Every day Iaposm going to work, I pay my bills. I remember one man moved in and he left after a couple of months because he wasnapost safe here. Theyaposre nice houses but for some reason, these people donapost want to see this area getting better. The problems with Primrose Court appear to have started when the development was first built by two private companies who went bust before work on site was completed. This means key elements such as street lighting and ‘proper kerbs’ have not been installed on the road. And because the road is unadopted, the duty to maintain it belongs to the owners of the properties.  In a previous interview with the ECHO, one woman who did not want to be named said she lived in a house on Primrose Court for seven years until she couldnapost take anymore. She said: It was nice when I first moved in. They were lovely houses. It went really bad around June . One family moved in and the next minute they all turned up. That was when it all went downhill. After the families moved out of the houses, which are privately owned, the woman said kids living in the area continued to vandalise them by smashing up windows. Speaking to the ECHO earlier this month, the owner of A Properties, Colin Bell, said of the  houses he manages across the region the  properties he owns on Primrose Court create % of our problems.  On average, Colin said he spends around one and a half to two days a week on the estate attending to issues and clearing up rubbish that has been left there. Colin said: All around Primrose Court there are nice properties going up and being sold immediately. The area is ripe for investment but weaposre stuck with Primrose Court simply because of the council really, I donapost know how many times Iaposve rung up asking whataposs happening or sent emails. They come back with the same thing apostheyaposre hoping to get funding.apos Of the  properties on Primrose Court, Colin said nine of the houses, which are owned by dferent landlords, are currently empty - and four of them are believed to have been derelict for over  years.Colin claims that in October , Knowsley Council promised street lighting would be installed and work on the road would be completed on the grounds that each property owner would pay towards the work. He said: Itaposs a crazy situation. Over two years ago now we agreed for the council to do the work and we would repay the council. For any of the houses that we didnapost repay, the council would repossess the houses and they would have charge of them. We were told the work would be completed in nine months - this was pre-covid. Up to now, weaposre still no further on. However, Knowsley Council has disputed these claims and said the properties on Primrose Court are all privately owned and the council never agreed to repossess them. A Knowsley Council spokesperson said: “Knowsley Council did not build the properties at Primrose Court and has never owned them. It is therefore not the case that we are able to aposrepossessapos them and we have never agreed to do so. “In fact, many of the issues at Primrose Court arise because the development was built by two separate privately-owned companies – both of which went into liquidation without completing the work on-site and without meeting the planning conditions for the developments.  This meant that the usual processes for adopting the highway, installing street lighting etc could not be followed and the same problem prevents the installation of other measures such as CCTV. The current property owners expect the Council to use a considerable amount of public money to complete a privately owned development. “The Council has been in regular dialogue with the homeowners and landlords of properties in Primrose Court since the initial issues arose in the area. The council continued: A number of Council services, including Housing, Highways, Environmental Health, and Crime  Communities, have worked with homeowners and landlords to identy solutions to the issues on site, try to identy sources of funding, and agree a collaborative approach to tackling the issues that are evident. “For example, the Council met with some of the owners to discuss co-funding highways and infrastructure improvements to bring the road up to adoptable standards. At that meeting, the owners who attended agreed - in principle - to co-fund this work. Unfortunately some of the other owners who did not attend refused to agree to contribute their shares, which would be required to progress the adoption of the road under a Private Streetworks Agreement. The Council has established how much the work would cost should an agreement ever be reached, but these costs are only going to continue to increase as time passes due to the poor original construction of the road by the developers. “Unfortunately, the Council is not in a position itself to fund all of the work which is required on site. Indeed, this would not be appropriate given that the Council does not own any housing and is not able to re-possess privately-owned properties. “Despite this challenge, the Council continues to look at solutions to tackle the issues being experienced and we are bidding for additional funding to carry out work in the area. Only last year, we pledged an extra £ million of funds specically to tackle crime and anti-social behaviour across the Borough – which is a key issue here. “The standards at Primrose Court are not acceptable and we remain committed to working with the owners on collaborative solutions to resolve the issues for all concerned.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON GoogleKing of the KippaxCCTVViralCCTV footageCrimeGoogle Street View\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

She said she had the feeling something was going on, but added: My mind wouldn’t accept it because I know he’s not into romantic stuff.  “When I opened his bedroom door, I saw lights and balloons. I got mixed emotions. I was laughing and crying at the same time and I was scared to fully open the door.”Ronica said she walked into the room to find a laptop playing their favourite video game, Genshin Impact, was sitting on top of his bed.She went on to say: “He created some obstacles and mazes in the game. It was very creative because I know it’s so hard to make. “He even said it took him more than a month because he needed to buy the supplies in the game’s shop.” As she played the game, Jerome had hidden messages throughout the online world, reading: Roses are red, violets are blue, forever is real with you.

Taking their seats, Kate, , who arrived in a smart navy coat and a black polo neck for the engagement in central London, asked the experts: From your experience what makes the dference between a young person succeeding after leaving foster care and when they do not. They heard about challenges for young people when they regularly move home and are sometimes exploited by the criminal world. William added: If you keep moving a child around when they are an adult their relationships are so short and shallow. Kate said she was concerned that without providing stable homes for children they risk being moved around and having to tell their story again and again. Will said: That may become emotionally exhausting to tell the story again and again. Weaposve had that in the mental health side of things, people end up on the street, go through hoops and hurdles, tell so many people in authority and nothing changes. You have to get to them a lot earlier so they donapost have to keep doing this. Later as they left the event William, , could not avoid the drama of his own family as a TV crew asked the Duke do you support Prince Andrew  as the couple left the museum. The Duke leaned closer to hear but then walked past without commenting. Part of their engagement, handpicked by the couple to be their first event of the year, saw them discuss the worry about the consistency in care:  Olympic hero runner Kris Akabusi, poet Lemn Sissay, and Allan Jenkins, editor of Observer Food Monthly, told the Duke and Duchess their experiences of growing up in care. Akabusi said: I enjoyed the stability. It was a saviour for me. He said leaving care aged -years-old was very traumatic. Kate replied: You are petried leaving for independence. She asked the m hurdlerit had affected his relationships. Kris, with his distinctive laugh, replied: Yes, but I am a loner. He added: Now aged  there is no stigma attached when I say I was brought up in care but there was a stigma when I was . Women who had previously been in care then joined the couple in an aposice-breakerapos armed with three-foot long pencils. They drew on a canvas what they could see in front of them without looking down at the floor. Kate - who scored a master of arts degree in art history at St Andrews University - laughed out as she struggled with the artwork which had the look of a vast doodle when it was finished. Duke laughed and said: I enjoyed it. The kids would really enjoy that. Viewing their masterpiece, he added: Thataposs beautul. Athlete Kris Akabusi said afterwards: It is great to have so many vital resources for young people. As a young person in care, to know people at the top are interested in your story and growth as an adult is very encouraging. Hopefully they are not forgotten. Young people who were in care are over-represented in gangs, sex industry and crime, I hope society has not forgotten them as these children are in care throigh no fault of their ownnso it is great to have this infrastructure. The Foundling Museum tells the history of the Foundling Hospital, the UK’s first children’s charity. It was founded in  as a home for children whose mothers couldn’t keep or care for them. The Museum delivers training, mentorship programmes and creative projects, led and developed by contemporary artists, writers and musicians, to continue to use creative action to transform and improve the lives of care-experienced young people. It helps around  adults who grew up in care every year. The Tracing Our Tales is described as a unique programme which has been developed to equip care-experienced young adults from London boroughs with the skills to devise and deliver workshops at the Museum for family groups. The programme provides paid employment and valuable le skills, including public speaking, critical and creative thinking, and people management, as well as skills in art and creative expression.

Manubi’s overlay text on the video, reading “DoorDash food delivery girl is not getting a tip after THAT comment!!” makes it clear that he believes the delivery driver called out a rude comment, along with the TikTok caption: “I may have ordered a little too much but that comment was a little overboard” and the hashtag “youresofat”. However, the TikTok has since received .m views, , likes, along with thousands of comments - many of which are from people who believe all is not what it seems. Some claims in the comments section are from people who believe Manubi misheard the delivery and that she was saying something  entirely. One person wrote: “I heard ‘Your foods up.’” Another person said: “She said ‘It’s DoorDash…’ Karen.” Someone  replied: “Bro she said ‘foods outside.’ “She definitely didn’t say that, you can tell just from the way she says it that she was just telling you the food was outside,” a fourth person replied. Other more cynically-minded TikTokers accused Manubi of using the misinterpretation as an excuse to not pay the driver a tip.  “She said ‘It’s DoorDash’ you just want to be cheap,” one person said. While some viewers were against Manubi, others backed him and his claims. One person said: “I can definitely hear the pronounced F at the end for fat. There’s no way she said DoorDash or anything . It doesn’t even sound similar.” “It’s pretty clear, she said it,” another person wrote. Someone  added: “LMAO BRO SHE LITERALLY SAID IT ARE U GUYS DEAF.” A portion of viewers sat on the fence, or were simply confused. “What did she say ” one asked. Another person wrote: “At first I heard ‘ur foods up’ but I watched it again and heard “ur so fat”. Reading the comments, it appears there is no conclusive answer.

The Duke of Sussex’s unprecedented move of threatening to sue the government is both breathtaking and utterly baffling. Those in royal circles have almost universally questioned the play at hand, not only in its nature but equally in execution. True enough, with his background in the military and his position in one of the most famous families in the world – and celebrity lestyle – Prince Harry and his family are arguably high profile targets.  But to suggest he is at a greater risk at home than abroad, where he has chosen to base himself, surely holds very little weight. Indeed the manner of this row seems even more bizarre that it is still being argued two years on from being granted his wish to up and leave his royal role, on the understanding that you can’t have everything you want. This is all before even considering the effect on the Queen, who we are told has been made aware of her grandson’s latest bright idea just as she emerges from one of her most tumultuous periods of recent years. She faced her first Christmas without her beloved husband before wielding the axe on her son Prince Andrew’s royal career.What do you think  Have your say in our comments below... The decision to banish him into the wilderness, arguably a couple of years behind schedule, would not have come easy no matter the depths of his fall from grace. Now, just three weeks away from the beginning of her Platinum Jubilee year, Her Majesty is facing down another petulant member of her family for reasons she would be forgiven for assuming had been sorted. Keep up to date with all the latest news from the Queen, Charles, William, Kate, Harry, Meghan, George, Charlotte, Louis, Archie and the rest of the family. Weaposll send the best Royal news directly to your inbox so you never have to miss a thing.to our newsletter here. At every turn the Queen has handled Harry’s behaviour with good grace, wishing him well and extending a loving sentiment that he and his family would always be much loved members of her own. With the season of goodwill to all now behind us, one may wonder how much is left.

The announcement that Plan B measures, which mandated people wearing masks and working from home where possible, will be lted on January  comes as welcome news to many.Because of the still-high numbers, the likelihood of fewer masks, and public places and transport getting a little busier in the coming weeks, it is important to know what to look out for.It is also important for the millions who have been vaccinated to be familiar with Covid symptoms and be able to recognise how they may dfer from symptoms among the unvaccinated. An array of studies has found that Omicron is, on the whole, a milder iant of the virus, with the first official UK report finding that it is between  and % less likely to cause hospitalisation than Delta.Despite this, getting your booster jab remains the best way to protect yourself and those around you from the virus. What symptoms should people look out forthey are vaccinated   Although its findings are not peer-reviewed, the ZOE Covid app study is a useful indicator that pools together the symptoms experienced by people who have tested positive for the virus.Data collected by it has found there are nine symptoms that keep cropping up. Professor Tim Spector, who is one of the key figures behind the project told newsGP : The  million reports submitted via the study’s app have shown that as the virus has evolved, so too have the symptoms it causes. Back in , it quickly became clear that the original and Alpha versions of the coronavirus caused three very common symptoms – cough, fever and loss of smell – as well as at least  others. When Delta appeared, we then noticed a sht in the most frequently reported symptoms. Cold-like symptoms – including a runny nose, sore throat and persistent sneezing – became more common, along with a headache and cough, particularly in people who had been vaccinated. He added: It’s causing symptoms that are much more like a regular cold, particularly in people who’ve been vaccinated, and fewer general systemic symptoms, such as nausea, muscle pains, diarrhoea and skin rashes. This means the nine common symptoms among the vaccinated according to respondents who have added their data to the ZOE Covid app are:Runny noseSore throatSneezing Headache Cough Nausea Muscle painsDiarrhoeaSkin rashThese are of course not necessarily the only things to keep an eye out for but are handy to know aboutyou find yourself developing any of these symptoms.

But theyaposve had several homes together since they first started dating almost six years ago. After they became engaged, Meghan moved in to Harryaposs small two-bedroom cottage at Kensington Palace, which is just a few doors up from the Cambridge family. But after their wedding, they wanted somewhere bigger to raise a family and went to the Queen with an idea. But according to a report the pair faced disappointment when the monarch rejected the request they made about their home. According to the Sunday Times, the couple asked the Queenthey could live at Windsor Castle.  The report, written by Roya Nikkhah states: The couple are understood to have set their hearts at first on Windsor Castle, and are believed to have asked the Queenliving quarters could be made available after their marriage.But Harryaposs granny said no and gave them Frogmore Cottage instead.Hugo Vickers told the Express why the Queen may have decided to deny their request, saying it might not have been entirely appropriate.

He writes: There are empty bedrooms and suites in the private apartments within Windsor Castle which the Sussexes may have had their eye on, or perhaps some former living quarters in the castle grounds converted into other things. But I can see how it might not be entirely appropriate to have a young family living there. Before the birth of Archie, the couple moved into their Frogmore Cottage home, later than expected due to delays with renovation work. Itaposs just over two years since they moved out of Frogmore and started their new le in the US. But it has now emerged that Harry does not want to bring Meghan and their two children to the UK to visit, saying there is a lack of security. The -year-old, who remains sixth in line to the throne despite quitting royal duties in , has threatened legal action against the Home Office unless he can have police protection for his family when in the UK. He is said to be keen to bring Archie and Lilibet to visit his homeland but claims he is unable to do so. Megan and Archie have not ed to the UK since the couple walked away from royal le in , while Lilibet has yet to set foot in the country where her dad was born. Lawyers acting for the Duke of Sussex say they will seek a judicial reviewcontinued security, which he has offered to pay for, is not provided when he and his family visit.

I absolutely hate standing at check-outs.Bill is one of a flock of people who headed to Greenwich to try out Aldi Shop  Go, the budget supermarketaposs first cashless store, on its second day of opening.After a dficult start to his shop involving five dferent members of staff valiantly trying to download an app onto his phone, Bill got through the automatic gates and into the fruit and veg aisle. The retired BT worker appeared through the exit ten minutes later an advocate of the new system. I will definitely be coming back, he smiled. If Aldi can convert more octogenarians like Bill to the cashless shopping cause, then the German company is probably onto a winner. When it opened its flagship south London shop on Monday Aldi was following in the footsteps of Amazon Fresh.  The American retail giant stripped away much of the inbuilt faff of food shopping by ditching human and automated tills when it launched in London last year. Like its rival, Aldi asks shoppers to download and enter their card details into an app, which is then sent a rundown of how much theyaposve stuffed into their trolleys. Unlike Amazon Fresh - which monitors products via pressure pads on shelves - Aldi tracks who has grabbed what with a huge rig of  cameras that hangs from the ceiling. The storeaposs Articial Intelligence computer system then denotes each person a stick figure, so as not to log any identying characteristics and watches as the virtual you select items.  Aldi insists that the ultra-high-tech surveillance model means shoppers can pick up a product, place it in their bag and then put it back on a shelf without being charged. I put this claim to the test during my visit by selecting and then unselecting pineapples, bananas and melons multiple times while turning small circles with my wheelie-cart. Somehow the omniscient grocery gods knew only to add a banana to the receipt that dropped onto my phone half an hour later. Shoppers leaving the store agreed that the smart system sped up the supermarket experience considerably. Xanthe Williams, who lives in Greenwich and runs Fourth Day PR, said the shop had been fun and that she would come back.  Yasmine Aysha, a full-time mum-of-two from the area, managed to pile her buggy high with items in just fteen minutes - far quicker than her usual round. Like mum Kerry Palmer, from Greenwich, they also agreed that the experience would take a bit of getting used to. It was proper weird, she said.How do they know what you are picking up  Itaposs just really odd. It feels like you are shoplting without shoplting. Another small thrill that Aldi Shop  Go offers is the chance to be aged by its computer system. As soon as shoppers pick up an age-restricted product, such as a beer, paracetamol or four-pack of energy drinks, the AI machine triggers the age verication system. You must then show a staff member your ID or open the app and look deep into the camera. If the unforgiving binary eye that looks back decides you look over-, youaposre good to go. If youaposre lucky enough to look younger, staff will come and manually approve the purchase. It can only be a matter of time before a teenager with a head full of talcum powder, horn-rimmed glasses and a brown mackintosh attempts to game the system. When the novelty of the experience wears off, as one suspects it will after a few shops and failed attempts to trick the computer, it will be interesting to see how Aldi Shop  Go measures up to a typical supermarket.  For many people, a trip to the shops is a social activity that culminates in a chat with a cashier. Although there were many staff on hand to help customers navigate the new app, it has to be assumed that the final product will be much more streamlined. Some are wary of the impact this could have on the high street. Dr Jackie Mulligan, founder of local shopping  ShopAppy, warned: “Checkout-free stores are sterilising the high-street experience. Yes, they bring some advantages in terms of time savings, but they come at the cost of basic human interaction. “Technology is the future but people need to play a part in it, too. If Covid has taught us anything, it is the importance of social interaction.

And today the wise-beyond-her years tot performed a star turn on Sky News, where presenter Sarah-Jane Mee asked her what the Prime Minister did wrong. Smart Layla replied simply: He went to a party in lockdown.Layla for PM  Have your say in the comment section! Layla also confirmed she stuck to the rules herself during lockdown, and her fourth birthday party was held on Zoom. Sarah-Jane then askedLayla forgave the PM for the parties. The thoughtful girl replied yes and said it was because he gave everyone an injection on the arm, in reference to the vaccine program. However, when asked what should happen to Mr Johnson, little Layla didnapost mince her words when she declared: I think he should leave because he has been naughty. Parents Devina Somani, , and Nick Somani, , filmed the cutthroat monologue and were sat beside her today as she gave her blistering verdict. Her comments have left many online hailing her as the next PM. One wrote: Layla for Prime Minsiter! She doesnapost need luck, she knows the rules. Another wrote: Fantastic! Layla talks more sense than Boris. I’d vote for her to be the next Prime Minister.  A third chimed in: May God bless her, she speaks more sense than the grown-up politicians especially our PM.In last weekaposs video, which has been viewed thousands of times, Layla told her doting grandparents:Boris Johnson told everyone to stay at home, but in lockdown he just went down to a party, in the lockdown. Heaposs been naughty, so he had to go to the naughty centre to tell everyone heaposs sorry for going to a party in lockdown. She continued: Now he canapost be prime minister anymore and he canapost go back to his prime minister home, so heaposs not prime minister anymore. So, someone  is being prime minister and there will be a good prime minister, but Boris Johnson is not a prime minister anymore, heaposs a bad prime minister.Mr Johnson may be forgiven by Layla, but he still faces calls to quit after continuing allegations of rule-breaking parties in No and further accusations he has lied to Parliament.  Yesterday, he claimed nobody told me that a boozy lockdown bash in the Downing Street garden broke Covid rules. He broke cover for the first time in days to insist that he hadnapost lied to Parliament about the event in May , which he has admitted attending for  minutes. Last week, the PM admitted to MPs that he briefly attended a BYOB gathering in the No  garden on May   - but tried to claim he thought it was a work event.

The UK is set for another day of icy temperatures on Thursday before the mercury dips further on Friday with people being told to take care and also look out for vulnerable people who may need help. Met Office forecaster Clare Nasir said: “[There will be] Arctic air streaming down from the north delivering snow showers particularly in the far north east of the country before high pressure moves in from the west affecting mainly England and Wales and a stronger wind will develop in Scotland.”Wintry showers are bringing hail and snow in Scotland and running down the east coast with an icy northerly wind, with temperatures well below freezing going into Thursday.  Due to the freezing conditions the UK Health and Security Agency has urged people to check neighbours are safe, especially in parts of England which will have their coldest temperatures of the winter.Agostinho Sousa, a consultant at the agency, said: Cold weather can have a serious impact on health, particularly for older people and those with heart and lung problems, as it increases the risks of heart attacks, strokes and chest infections.He added: Remind vulnerable relatives and neighbours to heat their home to at least C - particularlythey have reduced mobility, are  or older, or have a health condition. Should they need to go outside, itaposs important for them to wear shoes with a good grip.  It is set to remain cold during Thursday although there will be bright skies in many areas and then the freezing temperatures on Friday could be the coldest this winter in the south. Met Office forecaster Aidan McGivern said: On Friday morning, thereaposll be a widespread frost. Itaposll be perhaps the coldest night of the winter for some southern parts of the country.  BBC weather forecaster Chris Fawkes also predicted icy conditions.He said: Another cold night to come on Thursday,anything even colder across England and Wales plummeting the depths, temperatures could get down to about -C, -C in the coldest spots.” It will be milder in the North West with more cloud cover but the south of the country will have the brighter skies during the day on Friday. UK forecast for the next  days Today: A few showers for coastal parts east England and northeast Scotland, locally wintry during the morning. Isolated showers at first in Cornwall. Otherwise cold but dry and sunny for most. Cloudier in the north with a little rain possible later. Tonight: Dry and clear for most with light winds. Widespread frost for much of England, Wales and southern Scotland. Cloudier in the north and northwest with a little drizzle.  Friday: Mostly dry with good sunny spells in the east and south. Cloudier in the north and northwest with a little drizzle, cloud gradually spreading southwards. Outlook for Saturday to Monday: Increasing cloud for the weekend but remaining dry for most in the south with some patchy fog and frosts. Windier but milder with more light rain in the north.

Kelsie, , from Bolton, was entrusted by her dad Gaz Grfin to place her standard Big Mac order through the JustEat app. But while Gaz, , was tidying the bedroom upstairs, Ky saw an opportunity to play a prank on him. She removed the burgeraposs signature two beef patties, along with pickles, shredded lettuce, onion, sesame bun and the iconic Big Mac sauce. She then opted to go large on the meal and order extra Big Mac sauce. When the £. meal turned up at the door  minutes later, the prankster raced upstairs to hand her dad the box with just a slice of cheese inside. For more of the news you care about, straight to your inbox, sign up for one of our daily newsletters here. I found it funny. It was my own fault for not checking it over first, Gaz said. With all those options she obviously got a bit too giddy. Iaposm just surprised that no one rang to check thataposs what we wanted. Kelsie and her younger sister Portia, eight, had been staying at their dadaposs house at the weekend when they were askedthey wanted a takeaway for dinner. Gaz added: She came running upstairs shouting daddy, look at this.  I was so confused when she showed me the Big Mac box, so I checked over the order and realised what sheaposd done. I wasnapost too worried about the waste of money, I just found it amusing that sheaposd paid to go large too as well as extra sauce, after asking for no sauce. I did order her another, that I did myself this time! It was good of JustEat to refund us for it. When they ed home to their mum Heatheraposs house the next day, Kelsie retold her antics. Heather, a communications and marketing manager, added: When Gaz dropped the girls off home Sunday night, itaposs a common theme that I ask them what theyaposve eaten with him so I donapost repeat the same meals. I couldnapost help but laugh when asking Kelsie what sheaposd ordered from Mcdonaldaposs on the Saturday. God knows what the person at McDonaldaposs thought when they received the order.Heather uploaded photos of the meal onto Facebook, where it has racked up , likes so far.The post read: If you’re going to let your children add their own order on just eat, always check it before submitting it. My -year-old’s dad learnt this the hard way. Facebook users were quick to see the funny side, with one writing: I can’t believe they would actually only send a piece of cheese tho they must have a right laugh sometimes [sic] Another added: They must’ve had a right laugh putting that together. What’s with the no sauce then extra sauce, wrote a third bemused user. Another said that, despite the lack of ingredients, the post still made them hungry, commenting: This made me laugh, want a Big Mac now though. I’m vegetarian and love cheese so this is perfect for me but oh no! added someone . Others felt sorry for Gaz, commenting: Most expensive slice of cheese heaposll ever buy.

Robin and Gavin were accidentally given to the wrong mothers by a nurse at Nigel Hospital in Johannesburg where they were the only two babies born on that day in February .This meant Robin was raised by single mum Sandy Dawkins who was struggling to get by on the outskirts of Johannesburg while Gavin grew up with wealthier parent Megs Clinton Parker in Pietermaritzburg. The mistake was not uncovered until two years later when a disagreement over Gavinaposs rightful father led to a DNA test revealing that Megs was not his birth mother.  Hospital records further confirmed that Robin was Megsapos biological son who was growing up with Sandy as his mother. When faced with swapping their birth sons back, Megs and Sandy chose to keep the children they had raised since birth. Speaking nearer the time, one of the parents told  Minutes Australia: You canapost reject a child that youaposve been so close to for two years. Initially I think you protect the one youaposve got. The first few days are shock, then the curiosity comes. Whereaposs my baby   The boys grew up km apart in very dferent environments and referred to each other as brothers. But Robin has since admitted that he wishes his biological mother fought to switch him back. Speaking at age , he said he had dficulty accepting the situation and misses his mother Megs awfully a lot who he speaks to daily on the phone.  He told how le with Sandy was not easy and that he resented Gavin who does get things easy. If Iaposve ever wanted something, Iaposve had to work towards it. I’ve never just had it come towards me, he added. At the time, Gavin described being “happy” with the le he was accidentally given and that he did not feel sorry for Robin. He said: “Saying I thank my lucky stars every day would be wrong but at the same time I was given a le which I’ve now lived and I’m still living and I don’t regret anything.  The boysapos mothers embraced one another like sisters after discovering the mistake in  but chose not to swap the boys back. But Megs missed her biological son and encouraged him to move halfway across the country to her home with Gavin in , leaving Sandy without a child. Speaking at the time, Sandy said: “I just want to know she’s really happy with what she’s achieved. “I mean she’s ruined people’s lives, there’s just no other way to look at it… she’s ruined mine for starters.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON Single mumSouth AfricaParenting\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

The Daily Star says his unusual lestyle choices have made it it dficult to make friends or find a girlfriend.And one of his favourite past-times is smoking a pipe filled with animal manure which has left him more isolated. But he has impressed researchers who say he is perfectly healthy.Have your say on Amouaposs story in the comment section Villagers in Iran have been so impressed by his dedication to his unconventional lestyle, they built him a small shack as an alternative to his usual hole in the ground.Medics who visited the shack in the village of Dejgah, Iran carried out several tests and said that despite his lestyle, Jaji is surprisingly healthy and has no serious diseases or bacteria. Experts were interested in discovering dferent types of leforms, including parasites, might have taken up home on his body, but were able to confirm that he does not have any diseases or parasites despite his lack of hygiene. Professor Dr Gholamreza Molavi carried out the tests and suspects Jaji has remained healthy due to developing an enormously strong immune system.  Even with his preference for raw roadkill and a refusal to sterilise the water he drinks, Jaji has not suffered any diseases, leaving scientists surprised. The -year-old has also kept himself up to date with current events and discussed events like the Russian Revolution and French Revolution with those that visited him.  The newfound fame for the homeless pensioner has made le more dficult for him, he says, as although neighbours respect him, people occasionally show up to taunt him and throw stones. Medics tested him for everything from ious forms of hepatitis and AIDs through to parasites, and all they found was a symptomless infection of trichinosis.

speculating that the  committee may have already received the  letters of no confidence required to trigger the vote which could oust Boris Johnson.In a political move dubbed the “pork pie plot” by Johnson’s allies – named so because the meeting in which a group of Conservatives mutually agreed to submit letters was led by Alicia Kearns, a Tory MP who represents the town of Melton, home of Melton Mowbray pork pies. Kearns has denied leading any such plot.Tory MPs present at the meeting told Thethat they had discussed submitting letters of no confidence together, in a move that would push Johnson into an even more of a politically vulnerable position. If % of Tory MPs write to the chairman of the backbench committee – currently Graham Brady – a leadership challenge is triggered. As there are currently  ConservativeMPs sitting in Parliament,  Conservative MPs would need to submit letters to the  Committee to trigger an automatic leadership vote.: School letter about Boris Johnsons effortless superiority resurfacesThere is much inconsistency surrounding the reported number of MPs who have officially submitted a letter of no confidence. This morning, it’s been reported that  members of the  “Red Wall” elected Conservatives have handed in a letter. However, some Tory whips have reported that the number of total MPs to have submitted one is somewhere in the “twenties”.While inidual MPs are free to make it knownthey have submitted a letter, the  Committee keeps the actual number of MPs who have submitted one close to its chest.

That aside, it was a strong year for the driver.Argyll rally fans are looking forward to a full  season, Covid permitting, in conjunction with Dunfermline Car Club and the new main title sponsors Burnside Piling.CAPTIONS:Jamie Miller and Ian McCulloch in their Citroen CR MAX.

It#s estimated that  million plant pots and seed trays are sold every year and the majority are sent to landfill or are incinerated.But there are non-plastic alternatives such as biodegradable pots made using materials like coir, wood chips, bamboo and rice husks.A growing number of garden centres and nurseries use biodegradable pots, but it#s worth checking out their sustainability policies.You can also make your own pots using newspaper or toilet roll tubes.And now is a good time to make your own supplies of biodegradable pots so you have stock for the planting season in a couple of months.If you#ve got a supply of old newspapers to hand, simply roll a cm-wide strip of newspaper tightly around a glass tumbler, leaving cm beyond the bottom of the glass.Fold the excess paper across the bottom, then press the glass down to flatten the pot#s base.There is no need to fix your paper pot with tape, just slide it off the glass.When ready to plant, just fill with compost.Taking good care of existing plastic is a good way to ensure you don#t have to keep buying it – so reuse any plant pots you have again and again for new seedlings, cuttings and plants.If you look after your propagator trays and lids, repairing themthey crack, they will last for several seasons.You can also reuse compost bags to store compost or turn leaves into leaf mould.The added bonus of recycling or reusing items in the garden is that it also reduces cost – as does growing from seed rather than buying established plants.Even in winter, you can grow something from seed, you just need a seed tray and a window ledge, or small cold frame or greenhouse – whatever space and budgets allow.For anyone growing their own vegetables, January is great for sowing onions.If you sow onions then, it saves the expense of buying onion sets – small bulbs – later, and you can have a much larger crop of onions in the summer.Onions seeds do not have a long shelf-le, so it#s best to buy new seeds each year.Seeds will germinate between C and C, one or two weeks after sowing.When large enough to handle, transplant to inidual small pots and keep in a bright, frost-free place until April when they can be planted outside.Varieties to try include: Setton – high yield, yellow skinned and good storage potential Red Baron – a late maturing red onion with globe shaped bulbs and strong taste and Hybound – an early iety with bronze-brown skins which is excellent for long-term storage.January is often the coldest month in the garden but there are still some things you can be doing to keep busy.As the Royal Horticultural Society says, January might be the middle of winter but, as the days en, the garden starts to grow.It is a great time to plan for the coming gardening year and to order seeds and plants.Enjoy the fresh air on dry sunny days, and check your winter protection, stakes, ties and supports are still working after any severe weather.Also, put out food for birds and leave some garden areas uncut, a little longer, to provide shelter for wildle in your garden.Top three jobs this month: clean pots and greenhouses ready for spring, dig over empty or unused plots, and prune apple and pear trees."},{"url":null,"title":"from our files january 7 2022","story":"Machrihanish and Islay topped the highest gusts of wind recorded in the west of Scotland on Tuesday.Throughout the early

speed-related accidents.Argyll and Bute Council#s roads director Alistair Gow told councillors that use of both fixed and portable cameras to detect speeding had increased dramatically in the last few years.They had been pioneered by the former Strathclyde Regional Council which had paid for their purchase and installation with the police meeting the running costs.From the limited information available, an average drop of  per cent in injury accidents was being achieved where they were being used in the UK.#A substantial proportion of injury accidents within Argyll and Bute are speed related and in view of the above statistics, remote speed enforcement could substantially reduce the occurrence of accidents of this nature,# he said.#There are other types of equipment available which are not intended to operate as enforcement tools, but instead to convey a visual message to speeding motorists. This equipment has the advantage of raising driver awareness of the technology available, without the need to proceed with enforcement.#Councillors agreed that officials should investigate the ious forms of remote speed detection equipment, in consultation with Strathclyde Police and the Scottish Office, as trunk roads authority, and report back.FIFTY YEARS AGOThe New Year in Campbeltown was celebrated quietly at the weekend.Apart from a few breathalyser tests, police said the town was remarkably quiet.

We think that it’s been incredibly controversial and distractive at a time when we needed to focus on key public health messages that actually worked.” vw,vw,px, px\"Northern Ireland First Minister Paul Givan He added: “Where I can make progress even in terms of reducing its application in certain settings then I will support the reduction of its use but my preference is that the Covid mandatory passport scheme would be removed and its entirely but my expectation is that it will be removed in certain settings.”Deputy First Minister Michelle O’Neill expressed hope on Wednesday evening that the Executive could make “some positive strides forward on the Covid front, and particularly in relation to restrictions all the while guided of course by the health advice”.A minister in one of the three smaller parties in the Executive, the SDLP’s Nichola Mallon, expressed frustration that relaxation proposals had not been shared widely among the parties before Mr Givan spoke publicly on the issue.“As the SDLP Minister I have received no proposals from the Joint First Ministers on their plan for restrictions,” she tweeted.“If the DUP  Sinn Fein don’t want other parties in the Executive, they should be up front and say so.”Mr Givan and Ms O’Neill are in Londonderry on Thursday morning for a visit, and will remain in the city to virtually chair a meeting of the Executive.The outcome of the deliberations on Covid restrictions is to be announced at a press conference in Derry on Thursday afternoon.The Executive meeting will be informed by the latest Department of Health data which indicates Northern Ireland is likely at the peak of cases in the Omicron surge. vw,vw,px, px\"SDLP minister Nichola Mallon .A departmental paper, seen by the PA news agency, advises that case numbers fell substantially in the last week “primarily due” to reduced PCR tests due to a change in testing policy.But it notes the region is “likely to be at or around peak in terms of case numbers for the Omicron wave at present”.The paper indicates the true extent of the rise in case numbers is masked by the impact of the change in testing policy, with confirmatory PCR tests no longer required.The data suggests between one in  and one in  of the population tested positive for the virus in the week up to January , indicating around , cases per day, which corresponds to the central and pessimistic scenarios presented in mid-December.Hospital admissions and Covid bed occupancy increased in the last week, but started to slowly fall in the last few days.The paper notes Northern Ireland may experience a second peak in case numbers in the next two weeks as a result of further spread of the virus among school-age children.It notes the severity of Omicron appears to be “substantially reduced” from the Delta iant, and it is “likely that current measures will be sufficient to maintain peak hospital numbers at a signicantly lower level than last January”.👇🏼 Update on tomorrow’s Executive meeting where we will receive health advice on potential positive steps that we can take to relax COVID restrictions.I am also looking forward to visiting exciting projects in Derry that will create new jobs and opportunities for the North West pic QojjLOg— Michelle O’NeillJanuary , However the paper warns that very high levels of community transmission may result in signicant staff absences with the potential to reduce capacity in health trusts.On Wednesday evening, Mr Givan said that the self-isolation period for Covid- will reduce from seven days to five from January .Mr Givan and Ms O’Neill met with Health Minister Robin Swann, chief medical officer Sir Michael McBride and chief scientic adviser Professor Ian Young on Wednesday to discuss the latest state of the pandemic in the region.Earlier this week, there were calls from the business community for relaxations to restrictions.Belfast Chamber chief executive Simon Hamilton said predictions about how hard Omicron would hit had been “wide of the mark”, but added the effect of restrictions on businesses was “very real”.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Dr Jaffa is essentially a spokesman and an apologist for the salmon farming industry.#It#s no coincidence that wild salmon stocks have collapsed in all areas of the northern hemisphere where open net salmon farming has developed.#Peter Cunningham, biologist with the Wester Ross Fisheries Trust, said: #It is the salmon farming industry#s inability to manage parasitic sea lice that is the major threat to wild salmon. It is a natural parasite but they multiply and become much higher in number on open cage salmon farms.#Sampling by the WRFT in the spring of  supports contention that cumulative levels of infective sea lice were again much too high between Skye and the mainland of Scotland to protect migrating post-smolt salmon within these waters in the next spring.#Salmon populations in rivers Applecross, Ling, Sheil, Glenmore, Glen Beag, Arnisdale, Broadford, Sligachan and many others around Skye are particularly vulnerable.#  "},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/258343311_483851062940065_6761478433370174788_n.jpg","title":"skyes mavis sails first tall ship at","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine, as part of the Greenock to Leith voyage last year.

So much of what we learn in terms of socialisation and relationships does not happen in a classroom but across all the other day to day activities and interactions that take place.“It is a huge issue. Our young people have lost a lot in terms of their formal education but for me, they have also lost a massive amount in terms of the other areas of development that their education brings.”Portree High School pupil Luke Eveling, who has published a book about facing mental health challenges as a teenager on Skye, believes the pandemic had taken a toll on his age-group.He said: #Lockdown and the pandemic more widely definitely had an effect on young people in school. A lot of my friends are finding it hard to cope with exams and more broadly the pandemic simultaneously. This has influenced how well they are doing at school.#I have a few friends who have turned to serious drug abuse as a way of coping with the combined pressure, and others have stopped going to school completely.”In April , Luke bravely shared his own challenges through his book ‘A Series of Essays About Mental Health’.Within the book, Luke, who lives in Broadford, wrote frankly about a wide range of issues including heartbreak, peer pressure, drug abuse, and suicide. at the time, Luke talked about being diagnosed with Asperger’s and coping with isolation during the pandemic.While last year Luke spoke warmly about the “overwhelming support” he had received from family, friends and the wider community after opening up about his own circumstances, he believed more support services should be made available to help other young people.He added: #There are some, but there just isn’t enough for everyone. Things like having a school counsellor sound good but just don’t seem to reach everyone who needs help.#Councillor Finlayson added: “We know the importance of mental health # people are nervous about the pandemic and have not been able to socialise as before. We already have and will continue to have a situation where some young people will really struggle to get back to being with their peers and to sustaining positive relationships.“Parents are rightly concerned. Their children are in a totally unique situation given the global scope of the pandemic and the impact it has had and will continue to have on how education is delivered.“Supporting all aspects of education in its widest form needs to be a priority for all levels of government from the UK Government to Scottish Government to local government.“We all need to realise that the young people who have been in schools for the last two years have been disadvantaged in many dferent ways.“We need to take account of this going forward in terms of additional resources and possibly a catch-up curriculum and perhaps even more importantly, support for all aspects of young people’s health and wellbeing including mental health.”Assessing the lay of the land in schools across the region, Councillor Finlayson said: “Within Highland we will be continuing to follow the rules and mitigation measures that were in place previously and have come from the Scottish Government # all these things masks in classrooms, social distancing, ventilation in classrooms, limiting contact with other year groups and classes as much as possible will continue. What the rest of the country will be expected to do.“Better ventilation is being encouraged in schools # but we must consider the time of year and the fact that some of the schools within the Highland Council are pretty antiquated and not in the greatest condition.“I am keen that schools should make decisions that suit their own circumstances # because each school is dferent.#"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/annie-johnston-with-John-Lorne-Campbell.jpg","title":"tobar and dualchais a visit to canna south uist and barra in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineI have drawn on an intermittent diary kept at the time, to help with my present memories of the occasions., was by any standard a memorable experience.Campbell, a leading Gaelic scholar already well known internationally, had from the s carried out ground-breaking fieldwork recording Gaelic oral tradition in the Hebrides and in Gaelic Nova Scotia.

Police were called to Abbey Christian Brothers School in Newry after a group of Down players were spotted training there. As they were deemed an ‘elite’ team, the PSNI said no restrictions had been breached.The session did, however, break the GAA’s rules, and manager Paddy Tally received an eight-week ban.Nathan CarterThe country music star apologised in June last year after the PSNI issued  fines over a party at his home in Co Fermanagh. The police said at least  people were at his birthday bash. At the time, the rules allowed a maximum of six people from two households to meet inside a private residence.Mr Carter said he believed the gathering was within the rules but conceded: “Given the restrictions, I realise how irresponsible these actions were and I fully apologise.”Cara HunterExpand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseCara Hunter FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueCara HunterAt a time when she was the SDLP’s health spokesperson, the MLA broke the Executive’s Covid guidance in May of last year with a weekend getaway to Donegal.Ms Hunter posted pictures of herself on social media in what appeared to be a mobile home, along with the message: “Grateful for the weekend off — two happy campers.”Cross-border travel was only allowed for essential purposes at this stage of the pandemic. The East Londonderry MLA later apologised for the incident. “The travel was not in line with the guidance. I want to sincerely apologise for making a mistake,” she said.Antonio Horta-OsarioCredit Suisse chief Antonio Horta-Osario resigned earlier this week over Covid breaches.Following an internal investigation by the banking giant, Mr Horta-Osario — who had only been at the bank for nine months — had been found to have broken the rules on more than one occasion last year, including to attend Wimbledon, when he should have been in quarantine.“I regret that a number of my personal actions have led to dficulties for the bank and compromised my ability to represent the bank internally and externally,” he said.Rita OraExpand\" \" class\"c-lightbox-top-close icon-close\" data-closeCloseRita Ora.

However, no progress has been made.A petition calling on the council to take action and restore Wilmont House to its former glory has been signed by more than  people so far.It was launched by local woman Sharon Marks, who said she had noticed the poor state of the building while taking walks in Sir Thomas and Lady Dixon Park during lockdown.“About a year ago, I contacted the council to see what the plans for the building were as it was gted to the council and the people of Belfast,” she added.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up “For such a beautul building to fall into such a state of disrepair is just so sad. “The council said it was planning on carrying out an expression-of-interest exercise in early  to find someone to bring it back into use, but the pandemic has delayed this. “That really hacked me off, so I got in contact with local politicians to bring things forward, but that didn’t get very far.“One or two people in the council shouldn’t be gatekeepers of Wilmont House. “It was gted to the council and all the people of Belfast. People should be able to enjoy it.“It is such a beautul building and for that amount of heritage and history to be lost would be terrible.”Donal Lyons, a member of Belfast City Council’s growth and regeneration committee, agreed action should be taken.“There’s not many buildings like Wilmont House left in Belfast, let alone ones in such a setting, and we need to ensure that they are protected for future generations,” he said. “We’re lucky to have them. Each one of them captures a moment in the city’s history and everyone has their own personal stories in which these beautul buildings play a role. “We need to do more than just let them sit in decay.”A spokesperson for the council said: “Wilmont House at Sir Thomas and Lady Dixon Park is a Grade B-plus listed building owned by Belfast City Council. “We are in the process of preparing an invitation for expressions of interest to go to the market later this year, seeking a suitably qualied developer to restore the building and bring it into a new use.”Wilmont House, which dates back to , served as the headquarters of the US Army in Northern Ireland during the Second World War. It was later used as a nursing home and a parks office for the council. At one stage, it was also the headquarters of the Belfast Marathon. The petition calling on the council to restore Wilmont House can be found at change.orgRelated topicsBelfast City CouncilMore On Belfast City CouncilBelfast City Council voices opposition to closure of Regina Coeli Women#s HostelRegister for animal cruelty offenders is a step closer, says Poots PremiumJust one Orange lodge awarded grant from £m heritage fund PremiumViewpointOpinionIt’s worth travelling along green routeBelfast councillors to discuss motion on free public transport for young peopleMost ReadAntrim council gave taskforce boss Rose Mary Stalker over £k for  days’ workDUP investigates councillor Adrian McQuillan’s actions for second timeHundreds back call to restore Belfast’s Wilmont House to former gloryWhat should you doyou’re still testing positive for Covid after  days DUP councillor Audrey Wales’ spend on clothes during year as mayor causes further controversyTop VideosPlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy PlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentPlayWatch: ‘In the name of God, go’, David Davis tells Boris Johnson in fiery Commons PMQs sessionLatest Northern IrelandMinisters to consider reducing use of Covid certication in Northern IrelandNI Covid rules for hospitality and vaccine passports will ‘hopefully’ be relaxed, says Paul Givan as Stormont Executive meets todayBoris Johnson clings on as Sue Gray’s party report due next week… under-fire PM vows to fight any vote of no confidence after senior Tory tells him ‘in the name of God, go’Liz TrussOpinionThe NI Protocol must be changed to help protect the hard-won peace hereBelfast film: Well-known names who attended premiere share their thoughts ahead of cinema releaseLatestMinisters to consider reducing use of Covid certication in Northern IrelandInflation pushes up clothes prices at SuperdryNI Covid rules for hospitality and vaccine passports will ‘hopefully’ be relaxed, says Paul Givan as Stormont Executive meets todayTwo men arrested in England over Texas synagogue stand-offPrimark set to axe around  jobs in UK store management overhaul,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

As others start to get back to some semblance of normality, so should we”.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Retail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts also called for a “clear and managed plan to safely remove the Covid- restrictions”, as well as an immediate move to five days isolation.“This will be a signicant challenge and will require extensive planning but will be important to boost footfall for our high streets, reopening our economy andour society to near as normal,” he said.Meanwhile, Hospitality Ulster has called for “the punitive restrictions which are having a cataclysmic impact” on the sector to be lted.In particular, it has called for the reopening of nightclubs as it said the worst impacts of Omicron are not as severe as modelling suggested.A survey of members has found one in two have seen sales fall by more than % in the week beginning January , , compared to the same week in . Hospitality Ulster chief executive Colin Neill said: “The latest survey results paint a dire picture of where our industry currently is after almost two years of restrictions and closures.“It is no exaggeration to say the hospitality sector has never been in a worse position with over % of trade down from  in food, drink and accommodation sales.“The financial burden of the restrictions are becoming apparent as a growing concern with members responding that the cost of unused stock due to poor footfall and restriction, looming tax bills and the cost of extra staff to monitor Covid- passports and provide table service is having serious strain on business viability.“In fact, some businesses have made the dficult decision to close until restrictions can be lted, having a detrimental impact on trade and staff.” SDLP leader Colum Eastwood also called for a “clear and managed roadmap” out of restrictions.“The success of the vaccination programme and the effort made by people to keep each other safe has put us in a good position to begin planning for the recovery phase of the pandemic. It cannot be dominated by the chaos of the early response,” he said.

FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp,\"onDemand\":true,\"lazyload\":trueIan Marshall with UUP leader Doug Beattie.Ralph HewittTwitterEmailJanuary   : AMFacebookTwitterEmailA Co Tyrone UUP official has resigned from the party after its decision to nominate a former Irish senator as the West Tyrone candidate in May’s Assembly election.Former Derry and Strabane councillor Andy McKane claimed the party had abandoned its principles in selecting Ian Marshall.Co Armagh farmer Mr Marshall, joined the UUP last year and in , he became the first independent unionist to be elected to sit in the Seanad .Read MoreFormer Irish senator Ian Marshall joins UUPTyrone UUP association slam ‘dictatorial approach’ after party selection of Ian MarshallThe UUP said it was “delighted” to welcome the former Ulster Farmers’ Union president when he joined the party.It was reported in November that the UUP in West Tyrone had “unanimously” rejected the party leadership’s choice of Mr Marshall as the Assembly election candidate.Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up The local association criticised UUP leader Doug Beattie after the party leadership overruled its choice to nominate Mr McKane, who is from Castlederg.Mr McKane said both he and his we Karen had resigned from the UUP because their membership was made “untenable” following the party’s decision to nominate Mr Marshall.He also criticised Mr Marshall’s stance on the Northern Ireland Protocol.However, the Markethill farmer, who backed the remain camp during Brexit, said he wished to see the end of the protocol but felt an agreement must be in place.Read MoreFormer Irish senator Ian Marshall joins ‘inclusive and erse’ UUPCommenting on his decision to resign from the UUP, Mr McKane told the Belfast : “My decision to leave the UUP is simple. The people of West Tyrone chose me as their candidate.I stood in the Westminster election and increased the vote so as to why I was denied the opportunity to stand in this election neither I nor the people of West Tyrone can understand. This makes my membership untenable.”Speaking to the Tyrone Constitution, he said he could never “align myself” to someone who sat in the Irish government.“No unionist could be so foolish as to think there was anything to be gained for unionism by sitting in an Irish government or selling a protocol that creates an Irish Sea border,” he stated. “To me, that person is not a unionist.“That said, the electorate will decide who represents West Tyrone and the election in May will tell the tale.”In response, Mr Marshall said he had the full backing of unionist leaders to serve in the Seanad as it gave unionism a voice.“Andy has this attitude that this waters down my unionist credentials,” stated Mr Marshall.“That’s a bit like saying, Your Majesty the Queen shook Martin McGuinness’ hand - does that mean she’s less of a unionist or less British as a consequence  No one would ever imply that.“I don’t think there’s any substance to this criticism that I’m any less of a unionist. In fact, I’d argue the opposite is true - I’m very secure and confident in my unionist credentials.”A spokesperson for the UUP said the party has selection processes and “every aspiring candidate has to abide by the same processes”.“Andy entered the selection process and was interviewed as part of it,” continued the party. “Ian was also interviewed and he emerged as the successful candidate.“Ian Marshall is a positive, confident unionist who is committed to strengthening Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom.“We are sorry to see Andy leave the party and we wish him well for the future.”Related topicsUlster Unionist PartyMore On Ulster Unionist Party PremiumMen dominate at top of police, politics and the health service PremiumDonaldson has to stop threats to bring down Assembly: Long PremiumDouble jobbing plans a ‘thoroughly bad idea’, warns chair of Northern Ireland Affairs CommitteeVideo: NI public mostly opposed or ‘sitting on fence’ regarding ‘double-jobbing’ proposalsBig names could help DUP fend off strong opposition in key constituenciesMost ReadAntrim council gave taskforce boss Rose Mary Stalker over £k for  days’ workDUP investigates councillor Adrian McQuillan’s actions for second timeHundreds back call to restore Belfast’s Wilmont House to former gloryWhat should you doyou’re still testing positive for Covid after  days Andy McKane leaves UUP after decision to select ex-Irish senator Ian Marshall for Stormont electionTop VideosPlayJozef Puska charged with the murder of Ashling Murphy PlayVideo: Heartbroken mother releases footage of moment her son died in a fireball motorcycle crash - Warning Graphic ContentPlayWatch: ‘In the name of God, go’, David Davis tells Boris Johnson in fiery Commons PMQs sessionLatest PoliticsNI Covid rules for hospitality and vaccine passports will ‘hopefully’ be relaxed, says Paul Givan as Stormont Executive meets todayBoris Johnson clings on as Sue Gray’s party report due next week… under-fire PM vows to fight any vote of no confidence after senior Tory tells him ‘in the name of God, go’Liz TrussOpinionThe NI Protocol must be changed to help protect the hard-won peace hereMen dominate at top of police, politics and the health servicePhrase has been on the go since LatestNew Zealand PM warns Omicron outbreak is inevitableMinisters to consider reducing use of Covid certication in Northern IrelandInflation pushes up clothes prices at SuperdryNI Covid rules for hospitality and vaccine passports will ‘hopefully’ be relaxed, says Paul Givan as Stormont Executive meets todayTwo men arrested in England over Texas synagogue stand-off,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Newcastle did not make things easy for the visitors and constantly remained a threat in attack with the experienced Neil Corr causing problems all afternoon.Celticrsquos Conaill Kerr had his headed goal chalked off after he was adjudged to have fouled custodian Canavan by referee Peter Kelly.Kerr was determined not to be deterred by this and went on a surging run in the next passage of play, dancing around the Newcastle defence to unleash a shot that just whisked wide of the post.This seemed to wake up the Seasiders, who forced Celtic to retreat into their own half largely in thanks to the midfield display of Peter Brannigan.Newcastle nearly had their momentum derailed when lsquokeeper Canavan misplaced a pass to the feet of Gibney, although the Celtic strikerrsquos snapshot landed safely back into the arms of the grateful number one.As the hosts went back on the attack, Richard McInerney combined well with Shane Kearney before the Newcastle number rsquos inviting cross into the box was punched to safety by Celtic lsquokeeper Nathan Curran.The following ten minutes of play consisted of both teams battling for possession in the middle of the park, where man of the match Corey McCartan was notably winning the lionrsquos share for his Celtic side.The Hoops almost doubled their lead when Jordan McCoubrey fired a cross into the Newcastle box where team-mate Gibney managed to poke his head in front of Canavan to round the lsquokeeper.However, with the angle at goal not in his favour, the Celtic number nine saw his effort sail across the line and eventually out for a throw-in. This signalled the last notable passage of play before the half-time interval.Celtic began the restart positively with the ball quickly making its way back to lsquokeeper Curran, who sent a cross field pass to the feet of Stephen Galbraith.The Hoopsrsquo midfielder played a cute first time pass to Gibney, who sumptuously back-heeled to team-mate McCoubrey for a shot on goal that resulted in a corner.Newcastle decided to fight fire with fire and went on the attack. In what was possibly another sign that it wasnrsquot to be their day, the hosts had appeals for a penalty waved off after Brannigan was met with a tackle that sent him to the floor inside the box.The Seasiders enjoyed a purple patch where they hit the visitors with wave after wave of attacks, although they couldnrsquot find the vital touch to put the ball in the net.Celtic lsquokeeper Curran was forced to clear his lines on multiple occasions, and to his credit, The Hoopsrsquo number one remained sharp and focused throughout the  minutes.Peter OrsquoHare and skipper Louis Brunsdon were pulling the strings for Newcastle, but their final ball was just off the mark in what was becoming an increasingly frustrating afternoon for the home side.As the playing conditions began to become increasingly worse, there was a bright light in Celtic youngster Eoin Kelly, who made an impactful appearance off the bench and slowly began to swing the momentum in favour of his side ndash largely also in thanks to team-mate McCartan overturning possession in midfield.Another Celtic substitute, Sean McMahon, forced Newcastle lsquokeeper Canavan to produce the save of the match after his left footed effort was erted outside the post by a spectacular acrobatic e.The resultant corner was met with a similarly impressive save from Canavan, who stopped a point blank flick on header from Kelly.Newcastlersquos purple patch had well and truly ended and this was signied further when Celtic doubled their lead through skipper Michael Rice.After a long ball into the box looped over the Seasidersrsquo defence, the ball rolled invitingly out for Rice to toe poke beyond the impressive Canavan with  minutes left on the clock.The home outfit were not one to give up and went in search of the goal that would set up a nervous last few moments for their opponents.Corr almost awarded his side this opportunity when the ball landed at the veteranrsquos feet with only Curran to beat.However, the stubborn Celtic custodian refused to be bettered and spread his six foot frame as wide as he could to narrow the target and deny the certain goal.Moments later, Celticrsquos Peter Casey was clattered in the middle of the park but referee Kelly waved on the advantage which turned out to be an important call.Megahey gathered the loose ball on the right hand side of the pitch, before squaring a pass to Gibney, who struck a curling effort into the top right corner of the net to round off the scoring.Resilient to the end, Newcastle launched one last attack in search of a consolation goal.Despite the ball hitting the Celtic post in the midst of a goalmouth scramble, Newcastle captain Brunsdon couldnrsquot supply the required rebound and the referee blew his whistle for the final time.After the contest, man of the match Corey McCartan gave his thoughts on his sidersquos performance and winning start to the year.ldquoAll of the boys worked hard, especially coming back from a few weeks off after Christmas, he said.ldquoIt was a hard game and everyone was still stf, so I think it was physically tough for both teams and the weather definitely didnrsquot help.ldquoNewcastle surprised me because of how sharp they were and how high of a level their fitness was, but we got the job done and are now focused on the next game.Newcastle: F Canavan, C Scott, S Kelly, D Allister, J Maginn, P Brannigan, P OrsquoHare, L Brunsdon , R McInerney, N Corr, S Kearney.Subs: D Rooney, C McMahon, C Morrison.Celtic Bhoys: N Curran, S Megahey, R Quinn, B Connolly, M Rice , C McCartan, S Galbraith, P Casey, J Gibney, J McCoubrey, C Kerr.Subs: R Fitzpatrick, E Kelly, S McMahon.Referee: Peter Kelly..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/19January2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Eight appliances tackle accidental early morning blaze at Newcastle pub  ","story":"A FIRE at a popular bar in Newcastle last week was accidental, the Fire and Rescue Service believes.Firefighters extinguished the blaze at the Anchor Bar on the Bryansford Road during the early hours of Friday morning.It is understood that the blaze broke out just after am, with the Fire and Rescue Service deploying eight appliances to the incident.Crews from Newcastle, Knock, Downpatrick and Rathfriland responded to the emergency callwith footage posted on social media showing crews working at the scene of the incident overnight, with the Bryansford Road remaining closed as firefighters tackled the blaze.A Fire and Rescue Service spokesperson confirmed that firefighters were called to the fire in a non-residential property which had also spread to an adjacent building.ldquoFirefighters wearing breathing apparatus used four jets and an aerial appliance to extinguish the fire.

All statutory consultees bar one have now given the proposal their approval, with discussions with the final consultee in progress.Association officials say the planning application covers only the paths, pond, fencing and information  associated with the field close to the community centre.ldquoMany hours have been put in completing the application to the Heritage Fund which was submitted at the end of November with a decision due in March, Saintfield News confirms, explaining thatthe bid is successful, it will be for the development phase of the project.ldquoThis will probably take one year and will include detailed measurements of the scheduled monument buildings, work plans, costings for stabilising these and obtaining scheduled monument consent and planning approval for these works.ldquoAt the end of this development phase a further application to the Heritage Fund would be made for the delivery phase of the project. ldquoThe association says thatthis was successful and all went well, the park and windmill would be opened to the public in the spring of .However,the Heritage Fund application is unsuccessful, the association will proceed with the proposal, but the work would exclude the scheduled monument area.ldquoThis would be fenced off as unsafe and left as is, reports Saintfield News. ldquoCompetition for Heritage Fund grants is very competitive and many other projects in Northern Ireland will be applying. It will be a great achievementwe are successful.ldquoThis is probably the only source of funding that can preserve the windmill and the other two buildings of the scheduled monument for future generations. Without this funding, the buildings will continue their slow decline and will eventually collapse.Meanwhile, the man who is supporting the community park proposal visited Saintfield recently.Mr Moffett has already made a substantial donation to the association to enable it to purchase the Windmill Field.During his visit, Mr Moffett had an opportunity to walk around the field and visualise how the proposed community park would surround the ancient windmill and caretakerrsquos home that is part of Saintfieldrsquos history. He also met a number of residents at the community centre before visiting Rowallane Garden for a guided tour.Mr Moffett concluded the first day of his visit with a visit to the Belfast Road community centre to view the new facility and was impressed at the potential of fitting out the remaining empty buildings which would include a heritage area to complement the planned windmill park.Mr Moffett, who also played a round of golf at Royal County Down and visited the Mournes, said the beauty of Co Down, with its unique visitor sites and the central location of Saintfield, reinforced in his mind the importance of the windmill park project and the heritage centre.The third and final day of his visit was spent at a local shop exploring the location of his familyrsquos th century farm in Leggygowan.Mr Moffett said: ldquoExploring my family history was a wonderful way to end my visit to Saintfield.

An MP elected to Stormont, or vice versa, has to relinquish one of the two seats.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.The government planned to amend this rule so that an MP elected to Stormont could hold on to their Westminster seat until the next general election. This was seen as an attempt to help Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who has been stymied in his bid to lead the DUP from Stormont. Under present rules,he becomes an MLA he will have to surrender his Lagan Valley seat, triggering a by election. The DUP is favourite to win such a contest but the unionist vote might split three ways and Alliance is strong in the constituency. Under the plans, a by election would not be needed. But the proposal caused uproar. The Labour Party, which in fact mooted the change months ago, saw how the wind was blowing and turned against it.All the main rival parties to the DUP had jointly opposed it.And then, yesterday, Boris Johnson revealed he did too, and had decided to bin the proposal, leaving Sir Jeffrey humiliated . The public is said to oppose double jobbing but there was little sign it did. Supporters of all parties routinely voted for politicians with dual mandates. Once a ban was introduced in NI, it should have been akin to that in Scotland, where election victors can hold on to both seats until the next election. But a belated moved to bring NI into line with that rule looked like an inappropriate bid to help the DUP. But the proposal,implemented, would be much less bad than the special dispensation given to Sinn Fein to get expenses while not taking their MP seats. There is no cross-party opposition to that deal. The prime minister’s sudden u-turn, when he is under huge political pressure, will remind the DUP of his unreliable nature.——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

And evenit was, the public could have misread such remarks as meaning they were in great danger, when it became apparent late last month that omicron was having a minor health impact. However, it is welcome to hear Dr Black now speak in a reassuring way, and admit that “our worst expectations haven’t been reached”. The covid crisis is not yet over – there have been too many twists and turns so far to be sure of any scenarios in the near future – but it is at a sufficiently mild level where we cannot tolerate the ruin of certain livelihoods and groups of people.Most society leaders — medical, scientic and political —who have demanded rigid controls are themselves financially untouched by lockdown because they are paid by the state.If lockdown does , the financial burden should be more evenly spread so that there is extra money for sectors such as hospitality. Politicians could show leadership by accepting voluntary pay cuts. But let us hope that it does not .We cannot keep planning for worst case scenarios of virus mutations.

All Rights Reserved. WARNING: This picture must only be used to accompany PA Feature SHOWBIZ Film Reviews.“The Strand has a lot of similarities to the Troxy, the same architect. It feels quite nostalgic watching it in a picture house whenever you’re looking at another cinema from the same era.”Although the film’s UK release date is given as Friday , special screenings will take place in Belfast tomorrow evening before opening across Northern Ireland on Friday. Mimi said the film had generated a lot of interest prior to its release: “We’ve seen a lot more interest than we normally would.“People are really interested and intrigued, I think people hold Kenneth Branagh in such a sense of pride. He has given back an enormous amount to our creative industry in Northern Ireland, championing what he considers his home town.Strand Arts Centre CEO Mimi Turtle looks ahead to the UK cinema release of Sir Kenneth Branaghs Belfast film“The audience are interested, particularly those middle-aged and senior, who will remember the era.”Jude Hill plays nine-year-old Buddy, a role based on Branagh himself, in the film which also stars Jamie Dornan, Ciaran Hinds, Caitriona Balfe and Judi Dench as members of Buddy’s family.It is set at the beginning of the Troubles, but violence, although occasional, is not to the fore in the film.Mimi said: “I think the Troubles is more of a backdrop. It’s incidental to the characters.“There’s definitely a sense that it’s written for a global audience more than a Northern Ireland audience.“It’s got that nostalgia, that wholesomeness which the American love about all things Northern Irish or Irish.”She added: “This is just one person’s story, one person’s memory and obviously stories and narratives change with memory.“It’s that kind of sepia, rose-tinted view that comes whenever you have memories.“Because it is set here I know Kenneth Branagh and Jamie Dornan have said in interviews that they are more nervous that people here will enjoy it and accept it.”Of the staggered release which has seen the film open in America and other parts of the world before the UK, Mimi said: “It is unusual because of pirating for a film not to have one international release date.“People here will already have seen the film, but not on the big screen as it was meant to be showcased.”——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

So it is an important element of our city le.”He added: “I know we have had some dficulties in the past with the Saint Patrick’s Day celebrations, but there is evidence that more groups are looking to become involved in this event. I know that further development work is necessary, and in fact is being planned and funded, and I welcome that.”   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

It was a part of the annual events: the Rugby Schools Cup final was on Saint Patrick’s Day, some of the Irish regiments recognised it, indeed the Orange Order at one time recognised Saint Patrick’s Day.“So it is something I think we need to recover, and we need to encourage full participation in the Saint Patrick’s Day celebration. These developments in the council’s Cultural Strategy do provide for more outreach work, and for more development work. They provide for more longer term planning, and they will reap rich rewards, and create a truly inclusive celebration from which the city can benefit.”The council’s ten-year cultural strategy, “A City Imagining” outlines a new approach in delivering St. Patrick’s Day events from  onwards with a three-stage process being used to assess applications to deliver pilot projects this year.A council report recommends the commissioning of Beat Carnival and The Duncairn, to deliver pilot projects in March  with funding of £, and £, respectively.

Billy Hutchinson is the only remaining PUP representative in Belfast council.John Kyle has been a Belfast councillor since  when he was co-opted following the death of former party leader David Ervine.

They say that the beach is a sand and shingle beach and has a reputation for being one of the cleanest in the region. There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Once a pathway on the north eastern side of the wood led up to a summerhouse belonging to Cwrt yr Ala from where they would have enjoyed lovely views over their vast estate land.Exiting through a gateway there was a chance to examine a piece of rock containing crinoids which are marine animals and ancient fossils that predate dinosaurs by  million years and they are classed as plants not animals.A descent on a slippery and rocky track led them to a viewpoint complete with a wooden seat overlooking Cwrt yr Ala House away in the valley. Robert Rous owned Cwrt yr Ala in  and made many improvements to it and it remained within the family until the death of Georgina Anne Rous in . It then passed to Frances William George Gore, a nephew of the last male heir who preferred to remain in London, so he rented out the house to the renowned Cardf brewer W. H. Brain.Prior to  Mr Gore had tried to sell Cwrt yr Ala and the estate lands to Dr Iorwerth Cyfeiliog Peatewho was looking for a suitable place for the newly proposed Welsh Folk Museum to be sited. In fact Peate was later offered land at St Fagans by the Earl of Plymouth for free as the site and became its first curator from  to . During World War Two he was temporarily dismissed for being a pacist and a conscientious objector, but soon reinstated..removeRecent heavy rainfall had made the normal descent via the bridleway a bit like a slalom so instead they followed tracks through the lower part of the wood to join a farm track at the top end of the steep-sided and wooded Cwm George.A rough farm track brought them to the stone bridge over the fast flowing Cadoxton River and out onto Cwrt-yr-Ala Road for the short journey into Michaelston-le-Pit where they made their way to St Michael and All Angels, to view the ‘sporting side’ of the churchyard where the Brain and Merrett families are buried before partaking of refreshments.William Henry Brainwas an English first-class cricketer and footballer who was noted for being the only man to perform the ‘wicket keeper’s hat trick’ of three dismissals off consecutive deliveries and also John Patrick Brain, a Welsh cricketer and wicketkeeper. Sir Herbert Henry Merrett who owned Cwrt yr Ala was a footballer and referee and chaired both Cardf City Football Club and was president of the Glamorgan County Cricket Club despite being a busy industrialist and Chairman of Powell Dyffryn Ltd. Another gravestone celebrated the Reverend Henry Holmes Stewart, a Scottish clergyman who was a member of the Wanderers team that won the FA Cup in  which was the same year he was ordained as a priest.Then making their way through riverside meadows and across a wooden footbridge, the surrounding trees were bearing pretty yellow catkins as they climbed uphill, then down to re-cross the river into the muddy Millfields and make their way back across the golf course to their start.You can follow the group’s exploits at www.penarthramblers.wordpress or Facebook article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityLast week, first minister Mark Drakeford announced the rolling back of Covid restrictions in Wales.Here are the answers to some of the key questions about Wales’ route out of lockdown:What are the rule changes How does this affect the Six Nations In theory, the Six Nations should now be close to being back to normal.There will be no limits on crowds in Wales as of the first game in Cardf – against Scotland on February  – and no limits on the number of people meeting in pubs and hospitality settings.However, Covid passes will continue to be needed for large-scale events.When asked on Friday whether the rules were being changed because of the Six Nations, Mr Drakeford, said his cabinet \"responds to other pressures\" and base decisions on the data, and that the Welsh Government took the decision to impose restrictions to protect public health and the NHS.Why are restrictions being eased The first minister said that there were \"early positive signs\" that the Covid situation in Wales is improving.He says that the data will be reviewed regularly but is outlining how restrictions will be ed to alert level zero..removeMr Drakeford pointed to data showing that infections appear to have passed their peak in Wales.He says that protective measures in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have meant there have been lower infection levels than in England.Mr Drakeford said: \"Were able to do itonly because of the amazing hard work and effort of everyone  who have once again followed all of the rules and taken all of the steps to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe.\"The enormous efforts of all those working in the vaccination centres, in our NHS, in our public services, in shops and in businesses who have done so much to protect us fom this latest wave of that awful virus.\"Thank you - thank you to everyone who has done so much to help to keep us safe.\"It doesnt mean the pandemic is over.\"What does this mean for schools The new announcements means no change for schoolsIn the Welsh Governments Coronavirus Control Plan for Wales: autumn and winter  update, it was announced that, despite the challenges the winter period, the Welsh Government expected schools, alongside childcare and play settings, colleges and universities, to remain open. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentsComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityIn a report, entitled A UBI Pilot for Wales, the Petitions Committee concluded the current scheme for care leavers “has merit”, but that a wider trial would allow policymakers to learn more about the impact of a UBI.Universal Basic Income is the idea a government should pay all iniduals a set salary, regardless of their means.Last year, the country’s Labour government said it wanted to pilot such a scheme targeting  care leavers by giving them an additional sum of money each month.Proponents of the plans included those who believe UBI should apply to all citizens, and a petition submitted in August  calling for an expansion of the pilot gained over a thousands signatures.The committee, led by chair Jack Sargeant MS, invited a number of experts including Sophie Howe, the Future Generations Commissioner for Wales, Will Stronge, director of research at think tank Autonomy, Lydia Godden, Women’s Equality NetworkWales, and Ewan Hilton, CEO of mental health charity Platfform to give evidence on the topic.They concluded the government should consider increasing the size and ersity of the pilot scheme to provide more robust data, and ensure payments are guaranteed, unconditional, and paid to the inidual, not the household.It has also recommended the government make every effort to persuade UK Government departments such as the Department of Work and Pensions and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs to support the widest possible pilot scheme.While they said the pilot should be conducted by independent experts, include a control group and attempt to capture any indirect savings or costs that accrue as a result of the pilot.Mr Sergeant said: “It’s clear from the evidence presented to us that broadening the pilot could have huge benefits.“The Welsh Government should investigate increasing the number of proposed recipients and include care leavers from as erse as possible a range of backgrounds, locations, and circumstances to give us the evidence we need to properly evaluate this scheme..remove“While not all Members of the Committee support UBI, we all believe that a wider pilot scheme has the potential to produce richer, more persuasive evidence for the Welsh Government to consider.“I would like to extend my thanks to the petitioners whose passion for tackling poverty shone through and should be commended, as well as all those who signed the petition.” article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

She joined Portadown Cadet Division at the age of  and gained her Grand Prior Award, the highest award for a cadet. When she was older she became an Officer in St John. Her dad, two sisters and her brother were all involved in St John Ambulance for many years and devoted their time and commitment to the local community.Other clubs she was involved with during her childhood were St Mark’s Scouts and the Baptist Youth Club.Suzanne adored family holidays, particularly trips to Blackpool in her childhood. Her father said: “During the evenings in the hotel Suzanne was always entertaining the guests with her talent of dancing. The guests and staff loved to see her entertaining. We then spent a number of our family holidays in Florida, all together. She loved Florida and in  she got married there.”She worked as a le guard at Cascades for  years but was medically retired due to her ill health. Her husband Joab said: “Suzanne’s job was her le and she was very proud of everything she achieved. Whilst working at Tannaghmore Gardens Farm she loved having responsibility and was trusted to lock up the farm in the evenings, She also enjoyed driving the farm vehicles to collect food and also enjoyed giving school tours around the farm.”Suzanne’s illness first started when she was six. She was diagnosed with encephalitis - at the time they thought it might be a brain tumour. She was on medication for a while but otherwise was pretty healthy. Later in le she was diagnosed with epilepsy but that didn’t stop her having a fun active le.She became ill again in  - only this time it stopped her from working at the place she loved, Cascades.Over the next number of years her health was to deteriorate. She had frequent hospital admissions and appointments. She would go into hospital for periods of sometimes days and weeks but would always come home again. Throughout her long illness Suzanne never let it get her down. She was always smiling.Her father said: “She went into hospital on Saturday December  on what we all thought was one of her routine admissions but sadly we did not expect what was to follow and she passed away in ICU  in Craigavon Hospital on Tuesday, December , . “We have to thank all the staff in AE,  North,  South, and especially Consultant Daryl Stewart and all his team who worked tirelessly over Suzanne’s final days in ICU. Their compassion and care was second to none and we will always be so grateful for that. The family are also so thankful to Ian Milne and Sons who looked after Suzanne and the entire family circle in such a caring thoughtful and professional way in our dficult time. Donations in lieu of flowers will be going to the NI Air Ambulance C O Ian Milne and Sons. “A big thanks also to Canon Bill Adair for the way he tended the family and helped us through a very dficult time. Thanks also to everyone that called to the house, sent cards, messages and attended Suzanne’s funeral as all of you have helped us through this dficult time.”Suzanne was a woman so full of le. She was always the le and soul of the party. She touched the hearts of so many people in her young le with her loving smile.When she was in Hart Memorial PS her teacher sent her for a message but she ended up in the principal’s office. He asked her what he could do for her. She said: “My older sister Tracey is going to London on the school trip but she cries a lot being away and is it okI go with her .”When they were renovating Cascades Pool and staff were being allocated to other places Suzanne went to work in Tannaghmore Gardens Farm. Her mum and dad gave her a day as she didn’t like getting dirty and was always turned out neat and tidy. But she loved the farm and the animals. On many occasions she would bring young animals home like baby ducks and even, once, a baby pig. Having finished her day’s work, she got a call later that night to say that a cow was calving. She went to the farm with her sister Tracey and helped deliver the calf. Suzanne had been toldit was a girl it would be named ‘Silverwood Susy’ but it was a boy and she was so disappointed. When she went into work the next day the cow had another calf during the night. It was white and a girl so it was named ‘Silverwood Suzy’. Suzanne was so delighted.George said: “Suzanne will be deeply missed by the entire family, friends and all who knew her. She will always be remembered as ‘Our Superstar’.”Her husband Joab said: “Suzanne and I met whilst working in Cascades in . We hit it off straight away and enjoyed travelling together. We backpacked around Australia, Thailand and Singapore. We also visited Florida on a few occasions before getting married in Florida just after Valentine’s Day on February , .“We were delighted on the birth of our daughter Nikhita in April  and settled down to family le. We called ourselves the three Musketeers. Suzanne was amazing and her smile was something special. She was the kindest person ever and would have gone out of her way to help anyone. She was a fantastic mother to Nikhita and step mother to Craig, Ryan and Sophie. She was a devoted we to me and I can’t express the love we had for each other through good times and bad times. “During last summer in July we went up to Bloody Bridge in Newcastle. Suzanne was very unsteady on her feet and she said for us to go on ahead. I was having none of it and I carried her up the mountain so she could enjoy the day with us. She was so happy and we had so many things planned for  and her th birthday. “Nikhita and I are heartbroken as is the whole family circle but we will work together as a family unit to bring up Nikhita so her mother Suzanne would be proud. Suzanne wanted the best for Nikhita and got her involved in after school activities, arts and crafts and hockey. She also got her involved with Portadown Dance College doing hip hop, modern and tap dancing. Like her mum she is involved in many groups and goes to speech classes and is a member of JWLOL , and attends Edgarstown youth club.”Suzanne De Groot , of Lisnisky Walk, Portadown died peacefully in Craigavon Hospital. Suzanne was the treasured we of Joab, devoted mum of Nikhita, also a beloved daughter of George and Sandra, a cherished sister of Michelle, Tracey and Simon and a much-loved aunt and granddaughter of Billy.Her funeral service was in St Columba’s Parish Church with committal following in Kernan Cemetery. The funeral service was conducted by Canon Rev Bill Adair. Suzanne’s sisters Michelle and Tracey helped carry her into the packed church to the song ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’. The hymns for the service were ‘All Things Bright and Beautul’ and ‘Shine Jesus Shine’. Suzanne was carried from the church to her favourite song ‘Super Star’. Suzanne was a ‘Super Star’ to everyone who knew her. “We lost our Super Star,”said her father.Portadown  \"       \"  ]]Most Popular attacked by gang in Craigavon, Co Armagh\" data-s-el\"\"

demand for strong action on single use plastics and climate change.It is hoped the campaign will highlight the amount of single use plastics discarded across the borough allowing the public to visualise and understand the reality of the problem. It is also hoped it will focus on a collective societal effort to protect the borough for future generations.Street litter.Areas impacted by the lack of cleaning will subsequently be cleaned as a matter of urgency as part of a big spring clean campaign which will include community litter picks, school engagement and business environmental champion engagement.Waste collected will then be weighed and photographed to create imagery to be used as part of a call to action.With the exact dates for the campaign to be confirmed, the report acknowledges engagement with the relevant town centre management and businesses will be crucial to the viability and success of the campaign.:Witnesses sought after traffic collision"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1642067512749.jpg--take_part_in_this_year_s_big_garden_birdwatch.jpg?164206751200","title":"take part in this year s big garden birdwatch ","story":"Keep your eyes wide open, get the kettle on and grab your binoculars as RSPB NI encourage you to join in on the charity’s Big Garden Birdwatch this month.
