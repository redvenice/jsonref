And to remind her that it knows precisely where she is and what she is doing.In Somalia, where the group controls vast swathes of the country, Al Shabaab is responsible for many thousands of violent deaths. It has attracted recruits from all over the world who are prepared to fight for it.To the outside world it is known for its most despicable acts of mass violence — the shooting at the upmarket Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi in 2013 in which 71 died, the attack on Garissa University College in Kenya in 2015 which killed 147 the devastating truck bombing in the Somali capital, Mogadishu, in October 2017, in which up to 1,000 people lost their lives, one of the worst terror attacks ever to hit the African continent.         People in Kenya protest after gunmen attacked the town of Mpeketoni in 2014, which al Shabaab claimed responsibility for Al Shabaab has threatened to attack targets in the UK, the U.S. and France, and arguably as IS loses power, its influence will increase. Its aim is to overthrow the Somali government and set up an Islamic state in the country based on Sharia law, but there are more ambitious members who want to spread its caliphate across the world.         Mary Harper (pictured above) has penned a book titled \u0027Everything You Have Told Me Is True\u0027, which is out later this monthIts ruthlessly efficient intelligence arm has spies everywhere: ‘Cooks, soldiers, mechanics, cleaners, civil servants and street children can all be the eyes and ears of Al Shabaab,’ says Mary. ‘Some sympathise with the movement, while others are so terrified of it that they dare not refuse to carry out its demands.‘Al Shabaab is not a black-and-white phenomenon. Of course there are those who embrace it entirely and those who reject it. But there is a large grey area in between and plenty of blurred lines.’The media man, its conduit for channelling information to Mary, tells her in impeccable English — he has learnt it from listening to the BBC — every move she has made during a visit to Baidoa in south-west Somalia.‘I feel sick to my stomach,’ she explains, ‘because I try to be extremely discreet when I visit Somalia. I tell as few people as possible that I am coming to the country and switch off all my social media accounts when I am there.‘I change my local phone number regularly and use secure messaging apps whenever I can. Meetings are arranged at the last minute, with times and locations often changed. \u0027I do not talk openly about my internal travel plans, only sharing them with my two trusted security advisers. How could Al Shabaab know all these details?’‘We have been monitoring you wherever you go,’ the voice tells her. ‘We have people in the government, the security forces, NGOs, and the media who tell us everything.’He goes on to talk about the people she has met in Mogadishu. He gets it right every time. She says, ‘It makes me think of a phrase I hear so often from Somalis: “Al Shabaab is everywhere and you never know who is Al Shabaab.” ’                Mary boarded at Bedales School (library pictured above) before going on to University Al Shabaab have Mary’s British phone number and when she flies to London — she spends about a third of the year in Africa and the rest in the UK — she ‘almost invariably’ receives a call as she is collecting her luggage or in a cab back home.‘I am asked about my trip, what the weather is like in the UK, and given a blow-by-blow account of what I got up to in Somalia. They must have someone in the airport telling them I’ve got on the plane, which unnerves me.’The calls have come regularly over the past two years almost all from the same man. ‘When he is telling me about Al Shabaab atrocities his voice is staccato, as if he is reciting by rote. Then it can become quite gentle, even tender, which is even more disturbing.‘He asks me if I’ve been thinking about my religion. (He often attempts to persuade me to join the Muslim faith.) ‘He tells me, “You might think you have a lot of Somali friends, but they are not your real friends. Your true friends would save you from hellfire, which is where you will end up if you do not convert to Islam.”’         Mary studied anthropology and archaeology at Cambridge  University (pictured above) The voice affects concern, too, when he calls while she is driving her car in England. ‘He says, “You mustn’t answer your phone in the car or you’ll have an accident or be arrested.” ’I ask why she imagines he tells her so accurately about her movements why he also professes concern about her welfare.‘It might be to show me how efficient Al Shabaab are. It might just be showing off,’ she speculates. ‘And perhaps he is trying to win me over, to be sympathetic to them. I don’t think the aim is to unsettle me, because I am useful to them. Although I give them very little airtime, there will be a short line if they take responsibility for a bombing.’Nonetheless, I say, as a lone and conspicuous Western woman, she must be terrified of being killed. But she says her contact insists she is not on their target list.‘Although he says, “If you’re in the wrong place at the wrong time that’s just your bad luck.” And I got very angry about this because a good friend, a Somali journalist, was maimed in an attack, and I was told, “It was his fault. He went to a place where Government people eat.” They have this cold logic about people who get hurt or killed like this.’Mary is talking to me as her book about Al Shabaab is published. It is an astonishing account of the movement and gives a vivid insight into the lives of the Somalis who exist in the shadow of its terror.We meet at her mum Kay’s flat back in Britain — book-lined and busy with memorabilia from her African travels — and it is easy to see that Mary’s love of the continent is inherited.Kay, 74, a former aid worker, was a nurse with Save the Children in Mogadishu. Mary’s father, Professor Malcolm Harper, 83, taught at the University of Nairobi where Mary and her three siblings spent part of their childhood. She then boarded at Bedales and went on to Cambridge to study anthropology and archaeology.But it was her mum’s satellite phone that secured her job with the BBC. ‘It was the 1990s, before mobile phones, and I’d just joined the BBC’s African service. Mum’s satellite phone gave me a means of communication,’ she says.I ask Kay if she worries about her intrepid daughter: ‘You do worry, but you’re also proud because she does her job so well. I’d never say, “Don’t do it because I’m scared for you.” But I’m always very happy when she’s safely back in England.’Slender, gentle in manner and softly spoken, Mary’s unassuming demeanour masks a spine of steel. ‘I don’t think of myself as brave, but I am resourceful,’ she says. ‘I know how to make my way.’ I ask about her children — a son, aged 28 and 22-year-old daughter — and she is unforthcoming.Wasn’t she scared of leaving them motherless when she went to Somalia during their childhood? I press her. She declines to answer, other than to say that she travelled much less when they were little, and ‘took fewer risks’. ‘I keep my work and personal lives compartmentalised,’ she says with finality. When I ask about a husband or partner, she says merely that she is single.It is, of course, unsurprising that she does not elaborate: Al Shabaab know enough about her already. Since she has been back in London, her ‘contact’ has phoned her. ‘He asked, “Have you left the BBC?” I’ve been away from work for a while, and it was one of those concerned calls.It is hard to imagine the peril in which Mary operates.She came within a whisker of death on New Year’s Day, 2014, when the Jazeera Palace hotel in Mogadishu was attacked just a few doors away from where she was enjoying a meal with friends.‘Suddenly, an enormous blast thunders through the air,’ she writes. ‘It is as if the sound has hit us physically.‘Flames burst out of the hotel the mangled remains of the suicide vehicle which was rammed into the perimeter wall lies among other destroyed cars.’In Somalia, Mary reports, ‘girls as young as nine years old are abducted by Al Shabaab and forced into marriage. Boys are terrorised into joining. “I didn’t want to,” one child confesses, “but if you refuse they will kill you.” ’Anyone working for ‘infidels’ is hounded: Mary visits a sprawling camp in Mogadishu, crammed with displaced people escaping the insurgents. ‘I made and repaired soldiers’ uniforms,’ a tailor tells her. ‘Al Shabaab told me to stop making clothes for infidels, but I had to.‘I was also afraid of the soldiers (the government forces). Both the soldiers and Al Shabaab could kill me. I’d have been killed for repairing uniforms and killed for refusing to. The only thing to do was abandon my livelihood and come here.’The choice is often invidious: join, die — or flee and face destitution in the camps.The calls to Mary continue, unabated: she logs as many as 17 missed in a single hour of one day.In June last year, she went to Mogadishu, staying for the entire trip in secure accommodation in its airport compound. ‘Yet still the phone call came when I got back to London. “How was your trip to Mogadishu?”‘I tell my contact this makes me very scared. He replies, his voice almost tender, “You don’t need to be afraid of us. We have hundreds of enemies, but you’re not one of them.” ’Perhaps it is enough, for al Shabaab, that she is forced to listen to their gloating announcements of massacres and bombings enough too, that she knows their omnipresent eyes follow her everywhere.Everything You Have Told Me Is True by Mary Harper is published by Hurst on April 25 at £20. © Mary Harper 2019.

Well, think again. It didn’t take long to establish that the Beat The Receipt campaign is not quite what it first appears. It is not really an environmental movement. It is a front for the financial technology — or ‘fintech’ — industry, which of course has a huge vested interest in trying to stop the issuing of paper receipts.The campaign is run by a company called Flux, which develops an app offering paperless receipts. The industry has leapt on the environmental bandwagon in order to try to further its own commercial interests.But the campaign isn’t just about making money by selling apps for paperless receipts. It is not hard to work out why some retailers have eagerly backed it — they want to harvest our email addresses. These are hugely valuable pieces of data, allowing us to be targeted with marketing material.         It is not hard to work out why some retailers have eagerly backed it — they want to harvest our email addresses. These are hugely valuable pieces of data, allowing us to be targeted with marketing material, writes Ross ClarkBuy something with cash and be given a paper receipt, and a shop has no idea of who we are. If we are to receive an electronic receipt, on the other hand, we have to hand over our email address, or other social media contact details, to the retailer.Shops are already trying hard to extract this information from us — many times in the past year or so I have been asked by a shop assistant, with no good reason, for my email address.Needless to say, I decline. But what could we do if we were told it was the only way we could obtain a receipt, and therefore the only way we could receive our money back if the product proved defective?The fintech industry has already achieved its objective in California, where it ran a similar ‘skip the slip’ campaign — and where a new law will prevent shops issuing paper receipts unless a customer specifically asks for one.There is every reason why we should be given a paper receipt when we go shopping.How many of us would wait at the counter to make sure that the receipt we had been promised had actually arrived in an email? And if it didn’t, we would find ourselves unable to return defective goods.It is shameful that such bare-faced commercial interest is being hidden under the guise of environmental claims.Clearly, there are some genuine environmental campaigns which have achieved huge traction with the general public in recent years.         The Mail campaigned against single-use plastics. The items kill a large number of animals         A plastic garfield phone that washed up on a beach in Le Conquet, western France, this yearThe campaign championed by the Mail against single-use plastics, for example, has plenty of justification — discarded plastic is killing large numbers of creatures and threatens to litter the countryside, coast and seas for thousands of years to come.But receipts? The claims made by Beat The Receipt just don’t stand up. How can the manufacture of 11.2 billion receipts a year consume ‘millions of trees, millions of barrels of oil and billions of gallons of water’?Let’s just take the ‘millions of trees’: ten million trees would mean only 1,000 or so receipts per tree, so they would have to be pretty slender trees!There must be more paper in the ‘Vote Liberal Democrat’ leaflet I had put through my door yesterday than in all the receipts I gather in a month — probably longer. In fact, figures from California suggest that receipts account for less than 0.1 per cent of all paper produced — an utterly insignificant proportion.But the boldest claim of Beat The Receipt is that receipts are poisoning us. The thermal paper on which many of them are printed, it says, contain BPA, a ‘substance classified as toxic to humans and wildlife by the EU’.But there are toxic materials and there are toxic materials. In fact, in 2015 the European Food Safety Authority reviewed the scientific evidence on BPA — which is also used in a wide number of plastics — and concluded that ‘BPA poses no health risk to consumers of any age group (including unborn children, infants and adolescents) at current exposure levels’.In other words, even the BPA in the plastic wrapping around your cheese or in the plastic bottle containing fruit juice is not doing you any harm. It is preposterous, then, to claim consumers are being harmed by small amounts of it in their receipts.In any case, it is perfectly possible to manufacture paper receipts without BPA — something that the industry has committed to doing by next year.There is a far greater environmental hazard: the manufacture of smartphones — yes, the devices on which Beat The Receipt wants us to get our receipts instead.An analysis by Liverpool John Moores University revealed the damage being wrought on the environment by the mining of rare-earth metals for the manufacture of smartphones.Many of these materials are obtained from China, where vast amounts of toxic waste are a by-product. Moreover, resources of these rare metals — which include neodymium and dysprosium — are extremely limited, and could become exhausted over the next 20 to 50 years.In other words, if you want to stop receiving paper receipts because you think they are a menace to the environment, you wouldn’t want to use a smartphone, either.The paper receipt is a time-honoured part of shopping.

I’ve answered this question on the television as well.

Photograph: Michael McHughPA Wire Northern Ireland’s pro-Brexit Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is running ads on Facebook to raise money in England only as part of a new fundraising drive on social media.The party’s “Support Brexit – Support the DUP” ads are being shown mostly to people over the age of 55 – an age group that voted in the majority for Brexit - and only in England where the party has no candidates.Facebook data on the ad, which features photographs of DUP leader Arlene Foster and deputy leader Nigel Dodds, says it was being shown only to people living in England.Some 37 per cent of the people being shown the ad were aged 65 years or older and a further 25 per cent are aged between 55 and 64, according to the data on the ad.The ad had been viewed between 5,000 and 10,000 times since it began running on Tuesday, just weeks ahead of European and local elections.Asked why the DUP was running the ad in England where the party had no candidates, a spokesman said the DUP wants to see the UK’s vote in the 2016 referendum, to leave the EU, implemented.“The DUP wants to see a deal as we exit the EU which respects the referendum result and works for every part of the United Kingdom, ” he said.“People in England, Scotland and Wales as well as Northern Ireland support our position. We welcome such support.”The spokesman said that the party was not targeting any particular age group with the ad.The People’s Vote campaign, which is pushing for a public vote on the final Brexit deal, believes the ad shows the DUP are turning their focus to England because of the anti-Brexit feeling in Northern Ireland.“The DUP have plainly realised that opinion in Northern Ireland has turned sharply against Brexit and so they cannot afford to be seen promoting it with local and European elections approaching,” said a source with the campaign.“Maybe their funders in the business community have bailed on them too.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

File Photograph: Alan BetsonSDLP leader Colum Eastwood is to contest the upcoming European Parliament election on May 23rd.On Thursday the Foyle legislative assembly member (MLA) said he was “seeking to secure a historic second seat representing the Pro-Europe Majority in Northern Ireland”.With DUP and Sinn Féin incumbents Diane Dodds and Martina Anderson expected to retain their safe seats, the competition will be for the third seat in the North, currently held by UUP MEP Jim Nicholson, who has said he will not be running again.“This is an election like no other,” Mr Eastwood said. “In June 2016, a majority of people from communities across Northern Ireland came together to express our clear will that we should remain in the European Union. “It was a vote that, unlike many others, saw people break free from their traditional trenches to occupy a common ground and a common identity. “Since then, the broad progressive coalition that came together has been sidelined and silenced. “Without a government in Belfast and with the DUP aligned to hard Brexit fanatics in London, people here have been ignored. Enough is enough.”Mr Eastwood said the European election should be a referendum, “the North’s People’s Vote”. He said the SDLP “is within striking distance of the third European seat”. He told BBC Radio Ulster his party was “best placed” to take a second pro-Remain seat over the Alliance Party.Other candidatesIt’s likely the UUP candidate will be former minister Danny Kennedy and its expected Alliance Party leader Naomi Long, who has strong cross-community support, will announce her candidacy later today. Brexiteer, Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister could also have a chance of taking the third seat if he decides to run.In 2014, Ms Anderson won 159,813 first preference votes, while Ms Dodds won 131,163. Mr Nicholson won 83,438 votes, while former West Belfast MLA Alex Attwood, now retired from politics, was close behind on 81,594 votes. Mr Allister won 75,806, and the former Alliance South Belfast MLA Anna Lo won 44,432 votes.The SDLP last secured a set in Europe through former leader John Hume in 1999. Potential candidates had been former leader Mark Durkan but he chose to stand in Dublin for Fine Gael, and south Belfast MLA Claire Hanna, the party’s former Brexit spokeswoman, who resigned the whip earlier this year when the SDLP announced it’s new partnership link up with Fianna Fáil."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3864631.1555583229!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit pelosi visits irish border between donegal and derry","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi and Congressman Richard Neal address the media at the Irish Border.

More than 1.5sq km of Saddleworth Moor was ablaze in the early hours of Wednesday morning after the UK’s hottest winter day on recordLord Tyrie, CMA chairman, said: “People\u0027s livelihoods, savings and pensions all depend on the auditors\u0027 job being done to a high standard.“But too many fall short - more than a quarter of big company audits are considered sub-standard by the regulator. This cannot be allowed to continue.Under the CMA\u0027s proposals, competition would be encouraged by the introduction of\u0026nbspmandatory joint audits, which would force the big four to work with smaller partners when checking accounts.Big Four accountancy firms should be broken up, say MPsKPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY currently sign off the accounts of\u0026nbsp97 per cent\u0026nbspof FTSE 350 companies and 99 per cant\u0026nbspof FTSE 100 companies.Their dominance has led to allegations of a cosy relationship with some of the firms that they audit. Business Committee chair Rachel Reeves has accused the big four of using mundane audit work as a route to\u0026nbspmilk the cash cow of consultancy business.The CMA called for a regulator to hold company “audit committees more vigorously to account”, including public reprimands for those that fall short of adequate scrutiny from auditors.Lord Tyrie added: “Conflicts of interest cannot be allowed to persist nor can the UK afford to rely on only four firms to audit Britain\u0027s biggest companies any longer.”Business groups criticised the CMA\u0027s proposals with the Confederation of British Industry warning that they risk damaging Britain\u0027s reputation as a leader in the accountancy business.“Mandating joint audits will add cost and complexity for business with no guarantee of better outcomes, said John Allan, CBI president.Operational splits could restrict access to the skills required to carry out complex audits.”Dr Ian Peters, chief executive of the chartered institute of internal auditors, added: “We welcome the proposal to separate external audit from non-audit services to raise standards, eliminate potential conflicts of interest and ensure the independence of external auditors to reduce the risk of another Carillion style collapse.”Competition and Markets AuthorityOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

This cannot be allowed to continue.Under the CMA\u0027s proposals, competition would be encouraged by the introduction of\u0026nbspmandatory joint audits, which would force the big four to work with smaller partners when checking accounts.Big Four accountancy firms should be broken up, say MPsKPMG, Deloitte, PwC and EY currently sign off the accounts of\u0026nbsp97 per cent\u0026nbspof FTSE 350 companies and 99 per cant\u0026nbspof FTSE 100 companies.Their dominance has led to allegations of a cosy relationship with some of the firms that they audit. Business Committee chair Rachel Reeves has accused the big four of using mundane audit work as a route to\u0026nbspmilk the cash cow of consultancy business.The CMA called for a regulator to hold company “audit committees more vigorously to account”, including public reprimands for those that fall short of adequate scrutiny from auditors.Lord Tyrie added: “Conflicts of interest cannot be allowed to persist nor can the UK afford to rely on only four firms to audit Britain\u0027s biggest companies any longer.”Business groups criticised the CMA\u0027s proposals with the Confederation of British Industry warning that they risk damaging Britain\u0027s reputation as a leader in the accountancy business.“Mandating joint audits will add cost and complexity for business with no guarantee of better outcomes, said John Allan, CBI president.Operational splits could restrict access to the skills required to carry out complex audits.”Dr Ian Peters, chief executive of the chartered institute of internal auditors, added: “We welcome the proposal to separate external audit from non-audit services to raise standards, eliminate potential conflicts of interest and ensure the independence of external auditors to reduce the risk of another Carillion style collapse.”Competition and Markets AuthorityOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016.

The average UK home cost £226,000 during the month, £1,000 more than a year ago but the slowest annual rise since September 2012.Despite declining prices in the capital, it remains the most expensive place in the country to buy a home with an average of £460,000, followed by the South East and the east of England, at £316,000 and £290,000 respectively.Across England, house prices in the North West grew fastest at 4 per cent followed by the West Midlands which saw a 2.9 per cent annual increase, according to the figures released jointly by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and Land Registry.Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the ONS, said: “Growth in Wales and the west of England was offset by a sustained fall in London and falling prices in the South East for the first time since 2011.”London again out of step with the nation as its house prices tumbleAverage prices in Wales jumped 4.1 per cent over the twelve months to reach £160,000 while in Northern Ireland, average increased even faster with a 5.5 per cent rise to £137,000.

More than 1.5sq km of Saddleworth Moor was ablaze in the early hours of Wednesday morning after the UK’s hottest winter day on recordA small number of schools have particularly high rates of pupil exit, with just 6 per cent of secondary schools in England (330 schools) accounting for almost a quarter (23 per cent) of the unexplained moves.Watchdog Ofsted has\u0026nbsppreviously criticised schools for “off-rolling” children just before their GCSE exams to boost their results and perform better in the government’s league tables. David Laws, executive chair\u0026nbspof the EPI, said: “The size of unexplained pupil moves is disturbing and will raise concerns about whether some schools are ‘off-rolling’ pupils.”Schools ‘must be accountable for off-rolled pupils’ exam results’Jo Hutchinson, report author at EPI, added: “For the first time, we begin to see the full scale of this problem, having stripped away cases where family decisions have led to school moves. “Our estimate is that one in 12 children are being pushed around the system, and that this has risen in recent years.”Angela Rayner, Labour’s shadow education secretary, said: “It’s a national scandal that tens of thousands of children are falling off school rolls and potentially out of education altogether.“There must be a clear responsibility to ensure all children get a great education and are not let down by a fragmented school system.“But instead of taking action this government continues to drag its feet, failing the most vulnerable.Dr Mary\u0026nbspBousted, joint general secretary of the\u0026nbspNEU, said: “The data is shocking if not surprising.“It is urgent that we move beyond the numbers, analyse the real reasons behind these moves, and challenge the government policies which are undermining inclusive and high-quality education.”Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, said: “It is important not to conflate and condemn all the different reasons a pupil might leave a school’s roll.“To be clear, the practice of off-rolling a pupil to ‘game’ the data is wrong. But not all unexplained pupil exits are off-rolling, and this report still cannot tell us exactly how widespread bad practice is.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Dozens of firefighters worked through the night to battle a major moorland blaze in West Yorkshire. More than 1.5sq km of Saddleworth Moor was ablaze in the early hours of Wednesday morning after the UK’s hottest winter day on recordMeanwhile, Callum Wetherill, a teacher from Kirklees, said he knew of a school with a behaviour policy where children can be excluded for tapping, swinging on a chair or sighing when in an isolation room. The remarks come as a mother of an autistic child who tried to take her own life in an isolation booth at an academy school is threatening legal action against the government.The girl, who has autistic spectrum disorder, was put in isolation by her school in Kent for more than a month, where she was forced to remain silent and had no directed teaching.Anna Wolmuth, from Islington, said: “We have heard horror stories from across the country. Children being made to cry in assemblies. Children spending six hours a \u0026nbspday in isolation booths.”Last year, a BBC investigation revealed that around 5,000 children with special educational needs\u0026nbspattended isolation rooms in 2018 – and more than 200 children were placed in isolation booths for a whole week. School pupil attempted suicide after being in isolation for a monthAt her former school, Ms Wolmuth said the referral room was filled with children with special educational needs and “those with difficult things going on at home.She added: “This is when behaviour management is a euphemism for child abuse.”The motion, which was passed by NEU members, describes zero tolerance approaches as “inhumane”, adding they have led to informal exclusions and children spending “harmful” periods in isolation. Carole Buxton, a teacher from Hackney, said: “Zero tolerance approaches are isive, damaging and wrong. They are one of the causes of exclusions, putting children out of the education system.”The motion added: “The use of isolation booths for extended periods has a detrimental effect on the mental health and education of all children.”The debate came as a survey revealed that more than four in five teachers had seen a rise in mental health problems among pupils, with some children as young as nine talking about suicides.Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the NEU, said: “The current draconian approach to the education of children and young people is turning our schools into exam factories and squeezing the joy and creativity out of the classroom. “As a result, more and more children and young people are being diagnosed with depression and the levels of unhappiness are soaring.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And Sats for Year 6 pupils are here to stay.Labour will abolish Sats exams in primary schools, Jeremy Corbyn saysIn fact, children in primary schools will also face a times-tables check next year on top of the already unpopular phonics tests under the government’s assessment system.So why do the controversial primary school tests still exist?

And the pressure has been passed down to the kids.Some argue that abolishing Sats would also make it harder for parents to know how good schools are at teaching core subjects, with these\u0026nbspresults used in league tables and Ofsted ratings.However, many parents are willing to have less information in order to save their child from the tougher assessments that leave many feeling stressed out.Standing up in front of teachers\u0026nbspwho have been disillusioned with the primary school testing regime for years\u0026nbspand calling for the abolition of exams\u0026nbspis an easy gig for Corbyn. What will be harder is finding an alternative assessment system that both parents and schools will back.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series. Big-name stars such as Orlando Bloom and Aubrey Plaza crop up, but Jane Adams – who you might remember from Todd Solondz’s chronically depressing 1998 film Happiness – is the show’s heart, and Marc Maron is its jaded soul.Community’s Gillian Jacobs is brilliant as the prickly, magnetic recovering addict Mickey, who forms an unlikely – and arguably deeply unwise – relationship with her nerdy neighbour Gus (Paul Rust). Despite Gus’s pathological need to be the nice guy, we’re never quite sure who or what we’re rooting for – which is what makes Love such complex, compelling viewing.  In 2016, comedian Patton Oswalt’s wife, the true crime writer Michelle McNamara, died suddenly in her sleep. That subject matter doesn’t exactly scream “stand-up special”, but out of his devastating loss, Oswalt managed to craft something funny and profound. Over the course of an hour, he processes his grief onstage, managing to find humour in the struggle to raise his grieving six-year-old daughter alone.920 Santa Clarita Diet (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Granted, this horror-comedy – which stars Drew Barrymore as a neurotic real estate agent who suddenly develops a taste for human flesh – is really silly, and really, really disgusting. But it’s also strangely charming, and funny. Timothy Olyphant is excellent as Sheila’s frazzled husband Joel, and the pair’s idiosyncratic but respectful relationship with their smart teenage daughter Abby (Liv Hewson) isn’t quite like anything else on TV right now.1020 Dark Tourist (TV series, one season, 2018–)New Zealand journalist David Farrier is an unlikely TV presenter in the same way that Louis Theroux is – in just about every scenario in which he finds himself, he’s a little bit awkward. But as with Theroux, Farrier’s weakness is actually his strength, allowing him to endear himself to the many unusual people he meets on his journey through the world’s most questionable tourist destinations. Farrier’s stops include the site of the Fukushima nuclear disaster, the road where JFK was assassinated, and the Milwaukee suburbs where serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer murdered his victims.1120 Sacred Games (TV series, one season, 2018–)Based on Vikram Chandra’s epic 2006 novel, Netflix’s first Indian original series is a slowly unfolding gem. The first season of Sacred Games – which follows a troubled police officer (Saif Ali Khan) who has 25 days to save his city thanks to a tip-off from a presumed dead gangster – only covered one quarter of Chandra’s 1,000-page novel. As the show itself declared when it announced the forthcoming second season, “the worst is yet to come”.When the trailer for Dumplin’ first landed, it seemed all the ingredients were in place for a film that was at worst tone-deaf, and at best vaguely patronising. Thank heavens, then, that the trailer did Dumplin’ such a disservice. Starring Danielle Macdonald (who broke out in the excellent 2017 film Patti Cake$) as Willowdean, a self-described “fat girl” who enters a local pageant to annoy her former beauty queen mother (Jennifer Aniston), Dumplin’ is as funny, warm and sensitive as its protagonist – and with a killer Dolly Parton-laden soundtrack to boot.1320 Dark (TV series, one season, 2017–)This sci-fi thriller – which features disappearing children, a mysterious local power plant, and scenes set in the Eighties – has, for obvious reasons, drawn comparisons to Stranger Things. But Dark is even more beguiling and (true to its name) less family-friendly than Stranger Things.1420 The Death and Life of Marsha P Johnson (Film, 2017)Though it’s been somewhat tarnished by claims that director David France appropriated the work and research of trans film-maker Reina Gossett, this documentary is nonetheless a loving, respectful tribute to gay rights activist Marsha P Johnson. One of the key figures in the Stonewall uprising (though her involvement was almost entirely eradicated in 2015’s critically hated Stonewall), Johnson modelled for Andy Warhol, performed onstage with drag group Hot Peaches, helped found the Gay Liberation Front, and then died under suspicious circumstances in 1992.1520 On My Block (TV series, one season, 2018–)This coming-of-age series might not have found as many eyeballs as it deserved last year, but those it did find were glued to the screen. In fact, it was the most-binged show of 2018 – meaning that it had the highest watch-time-per-viewing session of any Netflix original. Created by Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, On My Block follows a group of Los Angeles teens as they navigate both the drama of high school and the danger of inner-city life.Two beleaguered assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) conspire to get their over-demanding bosses (Taye Diggs and Lucy Liu) together in order to get their lives back in this winning romantic comedy. Set It Up is responsible not only for coining the term “over-dicking” (it’s much more innocent than it sounds), but for rejuvenating a tired genre.Martin Freeman stars as the father struggling to protect his young daughter from a zombie epidemic spreading across Australia. So far, so overdone. But this drama thriller, directed by Ben Howling and Yolanda Ramke and based on their 2013 short of the same name, throws a handful of unpredictable ners in the works.    1920 Godless (TV series, one season, 2017–)With shades of John Ford\u0027s The Searchers, this languorous western was critically acclaimed but swiftly forgotten after it landed on Netflix in 2016. Set in 1884, it\u0027s about Frank Griffin (Jeff Daniels) and his notoriously ruthless gang of outlaws’ pursuit of their injured former ally Roy Goode (Jack O’Connell), who is hiding out in a small town populated solely by women after a mining accident killed off all its men. A gun-toting Michelle Dockery, clearly relishing the change of scenery after years of Downton Abbey, and a taciturn Jack O’Connell, are on brilliant form.2020 Atypical (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)This coming-of-age series about a teenage boy with autism was sweet and well-intentioned from the start, but its first season was criticised for a handful of inaccuracies, and for its lack of autistic actors. Rather than drowning in a sea of defensiveness – as too many shows tend to do – it listened, and brought in autistic actors and writers for its excellent second season.120 Money Heist (TV series, one season, 2017–)Known as La Casa de Papel (House of Paper) in its native Spanish, Money Heist is Netflix’s most streamed non-English language show. The bank heist is a tired dramatic trope these days, but don’t let that, or the show’s bland English-language title, put you off – creator Álex Pina has made something special. The heist here, led by a mysterious man known only as The Professor, involves breaking into the Royal Mint of Spain and printing off €2.4 billion. There are even more twists in the show’s 15 episodes than there are hostages. 220 American Vandal (TV series, two seasons, 2017–2018)Part satire of true crime documentaries such as Making a Murderer, part carefully observed portrayal of teenage life, American Vandal was criminally underappreciated during its two season run. It’s been cancelled now, but that doesn’t mean you can’t catch up with it, and then write Netflix a strongly worded email.320 One Day at a Time (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)In stark contrast to the off-beat, low-key comedy that currently rules TV – the kind that provokes a wry smirk rather than a hearty laugh – One Day at a Time is a big, bright sitcom filmed in front of an interminably enthusiastic studio audience. You wouldn’t have thought that the story of a Cuban-American army veteran  nurse  single mother – who suffers from PTSD and depression – would fit into this format, but it does so beautifully, tackling issues of sexuality, racism and sexism in the process.  Based on writer  director Tamara Jenkins’s own fertility struggles, Private Life stars Kathryn Hahn and Paul Giamatti (both giving brilliant performances) as a spiky, loving middle-aged couple desperate to have a baby. They even rope their enthusiastic but irresponsible niece Sadie (Kayli Carter) into the mix, much to the horror of Sadie’s mother (Molly Shannon, turning a potentially repellent character into one worthy of empathy). It’s subtle, restrained and beautifully realised.520 Big Mouth (TV series, two seasons, 2017–)Crude, rude, and rife with surprise emissions and bodily functions, animated sitcom Big Mouth is also a sensitive, nuanced deep e into the various horrors of teenagehood. When 12-year-old Andrew Glouberman (John Mulaney) is visited by the hormone monster (Nick Kroll, who voices many of the show’s best characters), he finds his life irreversibly – and seemingly disastrously – changed. Unlike many other puberty-centred comedies, Big Mouth makes as much time for its confused female protagonists as its male ones Maya Rudolph is a delight as the female hormone monster, and look out for Kristen Wiig’s wonderful turn as a talking vagina.  620 Easy (TV series, two seasons, 2016–)Joe Swanberg’s style of defiantly undramatic mumblecore isn’t for everyone, but if you enjoyed his earlier films, Drinking Buddies and Happy Christmas, you’ll find plenty to admire in this anthology comedy-drama series.

There’s a lot we don’t know about the origins of Easter, and we’re learning more every day.”It is not clear how, when or why the rabbit became linked to the Easter festival, although it could be due to the spread of Christian religious beliefs.The folkloric figure of the Easter Bunny bringing eggs for children is closely linked to German traditions.Additional reporting by PAOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She has since been caring full-time for her two children, one of whom has severe autism.In October 2018, the US national travelled to America for two weeks due to the father being ill. On her return, she was told she had no right to enter, and days later\u0026nbspshe received a notice from the Home Office stating that there was a ticket booked for her removal the following Thursday morning.Speaking to The Independent, Ms Cullen said: “I was just panicking because I couldn’t even\u0026nbspcontact a barrister over the weekend. My children would’ve gone into care because my husband was out of the country at the time. I was living like there was no tomorrow. It felt like everything was falling apart.“They said that if I didn’t board the flight I’d be arrested where I lived and forcibly removed. We were making preparations with social services and school. My children would have been devastated. This is the life that they know.”Ms Cullen’s barrister Morgan Read successfully sought an emergency injunction on the grounds that the department had failed to consider the welfare of her children\u0026nbspin breach of UK law.Despite this, and the fact that she\u0026nbspwas granted a British residence card in January, Ms Cullen is still on immigration bail, and the Home Office still has her passport.\u0026nbsp“I felt like I was finally getting over it, that the judge said I could stay. It just doesn’t make sense. They’ve agreed that I do have the right to be here. It’s like I’m allowed to be here but not allowed to leave,“\u0026nbspsaid Ms Cullen. “It’s baffling really that they don’t seem to consider any human part of this. I feel like I’m just a number. They wanted to protect the border by tearing a mother from her children.“My mother is starting to forget who I am because I’m not there. I just feel lost. This time is precious and they’re taking that from me.”Ms Cullen’s solicitor Arta Heath, managing director of MyUKVisas, said the Home Office’s attempt to deport the mother-of-two\u0026nbspwas “absolutely outrageous”.She said the\u0026nbsppassport issue was a\u0026nbspsymptom of both the hostile environment and “complete incompetence” in the department.Most immigration removals cancelled amid ‘dearth of legal advice’“This is a terrible situation. The Home Office said it knew she had British citizen children but that they could stay with their father, which is absolutely outrageous. They claimed that because had spent two weeks without their mum they could be without her forever,” said Ms Heath.“But the issue now is the administrative process.\u0026nbspThere is no reason for them to hold onto her passport, but they haven’t sent it to her and the removal direction process is still continuing, meaning she can’t go see her mum.“It shows how the inability of the Home Office to understand law and procedure, coupled with the hostile environment, is leading to shocking decisions being made.”Responding to the case, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: “It seems the Home Office have ignored what is humane and sensible. Instead they have continued with the tick-box exercises, which have characterised this Tory government’s hostile environment.\u0026nbsp“Until these dreadful policies end, families will live with the threat of being torn apart.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Members of the so called \u0027Red Brigade\u0027 march in disobedience on the street from Oxford Circus to Piccadilly Circus to protest in London.

Halting this cycle of fear and intimidation is a matter of the utmost urgency of all people.”He added: “If the political debate slides surreptitiously or openly towards a civil war-style atmosphere, in which journalists are treated as scapegoats, then democracy is in great danger.”Norway is ranked first for press freedoms for the third consecutive year and Turkmenistan replaced North Korea in last place.The study’s authors said the level of violence used in some parts of the world to persecute journalists who aggravate authorities “no longer seems to know any limits”. They said the Saudi columnist Jamal Khashoggi’s murder in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last October sent a “chilling message”.The Americas saw the greatest deterioration of any part of the world during the last year. Nicaragua fell 24 places from the previous year’s list due to attacks on journalists covering protests against President Daniel Ortega.Democracy undergoing \u0027alarming\u0027 decline around the world, study findsEl Salvador saw the region’s second steepest fall – 15 places – because journalists suffered armed attacks, harassment and intimidation by politicians, according to the report.There were also poor performances in Venezuela, Brazil and Mexico. The latter is one of the world’s deadliest countries for the media, with at least 10 journalists killed in 2018.The EU and Balkans registered the second biggest deterioration in press freedoms, but it remains the region where press freedom is respected most and which is the safest for journalists.According to a\u0026nbspseparate report\u0026nbsprecently published by\u0026nbspRSF, 80 journalists were killed around the world in 2018, up from 65 in 2017.The group’s annual index assesses six separate benchmarks and assigns each country a score calculated from answers to a questionnaire in 20 languages that is completed by international experts.Earlier this year a report by the Freedom House think tank found an “alarming” decline in democracy across the world, as a growing number of countries move towards authoritarian rule.Its report found 2018 was the 13th consecutive year of deteriorating political freedoms around the globe.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But if there were any weakening of the Good Friday accords there would be no chance whatsoever, a non-starter for a US-UK trade agreement.“The Good Friday accords ended 700 years of conflict. This is not a treaty only, it’s an ideal, it’s a value, it’s something that’s a model to the world, something that we all take pride in.“It was a model and other people have used it as a model and we don’t want that model to be something that can be bargained away in another agreement.”Created with Sketch.

A rise\u0026nbspwould help to lower inflation but would mean extra costs for borrowers and could act to slow economic growth.The consumer price index (CPI), including owner-occupiers’ housing costs (CPIH) – the Office for National Statistics’\u0026nbsppreferred measure of inflation – was 1.8 per cent\u0026nbspin March, unchanged from February.The retail price\u0026nbspindex (RPI), a separate measure of inflation, was unchanged from February at 2.4 per cent.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Scotland registered a decline of 0.2 per cent to reach £146,000 on average.The lowest average house prices are in the North East at £125,000 and is the only English region where house prices remain below their peak reached before the financial crisis.Howard Archer, chief economic adviser at EY ITEM Club said the figures “very much fuel the overall impression that the housing market is being hampered as buyer caution amid already challenging conditions is being reinforced by recent heightened Brexit and economic uncertainties.\u0026nbsp“Although there are significant variations across regions with the overall picture being dragged down by the weakness in London and the South East“.He predicted a 1 per cent rise for the coming year but said he “would not be at all surprised” if they stagnate.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There has been stone pelting by protesters in at least 40 places, said one senior police officer.\u0026nbspStone-pelting has become a weekly ritual in Srinagar, a show of protest\u0026nbspagainst the security forces that usually\u0026nbsptakes place after Friday prayers.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe state of Jammu \u0026amp Kashmir is currently operating under governor\u0027s rule and is due a local election to restore a state government, but it was deemed too insecure to carry out state election in tandem with the general election at this time.There are more reports now of violence in West Bengal, following the news earlier that a candidate for CPI(M) had his car attacked by rival workers.\u0026nbspIn Chopra in Darjeeling, police clashed with a group of protesters who alleged that the Trinamool Congress (TMC), the ruling party in the state, was not allowing them to vote.\u0026nbspOfficials said the agitators threw projectiles at riot police and were met with tear gas shells and baton charges.\u0026nbspAlso in Chopra, reporters said there were clashes at a polling station between TMC and BJP workers, during which some of the electronic voting machines (EVMs) were smashed.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspDarjeeling is one of only three hotly contested seats in West Bengal voting today. It has been held by the BJP in the past two terms, in what is otherwise a state dominated by regional parties.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThere has been a minor incident during a news conference at the BJP\u0027s main headquarters here in Delhi, where a member of the audience threw a shoe at the party\u0027s spokesman.\u0026nbspGVL Narasimha Rao was speaking to announce the Hindu nationalist\u0026nbspSadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur as the party\u0027s candidate for Bhopal.\u0026nbspHe was in the process of denouncing Congress for bringing false cases against Hindu activists like Ms Thakur - accused over a 2008 terrorist bomb attack.\u0026nbspThe man who threw the shoe was immediately bundled out of the news conference by security personnel, video of the incident shows. According to the Press Trust of India, the man identified himself as a doctor.\u0026nbspAfter the shoe flew across the stage, Rao immediately suggested it was the act of a Congress-inspired person.\u0026nbspVoting has been postponed in the Vellore seat in Tamil Nadu following the seizure of Rs 110 million (£1.22m) in unaccounted cash allegedly from the home of a local opposition politician, Kathir Anand.\u0026nbspHis party accused federal tax authorities of raiding the homes and offices of party leaders running against Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u0027s Hindu nationalist party. The governing party in the state, All\u0026nbspIndia\u0026nbspAnna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), is an ally of Modi\u0027s party.\u0026nbspThe Election Commission said that authorities had recovered 2 billion rupees (£22m) from leaders, workers and supporters of various political parties in the state in the past month. They suspect the money is for buying votes.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspNarendra Modi has been speaking this morning at a large rally in his home state of Gujarat.\u0026nbspWith Srinagar in Kashmir voting under extremely tight security today, Mr Modi talked at length on the subject of national security.\u0026nbspIt\u0027s the one issue his strategists at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have been pushing more than any other since the turn of the year.\u0026nbspThe Modi administration came in for some criticism in the wake of the Pulwama bombing that killed 40 armed police in Kashmir in February, with questions raised over whether more could have been done to stop the attack.\u0026nbspSpeaking just now, Mr Modi defended his government\u0027s record, saying that terrorism had been contained to only two-and-a-half districts in Kashmir, and that no bombings had been seen outside these areas during his five years in power.\u0026nbspMr Modi also harked back to a 2016 incident where India claimed to have carried out targeted ground operations within Pakistan-administered Kashmir after a militant attack on an Indian army base in Uri, Jammu and Kashmir.\u0026nbspHe compared it to what he described as Congress\u0027s failure to act after the 2008 Mumbai attacks.\u0026nbspCongress did not do any thing after the Mumbai attack.\u0026nbspWhat did Modi do after Uri? I killed them by going in to their home with a surgical strike, he told the rally.\u0026nbspThe Independent travelled to one of the two-and-a-half districts referred to by Mr Modi, Pulwama, last month. There, the family of the Pulwama bomber defended his actions, calling it a reaction to the excesses of Indian security forces in the region and a part of the separatist struggle. India says the militancy in Kashmir is fuelled by neighbouring Pakistan, which has armed and trained fighters in the past.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspRead the full story.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspOne of the big talking points in the days before the election began on 12 April was the controversial planned release of a Bollywood biopic about the prime minister, entitled PM Narendra Modi.\u0026nbspThe Election Commission of India eventually decided that the film, which was seen as being positive about Mr Modi\u0027s life story, risked undermining the level playing field of the elections and ordered it and any other elements of hagiography not be released until after voting was over.\u0026nbspThe film\u0027s producers complained, however,\u0026nbspand the Supreme Court on Monday ordered the commissioners to at least watch the film before taking a decision.\u0026nbspThat viewing is understood to have taken place yesterday, and the commission must now deliver its new ruling to the apex court no later than Friday.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIt raises the prospect that, if the commission changes its mind, the film could hit cinemas before the third day of voting on 23 April. The film, starring the self-confessed Modi fan\u0026nbspVivek Oberoi in the lead role, traces the prime minister\u0027s rise from being the son of a tea seller to leader of the nation.In southern Karnataka, both the BJP and Congress are hoping to make up seats, with the expectation that Mr Modi is unlikely to be able to repeat the near clean sweep he achieved across northern states in 2014.\u0026nbspBut it\u0027s also true that the BJP\u0027s Hindu-first agenda has struggled to take root to the same extent in the southern states.Critics say such isive election rhetoric is a threat to\u0026nbspIndia\u0027s secular foundations.Communal polarisation is obviously the biggest issue for me, said Rakesh Mehar, who voted in Karnataka\u0027s capital, Bengaluru. And the growing intolerance in the country is what worries me the most.While it is being seen as a referendum on Mr Modi\u0027s first five years in office, this election is not just about what is going on with the central government.Voters in Bengaluru, once a sleepy retirement town that has been transformed into\u0026nbspIndia\u0027s technology hub, said they wanted lawmakers who would fix infrastructure problems such as traffic congestion and poor water management.We have been voting every time expecting a change but nothing has come so far. People are talking about national issues, Manjunath Munirathnappa told Reuters. But only when they fix the local issues will there be progress in the nation.\u0026nbspThe focus today will be on the southern states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, with #TNElection2019 already the top trend across India on Twitter.All of Tamil Nadu\u0027s 39 seats, and half of Karnataka\u0027s 28, will be decided today.\u0026nbspThe south is a key region\u0026nbspwhere the main opposition Congress party and its allies need to win big if they hope to have any chance of ousting Narendra\u0026nbspModi\u0027s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).If the non-BJP parties perform well in these two states, then they would still be having a chance of forming a non-BJP government at the centre, Sanjay Kumar, director of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies in Delhi, told Reuters.More than 155 million people are eligible to vote today in 97 constituencies across 13 states.\u0026nbspIt is the second of seven phases in the election, designed to spread out the logistical and security challenges of conducting a democratic exercise in a country with more than 900 million eligible voters.Please allow a moment for the live blog to load.On Wednesday, Election Commission officials are understood to have watched the unreleased Bollywood biopic of the prime minister, PM Narendra Modi, after being ordered to do so by the Supreme Court.The commission had banned the release of the film during the elections, fearing it might influence voters. After being asked to reconsider the decision, commissioners who have now watched the film will deliver their new verdict to the court either today or tomorrow.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Any blaze has destructive power. Yet the Notre Dame disaster leaves a greater sense of obliteration. Just look at the crowds of Parisians, many of them youngsters, who wept and clutched one another and sang mournful hymns as they watched Monday’s devastation.Their grief, and the awed horror of countless millions around the world who saw events unfold on TV, was not the normal reaction of onlookers rubber-necking at an accident. The loss of that old building left a deeper anguish. Why James Mates, reporting for ITV’s News At Ten that night, proved his value when he reached for an explanation.“Our time here is brief,” said Mates. “These structures — the greatest creations of mankind — are supposed to be permanent. Few can have imagined seeing one destroyed before our eyes.”These were good words. Notre Dame dates to the th and th centuries. To stand beside such an edice reminds us of our human smallness.The great cathedrals of Western Europe took centuries to build. Beside such projects, the longest human le feels butterfly-short. You run a hand over the old stones of a place like Notre Dame and you are struck by a sense of your own impermanence.You don’t have to be churchy to feel this way. There are other forces at work in our Notre Dame agony, emotions that a modern broadcaster might hesitate to mention. Notre Dame contained more than altars and crosses and pews.Its walls sheltered things far greater than the priceless artworks which burned. Notre Dame was a repository of the concepts of civilisation and nationhood and beauty and Christianity.It may be politically incorrect to say so but Monday’s fire, to many of us, felt like a metaphor for the recent conflagration of those precious moral concepts. French president Emmanuel Macron, who rushed to the scene, had this to say: “Notre Dame is our history, our literature, part of our psyche, the place of all our great events, our epidemics, our wars, our liberations, the epicentre of our lives.”Macron announced a national project to rebuild the cathedral because, “it is our profound destiny”. All this was noble and fair. But measure it against the record of the liberal political class he embodies. The Macrons and Merkels of this world — like the Blairs and Camerons and Cleggs and so many other equivocating cultural cowards — have long preached secularisation. They have diluted Christian values in our laws and public le.One recent Archbishop of Canterbury even told us it might be a good idea to have sharia law in Britain.These political leaders have imposed education systems that fail to teach youngsters to be proud of Western art and religion. They have scoffed at national pride and national flagsand lied to us about the federal element of the European Union.Out of sheer political dogma, post-war politicians bigged up modernist architecture, even though the public hated it. Much-loved vistas were destroyed and our capital cities’ skylines were wrecked when mayors approved show-off skyscrapers.We were told to be ashamed of past national historical triumphs such as the British Empire, which was allegedly racist and supremacist. Tradition was bad. Dferent was good. How come such leaders appreciate antiquity and the values represented by a great cathedral such as Notre Dame only when it has gone up in smoke One of the defining images of the Second World War was that photograph of St Paul’s Cathedral at the height of the Blitz, the dome standing proud amid Hitler’s bombs. The picture captured an idea of British defiance, of our country’s decency withstanding a Nazi dictator’s barbarism. It still makes one’s neck prickle with patriotism.What will we in future feel when we see that image of Notre Dame ablaze on Monday night  Might it come to represent the torching of Christendom in Europe It is said that the Paris fire brigade was slow out of the traps. Might that be a metaphor for a wider carelessness by politicians who have seen our culture in peril and failed to act It is no great secret that churches in France and other continental countries have been in a spiral of neglect for decades. A few years ago I visited a major church in Coutances, northern France, and found dead pigeons on the floor and broken panes in the windows.We have done better in Britain where, despite financial problems, our cathedrals and parish churches continue to be a great glory. The Church of England gets plenty of things wrong but it deserves credit for this.That Notre Dame and some of her treasures have been destroyed in Holy Week, as though roasted in the very fires of Hell, is a challenge to our already-dented morale. It seems cruel and may leave churchgoers agape as they try to identy the Almighty’s purpose.If God is working his purpose out, He has an odd way of going about it.But Easter is about renewal. Maybe that should be our pointer.Let this ghastly fire act as a spark to our resolve to relight a sense of pride in Europe’s Christian tradition.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The early stirrings of that will no doubt be seen in the European elections, when the two major parties will surely receive an almighty kicking.The lesson is clear. Pass a deal — only one of which realistically exists — do it quickly and deliver on . million votes.The consequences of failing to do so don’t bear thinking about.THE devastation of beautul Notre Dame must be a wake-up call in Westminster.For years, staff working in the Houses of Parliament have warned that the building is on the brink of disaster.

It has had a huge impact on my childhood and teenage years – right into adulthood.I was diagnosed with the chronic skin condition at just six years old. Flare-ups would often leave me with an angry rash and even bleeding wounds across my arms, legs, back and face. My lips would swell so much that I couldn’t speak and would beg to stay off school.Through my teenage years I hid how my skin bothered me and concentrated on things that made me happy like good friends and sports instead.However, any sudden stress surrounding exam time or a cold-snap of weather would have an impact on my skin.At the age of , I thought I’d found the answer through learning about allergens that might set it off and following a strict diet and exercise regime.I eliminated gluten, dairy, sweets, crisps and anything processed but I also found that tomatoes, oranges and lettuce were also foods I needed to avoid to prevent flare-ups.Exercising is known to help release endorphins that reduce stress, and raise energy levels throughout the day.I find that in addition to that, it makes you feel better about yourself and you sweat out any toxins.My skin felt better too. What I wasn’t aware of is that I’d swapped one problem for another.Instead of being controlled by eczema I was being controlled by my new regime, which had spiralled into an obsession. I’d rather skip a meal than eat the wrong things.Soon I was existing on only juices, convinced I was being healthy but I was running on empty body, mind and soul.Around five years ago, I had lost all hope and was hospitalised because of my eczema. One evening after a flare up, I felt a rush of heat rise up my body from my toes to my head.I looked into the mirror and saw that my face was swelling.I felt dizzy and the pressure in my head was unbearable. I grabbed my phone to call a friend and he drove me to AE.Once I was seen, it was clear that my inflammatory markers were off the charts.The doctors said that the swelling was due to my eczema and the open wounds coupled with a  per cent deficiency in zinc meant that my body’s immune system wasn’t working properly.I had lost all hope. I remember frantically Googling for eczema success stories only to find that none existed.Even the doctors told me that I would never recover or find a solution.When it comes to eczema, people often underestimate how healing really does start in your head and mastering the mind can have a signicant impact on reducing symptoms and regaining control.Working out why your skin is flaring up in the first place and addressing that as a long-term solution is vital.I started to change the way I reacted to things, understand the triggers and turn negative situations into something much more positive.Through years of trial and error I found that my triggers were food that was processed or unnatural, stress or a sudden change in environments, lack of sleep which led to exhaustion and unnatural skincare products or chemicals such as chlorine in swimming pools.From a self-care perspective I put a series of lestyle changes in place ditching alcohol, eating mainly plant-based foods, and banning technology in the evenings in favour of Epsom, Dead Sea and Himalayan salt baths before an early night.The availability of natural skincare products helped, I’m particularly fond of Love Lula.I also focused on things I was passionate about. I saved up to train as a health coach and natural chef, and the happiness showed in my skin.These changes were helping me to find my glow and so I made it my mission to help others who suffer.Documenting my experiences and painful journey has been dficult. It hurt to look at pictures of my skin at is very worst and write about it but sharing this with the world was what was going to make a dference.Over the years I’ve developed a holistic approach to eczema management and a toolkit to healing which I call my HOPE principles.To offer a guide to living le beyond eczema I have published a book and designed a journal which unlocks a workable way to heal by putting pen to paper and reflection techniques. I want people to know that there is hope.H – is for HomeFor example de-cluttering, getting enough sleep and creating a sanctuary in the home, as well as incorporating mindfulness into your routine every day to improve your mental well being.O – is for OptimismP – is for PurposeE – is for Eating Well, Exercise and EcotherapyI understand how eczema can affect all areas of people’s lives, leaving those with the condition feeling isolated and withdrawn.One of my biggest outlets to share my experiences with others has always been through my Instagram and YouTube channels. I am very proud to be part of an online movement which is giving skin conditions like eczema increased visibility, offering support to people who are yet to be graced with positivity.Anyone who follows me knows that I am always brutally honest about my journey. Even recently when I was flying high after launching my book, my eczema flared up again and has taken a number of months to show signs of improvement.I have shared this experience with my community to show people that I am human and you can never take your mental and physical health for granted.Knowing that what I have been through is helping other people and receiving messages and DMs from my growing warrior tribe is extremely moving. I always reply to people personally and do my very best to help answer their questions – I know how hard it can be to reach out and ask for help, after all, I have been there.Eczema has been part of my journey but it doesn’t define me.

He was expelled when Corbyn was leader for rather delightfully tweeting: “Dan Jarvis can lick my f***ing ar*e too. Posing c***.”A shame no one was on top of that detail, as I thought it would’ve added to the debate they were having about “male aggression” ruining politics.No matter, because this week we had a discussion on feminism and the open goal of Frankie Boyle asking“the biggest problem for women is the determination of some men to be objectionable”.It is, Frankie. It is.As he well knew, though, there was fat chance of any of his guests being brave or bright enough to point out there was a big problem sat right in front of them.They all live in a wilfully blind, hypocritical political universe and will ignore any personal and professional failings, no matter how obvious and odious, just so long as the person shares the same common enemy and goals as the rest of this toxic, left-wing BBC bubble.Althoughcolumnist and environmentalist George Monbiot did rather let the cat out of the bag with that end- of-show rant.“We’ve got to go straight to the heart of capitalism and overthrow it. But you said this was going to be a comedy programme, Frankie.”Oh George, how stupid and naive can you really be QVC, Katy Pullinger to Michelle Mone: “I can’t wait to see your wedding photos.” Britain’s Got Talent, David Walliams: “Sheila Simmonds, you are a very funny lady.” And Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins, Jeff Brazier: “I think I might surprise a few people with who I really am.”Not unless you’re really Kirk Douglas you won’t.CHANNEL ’s three-part series Let’s Talk About Sex is a perfect example of a good idea gone bad.For it’s one thing holding up old sex education films for well-deserved ridicule.

The inquest also heard Shante had made an attempt on her le a year before her death before being referred to Impart, a mental health crisis team at Waltham Forest NHS Trust. Dr William Travers, a consultant psychiatrist with the Impart home treatment team, met Shante seven days after her attempted suicide on July .    Dr Travers said in the court: It [the overdose] seemed to have been triggered by an experience she had performing a role in a theatre show case, she didnapost think she performed it well, and she was dwelling on it, replaying it over and over in her mind.

Astrid Duminy, the crisis team manager at North East London Hospital Trust said: I donapost know exactly what triggered Shanteaposs suicide, all I know is that Shanteaposs job situation was playing on her mind - I might be just grasping at straws. Assistant Coroner Ian Wade ruled the teenaposs death was suicide.

Dr Alan Jamieson, , plunged ,ft to the deepest point of the Indian Ocean’s Java Trench, taking two and a half hours to get there. During an eight-hour mission, they captured remarkable footage of what are believed to be entirely new species, as yet unseen by humans. The footage includes the jelly-like stalked ascidean, or sea squirt, which lives attached to the seabed. Other previously unseen species imaged included hadal snailfish.    As Chief Scientist on the Five Deeps Expedition, he reached one of the most isolated points on the planet - the deepest point of the Java Trench in the Indian Ocean, around  nautical miles south of the island of Bali. Led by US deep sea pioneer Victor Vescovo, the expedition travelled more than ,m - almost five miles - to the ocean floor in a two-man submarine. Dr Jamieson, a senior lecturer in marine ecology at Newcastle University, said: “It is not often we see something so extraordinary it leaves us speechless. Amongst many other rare and unique observations, the stalked Ascidean was a really signicant moment. We are not entirely sure what species it was, we will find out in due course.

Julie Rose has been forced to prove the legitimacy of her marriage to her Canadian husband and partner of more than a decade, Jeff. The couple met in Canada with Jeff entering the UK on an ancestry visa in , reports the Manchester Evening News. They tied the knot in , choosing to settle in Milnrow, Rochdale, to enable Julie to take care of her mother. When Jeff, , tried to renew his visa in July  his application was rejected on grounds his relationship with Julie was not genuine. The couple became locked in a battle with the Home Office, with Jeff placed on immigration bail and threatened with deportation.    Jeff and Julie have finally won their case after a judge ruled in their favour at an immigration tribunal last month. Julie describes their ordeal with the Home Office as aposa nightmareapos. Youaposre put in a situation where a complete stranger is making a decision thataposs going to affect the rest of your le, says Julie. Itaposs hard to describe the stress it has caused myself and Jeff. There is no accountability or humanity in this process. When Jeff attempted to renew his visa, he was given incorrect advice from a Home Office helpline, resulting in him being threatened with forcible removal from the UK. Jeff has UK ancestors [his paternal grandfather was born in Derbyshire], enabling him to enter the country on an ancestry visa. The couple were given conflicting advice from the Home Office about what to do, and were told to apply for Indefinite Leave to Remain under the ‘Spousal Routeapos once the ancestry visa had expired a year later. The Home Office took  months to reject the application –  months longer than its target. Julie says they have lost around £, in legal fees and visa applications as well as more than a year of Jeff’s salary. Once placed on immigration bail, Jeff was unable to work and ultimately lost his job as a key worker for vulnerable young adults.    The coupleaposs MP, Tony Lloyd, backed their case, slamming the way they had been treated in a letter to Home Office minister Caroline Nokes. The result of this has been utterly devastating for Mr. Rose and his family, Mr Lloyd wrote in the letter. After  and a half years’ dedicated service as a Support Worker, Mr. Rose’s employer was forced to terminate his employment out of fear of receiving heavy penalties from the Home Office. Mr. Rose has always worked, paid taxes, owns his own home and has always been proud of his British heritage, choosing to describe himself as English Canadian. In response, Ms Nokes apologised to the couple in a reply to Mr Lloyd. Referring to a bail notice wrongly issued to Mr Rose, Ms Nokes said: “It was not the Home Office’s intention to cause any distress in this regard and an apology was offered.” She also apologised for the delay in processing the application. Judge Andrew Davies described the advice given to Jeff on the Home Officeaposs helpline as aposdubiousapos in his final judgement. He wrote: In my judgement, it is not reasonable. It is entirely unreasonable. The Appellant has attempted to remain within the Immigration Rules. He was given dubious advice. There has been unacceptable delay in dealing with the matter. Jeff spoke of his relief now he has been granted leave to remain. Itaposs a bizarre feeling when youaposve been through something like that, he said. We hope to get things sorted out and piece together our lives again. My first priority will be to find another job because I lost my other one. To be honest, Iaposm just relieved itaposs over. A Home Office spokesperson said: “All immigration applications are considered on their inidual merits and on the basis of the evidence available, in line with the immigration rules.” "},{"url":null,"title":"eagle eyed meghan markle fans","story":"NewsEagle-eyed Meghan Markle fans think theyve spotted Baby Sussex kickingIf Baby Sussex is an active baby, it could partly explain why Meghan is often spotted rubbing her bumpShareCommentsByZahra MulroySocial Audience Editor:,  APR NewsMeghan is due in the next couple of weeks \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Like many an expectant mum, Meghan Markle has been tactile with her growing bump throughout pregnancy.

About  million people are preparing to head off on an Easter holiday, new figures suggest.  Here is a breakdown of what to expect from the weather and travel disruption over the four-day Easter holiday weekend. Good Friday The Easter heatwave will be in full swing on Good Friday, the busiest travel day, with temperatures expected to peak around -C in areas with prolonged sunshine. Temperatures of C and above are expected widely thanks to warm air from mainland Europe. The Met Office is predicting plenty of sunshine across the UK, although it could turn hazy at times and it will be cooler around the coast. Saturday  The conditions on Saturday will be the same - dry and sunny - and it will be a touch warmer around -C. It doesnapost look like it will threaten the record for the highest temperature recorded over an Easter weekend . In the north, it is expected to be C. Easter Sunday The heatwave will continue on Easter Sunday with temperatures around C in the south and C in the north. The Met Office warned: It is likely to turn cooler in the far northwest from Sunday with outbreaks of rain. Easter Monday It will be a similar story on Easter Monday, with C heat in the south and C in the north. During the day it may turn cooler and more unsettled across northern and western areas, with stronger winds and outbreaks of heavy rain.Met Office chief meteorologist Steve Willington said: With temperatures usually around -C at this time of year, itaposs certainly going to be signicantly warmer than average this Easter weekend and quite a contrast to the colder weather we have seen so far this month.Traffic jams and crowded airports  About  million people are preparing to head off on an Easter holiday, new figures suggest. Good Friday will be the busiest travel day as many people make the most of the long weekend. Research by the RAC and Inrix suggests . million car journeys for leisure trips will be made on Good Friday. This is expected to cause many major routes to be clogged, with the worst delays between am and .pm. Motorists are being urged to set off early or delay travel until Saturday to avoid the worst jams. The Extinction Rebellion protests also threaten to disrupt travel. A survey of , people by tourist board VisitEngland indicates that . million have planned an overnight trip in the UK this weekend. This is up from . million last year and is the most since the annual survey was launched in . Among the attractions holding special events this weekend are Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire Goodrich Castle, Herefordshire Dreamland Margate, Kent and Chatsworth House, Derbyshire. Motorways to avoid These are the motorways to avoid,possible. The areas most likely to see jams include: - M westbound from Leeds to Manchester between Junctions  and - M northbound from Preston to Lancaster between Junctions  and - M anticlockwise from Orpington through the Dartford Tunnel between Junctions  and Highways England said it will remove more than  miles of roadworks in time for the weekend, meaning  per cent of motorways and major A-roads in England will be clear of cones. Motorists face paying the highest petrol prices for the Easter getaway in five years. The average price of a tank of petrol has soared by more than £. according to the AA. Strikes could ruin trips to Spain  Travel trade association Abta expects . million British holidaymakers to head overseas this weekend, with strong demand reported for destinations including Spain, Turkey and Egypt. Airports, ferry terminals and the Channel Tunnel will be extremely busy. Abta chief executive Mark Tanzer said: Easter is always one of the most popular times of year for travel and over the long weekend millions of holidaymakers will be taking either an overseas or a domestic break. As always on a busy bank holiday, leave plenty of time to get to your departure port and check for engineering work and line closuresusing public transport. In Spain, Air Nostrum pilots are threatening to go on strike on Easter Monday, and airport ground staff could walk off the job at AENA airports, including Madridaposs Barajas and Barcelonaaposs El Prat on Easter Sunday. Rail passengers face disruption Rail passengers also face disruption as Network Rail carries out engineering work. As many as  engineering projects are being carried out on the countryaposs rail network. London Euston, the fth busiest station in the UK, will be closed between Good Friday and Easter Monday. There will also be no trains to or from London Fenchurch Street, an amended service between Preston and Glasgow Central, and some lines closed through Wimbledon. South Western Railway services are also amended. Network Rail said fewer passenger use trains during bank holidays compared with working days but admitted there is never an ideal time to shut the railway for our must-do work. Deadly pollen bomb  Asthma and hay fever sufferers have been warned to stay indoors as a deadly pollen bomb hits the UK this week while temperatures soar. Pollen levels are dangerously high in parts of the UK, putting more than three million asthma sufferers at risk of a potentially le-threatening attack.For about  million hay fever sufferers, the bank holidays could be ruined by symptoms such as sneezing, coughing, runny or blocked noses, or headaches .Sonia Munde, Head of Services at Asthma UK, told : “A deadly pollen bomb is due to hit this week, putting people with asthma at risk of a potentially le-threatening asthma attack. Around .million people with asthma are affected pollen, which can cause symptoms such as wheezing, a tight chest or coughing. “Trees have been releasing their pollen for several weeks, but the warm spring weather is going to make these pollen levels spike. If you’re already getting symptoms, it’s not too late to help yourself stay well.

Electrician and photographer Gareth Owen made the journey earlier this month through darkness inside the disused mine, which closed in the s and is around ft beneath Ceredigion, Wales. He was stunned at the sight of the pile of vehicles stacked upon each other above the still blue water with a Ford Cortina balanced on the top. The waterfall-like formation can be seen lit up by a beam of light. Despite the surprising beauty of the images, Gareth, , was also shocked by the stash in the aposunrecognisable rubbish tipapos.  He claimed it was a bittersweet sight that reminded him of the impact rubbish had on the natural environment. Gareth, who is from Llanberis in North Wales, said: Once your eyes adjust to the sudden beam of light you realise the sheer scale of the place. There are hundreds of cars on top of each other. They are mostly unrecognisable by now but then front and center of the pile is a Ford Cortina - it was the only real colour on the pile. I guess being so used to photographing the natural landscapes and their beauty, photographing this spot was bittersweet for me. As eye-catching as it is, at the end of the day it is a rubbish tip from a time when the environment was not in the forefront of our minds.  But it is also a great reminder of how far we have come as a country to doing what we can to protect nature from now into the future.He added: The reaction to the photo itself has been immensely positive. But the subject matter has had a mixed response with some people not quite happy about the fact these cars were dumped underground and others seeing beauty in the carnage. I have done a number of underground explorations including natural caverns to old mines.  I really enjoy exploring the unknown beneath our feet, so having seen an image online I went on a hunt for the aposCavern of the Lost Soulsapos, as it is known. The pleasures I get from exploring underground are amazing and itaposs amazing to think what is right under our feet.

She added: I never thought I’d be saying this but recovery is well and truly possible and I’m the evidence to prove that as are many other people. We should all enjoy food as it keeps us alive and fuels our bodies and also because it tastes hella good. We shouldn’t beat ourselves upwe are a few calories over our intake like how I used to. Now I don’t even have an intake, or count my calories. I live my le the way I want to and not how my anorexic self wants it. Keep fighting your demons like I am mine. We’re all in this together.

Jackie and Tom Luxon are raising awareness of the Road Traffic Act  and asking MPs to amend legislation to recognise unborn babies over  weeks as a person in their own right. This would enable charges to be brought when an unborn child is seriously injured or killed in a road traffic collision. The Luxons lost their unborn child at  weeks after a motorist swerved into the wrong lane on the B in Somerset, colliding with Jackieaposs vehicle and lting it into the air, Somerset Live reports. Jackie was freed from the wreckage and rushed to hospital with serious injuries. Sadly, her unborn child had no heartbeat and was later pronounced dead.    In a statement after the incident, Jackie said: My heart was torn to pieces when we were informed that my baby girl no longer showed signs of le. Itaposs heartbreaking that no prosecution can be brought for the loss of her le...we hope that consideration is made for changes to this law going forward. It was a day that tore our lives apart. The driver of the vehicle which collided with Jackieaposs Seat Ibiza pleaded guilty to two counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving and another count of dangerous driving. He was given a prison sentence. However, the Luxons, of Axbridge, Somerset, say his punishment was not justice for the death of their unborn baby girl, Grace.    Currently, the Road Traffic Act  does not recognise an unborn child in any waythey are injured, seriously injured or killed in a road traffic collision. Therefore, charges could not be brought as a direct result of her death. Yet the bereaved parents say she was fully recognised as a person in other aspects of the law. After Graceaposs death, we had to legally register her as a person and then give her a funeral, either bury her or cremate her, Tom told Somerset Live. And then, on the other side of that,the hospital had focused on Graceaposs le instead of Jackieaposs, orshe had been born even for a second, then she would still be identied as a person.  The couple are rallying road safety charities and local MPs for support of the proposed change, which they are calling Graceaposs Law. Wells MP James Heappey has already vowed to back the familyaposs campaign. He said: I’ve been aware of this tragic case for a number of months and have already raised the matter with the Secretary of State for Transport, who in turn has undertaken to discuss the matter with the Lord Chancellor.  It appears that there is an anomaly in the law wherean unborn child is killed in some circumstances, it is punished dferently to others clearly this cannot be right.  I am intending to raise this important issue further but early conversations suggest that this is something that the Government will want to look at. In the meantime, the family says they will continue to share their story in the hope that it will encourage others to come forward with support. Tom said: Maybe other parents this has happened to might turn around and see it and think, aposMaybe I didnapost have the courage to do this at that particular time, but definitely Iaposd like to jump on the back of this and try and promote changeapos. Itaposs only when something truly terrible happens that you think, aposActually, now Iaposve got a chance to change thatapos. Jackie added: I would hate for someone to be in the same position as us... but Iaposd like to think someone  in the future will get a lot more justice than we did.

Boil the water, throw those shapes in the pan, cook for about  minutes then add some sauce. Simple. But according to a top Italian pasta maker there are a few big mistakes lots of us when we make the carby delight. Giovanni Rana has been cooking pasta since the s, and has teamed up with his daughter-in-law Antonella Rana to share their secrets. The first is about how much sauce you add to the pasta.    While most of us will add a whole jar of sauce or make a big portion of it, apparently we should be using much less. Antonella says this can be a big giveaway when it comes to spotting an inexperienced chef.She told the Mail Online : When you have great fresh filled pasta, the flavour is inside. You just need to add a drizzle of extra virgin olive oil and a sprinkle of Parmigiana Reggiano. If you want to enhance the flavour more then use the sauce, but only in a small spoon.When youaposre speaking about fresh pasta tortellini, the filling has its own taste and power, as Italians we try not to cover it too much with the sauce.    In general, the most traditional way to eat fresh filled pasta is to be very respectful of the proportions. The queen is the pasta and the sauce is the tool. Antonella also says that there is a common misconception about al dente pasta.

The predator is “lame, exhausted and confused” but has climbed on its hind legs to peer into windows in a search for food or assistance, leaving some locals scared on the Kamchatka Peninsula in the extreme east of Siberia.Residents have left fish for the bear and police officers in the remote settlement - population , - are watching over the animal as officials seek to airlt it above the Arctic Circle.   The young male, now named Umka after a polar bear cartoon character, got stuck on the floe off the coast of Chukotka, Russia’s most easterly region, and floated far to the south away from its natural habitat, travelling a distance at least as great as London to Edinburgh. The wild animal seems to have a wounded front paw and is “disorientated” and weak after its odyssey. The “forlorn” bear is scavenging for food in the bleak village. Svetlana Gubareva, deputy head of the district, said: “At first, the animal behaved quite actively.  “Locals filmed it on video, photographed it, and yesterday - fed it with fish, though he did not eat much. “The bear looks drained and weak. “For some reason he does not catch fish and seals, which we have in good supply.” Locals came out to gawp but also want to help.     Yet they are rightly frightened to approach too close, reported The Siberian Times.A resident on one video says: “He is starving. Poor poor bear, so hungry. If this wasnapost Russia but America, they would have found a way to send him to sleep and move him to an animal enclosure.” But then a voice is heard getting frightened as the bear approaches. “Weaposve got to go, we are leaving,” says the woman.  “Please can we go now, we wonapost have enough time to escape, please, please can we go.” Environmentalists said the bear could have lost its sense of direction while drting on the ice floe. Vladimir Chuprov of Greenpeace told the : “Due to climate change, the Arctic is getting warmer, hunting environment gets smaller and less convenient. The ice is receding, and polar bears look for new ways to survive. And the easiest way is coming to people.” Officials in Kamchatka have called in the Russian Emergencies Ministry in a bid to rescue Umka.  “He lies near the bay on the ice - close to our police station,” said Gubareva. “The police are watching him so that no one will approach him. Regional wildle had Vladimir Gordienko said that bears getting carried away by floes is a rare event. “Bears get here on the ice floes washed this way,” he said. “As a rule, they cannot go back to Chukotka. In Kamchatka, the feed base does not suit them.  “So, most likely, such guests will die.” However, regional governor Vladimir Ilyukhin is seeking to organise a rescue for Umka. “A special cage is already being manufactured inPetropavlovsk-Kamchatsky for transporting the animal, said Kamchatka official Sergey Khabarov. “On arrival in Tilichiki, specialists will temporarily put the bear to sleep so he can cope with the flight.” An assessment will also be madethe bear needs medical attention for its paw. The conservation status for the polar bear is listed as vulnerable with a decreasing population amid retreating ice cover in its habitat. The animal is found across the Arctic in Russia, Norway, Greenland, Canada and the US. Its home range can be enormous depending on the quality of sea ice and the availability of seals, which they eat for their high fat content. A polar bear can eat lbs of blubber in a single meal. Earlier this year, Russian officials declared a state of emergency in parts of the Novaya Zemlya archipelago after a mass invasion of polar bears in human settlements. The bears were pictured wandering through residential and government buildings.

Tracks Sober On Sunday, Three Sheets to the Wind and No Disguise were based on me beginning to accept that I couldn’t hide that I was struggling.“Sinners is the saddest song I’ve ever written. That felt like I’d given myself closure from the last six months. It’s a departure but still familiar.”After embarking on the tour on Friday, with doors opening at .pm, the band are heading across Scotland and south of the border.David added: “We have three Scottish dates – Dundee, Edinburgh and Paisley – then we’re off to Blackburn, Nottingham, Bristol, Liverpool and Gateshead.“The last date is Scotland Calling at the O Academy in Glasgow.“I could only have dreamed of playing the O Academy  years ago when I first picked up a guitar so we honestly can’t wait for that.”When it comes to the Dundee music scene, David believes that it has always catered for all tastes.“It’s always been great. It has something for everyone,” he said.“People who complain about it being awful are usually the ones who don’t go to shows.“I don’t get to as many as I’d like but I try to get to as many as I can. It’s top notch.”And following their tour, what’s next for Delinquents “Trying not to die and world domination,” said David."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2019/04/daa89690-b428-4819-b12a-82f9d166c7c7-240x180.jpg

for a sixth successive European qualication is all that is left from a campaign that at times had promised so much but will yet again deliver no silverware.The Scottish Cup bid crashed at Hampden in a - defeat to holders Celtic where four Dons, including McInnes and assistant manager Tony Docherty, were sent off.Retaining the league runners-up spot is effectively beyond the Reds with Rangers holding a commanding eight-point lead and superior goal dference with five games left.When the season finishes, McInnes faces a summer of rebuilding with a number of first-team players set to exit the club.As many as  players could call time on their Pittodrie careers following the final match of the campaign at Hibs on Sunday May .Although they will not be at the club to experience the benefits of Continental action, McInnes has challenged those set to leave to deliver one final push for Europe.He said: “There will be a lot of players leaving at the end of the season.“There might be some wanting to leave and there might be some players going back to their parent clubs.“But it is important that all at the club, especially the players, myself and the staff, show that enthusiasm after that disappointment .“I have reminded all the players that we have five games left and it is important that we have a full responsibility now of achieving our goal of getting that European football and getting that third spot.“We have work to do.”Six players have contracts set to expire at the end of the season with a further five on loan set toto their parent clubs.The Pittodrie contracts for Scotland internationals Graeme Shinnie and Gary Mackay-Steven are both set to end. McInnes wants to retain both and captain Shinnie has been offered an attractive long-term deal.However, both are coveted by other teams. Shinnie travelled to Derby County last week for talks with manager Frank Lampard and to be shown around Pride Park.League One leaders Luton Town as well as second tier English sides Wigan Athletic and Bristol City are interested in Shinnie.Rangers were reportedly interested, but If the Dons skipper, as appears likely, is to leave it will be for a move down to England.Winger Mackay-Steven is also a target for MLS side New York City, who made an official approach to the Dons in January for permission to speak to the -year-old.Long-serving defender Andy Considine is also out of contract this summer but has triggered a clause for a one-year extension due to the amount of games played. A new deal, however, has yet to be announced.Keeper Tomas Cerny is also out of contract as is defender Mark Reynolds, who has already signed a pre-contract with Dundee United – the club he is on loan at.Greg Halford, an emergency short-term signing due to a defensive crisis in February and yet to play, will also be out of contract.Five loanees are set to leave – Greg Stewart , James Wilson , Dom Ball , Max Loweand Tommie Hoban . The deals for Stewart, Wilson, Ball and Hoban at their parent clubs all expire at the end of the season.McInnes has entered talks with Ball regarding a permanent move and is also keen on securing the long-term future of Stewart. However, Rangers look set to land the attacker for next season.Defender Hoban is currently out injured for the next six months having undergone surgery on cruciate ligament damage sustained playing for the Dons in late February.Hoban ed to his parent club and, although his contract will run out, the Premier League club will oversee his rehabilitation.McInnes has previously stated he would be open to the possibility of securing Hoban on a permanent dealthat option opens up when he s to fitness,Hoban travelled up to Glasgow for the Scottish Cup semi-final defeat to Celtic and sat alongside the injured Dons players just behind the dugout at Hampden.That defeat underlined the importance of captain Shinnie, who was suspended for the semi-final.McInnnes will not give up hope of Shinnie committing his future to the Dons, but admits they are “up against it”.He said: “I suppose there is a chance, but we are up against it with that one I think.”Derby County boss Frank Lampard wants to bring Shinnie to Pride Park, but admitted a deal has not been agreed yet.Shinnie held talks with the Rams’ boss last week before ing to the Dons camp for the Scottish Cup build-up.McInnes will hold further talks with Shinnie in the bid to convince him to stay – or gain clarication on his future.The Dons boss said: “There is nothing new on it .“Shinnie was at the game, he was at the hotel with the team, but we haven’t actually spoke to him about his own situation.“We plan to do so.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/04/SNS-18919054-Celtic-v-Aberdeen.jpg ","title":"mcinnes wants more bravery on the ball from his dons team","story":"Manager Derek McInnes admits Aberdeen were too tame in the Scottish Cup semi-final and lacking in bravery on the ball.The Dons crashed - to defending champions Celtic at Hampden.McInnes was one of four Dons sent off in the semi with No. Tony Docherty, Dom Ball and Lewis Ferguson also dismissed.The build up was disrupted by a season ending ankle ligament injury to winger Niall McGinn sustained in training on the day before the semi-final.McGinn’s absence added to an injury list including Shaleum Logan , Gary Mackay-Stevenand Tommie Hoban .Captain Graeme Shinnie was also suspended for the semi having exceeded the points threshold for bookings.McInnes was also frustrated at the dismissal of on-loan Rotherham defender Ball for a second yellow card when the game was -.Despite all the set-backs, however, he reckons the Dons were ultimately culpable for their own downfall at Hamdpen.He said: “While we were dealt a lot of blows in the build-up, in terms of injuries, but still felt we could go to Hampden and get the result we were after.“We had a lot of expectations on ourselves.“We knew we were playing the best team in the country and it was the biggest step we were asking the players to make to get to the final.“And it is a huge disappointment for us that we weren’t able to do that.“On the game itself we were tame and a bit safe with everything that we were trying to do.“For  minutes that’s maybe understandable given we had so many younger ones in the team.“But I was looking for more bravery on the ball and more bravery and responsibility against the ball.“I actually thought we’d weathered the early storm for ten minutes prior to Dom Ball’s sending off.”Teenage midfielder Ferguson will miss Saturday’s trip to Kilmarnock as he serves out an immediate one-game suspension for violent conduct.He will also miss the first Scottish Cup tie of next season following the straight red for a reckless two-footed lunge on Celtic’s Tom Rogic.Ball will be available to face Kilmarnock but will be banned for the first Scottish Cup tie of next season. His loan deal at Pittodrie expires at the end of the campaign, but McInnes has opened talks about securing the defender-midfielder on a permanent deal.McInnes insists Ball’s dismissal – for an aerial collision which left Celtic’s Ryan Christie needing facial surgery – was harsh and a turning point at Hampden.He said: “We had worked our way into the game and were doing away okay.“But the sending off then changed the game.“The first booking was for stopping a promising attack, butI’m right Jonny Hayes kicked the ball out the park.“There’s no doubting it was a foul, but I didn’t think it was a yellow card. In the second incident I didn’t see Dom leading with his arm or elbow.“We feel frustration in that the two incidents — an accidental collision and Dom’s first tackle on Jonny — has allowed Dom to be sent off in such a high-profile game.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/04/5cb074a2914bc2.84707839.jpg ","title":"adopt a pet pepper monkey and shadow are looking for a new home can you help","story":"Are you looking to get a new pet  Why not adopt one of these adorable pets from Mrs Murray’s Cat and Dog Home.This timid girl takes time to get to know and trust new people.But Pepper loves treats and this will help a new owner bring her out her shell and build up some trust as she has a sweet nature just waiting to get out.She will need a quiet home with an owner who has the time and patience to help her find her confidence.

Aberdeen City Council will have the ability to conduct further reports into the problem with a view to finding solutions.However, officers will have no power to tackle problems such as antisocial behaviour.A report to the committee said: “Strategic noise maps were created by acoustic consultants on behalf of the Scottish Government using noise prediction modelling software.“A noise map is rather like a weather map for noise but it shows areas that are relatively louder or quieter by contours joining points having the same level of noise.“Modelling criteria include types of traffic, traffic volume and speed as well as environmental features such as buildings and types of ground.”The area around Westfield Park has been earmarked as a proposed quiet area – one which could benefit for protection from noise pollution.New rules have already been introduced to protect existing live music venues from noise complaints by people moving in close to them.Hazlehead, Queen’s Cross and Countesswells councillor Martin Greig said: “It is welcome to see the problem of noise being addressed.“However, there is little that can be done to tackle this nuisance.“It helps to identy the worst areas but the exercise is of limited use when there is no extra action that can be taken to make the environment more peaceful.”Kingswells, Sheddocksley and Summerhill councillor David Cameron added: “My initial thought is ‘how far does this go ’.“I have been working around environmental health since the s and noise has always been one of the most complained-about areas.“The report will go to the Scottish Government to comply with the legislation, but there are no enforcement powers associated with it.“I certainly think it is a good idea in

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks.

Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14393422.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_emp_ayp_090419quivox_01JPG.jpg","title":"celebrate holy week ayrs oldest","story":"NewsCelebrate Holy Week at Ayrs oldest churchThought to be the oldest church in the town, St Quivox Parish, Auchincruive, is rich in heritage and history.ShareByAbi Smillie:,  APR NewsSt Quivox Parish Church, Auchincruive, Ayr.\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHoly Week is celebrated by millions across the globe each year. And what better way to celebrate the religious holiday this year by visiting Ayr’s oldest church. Thought to be the oldest church in the town, St Quivox Parish, Auchincruive, is rich in heritage and history. Visible from the A, the ‘country church’ was originally a rural Parish church dating back to the late th   early th centuries. It has been a living, working church without interruption ever since. The Church of Scotland branch has seen many changes over the years. In , the church on the Auchincruive site was originally called Sanchar-in-Kyle and was described as a rectory. In , it was mentioned in connection with the founding of the Gilbertine Priory of St Mary at Dalmulin within the Parish and in  came under the ownership of Paisley Abbey when the monks left Dalmulin. At this time it was a Roman Catholic Church and after the Reformation in , and the movement away from Rome, the church became used for the Protestant form of worship.  In , a major restoration was carried out to the original long church with the addition of a T-shaped wing. A relic wooden ladle used for the collection and communion cups, said to have been presented in , are still in use today. The last structural change to the church was seen in the early th century when the Whitletts and Craigie Galleries were added above each end of the original long church. The outside gallery stairs, still in existence, speak of an older time when the landed gentry did not mix with the people seated in the body of the kirk. And it’s hard to believe that back in those days there was very much a ide among the congregation between rich and poor. But that’s certainly not the case now. Church member and Convener for Fundraising and Events, Margaret McConnell said: “It’s always been quite a poor church. “The members and residents were either miners or worked on the fields. “Of course, there were quite a lot of farmers in the area but they were the wealthy ones.”  Speaking of the upper central gallery, Interim Moderator Rev Ken Yorke said: “That’s where the lords and ladies sat. “There was a fireplace up there and the story goes that when the local gentry was sitting there,he didn’t like what the minister was saying, he’d get up from his seat and go over to the fire and sit and warm himself.” Session Clerk David McMahon joked: “We don’t have any original members left anymore.” Margaret has a long standing relationship with the St Quivox, Auchincruive. She originally went to the church as a young girl then lived overseas for several years. But she admits finding her aunt Elizabeth’s grave in the church’s graveyard brought her “back to her roots”. She said: “Faith is a journey. “I joined the church  years ago. “My family were local residents and granny came to the church every Sunday.  “They were from Whitletts and used to walk along the Low Road, but now that’s the bypass.” Her family sat in one of the galleries, to the left of the minister. She later married in the church in . And it seems ministry runs in the family for Rev Ken too, whose father was a minister at Prestwick South for  years. Rev Ken said: “It’s not all about the minister though– we have faithful people who help out. It’s a team effort. “People nowadays, their attention span doesn’t last for too long so I try to speak for a short time but get all the important parts across. “There comes a time more than ever where Christian people and communities need to come together– still do their own thing– but come together to further God’s work.” David added: “A lot of our work is trying to involve the community. “It’s about getting in touch with the people.” St Quivox Auchincruive will host Holy Week and looks forward to welcoming those who wish to celebrate the holiday.  Margaret said: “Hosting the Holy Week Services at Ayr, St Quivox Parish Church, Auchincruive provides a great opportunity for us to let everyone in the community know that the beautul old church is still open to all and welcomes everyone. “We would also like to extol the historical importance and the heritage of Ayr, St Quivox Parish Church, as two of its former ministers were Moderators of the General Assembly – one of whom, Rev Archibald H Charteris, began ‘Le and Work’ magazine and also founded the Women’s Guild.” And although very proud of their beautul and historically rich place of worship, the trio agreed “the church is the people – not the building”.

But no action was taken due to a blunder.   The council admitted the mistake after the Ayrshire Local Democracy Service learned of the incident.   Laura McEwan who campaigned to keep the library open said the councilaposs paperwork error was of great disappointment to residents.   She said: Once again South Ayrshire Council make disastrous financial errors which come at great cost to our local community. After much campaigning, Coylton like so many other villages lost its library services and the building stood empty for many months.   She said the £, rent could have went to other vital community services and blasted council cuts at the Coylton Gala.   The mother-of two added: How can they justy raising the council rates while this continuous waste of money is allowed to proceed unchecked    A council spokesman said: “The council’s lease at  Main Street Coylton was terminated in August , annual payments of £, were made up to this point in line with the lease agreement. The lease was not terminated earlier due to an administrative error.”   The council shut the Coylton hub  in Spring  along with two other libraries in Dailly and Dundonald to save a projected £, that year.   Coylton villagers waved placards as workers turned up to strip the shelves of books during a tense protest soon.  At the time council head of leisure Jill Cronin said the closure of the Coylton hub was “necessary” to “help the council balance its budget.” She added: We know local people are disappointed about the decision to close the library and we do sympathise.”  The Local Democracy Reporting Service was unable to reach the owner of the library building for comment.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsDundonald"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14385183.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_asr_ayp_150419blaze2.jpg","title":"how helicopters used tons loch","story":"NewsHow helicopters used tons of loch water to battle Ayrshire wildfireThe terrying blaze engulfed large swathes of moor on Saturday night.ShareByStephen Houston:,  APR Updated:,  APR Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.dailyrecord video video-helicopters-fight-fire-loch-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,swipeNavigation:true\"\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTwo helicopters hauling tons of loch water stopped a devastating wildfire from being catastrophic. People in isolated properties were on standby to run for their lives as the fierce blaze engulfed hillsides. Residents and anglers had packed up valuables and were prepared to evacuate at a moment’s notice overnight on Saturday. A major power line was also in danger of being engulfed before the helicopters doused the surrounding grass. The scale and speed of the fire - swept on by mph winds and tinderbox grass and heather - shocked rescuers. People as far away as Maybole had to close their windows as the smoke blew in. One resident said: “It was really, really scary. I have never experienced anything like it. The fire was everywhere and we were ready to leave.” And forest steward Archie McNeillie revealed: “If we did not have the helicopters I hate to think what have happened.” Ten square miles of moor, from the head of Loch Doon to the upper banks of Ayrshire’s water supply Loch Bradan, was destroyed.    Fortunately the nest site of the Loch Doon ospreys was nowhere near the flames. The main forest drive between Loch Doon and the Falls of Stinchar is credited with halting the fire’s spread south. At the one point it jumped the drive but the flames were beaten by the Carrick Lane river. Dead grass and several weeks of dry weather gave vast amounts of fuel to the fire. There is no grazing or controlled burning, which would have prevented spread, in the area. Flames came within yards of destroying the play park which overlooks Loch Riecawr. They wiped out a lecking spot for black grouse and could have claimed the lives of young birds, rabbits and deer. Fortunately only a small percentage of the valuable timber crop was damaged. Several fishing lodges were at risk of being in the path of the flames.  Forestrymen directed aircraft to dump the water, lted from Loch Skelloch, to protect these and other rural buildings. Archie McNeillie, area warden for Forestry and Land Scotland, was among nine staff called out to help at first light on Sunday. A staffer from Dalmellington was first to get called out to investigate with fire and police on Saturday night. But he said: “It was clear from the start this was bigger than anything we could handle. “The wind was so strong and we could not control it manually. That’s when we got the copters in. “The area is huge,  square kilometres.”  Archie, who starred in the BBC series The Forest with his sidekick John ‘Cool’ Coughtrie, said  per cent of the damage was open moorland. He said: “There are some trees damaged by the fire. “The fire was funnelling up the river from Loch Doon to Ballochbeaties and came into a pinch-point. We just couldn’t stop it. “The two choppers came up in the nick of time to stall it. Had they not it would have gone into the Tairlaw Plantation.” Earlier overground and underground power lines at the Loch Finlas side were under threat and the helicopters had to contain that first. As late as lunchtime on Monday there were still wisps of smoke rising but there was no fuel to make it spread. An incident command centre was switched from Dalmellington on Saturday to the foot of the road to Loch Bradan treatment works on Sunday. Wild campers near a car park at the top of Loch Doon are being hunted. Police will only officially say they are investigating but the blame is being pinned on three young men seen with a car next to a well-known trouble spot. A police spokesman said: “We are working with Scottish Fire and Rescue to establish the cause of the fire.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish water insists ayrshire drinking","story":"NewsScottish Water insists Ayrshire drinking supply is safe following concerns over taste and odourBosses at Scottish Water say the supply throughout Ayrshire is still safe to drink.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  APR NewsScottish Water has ruled out health concerns \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailAyrshireaposs drinking water IS safe to consume, officials at Scottish Water insisted today.

portion of the Tweedbank masterplan is ldquounviable and undeliverable and that ldquoit is quite clear that what is proposed is over-development of the site.The damning report, commissioned by Middlemede Properties Ltd, who own the Upper Pavilion fishing beat adjacent to the proposed Lowood development, was presented to SBC chiefs months before the council purchased the land for pound. million in December .Once costs of borrowing and other fees have been factored in, the purchase will cost SBC around pound million and forms parts of its wider plan to address a regional housing shortfall of some  units.The Lowood site has been earmarked for around  properties, however the JLL report suggests that the development is unlikely to yield any financial gain.The report claims: ldquoOur conclusion is that there would be insufficient revenue to generate either a developerrsquos profit or a positive land value.In addition to questioning the economic viability of the development, the JLL report raises concerns that ldquothe level of development and infrastructure proposed would seriously harm the environment and the River Tweed interests from a physical and

We learnt that smallpox dates back to before , BC and came from the Middle East, that Pharaoh Rameses V died in , BC of smallpox. Isabel mentioned lots of other people well-known to history who suffered from smallpox or died of it, including Saint Nicasius, Bishop of Rheims, who, though he was decapitated by the invading Vandals in  AD, in the cathedral he founded, picked up his head and walked to the altar, reciting a psalm. He is the patron saint of smallpox victims.It was called smallpox in the th century to dferentiate it from syphilis, which at that time was known as the great pox. It is a crowd disease that passed by inhalation, though can stay active on clothes, blankets and other objects. So the North American Indian tribes, the Aztecs and the Incas were devastated by smallpox, and the native tribes in Canada were infected by missionaries and priests possibly through donations of bedding or clothes. Itrsquos clear that smallpox was a major disease in Europe from at least the th century, killing at least , people each year and leaving visible evidence of the disease on the faces of millions of others. Smallpox seems to have been taken as inevitable right up until the mid-th century in Britain and only a few lucky iniduals came through it, unspoilt. The Chinese had a defence against it, more than , years ago, by blowing powdered smallpox scabs up the noses of healthy people ndash a form of inoculation. Though reports of this practice reached London in , it wasnrsquot accepted by the medical profession and it was almost  years before Edward Jenner demonstrated the effectiveness of using cowpox to protect people from smallpox.Wikipedia lists six th century acts about vaccination, though itrsquos not clear whether they all affected Scotland: in , making it available free of charge in , making it compulsory for every healthy child the ,  and  acts extending the requirement for children to be compulsorily vaccinated the  act while guaranteeing the right of parents to choose whether to have their baby vaccinated, effectively made it very dficult to avoid. Smallpox was declared to be globally eradicated in . Children are no longer vaccinated so they are potentially at risk,it comes back.

Irsquom not yet really old, as Irsquom still in my s, but relative to how young I used to be, Irsquom old by any measure I used in my days of youth.And there seem few benefits in getting older.As one friend recently told me, ldquoIf, at our age, you donrsquot have a pain or ache somewhere, then yoursquore probably deid.But I think there is a tipping point in all this getting old process, whereby you stop resisting the idea, and not only accept it, but embrace it. I think I have reached that point.My age has become a kind of achievement given my lestyle, and I have a deep recognition that every day is something to savour, even when, as is the case as I now write, the weather outside is cold, wet and just miserable.And storytelling is a profession in which getting older is not seen as a disadvantage, because oldness in a storyteller can add a bit more authenticity.But my storytelling profession also highlights my disconnection to what people call progress. Increasingly in my work with children, I am being made aware of the gap between what is going on in technological developments and my knowledge of it.Often in accounts of daily le, things are mentioned by children and I have absolutely no idea what they are. Usually they are new computer games or computer technology.These games are so much part of so many childrenrsquos lives that when I ask what they are they find it incredible that I have no knowledge of them.One of them responded cheekily, but in an affectionate manner, ldquoTim do you live in a cave In a sense I suppose I do. I am lucky to have a young family as well as a grown up one, and that keeps me young at heart. But so far I have managed to resist the computer game thing, although I know how addictive it can be because I recently I tried a game once in a friendrsquos house.I felt a bit like Frodo Baggins when he put on the ring. Something took over my soul and for a moment I was being taken over by an uncontrollable desire. I didnrsquot actually say the words ldquomy precious screen when I was forced to leave, but that is how I felt.In one way, my lack of experience with this kind of technology makes me feel old and disconnected from the modern world but, on the other hand, it makes me feel relieved and even privileged that I grew up in an age when such toxic distractions from living le were simply not available.I remember climbing trees, mucking about at the beach, playing in the garden till it got dark, making dens, cycling on an old bike that had been thrown away, going round for pals basically being almost constantly outside and usually dirty when I finally came home. No wonder children assume there was no electricity in the days of my youth, because when I describe it, there is an absence of devices.I did, of course, watch TV, but programmes were limited, no morning TV for example, and childrenrsquos TV was over by teatime. The outdoors was ldquomy precious and being bored was a motivation to make a game with pals not switch on a screen.Only now, looking back, do I realise just how much a privilege it was to have a childhood free of this screen addiction. It simply wasnrsquot an option so there was no sense of loss or missing out.But now with a young family I wonder how much longer I can hold out.After a trip to North Berwick the other day I was asked by my youngest daughter, ldquoWhat are those things on the seat  as she peered into a car parked next to ours at a supermarket car park.They were the frame holdersfor ipads, so the children can watch films or play games while in the car. I realised my daughter had no idea that such a thing was possible!I explained how it was much better to sing songs, tell stories, play word games and look out the window and play ldquoI spy. She nodded her head, but Irsquom not sure she was convinced.I know Irsquom coming across as an old self righteous dinosaur. I do realise, of course, that the ldquogood old days were not all good.I also understand that kids, indeed le itself, can be hard work, and all this new technology can help make our lives easier. It can help us keep us entertained and connected in a dferent way, and make information easier to get.But even still, when children look at me in horror when I explain the absence of technology in my childhood and they ask me, ldquobut what did you do, I feel a sense of sadness that we have allowed the giants of IT multinationals to steal the imaginations, and the precious childhood time, of our children and future generations.In that sense I think storytellers are needed perhaps more than ever. I remain happy living in my ldquocave. And when it is finally time for my own lights to go out, I hope I will have left a trail of stories and experiences.In the end, surely, that legacy is worth more than a thousand computer games played."},{"url":null,"title":"ambitious-plans-revealed-for-the-bell","story":"Kurt Edwards and Laura McSweeney will step behind the bar at The Bell next month, with plans for a fresh outlook and a name change.Mr Edwards and Miss McSweeney are behind Eats on the Green, which handles catering at Haddington Golf Club, with Graeme Flick set to become head chef at the pub, which was previously The Railway Hotel.Thirty-eight-year-old Mr Edwards said: ldquoWe have got children and we found there was a need for a family pub in East Lothian.ldquoWe had been going to The Pine Marten in Dunbar but there was nowhere for us take the children.ldquoI spoke to Greene Kingand we came up with the idea to put in a play area upstairs and they were all for it.The trio will officially be handed the keys on April  and will put in a new till system and run the business until the end of the month.Then, the final bell will toll for The Bell, with a new name of The Green when the business reopens.Mr Edwards said there would be a similar outlook at the Court Street business as to their business at the golf club, with an emphasis on ldquoworking with local suppliers, everything made in house and tasty food.He added: ldquoWe are going to lose the big screen television upstairs.ldquoIt was just not working and we are going to get a couple of screens downstairs.ldquoUpstairs will be more of a family environment and we are going to change the bar and add a coffee machine.ldquoThere will be cakes and sweet stuff, plus alcohol.ldquoDownstairs will be more of a pub and we will have a food offering sothere is a game on you can get a pint and a meal during the game.A spokeswoman for Greene King wished the new parties well.She said: ldquoWersquore thrilled that Kurt and Laura have agreed to take on The Bell and we wish them all the best with their new venture.ldquoWe made a signicant investment in this pub in recent years and wersquove spent time recruiting the right partners who we believe can take the pub forward and continue to ensure its success at the heart of Haddington.Haddington and Lammermuir ward member Councillor Tom Trotter also wished those involved the best of luck.He said: ldquoYou go further down the street and see what has happened to some of the pubs.ldquoHopefully, they get a turn and make a success of it.Meanwhile, The Victoria Inn, which is also owned by Greene King, remains on the market after a potential buyer fell through."},{"url":null,"title":"trios-delight-at-being-named-members-of-scottish-youth-parliament","story":"Adnan Ros and Nathaniel de Havilland will represent East Lothian, with Erin Campbell representing Midlothian North and Musselburgh.

A local tradition claims that the name Markle is actually a corruption of the word miracle, a reference to this legendary intervention of the saint on that day.This event is now seen as the lsquobirth of the Scottish flagrsquo, the Saltire thereafter becoming the flag of Scotland the tale is well told by the Scottish Flag Trust in the doocot by Athelstaneford Kirk, which has been wonderfully adapted into the Flag Heritage Centre.But why was it St Andrew who came to the aid of the Picts and Scots on that day and not, say, St Columba  The answer to this question may begin in a ,-year-old crypt in Northumberland.This crypt lies underneath the abbey of Hexham, a town in northern England. The crypt is an amazing survival from Anglo-Saxon times, built in the seventh century, more than  years before the Battle of Athelstaneford is said to have taken place.The crypt was part of a monastery built on the orders of the then abbot Wilfrid and it had a special purpose.Wilfrid was a passionate devotee of St Andrew. He had travelled to Rome and ed with a relic connected to the saint. Christianity at this time had not yet fully established its dominance, and Wilfrid was determined to create a great Christian holy site to encourage the spread of his faith.And what better way to do this than use a relic of St Andrew, an Apostle of Jesus himself So he established St Andrewrsquos monastery at Hexham in AD , and in the crypt below there was a shrine, in which the relic of the saint was kept.Pilgrims began to flock to the site and, although small, the design of the crypt gave an intense religious experience.The entrance was by the high altar of the church, with dark passageways for the pilgrims to file towards and pay homage to the relic of St Andrew.Even today, the now-empty shrine has the atmosphere of a sacred inner sanctum. The ancient feel of it is added to by the fact it was constructed with stones taken from abandoned Roman buildings, as Hexham is close to Hadrianrsquos Wall and the Roman garrison town of Corbridge.But what is the connection with the miracle at Markle The connection begins with Wilfridrsquos successor Acca, who became the abbot of St Andrewrsquos in Hexham in AD . He had travelled with Wilfrid and shared his devotion to St Andrew. It is said Acca acquired his own relics of St Andrew and added them to the collection at Hexham.But Acca the abbot was an evangelising monk. In AD , he left Hexham and journeyed beyond the old crumbling Roman wall and further north.It was around this time that East Lothian became part of Northumbria. But the kingdom beyond the seawas the land of the Picts.The story tells us that Acca met with the Pictish king Angusat a place called Kilrymont in Fe. Here, we are told, Acca gave the Christian Pictish leader some relics of St Andrew he had taken from Hexham and urged the king to create a new centre of Christian pilgrimage for the saint.From the limited historical accounts available, it does seem that it was indeed around this time that the religious site of St Andrews in Fe was established, at the place previously called Kilrymont.Further evidence of this is the amazing St Andrews Sarcophagus, which was discovered at St Andrews in the early th century. It can now be seen in the cathedral museum, where it is described as ldquoone of the finest examples of early medieval sculpture in Europe. It dates from the mid-s and was almost certainly commissioned by Angus for his own burial. He died in AD .And so the veneration of St Andrew in Scotland had begun well before the miracle at Markle, with King Angus resting at St Andrews in his magnicent sarcophagus. No wonder, then, when a later King Anguswas in need of ine intervention in AD , the saint he prayed to was St Andrew, who is then said to have replied in such a legendary, dramatic fashion.Here is the connection between the crypt at Hexham and the miracle seen at Markle: the relics of St Andrew brought to Fe which began the Scottish attachment to the saint may well have been part of the Hexham collection.But wait a minute! Thatrsquos not the story I have always been told when I go to St Andrews. The oft-told legend is that it was St Rulewho brought the relics to Fe in the fourth century. He was the bishop of the Greek city of Patras, where St Andrew was crucied.The story tells us he had a dream in which he was told that the relics of the saint, which he was the custodian of, were in danger and he must set sail with them. The dream told him that wherever he was shipwrecked, there the relics would find their new home.After months at sea, his ship was wrecked at Kilrymont in Fe. And so he established a new shrine and re-named the place St Andrews. No mention of a Northumbrian abbot, or relics from Hexham in this story!What are we to believe  There is often a haze between history and legend and they sometimes meet in a place too misty for us to see. Historical truth can be an elusive creature. You think you have grasped it when suddenly it slips away, leaving you searching once again. And sometimes a lost historical truth is to be found hidden in a legend.In the tale of St Andrewrsquos relics, history will side with the abbot, I suspect, but the romanticised and dramatic tale of St Rule has become the more popular and well-known explanation.But the reason for this is another story in itself.With thanks to Anna Blair, whose tale lsquoSaint and Saltirersquo inspired my research into this story."},{"url":null,"title":"council-planners-accused-of-having-a-lack-of-knowledge-of-their-own-policy","story":"A planning application to build the three-bedroom home and a detached garage on the outskirts of Camptoun Holdings, a small hamlet two miles north of Haddington, was refused by the local authority for the second time in five years.However, the applicants have now lodged an appeal in which they claim the planning officer who turned them down did not understand the policyused to make that decision.They claim that the house, which would be built on land currently occupied by derelict agricultural buildings, should be classed as an ldquoenabling development because they say it would improve the area.In an appeal which will be heard by the councilrsquos Local Review Body next month, they state: ldquoThe planner, in the pre-application response, did not accept that the proposed development was an enabling development.ldquoHowever, it is submitted that this conclusion only serves to demonstrate the lack of knowledge of the development process.ldquoTo allow for the removal of derelict buildings and reclamation of an unkempt siterequires third-party intervention.ldquoThe applicant is submitting a proposal for a single dwelling house and garage absorbing the costs of demolition and reclamation.ldquoThe development will bring substantial improvements to this rural brownfield land and improve landscape quality as well as visual and residential amenity.East Lothian Council has a planning policy which bars new housing in the countryside unless exceptional circumstances can be established.The plans for a house at Camptoun Holdings were first lodged with the council in .On that occasion they were refused and the Local Review Body rejected an appeal.Agents for the applicants this time around will argue that there has been a change in circumstances at the site, which has deteriorated further over the years.The Local Review Body meets in Haddington on Thursday, May ."},{"url":null,"title":"new-exhibition-highlights-history-of-musselburgh-athletic-fc","story":"The display was officially opened by Billy Brown, a former Hearts and Bradford City manager, who comes from Musselburgh and is a former Musselburgh Athletic manager, at a reception in the Old Town Hall.On show at the High Street museum is a iety of memorabilia relating to lsquoThe Burghrsquo, including trophies, medals, strips, pennants and photographs.

Even after the Damascene conversion of arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg, who used to described her deal as ldquovassalage, her final attempt to get a stripped-down Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament failed on Friday by a substantial majority. You have to give May full marks for her consistency: everything she touches turns to dust, even her own resignation.But thatrsquos by the by. As everyone has been saying: we are where we are. And where we are is extremely uncomfortable. Brexiters are gearing up to have a belly laugh at the opposition MPs, who will do their best throughout the coming week to find a compromise. Who do they think they are  Playing at being a provisional government  ldquoItrsquos like allowing the whelk stall to be run by the whelks, according to the Tory MP Sir Bill Cash. Butno-one  is able to run the eponymous stall, then all power to the whelks.Last weekrsquos indicative votes suggested that MPs are broadly in favour of a Brexit that keeps Britain in the EUrsquos economic loop while leaving the political institutions. Curiously, the SNP, who have been arguing for soft Brexit in two white papers and an election manesto, decided not to vote for the ious options, even the Norway model that they have long extolled. The SNP did, however, vote for the proposal from the Labour MP Margaret Beckett for a confirmatory ballot, and this option got the largest number of votes, much to everyonersquos surprise. This must be a serious possibility now that Parliament has failed to resolve the Brexit conundrum.However, this is not a Peoplersquos Vote as some have styled it. A confirmatory vote is not a rerun of the  referendum, but strictly a chance for voters to give their views on whatever deal Parliament agrees . The Kyle Wilson Amendment originally envisaged putting the Prime Ministerrsquos deal to a popular vote, assuming it was passed by Parliament. However, this confirmatory referendum might be dficult to schedule because it could collide with three other elections: a Tory leadership election, the European elections and a General Election. Brenda from Bristol will be in despair.EvenMPs fail to come up with a working compromise, they can still block a no-deal Brexit. The majority against leaving the EU without a deal is overwhelming. This means May, or her successor, will have to go cap-in-hand to Brussels in the next few days and request another, longer delay to Article . This would mean Britain participating in the European elections in May, which excites the Independent Group of Tory and Labour rebels, but is looked upon with dread by the main parties. Brussels too is worried about populist contagion spreading to other EU countries like Italy, but they are legally bound to make British participation a condition of any further extension to AVoter wrath, particularly in Labourrsquos leave constituencies, could lead to a dramatic revival of Nigel Faragersquos Ukip, or worse. The Svengali behind the  Vote Leave campaign, Dominic Cummings, is gearing up for the fight and reportedly suggesting a new party to fight for the right to leave. ldquoTell them again is the favoured slogan. The European elections might themselves turn into a kind of second referendum on Brexit.The Tories will presumably have a new leader by then, since Theresa May will surely go now there is to be the long extension she has resolutely opposed. Mind you, it is impossible to guess the Prime Ministerrsquos thought processes. She said she would goher withdrawal deal passed on Friday. But her gambit didnrsquot work. Even the opportunity to dispense with Mayrsquos services was not sufficient inducement for the Democratic Unionist Party to come on board. The joke doing the rounds last week was that she tried to fall on her sword and missed.But these things have a momentum of their own, and the Tory leadership election has already begun. Boris Johnson is the narrow frontrunner, but that could change. He might win the membership, but under Tory rules the parliamentary party has to agree the two candidates put to a postal ballot. The remainers in the Tory benches might use this as an opportunity to foil the hard Brexiters by keeping Boris off the list.Of course, what should happen when a government fails to get its most important legislation through Parliament is not a leadership election, but a General Election. The government cannot govern and, even with the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, this should lead to a General Election via a vote of no confidence. Some Conservatives might prefer to fight a General Election than European elections they had promised would never take place. But events are now out of everyonersquos control.Everyone, that is, except the EU, which now holds Britainrsquos future in the balance. Itrsquos trying not to crow about Britainrsquos abject national humiliation, but the , not the UK Parliament, will now decide the UKrsquos immediate future: deal or no deal. If MPs agree this week to back a soft Brexit involving the customs union and alignment with the single market, Brussels has promised to fast-track it in a matter of days. But the alternative, a long extension, will also suit the European Union.That means more money from Britainrsquos budget contribution, and serves as a warning to other EU countries about the dangers of trying to leave the Union. It also holds out the possibility of Britain remaining in the EU,a referendum is eventually staged.Well, that remains to be seen. What is perhaps more likely is that Britain gets stuck indefinitely in a long extension. It emerged last week that the Democratic Unionist Party, which again voted against Mayrsquos withdrawal deal, could live with a long extension. Indeed, they signalled that they could live with a customs union ndash as long as it ensured no border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The DUP may be Brexiters, but they are ardent Unionists first.A soft Brexit may now be the best way of keeping the UK together. But it should be put to the people in a confirmatory vote,for no other reason than this was not what most people thought they were voting for in . MPs have the opportunity to decide this tomorrow.How and why Theresa May failed to seek the only kind of Brexit that could get through Parliament will be left for historians to judge. One of her own Cabinet ministers, quoted on BBC Newsnight, gave the provisional verdict: ldquoShersquos the sole architect of this mess because of her inability to engage in the most basic human interaction.

So, although she didnrsquot elaborate on the outcome of the altercation, I can only imagine Ms Murray volleyed back as good as she got and ended up persuading the shop to accept Euros, groats and Monopoly money as well as Scottish cash.The tweet got so much traction because most Scots know and understand exactly how this interaction goes, just how grim and maddening it is no matter how many times yoursquove experienced it. These days many of us feel much more confident in our skins as Scots and are able to consider and reconcile our relationship with our English neighbours in more mature and expansive ways than ever before. But you still canrsquot escape the deep, primeval humiliation of having your money refused.

Not even in Scotland, as it turns out, where only coins have legal weight. According to the Bank of England, both coins and Bank of England notes are legal tender south of the border, with anything  a ldquomatter of agreement between the parties involved.

Whether that makes the shock greater is irrelevant: the loss and sorrow are the same. The rapid response of Parisians spoke of the deep place Notre Dame holds in Francersquos psyche. ldquoIt was Parisrsquos lighthouse, said one, indicating that this marvel of medieval gothic architecture was the brightest of all beacons in the famous city of lights. ldquoIt is our history, our literature, our imagination, said President Emmanuel Macron, vowing ldquowe will rebuild Notre Dame together.All of us who have visited Paris have made a bee-line for this remarkable, forbidding place, which perhaps explains why its destruction has touched people across the world. Notre Dame, home of Victor Hugorsquos tender-hearted hunchback, Quasimodo, is to Paris what Edinburgh Castle is to the capital: a massive, seemingly immovable monument, witness to centuries of turbulent affairs. Both have represented an unchanging presence around which tides of revolutions and revolts, war and politics have washed.As it lies in partial ruin, Notre Dame is being talked of as part of Francersquos soul. Yet this -year-old building carries meaning far beyond the countryrsquos border. It was here that Napoleon Bonaparte was crowned, and Joan of Arc beatied, but it was also the scene of Henry VI of Englandrsquos coronation as King of France, when he was a child. More than a century later, on April  , , Mary Stuart was married beneath its graceful soaring roof to Francis, the dauphin, son of Henri II. By all accounts it was an eye-wateringly extravagant event. A large theatrical stage was built outside the cathedral, and inside there was a massive triumphal arch. As weddings went, it was the most spectacular Notre Dame had ever witnessed.Read more: Macron vows to rebuild cathedralI doubt therersquos a country in Europe whose history has not crossed with the cathedralrsquos at some point. In certain respects, it is the most venerable symbol of an emerging Europe, a fulcrum for events that have made the continent what it is today. No wonder crowds watching the inferno from the Icircle de la Citeacute or on television wept.The largest of its  bells, Emmanuel, shares its name with the president. This coincidence might just prove fateful. Mr Macron rushed to the scene before the fire wholly engulfed the roof and spire. It is a little ironic that, as the flames took hold, he cancelled a recorded speech due to be broadcast at eight that evening. This statement was intended to restart his first term in office, and go some way towards appeasing the gilets jaunes movement, which has badly damaged his credibility and his countryrsquos stability.Doubtless he postponed because of the gravity of the unfolding disaster. Even so, Mr Macronrsquos emotional proclamation late into the night, in which he pledged to see the cathedral restored to glory, might prove to have been a masterly stroke.It is too cynical to suggest that even as the fire blazed the president understood that this crisis could improve his standing. But the political fall-out might nevertheless work to his advantage. In a way that no prepared script could, the presidentrsquos response to the fire, and his assurance that ldquotogether the cathedral will be rebuilt, will have won him new friends and admirers. He might have misjudged the national mood when handling the gilets jaunesrsquo demands, but on the night when Notre Dame burned, he too was ablaze. Instinctively he gauged the depth of feeling this place rouses in the people he governs. That affection, and the profound heritage the cathedral represents, crosses political, ideological and class ides. The wealthy of the Bouled Saint Germain feel the same in this matter as their compatriots in downtrodden rural France.If anything could unite people across the board, it is the sight of the countryrsquos best-loved building wreathed in blood-orange smoke. Some will doubtless see this calamity as a warning or sign, as when York Minster went on fire. Certainly, the potency of the pictures of such a blaze is primitive. You cannot fail to respond, nor to feel a passing shiver of superstition that, at this exceptionally troubled and uncertain time in Europe, it holds a message of some kind.For Mr Macron, that message might simply be that Notre Dame is a symbol of what unites the nation, an olive branch of sorts. In promising without hesitation to secure its future, he was committing also to hold together the France of liberteacute, eacutegaliteacute and fraterniteacute.It might not be the speech he expected to deliver, but it mayprove to be the finest he has yet made."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/9726876.jpg?type=article-full","title":"iain-macwhirter-the-burning-issue-has-to-be-the-need-to-abandon-coal","story":"Unlike Brexit, Scottish independence or even CND, climate change just doesnrsquot provoke fierce public emotions any more. Indeed, the problem for environmentalists, in the West at least, is perhaps that theyrsquove been too successful. The science of climate change is now more or less universally accepted, since the BBC started banning climate-change deniers like Lord Lawson from the Today programme. If everyone more or less agrees, therersquos no controversy.Civil disobedience, and stunts like superglueing naked bottoms to the safety glass in the House of Commons, at least gets attention. Politicians insist that they are listening . The UK is, perhaps surprisingly, one of the world leaders in CO reduction, and emissions are now lower than in Victorian times. The Scottish Government is committed to net  per cent elimination of greenhouse gases by , and has exceeded its emissions targets since it began the process of decarbonisation a decade ago. Admittedly, this is largely down to the closure of coal-fired power stations, like Longannet, and there remain problems with home heating and transport.:Extinction Rebellion protests: The activists who plan further disruption in Scotland to prevent environmental destructionThe electrication of vehicles is moving forward ndash though much too slowly because of the lack of charging points across Scotland. But it is happening. Petrol and diesel cars are to be phased out after . In fact, the internal combustion engine may become obsolete in towns some time before that, so rapid is the development of electric vehicles, especially micro-transportation like electric scooters and e-bikes. Buses and lorries, though, are another matter, and diesels are defended by powerful economic interests like the road hauliers and distribution companies like Amazon.Climate protesters like thecolumnist George Monbiot insist that we must ldquooverthrow capitalism to save the planet. But technology is turning the market green at a remarkable rate. The cost of renewable energy has fallen faster than anyone could have imagined  years ago. According to the investor bible, Forbes, solar and wind energy is about to make coal, gas and even nuclear power obsolete in the West in the next couple of years. It says three-quarters of US coal-fired power stations are already uneconomic, despite Donald Trumprsquos promotion of coal. Therersquos even talk of imminent estment in loss-making fossil fuel stocks causing a global financial ldquocorrection or stock market crash.Read more: Climate protestors block Edinburgh streetHowever, the Extinction Rebellion protesters are right to warn against complacency. The battle against climate change is far from over. President Trump disgraced America by withdrawing from the Paris Climate agreement. But the US is not the worldrsquos worst polluter. The inconvenient truth, as Al Gore might put it, is that protests against climate chaos are futilecountries like China continue to open a coal-powered station nearly every week.There has been much dispute about this claim, which environmentalists say is a racist myth designed to sht the blame for climate change to a developing country. However, there is no doubt that the second-largest economy in the world is also the biggest single polluter. China is responsible for one-third of global CO emissions, and thatrsquos largely down to its anachronistic dependence on burning coal.One of the greatest obstacles in the way of meeting  Paris climate target of capping global warming to two per cent above pre-industrial levels , is the persistent use of coal, largely in south-east Asia. China currently consumes half the worldrsquos coal and has increased coal-powered capacity by  per cent since , according to the International Energy Agency .True, China is also emerging as a world leader in renewable energy and is opening huge solar farms by the week. But promises by the communist government to curb coal use have not been honoured. According to the Global Energy Monitor, China is in the process of adding  gigawatts of coal-fired power, equivalent to the entire capacity of US coal. Hence the claim that it is opening a coal plant every week.The IEA say that to meet the UN targets, China would have to close all its coal-fired power stations within the next  years. That isnrsquot going to happen. Indeed, according to the German environment and human rights NGO, Urgewald, China is busy exporting coal-fired power stations to at least  countries, from Kenya to the Balkans. In Serbia, Chinese companies are building the countryrsquos first coal-fired power plant in  years.And itrsquos not just China. The IEA estimate that Asia as a whole is becoming coal central, with hundreds of coal power stations in the pipeline. Indonesia and Vietnam are turning to coal as are Bangladesh, and with Chinese help, the Philippines. Japan has ed to burning more coal following the disaster at Fukushima nuclear plant in . Without the active involvement of these countries, then the efforts of countries like the UK will be in vain. And of course in communist countries like China, climate protesters would be in jail, not on the streets campaigning.Developing countries have a strong case for special treatment. They can legitimately claim that the current warmth of the planet is not their fault. China has only become an industrialised nation in the last  years, whereas we in the West have been pumping C into the atmosphere since the start of the industrial revolution  years ago. Living standards are poor for the vast majority of ordinary Chinese families, who consume only a fraction of the goods and services we enjoy in the UK. Chinese citizens, therefore, have a much smaller carbon footprint.These are strong arguments and are recognised by the UNrsquos International Panel on Climate Change. Despite Americarsquos objections, there may have to be resource transfers to developing nations,they are to curb their uneconomic coal use. This is a global problem demanding global action and time is running out.

In true showman style he started off with a near miss, adding to the already heart-pounding drama. But then it happened, the ball fell into the hole, the penny dropped, and just like that his time on the wrong side of fame was over. He took it easy at first, just one arm pumping the air, but who was he kidding  There was too much there to contain. Too much relief, hurt, gratitude, happiness. He threw his arms wide, looked up to the heavens, and screamed.:A comeback for the agesHe howled with delight again when his son ran into his arms, Woods holding him the way his dad held Tiger  years before when he won his first Masters. Back when everything was ahead of him, when he could do no wrong. What scenes. From presidents past and present to fellow champions including Serena Williams, the congratulations have poured in. Woodsrsquo achievement at Augusta has been hailed as the greatest comeback in sporting history, quite a claim in a field that contains Ali and Lauda to name but two. It is more than that, though. The joy millions have taken in histo form shows the continuing power of the comeback as an idea. We want to believe in it. We need to believe in it.From the moment he appeared on television at the age of two, winning a putting contest with Bob Hope, Woods has lived in the glare of the cameras. His talent led to fame and more money in sponsorship deals than any athlete had earned before. Between  and  he won  majors and was on course to beat Jack Nicklausrsquos record of .Then his car hit a fire hydrant and his le was exposed as a wreck. He apologised to his we ndash on camera, naturally ndash for a series of affairs and casual encounters. His we gave up on him, understandably, and his body followed. From being an athlete in his prime, Woods was felled by pain in his knees and his back. Operations followed, as did an addiction to pain pills, culminating in his arrest in  for driving under the influence. The police mugshot, never among the most flattering of images, was particularly cruel, showing Woods as a bloated, weary mess, one, moreover, who still seemed to reek of arrogance. It looked like the photo equivalent of some blowhard asking ldquoDo you know who I am  and it earned Woods even more enemies than he had already accrued.:Sports greatest taleDespite the adulation which surrounds him after his win in Augusta, Woods still has enemies and critics, some of whom took to social media after he won the Masters to askthis great guy hugging his family was the same serial adulterer and spoiled brat of a few years ago. It has also been pointed out how lucrative Woodsrsquo comeback will be for himself and his sponsors. Great for the game of golf, too. It might be the whitest sport on the planet, butit has a place for Tiger then all is forgiven, right Looking at the hostility Woods ignites in some quarters it is hard not to think he is being unfairly held to higher standards than others, and that this is due not in large part to his riches or talents but to his colour. One only had to glance at the crowd of spectators cheering him on his way on Sunday to see what what a rarity Woods, an American of black, Native American, Asian and Caucasian heritage, is at the upper levels of golf. In a country that remains as ided on race as America it was something of a miracle he ever got as far as he did. When he fell from grace, as many others had done before him, the backlash was particularly brutal, even for the modern media age. It was ashe had to be punished, not just for what he had done, but for being insufficiently grateful for the status and riches he had been accorded.:Can Woods break new ground It might be thought that none of this matters any more now that Woods has joined that most elite of clubs, the comeback kids. For some, however, there is no such institution. A person might be seen to recover from the most dreadful setbacks and failures, but they are never fully allowed to forget them. Will Bill Clintonrsquos name, for example, ever be mentioned in the history books without Monica Lewinskyrsquos being far behind  As for Ms Lewinsky, she is proof of how membership to the club is only granted to those, mostly men, who meet certain criteria. Women by and large donrsquot have comebacks. They survive. They endure.Those who do not believe in second acts usually quote F Scott Fitzgerald to bolster their case. Erroneously, as it turns out. While the line about there being no second acts in American lives is usually attributed to his unfinished novel of , The Last Tycoon, it in fact originated in an earlier essay, My Lost City, and it reads: ldquoI once thought that there were no second acts in American lives, but there was certainly to be a second act to New Yorkrsquos boom days. If even the writer most associated, however mistakenly, with naysaying second acts was a believer, who are we to doubt As for those who question whether Woods should be treated as a hero again just for winning a golf tournament, what is the weather like up there on the moral high ground  It is not just sport that needs great comeback tales. What a bleak, devoid of hope, le it would be to think that things and people and luck cannot change, that there were no second chances for anyone. Sport shows us what a comeback looks like in a spectacular sense, but every day millions quietly stage their own fightbacks big and small. People do not come back from grief, illness and misfortune because of multi-billion dollar sponsorship deals or the acclaim of millions. Putting one foot in front of another again is the purest expression of our will to live,not for ourselves then for others.That we take such pleasure in seeing people bounce back is one of humanityrsquos finer instincts, something to be celebrated, an act to shout, or scream, about.

Peatbogs are carbon sinks, storing up natural carbon which would otherwise be released into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming.More than  per cent of Scotlandrsquos land area is covered in peaty soils but large areas have been damaged overcenturies. According to Scottish Natural Heritagersquos Peatland Action, the carbon locked up in Scottish peatland soils is equivalent to  yearsrsquo worth of Scotlandrsquos total annual greenhouse gas emissions.Langlands Moss is also a Local Nature Reserve and a much-loved and valued community resource used by localresidents, groups and schools. With the help of funding from a iety of sources over the years, the group has repaired paths, created a wildflower meadow, installed seating and signs, built dams to keep the peat wet and introduced ponds to encourage frogs, toads and newts.Photo credit of Langlands Moss John McIntyre McIntyre It has not been an easy road at times ndash concerns about creeping development in the area, coupled with two devastating fires in quick succession which destroyed the grouprsquos recently installed pound, boardwalk, have beenparticular challenges.But Potter, fellow founder members Alan Franklin and Yvonne McWilliams and the rest of the volunteers who runFoLM, are undeterred, and remain keen to ensure their work continues to benefit bioersity, the environment and local people.A second peat bog, estimated to be around m deep and , years old has been discovered, along with peatpockets throughout the woodland. The boundary of the Local Nature Reserve is now being extended from the original  hectares to  hectares and a bank of coner trees is being removed and replaced with a mosaic of native woodland.Plans for a restored boardwalk are under way, which will combine with the newly installed woodland paths to createa network of forest walks. ldquoItrsquos a lovely place to visit, but itrsquos also really important in the fight against global warming, explains Potter. ldquoIf the peatbog is wet, it keeps the carbon in, rather than releasing it into the atmosphere. Peat bogs help to keep the atmosphere cool.Picture taken by Fiona McGrevey on the last Bog Squad day. She adds: ldquoThe flora and fauna of the site is incredible too ndash as well as the sphagnum mosses which make the bog, you can see cross-leaved heath, cranberry and round-leaved sundew, and rarer plants like blueberry,crowberry and cloudberry.ldquoWe see lots of butterflies and many birds, from meadow pipits and skylarks to buzzards and tits, and deer and otters are regular visitors.It is a source of great pride for Potter and her fellow volunteers that Langlands Moss has become a flagship conservation project in South Lanarkshire. It was one of the first community conservation groups in the region, and there are now more than . Malcolm Muir, Countryside and Greenspace Manager for South Lanarkshire Council, says: ldquoWe couldnrsquot do our job without groups like FoLM.ldquoThey have done fantastic work over the years. Langlands Moss is a particularly nice accessible recreational area on the edge of the town but much more than that, it provides an opportunity to help people understand the importance of peatlands as a carbon store.ldquoThere are around , tonnes of carbon stored at Langlands ndash that is equivalent to the entire annual carbonoutput of South Lanarkshire. FoLM is in great demand from organisations keen to hear about its successful work.In recent months, Potter explains, she has been invited to speak at the International Union for Conservation of Nature conference in Balloch, about the role of volunteers in peatland restoration and she has received requests for more information about the Moss from groups as erse as rural colleges looking into habitat training, to Scouts and Guides, natural history societies and local health groups.ldquoWalking, being in the fresh air, getting away from the everyday has real benefits to physical and mental health,says Potter, who first fell in love with the Moss many years ago, walking and working in the nature reserve with herhusband Ian. When he died suddenly, aged , she continued to find solace and ldquobreathing space at Langlands.ldquoThere are so many benefits of the Moss, she says. ldquoItrsquos good for the environment and good for your health.And as a group, we feel very proud we have given the people of South Lanarkshire something to value and enjoy.For more information on The Friends of Langlands Moss please visitwww.friendsoflanglandsmoss.orgor join thei Facebook group.The Heraldrsquos Climate for Change initiative supports efforts being made by the ScottishGovernmentwith key organisations and campaign partners.

Radiocarbon dating of the dog bones unearthed at Cuween has shown that the dogs were placed in the chamber more than  years after the passage tomb was built, suggesting that they were ritually buried.Steve Farrar, interpretation manager at HES, said: “Just as they’re treasured pets today, dogs clearly had an important place in Neolithic Orkney, as they were kept and trained as pets and guards and perhaps used by farmers to help tend sheep.“But the remains discovered at Cuween Hill suggest that dogs had a particularly special signicance for the farmers who lived around and used the tomb about , years ago.#Maybe dogs were their symbol or totem, perhaps they thought of themselves as the ‘dog people’.“While reconstructions have previously been made of people from the Neolithic era, we do not know of any previous attempt to forensically reconstruct an animal from this time.“Looking at this dog helps us better relate to the people who cared for and venerated these animals, people whose ingenuity and sophistication made Orkney such an important place in the Neolithic and who have left us with such a rich legacy of monuments today.”The canine reconstruction is part of a wider project to use cutting-edge technology to share the stories of Orkney’s Neolithic chambered tombs with visitors.Last year, HES published D digital models of these chambered cairns, created through photogrammetry to better reveal the sophisticated structure of these monuments with the public.This process involves taking hundreds of overlapping images which are then combined to create a D model, enabling users from anywhere in the world to explore the sites in detail online.All of this new research will form part of updated interpretation  for visitors to Orkney’s chambered cairns, including Cuween Hill, due to be installed this summer. The reconstruction itself will also be going on display in Orkney later this year.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Their guests are interested in all types of accommodation, from hotels and guesthouses, to BBs and self-catering, and most will arrive with their own or hired cars.#They have the flexibility to explore areas off the busy, well-beaten tracks and taking a local guide with them or booking a private or scheduled tour is a popular way to do this.#She added: #Once operators understand how much there is to see and do in Orkney and how many islands there are, in addition to the wonderful food, drink and crafts we have, they appreciate why we recommend three to four-night stays as a minimum for their guests.”Ms Tulloch said that Destination Orkney hoped to build on the opportunities the travel trade industry was now offering to Orkney by running future workshops for tourism members locally.“We’d like all our members to be aware of the potential this section of the industry presents and to equip them with the necessary tools and knowledge they will needthey would like to work effectively with the travel trade,” she explained.Joining Ms Tulloch on the Orkney stand at the Expo were travel trade consultant, Kathleen Hogarth, Destination Orkney members Hazel Aim and Fidra Sym of Orkney Heritage Tours, and Destination Orkney chairman and hotelier Gareth Crichton.Expo was also attended by Pentland Ferries, NorthLink Ferries, John O’ Groats Ferries and representatives from Shetland, forming a strong presence for the Northern Isles.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

In the event of any archaeological discoveries of interest, SSEN Transmission has said it is committed to ensuring these are fully documented, preservedpossible, with the findings shared with interested parties.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Paris, easily reachable from the UK, has become all the more so in the last several decades with the arrival of budget flights, whether landing amid Charles de Gaulle’s s glamour or at the poky Beauvais, which feels that at any moment it might take off itself like a tent in a field, decanting passengers somewhere to the outer periphery of their target.On most days, boats filled with tourists craning sun-reddened necks to one side cruise down the Seine, gliding theof the cathedral’s gothic brickwork, flowers picturesquely spilling over the embankment. Or they jostle for a space out in front of the two towers, among those who have paid vendors for seed bags to coax pigeons onto outstretched arms, like beads on a string, for a photograph with fluttering wings.It’s the second destination, after the Efel Tower of course, that many visitors associate with the city. Despite the occasional complaint of over-crowding, common to all popular tourist attractions, TripAdvisor users list it as second in satisfaction too , and it looms in the backdrop when visitors exit the bookshop Shakespeare  Co, the charmingly ramshackle Parisian gateway to worlds of words, and arrive back in the hustle and bustle of the city. Distances to Paris are marked officially from the site of Notre-Dame at its heart.: Notre-Dame inferno: a history of Paris’s most-visited landmarkHostile infrastructure is not limited to repelling the human species. Although we have made natural land inhospitable in many ways, recent images of netting preventing sandmartins from nesting on clf faces in North Norfolk’s Bacton have prompted consternation, and they are not the first of their kind. Buildings, like any public spaces, don’t become symbolic of a city unless citizens feel warmly enough to envelop them within their personal ideas about the place, and as touchstones for journeys through the streets.Firefighters saved Notre Dame from total collapse and signs point to the grand cathedral being rebuilt. Stone and sculpture aside, it’s worth considering as we look around our own cities whether we are doing enough to encourage that spirit, making public spaces beloved of the people who live around them.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"wings over scotland vs kezia dugdale case hinged on this key question","story":"The defamation case brought by Wings Over Scotland blogger Stuart Campbell against Labour MSP Kezia Dugdale raised important questions about free speech.After his defamation case against Kezia Dugdale was thrown out, the Wings Over Scotland blogger Stuart Campbell wrote that “in almost every sense that the case was brought, we’ve actually won”.And, indeed, the sherf’s written judgement agreed with Campbell on two key points: that he “does not hold homophobic beliefs or feelings ... [and] has demonstrated by his conduct over many years that he supports equality for homosexual people” and that his tweet which sparked the dispute “was not motivated by homophobia and did not contain homophobic comments”. This will go a long way to healing the reputational damage he suffered as a result of the Labour MSP’s claim that the tweet – “Oliver Mundell is the sort of public speaker that makes you wish his dad had embraced his homosexuality sooner” – was homophobic.: Kezia Dugdale wins defamation case against Wings Over ScotlandHowever, the sherf decided that even though Dugdale’s opinion was wrong, the comments she made were still “fair” and dismissed the blogger’s claim for damages of £,. “The law of defamation allows redress for damaging comments about character, but it also recognises that a balance must be struck with competing public values, such as free speech,” the judgment said. “It recognises that there is signicant public interest in allowing people to freely express opinions without fear of legal penalty. Accordingly not every damaging comment about character will result in legal liability for harm or distress.”This case may have attracted headlines partly because of the fame of the two people involved, but it also had broader implications. If the ruling had gone in Campbell’s favour and he had been awarded substantial damages, then it could have had a discouraging effect on the challenging of other public remarks that did actually cross the line in terms of homophobia or other forms of prejudice.Despite strict laws of defamation in Scotland and the UK, there has always been considerable latitude in the political sphere. For example, after David Lammy recently compared the ERG Tory MPs to the Nazis, the group’s leader Jacob Rees-Mogg responded by saying he “feels sorry” for the Labour MP.

Companies in Scotland are caught in a pincer movement of business challenges.“On one hand, businesses are faced with increased cost pressures due to currency weakness and higher wages, and on the other they are hit by the dampening effects of political turmoil caused by the ongoing uncertainty of our future relationship with the EU.“There is an immediate urgency to deal with Brexit, which is hampering our ability to compete on the international stage. We see this borne out in the decline in confidence, dficulties in recruitment and challenges in exporting. “Furthermore, restraint on plans to invest will do nothing to solve Scotland’s ongoing productivity challenge which requires sustained levels of investment in skills and trainingwe are to see the sht the economy needs.”The SCC’s quarterly economic indicator is Scotland’s longest running survey of its kind, operating since . Its latest findings come just two days after it was revealed Scotland’s unemployment figures had reached a record low at . per cent.Mr Allan added: “Our survey has shown some real areas of robustness which highlights the resilience of Scottish businesses and their resolve to stay focused on creating jobs and paying taxes to fund vital public services. But the pressure on Scottish firms is rising, with the prospect of increased costs due to inflation, currency volatility, Brexit preparations and the prospect of increased taxation remaining as top concerns for all sectors.”Professor Graeme Roy, director of the Fraser of Allander Institute, said: “The lack of clarity about the UK’s terms of exit from the EU continues to cast a shadow over day-to-day decision making, with businesses clearly struggling to make long-term plans in such times. Weak business investment has been a feature of recent times, and this latest survey shows that firms are becoming even more reluctant to make investment decisions at this present time. “This is an unwelcome sign given the key role that investment plays in boosting productivity.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Voters don’t always get the chance to change the government, but they may want the chance to change their mind.You may be cheering the overturning of the democratic vote now, butthey get away with it we will all be losers. Be careful what you wish for you may just get it.Well, the #Put it to the People# march was in London in that there England, so I#m unsure why Quitters are making an issue of the numbers. The debate afterwards was billed as an open debate, and only one cockney Quitter spoke, so make what you like of that.Why go to the unnecessary effort of changing my mind  Parliament, the commentariat and most of the mainstream media seems perfectly happy to do that for me. And while they’re at it why not move the goal posts, change the game and rewrite the rules as you go along. Quintessentially EUropean modus operandi.Our major export markets are Japan and China. That is unlikely to change either.British markets of old will not be ing to the past and arguments made that this will happen is extreme naiveté.The commonwealth is far bigger than Australia. Much of it developing economies expanding far far faster than Australia is or ever will. You are right though Oz will have to keep selling to China because China owns vast swathes of Ozzy industry and mining. I for one will be delightedwe have a much closer links with Australia, New Zealand but they are hardly super stars of economic growth.I do not know of a single UK made item in any of my families ious homes.Ali says “ theyget away with itwe will all be losers”. Boo-hiss! Really  If Boris, Farage, Rees-Mogg and chums get away with it most folk will be worse off, with the few laughing all the way to their offshore banks. And that’s the point # them taking control to profit from their vision of a backwards looking low-tax-for-the-rich Britain of biddable serfs. Ali should be careful whose bidding he is doing by defending May’s hollow deal.Perhaps my previous point might distress Ali lessI rephrased it. Not all of the electorate who seek a change of government achieve this at election time. That’s parliamentary elections for you, particularly under first last the post. We get one day of enjoying the freedom of maybe changing the government and have to put up with the outcome for some years before the next time. However, in the terms of this referendum # brought on to placate those ideologues who bankrolled lawbreaking in their dishonest campaign, well # some folk might have changed their minds + days on. Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever. Why not make sure we really want it Peter, you so waffle on! Ignoring your obviously obsessive-compulsive dogma, reference Boris, Farage,biddable serfs and assorted socialist claptrap, I will take issue on one point only here. Your  statement,#Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever#, that is manest nonsense. After Brexit, Europe will still exist. The EU, on present developments, may well implode at any minute. Spain, Greece, Italy even Franceseem to be moving away from the suffocating mire of Brussels, Junker, Barnier and undemocratic cabals of theEU. Brexit would never be forever It is just the start of an equitable move towards democratic change and true democracy in Europe, not the present cartel of faceless unelected bureaucratic parasites and overpaid freeloaders.You keep harping on about Boris, Nigel and Jacob asthey were the only proponents of brexit. You steadfastly ignore the other . million people because of course you obviously are so much smarter and nicer than them so their votes don#t count. What I wonder is what will the political elites decide to ignore next time we votethey get away with it this time. How about we have a vote about the SCT andwe don#t like the outcome we vote again until we do get the result we want. Or may until they get the result they want which is contrary to what you want. How does democracy work in your fantasist mind Marc Petit, Superstars! I love Aus but economic Superstars, what planet are you on  Australia has a masive land mass, fantastic mineral resources yet is so outperformed financially by India, Canada, and with half the GDP of the UK . As my Aus brother would say, #A few stubbies short of a six-pack. A few sandwiches short of a picnic#. Now get real your comment marc,#we are superstars of growth # it must have been a petit and low starting point  years back.@Mark Petit,Thanks for that, very interesting. Do you think that the Australia-Japan Economic Partnership is helpful by removing tarfs from Japanese goods imported into Australia and vice versa for your agricultural exports to Japan  Whereas having no trade deal with the EU presumably means that goods from both parties are subject to tarfs  The EU is very protective of its agriculture.I#m assuming Australia would find a UK trade deal helpful by removing UK tarfs on your agricultural produce e.g. fruit and wine, and making British goods much cheaper to Australians than they are now What a wonderful attitude and comment from Marc Petit, #These goods Japan et al are cheaper and generally regarded as better .# as our goods are all manufactured under EU protocols and Marc claims are clearly poor quality, just another really good reason to move on. I quote, World Financial Review # Australia has become one of the first countries to finish signing off trade deals with Britain# and The Financial Times, #Australia to fast-track UK trade pact in event of no-deal Brexit# so you see petit comments from Mr Petit,are just that and no more.!!So, Boris Johnson has now changed his mind. Let’s respect his right to do so, but couldn’t the public have done so too And May took her deal twice to the Commons,but she won’t take it once to the commoners. At least you know where you are with the Tories # kind of.Only % of voters think May’s deal is a good deal, but we are meant to shut up and swallow it,her party can back it,she’ll go. How dare anyone speak up against this insulting nonsense Ali’s alt-right guided jibes are remarkably handy. Non-fantasist Ali draws a telling distinction between self-interested Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg on one hand, the “political elite” on another hand,and the millions who fell for the demonstrablelies of the Brexit campaign cheats on yet another hand still. I am not of course forgetting those voters. I’m pointing out who misled them and why.To adapt Roald Dahl: these laddies from the upper crust. Does he really not see that they are political and elite  It’s troubling.Ali might care to note I am not calling him a member of the alt-right here, buthe continues to unthinkingly parrot their offensive arguments conclusions will be drawn. Non-obsessivecompulsive Ian might similarly do well to dwell on the benefits of avoiding ad hominem arguments. Whilst he has managed at times to play the ball not the man, Ian sadly is more than habitually inclined to foul, and thereby be judged foul in turn. If he repeatedly takes the same self-defeating approach and expects a dferent result# well conclusions may also be drawn. Can’t these lads raise their game Again you only want democracypeople vote the way you tell them. That#s not democracypeter has got it wrong again there was no cheating in the leave side#What started out as a witch-hunt by the political establishment in what they thought was the largest political scandal investigating Cambridge Analytica and Goddard Gunster’s alleged involvement in the Leave.EU referendum campaign, has today been proven to be . Instead, the Electoral Commission fined us on technicalities and an overspend of £,, not the £, originally presented by them on £ million overall spend. The fines were reduced and the Judge accepted the technical breaches were ‘mistakes’ rather than calculated wrong-doings and crucially held there were ‘no findings that Leave.EU had been dishonest.#”#.Does Ian mean the .m who were lied to by self-serving cheats  Ian might be interested in this from the Chair of The British Medical Association’s Public Health Medicine Committee:The referendum result was NOT #the will of the people# # certainly not following the revelations since.Thank you for asking the people to vote again.Can we also put it to the people in Shetlandthey still want to live inside a windfarm  How many times do we get to vote Past comments on referendums from David Davis MP could soothe or enrage frustrated Leavers. Speaking to parliament in  he said: We should not ask people to vote on a blank sheet of paper and tell them to trust us to fill in the details afterwards. For referendums to be fair and compatible with our parliamentary process, we need the electors to be as well informed as possible and to know exactly what they are voting for.#theyworkforyou says former Brexit Minsiter Davis received £, for  hours work for JCB this year, and that he generally voted against a statutory register of lobbyists. Coincidence  Maybe not. Does Ian still insist rich and powerful Brexit-backers aren#t out for themselves #neo-fascist German AfD party leader# revolting female, but elected to the German Parliament, I repeat elected!!! Now, Peter, can you see the reason we need out. Even you must now see what the E Union is doing with its Proportional Representation and revolting political systems. Neo-Nazi elected into the German Parliament, enough said.Fascism cannot be defeated by nationalist-navel gazing. The far-right are cooperating across Europe, trying to heighten a sense of crisis and undermine confidence in the institutions which they hope to control. Ian#s approach isn#t simply ahistoric. It is dangerously naive. His phrase #revolting female# normalises misogyny.Recognising the threat, not allowing ourselves to be ided and working with our neighbours to the greater good is the only way to keep the far-right at bay internationalism, standing together, kindness, respect. It is less than two years since Farage was speaking at an AfD rally. Ian should be more skeptical about the real motives of the brains behind Brexit. The David Davis#s quote shows they knew what they were about. Rich financiers, newspaper magnates and populist politicians have schemed together to break electoral law, lie to and manipulate the public to bring Britain to this precipice. Meanwhile all some have had to add is jeers. That said, Ian did manage to make his last ill-considered contribution without needless insult. Hopefully, now that he can see who has been pulling his strings, he will be able to accept he has been had. The referendum wasn#t won. It was stolen. Dangerous days are ahead.##and who keeps the far left, or even just the left for that matter, at bay Extreme left, extream right. Two sides of the nastextremist coin There is no dference, the sad thing is what Alice Weidel said was and isperfectly true on this occasion. If the European Union#sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable , way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for. The reality #the brains behind Brexit# or rather the driving force, that would be Tony Blair, Osbourne, Cameron, Junkers, Barnier, Tusk, Salmond. Sturgeon et al. They are the ones that did so much to alienate the UK public. They are still doing just that.Aprime example today from Junker, # April is the ultimate deadline for approval of the Withdrawal Agreement by the House of Commons,# Juncker told the European Parliament. #A #no-deal# at midnight on the th of April is now a very likely scenario. It is not the outcome I want. But it is an outcome for which I have made sure the EU is ready.# Just food for thought does that mean Junker has a special place in Hell reserved as Tusk previously intermated !!!Er, dunno Michael. Of late the whiter-than-white far-right have distracted the nation away from dwelling on the harms of austerity with a isive, dishonest Brexit campaign that’s resulted in unparalleled spikes in hate crime, Muslims attacked at prayer, Europeans and U.K. born citizens told to go back to where they came from, malicious devices left of train tracks, a plot to murder an MP and the murder of another. The left largely seem intent on taxing the rich, investing in public services, ending poverty, housing thehomeless, reducing demand on food banks and educating the ignorant. If that ever becomes a problem I’ll give Michael’s question some thought. Until then equating the left with the far right doesn’t seem quite fair.Btw. has anyone heard Ian describe Farage as a repulsive male  Farage might be described a repulsive person or man but never a repulsive male.For some reason the term “female” in Shetland social media is chosen as a pejorative.There is quite a bit of work to be done before the repulsive elements of the present era are behind us.Meanwhile the rich are set to increase their share of global wealth from % to % by .So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Non-revolting Ian attacks the leader of German#s AfD, then agrees with her.He holds that Cameron wasn#t given enough concessions by the bad EU to feed his far-right Tories, and that Cameron is also to blame. You can#t weaken fascists by giving them what they want. Its not in the nature of the beast.Labour MP Rosie Cooper, target of a neo-Nazi murder plot, was praised in the House of Commons yesterday by the Home Secretary and the Leader of the House. In her speech she thanked the organisation #HOPE not hate# who campaign against racism and fascism, who helped to save her le.The title highlights the far-right#s aim to create the sense of alienation which Ian so willingly feeds. Ian has outed himself. Little more needs said, other than that at least with PR the far-right do their work in plain sight. In the UK they lurking within the Conservative Party and tell themselves they#re free thinkers.Dennis Skinner, Tony Benn, George Galloway, Kate Hoey etc etc etc according to Peter these are far right racists for wanting to leave the undemocratic euAccording Bernie Sanders,an open door immigration policy is incompatible with a welfare state. According to Peter this makes him a far right fascist.It is such a shame Peter Hamilton has to lie so. His words #So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Ian has outed himself.# Please, Peter, make an effort at simple honesty! The fact I agreed with a few words from Alice Weidel does not wed me to her views and rancid opinions which you are not so very stupid as not to know. So stop being so pathetic and be a little less disengeneous.O dear me, Peter is rather wandering off the point with his petit and puerile criticisms. I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I share some of his, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to John S Bercow#s comments on a repulsive male, Alt-Right football thug and ex-convict Tommy Robinson,. Bercow#s words in the House# Tommy Robinson as #a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent inidual#. Now there we have a repulsive maleon the right sadly there are more than enough violent and repulsive Marxist–Leninist terrorism, both male and female on the left. As I previously stated, extreme left and right, opposite sides of the same nasty coin. Revolting females and revolting male are plenty on both sides. Revolting people of both genders exist, only Peter with his pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation as,#Hisphrase “revolting female” normalises misogyny.Peter Hamilton, for your information, I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I indeed share some of his views, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to Alt-Right, football thug, Tommy Robinson. To mimic House Speaker, John S Bercow, #Tommy Robinson is#a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent male. There are repulsive males and females on both sides of the political spectrum. Gender is not an issue! Only you, Peter Hamilton with your pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation referencing my comment about a truly revolting female.. One whom is an active racist, white supremacist, elected to serve in a European parliament.What explains right-minded Ian’s double standards  Doesn’t he realise Farage and Weidel are both far-right extremists  It appears there is little to set Weidel and Farage apart except that one is a bigoted German woman and the other a bigoted English man.Hopefully Ian will want to reconsider his appreciation of Farage.I have no particular appreciation of any politician however I would just say I appreciate honesty, not your strongest gt Peter Hamilton!Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians as any reasonable person can see. Just because they do not share your own particular brand of left-wing zealotry does not make them right-wing bigots. I would advise you to look at the definition of a bigot and then take a long hard look in the mirror! Before anyone states the obvious, I am intolerant of racists, Islamophobics, sectarianism and anyone who subverts democracy with disinformation and dishonesty. Sadly there is plenty of all that sht around. If that makes me intolerant towards those holding dferent opinions,they are those as mentioned earlier, I rejoice in that.Will Ian really not condemn Farage’s racist anti-migrant poster   What evidence does Ian have to show Farage and Weidel are not the same brand  It’s a poster the AfD would have been equally proud of. Is Ian really now saying Weidel is not a right-wing bigot  It’s no time since he said she was “revolting”. It’s a word I’d rather apply to Farage’s poster and the views it represents. How does Ian justy applying it to Weidelnot for behaving in ways similar to Farage  I would not think any less of Ian were he to show himself capable of changing his mind about Farage as fresh information emerges. Any reasonable person would. Perhaps Ian yet believes Farage was never a racist. Presumably Ian doesn’t simply find Farage’s views tolerable because heas a white British nationalist is an all round good bloke  Where does Ian stand on Farage’s warm embrace of the views of Le Pen   Will Ian really not condemn that poster,not the man behind it  It’s ok to be intolerant of racism Ian, it really is.I consider your silly poster, I do not like it at all! I also dislike some of the dishonest troop on the photos on this blog. For example Gary Robinson for his dishonest campaign for the Council . Jonathon Wills for his dishonest statement that I alone held up Viking Energy . Yes Peter, it, however, takes more than one poster to show the merits of a person. I recommend Farage for his stand against Islamophobia and leaving UKIP, once UKIPbedded Tommy Robinson. If Farage is Xenophobic he has a strange choice for a we and girlfriendI condemn most of all your dishonesty and  statements above.Weidel, Farage and Tinkler all agree “If the European Union’sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable, way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for.“ Weidel, Farage and Tinkler have a shared appreciation of what is reasonable # giving the far-right what they want. Cameron got concessions, just not enough to appease the far-right ERG tail that’s been wagging the Tory dog and Farage. It’s really not the EU to blame for getting us into this mess, but that is what Tinkler, Farage and Weidel want us to believe. Cameron should have stood up to those on his right like John Major did before him. Instead he appeased them and somehow Europe is to blame  This buckpassing feeds into a neo-fascist narrative. Rees Mogg called Weidel’s speech “interesting”. What’s interesting is that Tinkler falls for an argument Rees Mogg highlighted and then tried to distance himself from. What’s interesting is that Ian blames mainstream politicians, not the far-right for alienating the public. Can he really not see their game  “Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians”. Really Ian  Do you still think that It is not yet clear whether politically correct Ian needs to learn more about Farage before he will condemn him in the same terms as he did “revolting female” Weidel. The facts suggest both deserve an equal opportunity to wither under Ian’s singular brand of enlightened scorn. Ian may or may not be revolted by Farage’s thoughts on the prospect of having Romanians for neighbours or on Farage’s anti-Semitic attacks on George Soros. Ian will likely recall seeing posters defaming that philanthropist during Ian’s own well publicised whoop whoop visit to Hungary. These posters, which portray Soros as an untrustworthy Jewish money lender, were paid for by Hungary’s far-right racist party which has taken control of the Hungarian media and parliament. Anyone wondering whether Farage dfers much from Weidel need wonder no more.If Ian is looking for revolting enemies of democracy he could look back at the ious characters I have provided him with information about over the last few months in the not quite Pygmalion hope that, underneath it all, Ian is a rational human being who can be reasoned with, and can therefore change both his mind and potentially even his unapologetically needlessly confrontational counterproductive approach.Peter@s obsession seems now to be about me now!. My #Whoop whoop# visit to Hungary was not an SOE mission but to a Hungarian friends wedding!Hungarian political posters, I understood not one all were in Hungarian! . Peter talks about antisemitic views. Peter#s beloved Labour party has well publicised anti-semitic views that appear far worse and more contemporaneous than any comment Farage may or may not have made. I note Peter claims thatHungary has a far-right racist party, well Peter that is all part a parcel of the EU and I understand was democratically elected. The thing that I find amusing here is Peter so compulsively obsessively references, his words, #neo-fascist#! It may interest him to hear I have received threats of violence from # neo-fascist right wingers online# of which a police response resulted. . Now Peter, just calm down a bit dear,I visited the USA also. I understood their posters and did not honour Trump, although I find him about as obnoxious as Corbyn, however an improvement on Salmond, Whoop whoop!!! Both have so very much in common.Trump, Salmond so very similar. just note their alleged courtship rituals . Trump pays the girls silence with his own funds, Salmond uses crowdfunding and sits on his own £millions, wonderful man to represent Scotland.Ian’s approval of Farage is the matter at hand. Farage attending an AfD rally should be enough to concern Ian. Farage distancing himself from Tommy Robinson scarcely makes Farage Mr. Clean. To be clear, it was Farage’s poster, not mine, and to call it “silly” trivialises Farage’s use of racist tactics in the referendum. This period saw a spike in racially motivated assaults and other hate crimes: a serious matter.Ian’s poster boy’s racism cannot be disproven by his choice in partners. The French and Hungarians are not regarded as lesser humans by those who think that revolting way. Farage’s abuse of Romanians # which even The Sun called racist # is another factor Ian chooses to ignore, and we don’t need to consider what Farage means by “defending Judeo-Christian values”.For Ian, Farage now saying Farage isn’t Islamophobic is good enough. Considered together with everything  Farage has said and done that is a pretty low bar. No amount of evidence will enable Ian to realise he has been taken in by a member of the far-right.Of course pointing all this out to Ian sees him again calling me obsessive. Doesn’t make him right about Farage though.A more positive role in the enacting of decisions on important topics of vital national interest needs to be found for the voters. Just casting our ballot once every few years for a representative of a political party and them going off to Westminster, Edinburgh or Brussels has been revealed by the present crisis to be nigh on meaningless. Once chosen and having shipped out the MP, MSP or MEP develops dferent priorities. The acquisition, maintenance and development of power takes precedence over local concerns and often personal ethical and moral concerns are sublimated to the service and survival of the Party. The present political stramash is the perfect example of what I am talking about. Mud slinging and arguing is getting us nowhere. Let’s look for the way forward.Careful Andrew. Well argued points are rarely welcomed here. Try being more extreme and ill informed, clueless but convinced YOUR opinion is the only correct opinion. Then tear the opposing opinion up for toilet paper.Mr Holt, this is the best on-the-button analysis that I have ever read on the Brexit process. The Brexit debate has laid bare a much deeperpolitical crises, that is ,the existential crises of future democracy in the UK itself and I do fear for that future .My final word here . Given a choice of Nigel Farage, Johnathon Wills or Gary RobinsonI would choose Farage without question. Ex Councillors with a history of outright dishonestyor complete turncoat behaviour , Farage for me warts and all, any time.I do not agree with all Farage has done and said, but I find no lack of integrity in him, which in the atmosphere of today#s politics is refreshing.I am intrigued as to the motive behind Brexit, and what advantage this would be to the Conservatives and their agenda   What political advantage would there have been in leaving the EU as opposed to remaining for the Conservative Party, and is this the real reason why there was an EU Ref.in the first place Was the EU Ref. politically or economically advantageous to the Conservative Party regardless to what the people of the UK voted for      The people voted, but did they vote knowing what the aftermath would be in its entirety    The advantage to the Tories, in the short term at least, was to shut up those on the right who were agitating, causing a ided party defecting to further right associations attracting further right sympahisers support. It backfired on them though, they didn#t expect #Leave# to win, they were relying on #Remain# winning to silence the dissent. #Leave# winning caused the whole establishment to descend in to a silent panic they#re still in shock and denial from, hence the total pigs ear of the last few monthsI voted believing #Leave# in the belief it meant exactly that, close the door, walk away, build a wall up the middle of the North Sea Channel, call it what you like. Back to pre # status for everything, no exceptions, no bits and pieces held on to and dragged with us that have been conceived while part of the EEC EU.I did not know we were going to end up stuck in an eternal country destroying limbo that Westminster has dragged us in to and seem hell bent on keeping us in.Only politicians could try and convince the public they#re acting in the national interest while doing everything to destroy the country.I totally agree with your comments, Michael. It certainly has put the Conservatives into a situation where it has caused ision and political mayhem within the government as well as affecting, to a degree, other political parties. It has also weakened the basis for leaving the EU, and the aftermath, politically and economically, and the mess which has occurred thereafter. On the outset, from what I know, it did not make economic sense to leave the EU, based on the feedback, prior to the EU Ref from many British companies trading within the EU, and the possible damage it would cause  I believe % of British trade was directly with the EU, and now this figure could be vastly reduced as a consequence We are, the UK, in uncharted waters, so to speak, and it could, possibly, take years to smooth out or cause greater calamity with the EU. I hope the future relationship with the EU, does not have a negative impact on trading relationships######time shall tell, as they say. It has put the future of the EU in doubt, as other countries within the EU, also wanting to have referendums  A big problem was using a referendum to answer a complex question. Should we ban smoking in public places#  Yes No. Easy. Should we leave the EU  It’s not as simple as some pretended. Did it mean leaving in every respect  It wasn’t entirely a Yes No question. Were all the knock-on consequences clear from the start No. Some politicians are reluctant to harm the economy. Most believe Parliament is sovereign. Switzerland takes many decisions by referendum. Britain doesn’t. The public were sold a lie from the outset # that politicians would put the result above the national interest. They were sold others later, including by “trustworthy” Farage. For some, not cutting our nose off to spite our face is a matter of principle. For others, we can only get Britain back to its former splendour by going it alone # which might not turn out to be that viable. But there is financial itself interest at work for the pro-Brexit mega-rich who want a low-tax Britain, and they don’t mind turning up the volume on intolerant rhetoric to strengthen their position. Brexit or not, they’ve now strengthened their position # worrying given their aims and the repulsive means they willingly embrace.You mean the mega rich that made their fortune by evading tax and suing the NHS because they didn#t get a contract  folk like Richard Branson the prominent remoaner. Or geldof who lives in the UK tax free under non dom status Or Osbourne, Cameron, Salmond, Blaire!! I wish I was poor like them!It was a simple question. Only those who do not like the result try and pretend otherwise.#Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union #If #leave the European Union# somehow, as you try to convince us, can be interpreted as only leaving certain bits of the EU, then the same must also apply to the alternative choice of#remain a member of the European Union# and it be interpreted as only remaining within certain bits of the EU. Which would have made asking the question in the first place meaningless and pointless, as regardless which way anyone chose to vote it meant the same thing.#Leave the European Union# and #remain a member of the European Union# can only be interpreted one way, as per the dictionary definition, as the question contains no caveats. Besides, being the good old Socialists that they are in their mission to list, label and micro manage everything, you#re either a full member of the EU or you#re not. There is no mechanism or precedent to sorta half leave, but not leave everything, like you suggest. Fully in, or fully out, them be the choices.I think Michael will have to agree it doesn’t appear to be a question Parliament wanted this answer to! Fully in or fully out: thems not the choices no more. It’s a really big tangle because ultimately for the U.K. it is Parliament that is sovereign. For Scotland apparently it is the people that’s sovereign, so there may be a clash ahead. I’m not sure how many people voted to break up the U.K. Maybe the only solution now will be to have a confirmatory vote.#Fully in or fully out: thems not the choices no more#.Really  What are the choices then  Like I said above, those are the only two available where the EU is concerned. Which is a goodish chunk of the reason some of us voted out, you either accept everything that Brussels dictates, or reject everything Brussels dictates, participating in the things that work in your country and rejecting those which don#t isn#t an option. The EEC EU worked up to a point while some level of give and take was possible with such things, now that its not, the EU are on a fast track to implosion civil war, whichever arrives first.“What are the choices ” No idea, but, from the news, No-Deal is now No-Go.Sorryfolk were misled, but why is no-deal seemingly now no-go  Its because we vote for MPs, and they do what they think they should, not what we want. It’s a sair fecht, but most MPs seemingly want to spare the country needless economic damage the people didn’t knowingly vote for. That’s then doing their jobs btw.Lets wait and see nowa compromise emerges that Parliament can live with, orthey can agree a question they need to put to the people.MPs are our representatives, put there to do what they think is best. They are not our servents put there to mindlessly do our bidding. This key fact allows them the wriggle room they need to change their minds once the facts change. This reality behind our representative democracy illuminates the lie that was Cameron’s “advisory referendum” which, funnily enough, he promised to obey. You’ve got to love those Tories# or not. No-deal was a fake promise, which, happily for some, still distracts attention from the many harms of needless austerity.

And with the likes of midfielder Ciaran Kellett and goalkeeper Joe Russell having come off the back of impressive campaigns in the under-s league for Lochalsh, the mainland team could prove a tougher nut to crack this season. #We haven#t lost any players, which is a huge step forward, and we are very lucky to have so many young players.#After missing out on the title in a dramatic play-off against Mallaig, the  champions will fancy their chances of mounting another championship charge with a settled squad that is full of experience. Kyleakin will also hope to add to their trophy haul in the cup competitions having claimed the GF MacRae Cup with a - win over Mallaig in June .David Butcher has handed the captaincy to defender Chris MacLennan this season, while the Kyleakin coach will also look to blood youngsters into the side with the likes of Aaaron MacBeth and Nathan Stewart earmarked for inclusion.With a blend of seasoned performers and exciting young talent, Kyleakin are almost certain to be amongst the teams in contention for the title yet again.#It always has to be the league for me # anything  is a bonus.#Having entered the Skye and Lochalsh league as an unknown quantity last season, the reigning champions will start the  campaign as the team to beat.The side will have to adapt to the loss of outgoing player-manager Jamie MacGregor whose contribution on the pitch was understandably overshadowed by his abilities on the touchline as he guided his team to an unexpected championship title.Neil Cameron will take up the mantle of manager and, while the transition might not be an instantly seamless one, the Blues have a large squad of talented players to choose from including a solid spine of goalkeeper Mark Johnston, captain Jamie Young and the attacking talents of Ross Douglas and Andy Cunningham.Defending a title is iniably harder than winning one, but discount Mallaig at your folly. #The lads all know what they are capable of so it#s down to them to do the talking on the pitch.#Graham Campbell#s side look to be a stronger proposition this season having added two players to the squad as well as retaining the players from last season.

Having caught the eye leading the line for Portree during a dficult campaign, Cameron#s killer instinct in front of goal and ability to play as a lone target man might be the perfect tonic for a side whose performances at times lacked a cutting edge. #We were disappointed with our sixth-place finish last season, although we did end strongly. We will be looking to move up the table this season, and will be targeting a top-four spot.#After an arduous season last year, Portree will begin the  campaign under the guidance of new player-manager Mark Macleod.Although the loss of Robbie Cameron will be felt by the side, MacLeod has added a raft of players such as Kenny Palmer, Billy Kehoe and Ali MacKenzie to boost the squad. Youngsters Aaron MacKinnon and Kyle Dick will also provide competition for places as the club look to embark on a new era. #We are obviously building a new team, so our main goal is to bring back those high standards that are expected of Portree. I#m confident there is a cup final in this team this season.#After an exciting end to the last campaign which saw them compete for the title right until the last day of the campaign, Portree Juniors are looking to rebuild their side with an accent on youth.First-team regulars Chris McNab and John Murphy have indicated that they are likely to be available # but pribably on a limited basis. While the loss of last year#s Skye and Lochalsh young player of the season, John Gillies, to Sleat will be keenly felt, Juniors are taking an exciting approach to reshaping the team for the future by blooding the next generation of players.Phil McCaherty says his side could have at least six of the under- team to call upon, including Ryan MacAskill and Connor Gilpin.McCaherty#s ability to bring players together and foster a good team spirit is likely to stand Juniors in good stead for the season ahead. #Our aim is to be competitive. However, the club is fully prepared for the potential inconsistency in performances that playing youngsters may bring.#Two cups and a title charge that lasted until the final day of the season constituted a very good  for Sleat, but DL MacKinnon#s competitiveness means the bar will be set even higher this season for the south Skye side.With the addition of John Gillies to a squad already containing the likes of Ben and Connaire Yoxon and Lachlan MacInnes, it is hard to imagine that Sleat will not go as closenot better than last year in their attempts to capture the league title.The loss of captain Martin MacKinnon, who is convalescing from a serious injury, is a big blow to Sleat. However, the performances of Fraser Graham and Peter MacCusbic mean there is no shortage of defensive quality in the squad. Having impressed with a glut of assists in the under-s league for Broadford, Alex Tully could be the pick of the youngsters emerging for Sleat. #My expectations are as always to win everything in our league and go as far as possible in the Highland Amateur Cup.#Mallaig v Portree # kick-off . pmGA United v Kyleakin # kick-off  pmPortree Juniors v Glenelg # kick-off pmSleat and Strath v North West Skye # kick-off pmGlenelg v Kyle # kick-off pm"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Campbell-Stewart-MacLennan-Co.jpg","title":"skye resident tries to fathom naval","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA resident of Waternish on the Isle of Skye has reported seeing a submarine moving around in continuous circles in Loch Bay for several hours today. after spotting the submarine this morning from his home in Waternish.He said: “We have never seen one in the bay before, we noticed it at about  o’clock this morning and thought it was going out but for most of the morning it has just been circling around.“To be honest, I thought it might have been caught in a lobster pot # I know that sounds silly – now it is just virtually stationary.Michael, who lives in close proximity to Loch Bay, said the submarine was visible through the naked eye from his house but after spotting it he had been keeping tabs on the boat with a pair of binoculars.“I am not a marine expert, but it appears like the engine or whatever is propelling it is spinning, but it looks as though it’s stuck. “When we watched it earlier there were two torrents of water coming out the left and right of the rear astwo engines were running but now it would appear there is just one running and it is just throwing up a lot of water spray.”“I don’t know technically what is wrong with it, but I#m getting the feeling something is amiss here because I can’t see why it would just be where it is.”He added: “We have seen a lot of ships, so I was just assuming that it has something to do with the exercise going on just now.NATO has been carrying out the #Joint Warrior# exercise off the west coast of Scotland since Saturday th March.

It was mainly Ballymena people attendance.  He remembers Johnny Mitchell, who worked in the Waveney Laundry, bringing his friends every week. Johnny also brought musicians from Ballymena to play including Nellie King on piano and George Kernohan on accordion. Morris said: “George, who had a barber shop in Harryville would leave his accordion during the week with his grandmother. He would let me try to play it, upside down as I remember my first attempts! “During the summer months George’s brothers used to visit as well. ACCORDION“They were great singers and often talked about how well other relations were doing who had emigrated and formed a group called the Irish Rovers in Canada. The first time I heard “Bonnie Kellswater” sung was by an older man called Jimmy Fullerton. Great days, great times and a great introduction to performing music.”He continued: “Eugene O’Dornan from the Braid and I played as teenagers in our first band together. Eugene’s sister Maureen entered, or more properly bluffed me into entering a talent contest as I was very shy and horried at the thought. “Anyway the competition went well and from it I joined a Ballymena based band called “The Countrymen” managed by Harry Lynn and George Dillon.  Leo McCaffrey was the compere at the competition. Leo became a great friend and mentor and a major influence on my music career.”In  Morris went with Leo to play in the famous “Blarney Stone” in Vancouver. Members of the Irish Rovers would come into the Blarney Stone as they knew Leo well. Morris said: “I became great friends with Wilcil McDowell, the Irish Rovers’ Accordion player. I was already a fan of Wilcil’s playing as he too occasionally visited my grandmother’s hotel in Carnlough.“It was through Wilcil that I started to play keyboards on Irish Rovers recordings and take part as a guest musician on some of their videos.” When Morris retired from his day job he was delighted to take up an offer in  by George Millar, the bandleader, to join the Rovers. He said: “When Wilcil decided last year to stop touring with the band I moved from keyboards to playing accordion. Touring Canada with the band also meant I was able to meet up with some other Ballymena musicians now living there.“Paul Fynes who was in the Countrymen with me, and Kevin Erwin who played with Leo. Kevin was ill during my last visit and sadly passed away last year. One of the most talented people I have ever played with.”CONCERTCommenting on the concert which took place in Ballymena on March  Morris said: “It was lovely to perform in what I knew as Ballymena Town Hall.“ It was a great concert and I was so pleased it was a such a success, especially for George and Ian Millar. “Never easy playing in your home town with your relations sitting in the front row!“It never ceases to amaze me that after  years the Irish Rovers continue to play to sell out shows throughout Canada and the USA. They are a fabulous band and brilliant people to work with. “George and Ian are proud of being from Ballymena and the town is mentioned at every show. “The Irish Rovers videos, which are broadcast on American television really show off the local area and the Antrim glens. I’m sure this has a real positive impact on Tourism here. “The warm reception in the Mayor’s parlour just before the concert I think is a well deserved honour for the Millar family and it was an honour to attend it.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1733279.jpg--.jpg?1555495975000\n","title":"ballymena young conquerors spring concert","story":"BALLYMENA Young Conquerors Flute Band will be holding its annual concert on Thursday, May  in the Braid Arts Centre Ballymena, commencing at . pm.The band is the town’s oldest surviving music group, having been formed in .

Fans of the Brooke-based Paddy ‘Raff’ have lapped up his BT alter ego ‘Nigel’ in online sketches such as ‘Nigel at the Christmas Market’, ‘Nigel the BT Tout’, as well as the storming stage performances of ‘Paddy and Nigel Act Their Postcodes’.Set for yet another sell-out run of four shows at the city centre’s Limelight venue, Paddy told the Andersonstown News that he is “gobsmacked” at the response to his on stage routines and that of ‘Bravo Tango er’ Nigel. “It’s class,” said Paddy, “I remember when the hosepipe ban was in full effect last year, thinking what kind’ve voice would go with someone who would tout on his neigbours and their over-use of their hose pipe. “The character of Nigel started with a Snapchat filter. This to me looked like some kind’ve posh dude, the mullet, the aviator glasses and moustache. Luckily it was one you could replicate easily as a lot of the filters are quite contorted. “The first one went viral and featured on BBC Trending NI. At the time I didn’t think it would be a recurring character but people really responded to it, they were like ‘you gotta do more with that posh guy’, I just kept going back to it, it’s a pure fluke how it came about,” he said. Since Paddy took to the stage at the Palm House in Belfast and Derry’s Nerve Centre, he has performed to hundreds of comedy fans during a series of three sold-out shows at the MAC theatre in March.  “I remember when the MAC tickets went on sale, I checked the tickets and the map was completely grey, I thought ‘maybe I’ve got that the wrong away about ’, but a second show was penciled in and within two hours of that going onsale we put on a third one. “The Limelight is  people capacity and three of the shows are already gone, the fourth one is approaching sell-out. I’m blown away. Basically I’m responding to the demand that’s out there.”Paddy spoke of how he is working with producers to develop ideas for TV both here and across the water. “I’ve a massive, massive list of ideas for more sketches. I’m sort of a one man band, still a full-time dad and it’s like anything it’s getting the time. I’m making the time for it now, it’s not a nine-to-five job in that you are at the desk. My we and I have fantastic support from our families so that is great to have. “I’ve achieved more than I ever thought I would, it’s not even been a year since the first solo show. I’ve put a lot of effort into this show and want to let as many people come to see it before moving on. At the minute I’m looking at a bigger venue for a new show, possibly towards the end of the year.I’ve loads of ideas and it’s been great to have received the support and reception the show has so far to date had.”Paddy and Nigel at the Limelight takes place on Sunday May .

The President will deliver a speech to mark the historic occasion as the £. million three-storey building in the Gaeltacht Quarter prepares to open its doors to visitors for the first time. Director of Fáilte Feirste Thiar, Harry Connolly, told the Andersonstown News that it was an “honour” to have the President open the centre.“James Connolly lived on the Falls Road just yards away from the location of the new Visitor Centre,” he said. “He was a man of formidable ideas and remarkable vision. Over  years after James Connolly was executed, his values, his ideas and the example he gave us in le are as inspiring and relevant as ever.”Harry Connolly said: “It is entirely fitting and appropriate that the President of Ireland will officially open the James Connolly Visitor Centre and pay tribute to Connolly’s colossal contribution to our nation and to the lives of so many across the world.” As well as the President’s visit,  trade union leaders from  dferent unions have also arrived in the city to attend the opening including General President of the Labourers’ International Union of North AmericaTerry O’Sullivan and Rocco Davis, Vice President and Regional Manager of Pacic Southwest Region of . James Connolly travelled to the US and is strongly linked with the trade union movement in the States.Harry continued: “The realisation of Áras Uí Chonghaile is another major step forward for the success story that is West Belfast tourism. Supported by the Connolly family and funded by Belfast City Council and the US Trade Union Movement, this new visitor centre will have a major social and economic impact on Belfast’s Gaeltacht Quarter, attracting thousands of visitors from across the globe every year. “We are inviting everyone to take part in the James Connolly Parade, leaving Conway Mill at pm on Good Friday and parading along the Falls Road to arrive at Áras Uí Chonghaile at .pm. “Outside the front of the centre a number of guest speakers headed by President Higgins will speak, and Irish singing star Frances Black will perform live along with renowned Belfast balladeer Terry ‘Cruncher’ O’Neill. “We are saying to everyone, from the Falls Road, from Belfast, from across Ireland and from further afield, come along and take part in the parade and attend the opening ceremony outside Áras Uí Chonghaile. Good Friday will be James Connolly Day on the Falls Road and we aim to do him proud.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"taking the crooked glen to crumlin","story":"THROUGH a process of Anglicisation, Crumlin is among the thousands of Irish towns and areas whose place names are virtually lost in translation. Situated in Antrim’s hills, the Crumlin derives its name from the Irish ‘An Cromghlinn’, meaning The Crooked Glen, which is the name adopted by one the town’s most exciting new pubs.Headed up by North Belfast businessman Laurence Burns and his brother Damien, The Crooked Glen is bringing the original meaning of the name Crumlin back into everyday use in the town and breathing new le into one of the Main Street’s most prominent buildings.Laurence has spent the last -years leading operations at the popular city centre nightclub, Thompson’s Garage, and has also worked on a number of the city’s biggest events and festivals, including our own Best of the North awards ceremony. However, when the opportunity to run his own bar and restaurant arose he jumped at the opportunity, and while aiming to bring something new to the area he said paying homage to the town’s Irish-speaking heritage was vital.“I was always trying to keep my ear to the ground so that when a pub came up I would be in contention for it,” he said.“I had done that through Jeeves Limited and then the opportunity came up just before Christmas.“There was an opportunity for me to take it on – along with my brother who is my business partner – and give it a wee bit more care and attention.“It had been O’Connor’s twice before under two dferent businesses. The previous owner was O’Connor and the guy who took it on firstly was O’Connor, so I didn’t want to be the third O’Connor’s and that’s where the Crooked Glen came into it. There’s a big Irish speaking community up in Crumlin and I just thought they would appreciate that the name came from Irish origins. That’s where the name came from and it has gotten a really good response.“I got a logo and then used the boys from North Belfast Graphic to implement the artwork outside on the walls, the menus, and all the rest of it.”He continued: “I fell in love with it the first time I came into it. I just loved the character of it.“The first time I came in was as a customer, I sat downstairs and had a bit of craic with a few of the locals who are now my regulars. They were giving me a bit of stick and saying thatyou’re eating in here you have to keep the fire filled up. We were just having a bit of banter – I actually did get up and put a bit of coal on the fire. I hadn’t even seen upstairs at that stage, but I had my lunch and said to Damien that I had a really good feeling about the place. I knew I liked it right away, I had a feeling for it and I could see the potential.”In terms of its space, The Crooked Glen has it all – a cosy fireside bar, a beautul upstairs restaurant and a fantastic outdoor area. In the short six weeks since taking over the venue, the Burns brothers have implemented an exciting new menu, improved service standards and have lined up a number of talented artists for their weekly live music sessions.“The responses and reviews that I’m getting is that we’ve taken a bit of creativity from Belfast and brought it up into Crumlin – that’s no disrespect to anything that was already up here,” Laurence said.“It’s the first time that things have been done in this way up here. In the restaurant it will be a bit more of a service led experience, downstairs is your good hearty pub grub with the music, the fire and the pints, upstairs you have a bit more of a refined dining experience.”By offering everything from food to live music and sports, The Crooked Glen aims to have “something for everybody” in the town.“I don’t think Crumlin has had that calibre of musician here on a regular basis. We want to bring the best of what we can afford here, we can’t charge on the door, but we’ll put on the best music possible with a ied selection on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.”He added: “Crumlin sometimes feels like you’re in Donegal because it has that country village feeling, but you’re also on the doorstep of Belfast, so people are used to going in and out of the city and sampling what it has to offer.“We’re trying to take the good things that are in Belfast and the good things of village le in Crumlin and combine them into what should be a strong brand in the Crooked Glen.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Noel-.png","title":"the day when the bovedy trailed above our heads","story":"Former De La Salle pupil Noel Connor explains the background to his exhibition The Bovedy Illuminations which can be seen at The Armagh Planetarium until May THE sky always seemed low over our street in Andersonstown, with the Black Mountain looming behind the housing estate, seeming to draw down the sky. And on top of the dark silhouette, the television mast, it’s flashing light a constant presence above my childhood. My friends and I played football in the street constantly. I remember watching my first few live football matches on television and being shocked that they stopped after ninety minutes. Why would you stop But playing in the street on Friday evenings was dficult as it was always especially busy then. At the end of the week the wages were in and everyone arrived in cars and vans and trucks to collect their money. Seamus the bread man in his Barney Hughes van, Tommy the milkman with his terric leather satchel full of loose change slung over his shoulder, and not one insurance man but two, wearing suits and all sweetness and light. Our grocery order would arrive all the way from McAlea’s shop on Divis Street, the Mikado biscuits always lying tantalizingly on top. As many people were going out as coming in, with older brothers and sisters all dressed up, heading downtown for the start of the weekend.So that evening my mates and I took our football down to ‘the Ring’, Koram Ring, a sort of muddy roundabout where our street ended and converged with three other streets. It was a perfect circle of baldy grass, criss-crossed by paths which people used as a shortcuts from street to street.At times, every kid on the street would be there, the McMahon’s, McCann’s, Gilmore’s, Murphy’s, Bannan’s, Allen’s, Casey’s, and me, always me.Not long after we had started playing, the ‘Bovedy’ blazed low across the sky above our heads at that stage a magnicent fireball floodlighting a group of amazed kids. We all stood transfixed, watching it disappear off behind the mountain, having no idea what had just occurred. Back at home, I discovered that no one  had witnessed the event, and over the subsequent days and weeks it was forgotten about. Indeed, recalling the event in much later years, I could find no family member, friend or neighbour who could remember anything of the evening, it was almost asthe subsequent years of violence and political unrest had brutally erased the memory. I almost began to believe that I had created some sort of  memory.But as an visual artist it was too profound an image to be ignored and many years later my research eventually led me to the Armagh Planetarium. Not only did they confirm the event and times and dates, but the actual meteorite which had come to ground on farmland at Bovedy, had been loaned to their collection. I was invited to visit and had the extraordinary privilege of holding the mysterious object which had fireballed across my childhood sky in . Anyone from my generation will recognize the signicance of that year in Northern Ireland, and I have come to regard that event as symbolizing an end to the innocence of my childhood. At that point I had begun to take an interest in art, and had travelled into Belfast with my pocket money, especially to buy my first proper set of paints, from the Educational Supply Store in Fountain Lane. I can imagine that my precious paint box was sitting open on my bedroom windowsill where I kept it and would have been lit up by the passing meteorite. In many ways that image lit the fuse on the work I have produced for this whole project.Having the opportunity to work with the original copy of my old school register, which was completed on that day, has also provided a terric stimulus for the work. Those ink crosses, made by our teacher, registered my ‘presence’ and that of all my friends as the Bovedy crossed the Universe towards us. I captured each tiny mark using microphotography, and then projected them across the surface of the meteorite, photographing the results. These previously insignicant and long forgotten trails of ink were transported and transcribed across fty years of space and time, to create wonderful visual and poetic illuminations.The project provided such a iety of stimulus, that I needed an outcome which could combine image, poetry and sound, and I began experimenting with film and audio recordings. I will be forever grateful to my friend Davy McBride, who was able to work with a class of boys at our old school, now La Salle College, recording them responding to the original class register of th April . That recording became the spine of ‘The Bovedy Illuminations’, the short film I’ve produced for the exhibition.I also wanted a poetic narrative to run throughout the film, at times in two voices, allowing me a dialogue with my fourteen-year-old self. To my amazement I discovered that Nathan Quinn O’Rawe, a current pupil at the school had previously won the prestigious ‘Poetry Aloud’ Award, a national competition to find the best young reader of poetry in Ireland. Throughout the film, Nathan speaks as my younger self. Again I am indebted to Davy for recording us both at the school.Without a doubt, this project would not have come to fruition without the support of Professor David Burton and his colleagues at the Planetarium, and I can’t thank them enough. Having the opportunity to present a complementary exhibition of my photoworks and poetry at the Market Place Theatre and Arts Centre enabled me to further develop my response to the project, and I’mgrateful to Christine Donnelly for her help and support there.www.noelconnor"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38005449.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/foster418.jpg","title":"foster if eu wont negotiate on backstop uk faces nodeal brexit","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

In spring , he began flirting with her and using sexual innuendos.Crown prosecutor Neil Connor told Antrim Crown Court, sitting in Belfast, that this flirtation progressed to text messages. McBride initially sent her images of women both in lingerie and naked, with comments such as: \"I like women who dress up.\"Mr Connor said the teenager was \"somewhat flattered\" by the attention and reciprocated with text messages to McBride. These messages - some of which were sent while she was  - included images of her naked.McBride sent the teenager around  naked images of him and they exchanged what the Crown said were \"graphic\" texts.In these messages, McBride told the girl he wanted to have sex with her, and set out what he wanted her to do to him, and what he wanted her to wear. They then met up in July  \"for the purpose of sex\".After she turned , she and McBride began a consensual sexual relationship, and they continued sending naked images to each other.Mr Connor revealed the relationship continued for around five months - until McBride began a sexual relationship with one of her friends.The complainant, now , went to police in June  and McBride was subsequently arrested.He told police he had been in a sexual relationship with the teenager, but said he believed she was .He also branded their relationship \"a bit of extra-marital fun\".Telling the judge there were \"aggravating factors\", Mr Connor spoke of the -year age gap between McBride and the teenager, and the grooming element which saw her sending him images of herself.Defence barrister, Charles MacCreanor QC, said his client was \"shamed and disgusted by what he has done\". Pointing out that McBride came before the court with a clear record, Mr MacCreanor spoke of the impact the offending has had on McBrides domestic situation and also on his business as \"people dont want to associate with him because of the nature of the allegations\".Judge Miller said that after reading a pre-sentence report, he felt McBride had displayed both \"an apparent lack of empathy\" for the complainant, and a \"self-centred attitude.\"The judge also cast doubt on McBrides claims he believed the girl was  when they began having sex, saying it was his belief McBride deliberately targeted someone \"half his age\" for his own \"deviant sexual interests\".As well as being jailed, McBride was also made the subject of a Sexual Offences Prevention Order for five years."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article37391119.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/road%20closed.jpg","title":"northern ireland traffic latest updates","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

through the roof.\"Disappointingly, many local authorities are now responding to financial reality through further tax rises and reducing services, rather than scaling back top pay.\"Despite many in the public sector facing a much-needed pay freeze to help bring the public finances under control, many town hall bosses are continuing to pocket huge remuneration packages, with staggering payouts for those leaving their jobs.\"There are talented people in the public sector who are trying to deliver more for less, but the sheer scale of these packages raises serious questions about efficiency

crucial for the  councils in Northern Ireland, and senior officers now require signicant skills and competencies.\"Versatile, motivated and productive people delivering high quality, affordable services is the very least the public deserves.\"As a recent independent review of chief officers pay in Northern Ireland showed, after market testing, our pay rates for this group are in keeping with what is needed to retain and recruit.\"No increases therefore were recommended in Northern Ireland.\"Its pleasing that all NIs councils have adopted this prudence, despite the new pressures faced by

Ireland has become a home from home for so many Americans.“We want Ireland to act as a political and economic bridge between the EU and the US. Given our shared language and history, it means the US and the EU can better relate to each other on a political level.”Mr Varadkar added: “Today we are working to preserve all of that which has been achieved in the past and no matter what happens with Brexit, we will do everything we can to prevent theof a hard border.“In this we are backed by countries across the EU and indeed our friends in the United States.“We all want free movement of people North and South and free trade and enterprise, North and South, to continue into the future and forever.”He also said he hoped it would be possible to find a solution for the thousands of undocumented Irish living in the US and those who are in a similar position who come from other countries.“Their welfare continues to be a real concern and priority for us,” he added.“We know the politics of migration is particularly contentious in your country, as it is in so many parts in the world, but we also know the capacity and the power of democracy and politics to bring about great change.”Earlier on Wednesday Ms Pelosi addressed the Irish parliament on the second day of her four day visit to Ireland.Her delegation is set to travel to Northern Ireland on Thursday.Speaking at Dublin Castle, Ms Pelosi said: “We all strive to make the future better for the next generation.“The connection between the United States and Ireland is very precious to us.“We see the Brexit conversation as an aberration and we see a brilliant future ahead working together.”She presented Mr Varadkar with a bespoke bowl printed with doves and added: “It’s all about peace and that is what we are striving for.”"},{"url":null,"title":"batten says ukip is authentic party of brexit ahead of euro elections","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have been told by the airline management to wait for what the bidders plan to do,” she said.Jet Airways pilots have complained that they have not been paid in four months.

The service was followed by a reception at the school.St Columbarsquos is one of four schools, along with St Maryrsquos High School, St Patrickrsquos Grammar and De La Salle High in Downpatrick, which will learn later this month whether they will be merged under a proposal from the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools.Fr McGrady reminded the audience of the strong connection of the history of education in Upper Ards before and after St Columbarsquos was established in January ,.He also spoke of the collegersquos namesake, the Donegal monk Columba.ldquoColumba was a le-long scholar and itrsquos fitting St Columbarsquos is named after him, said Fr McGrady.ldquoIf he was with us today I think he would be very proud to be associated with St Columbarsquos College. As was the case with the Department of Education inspectors, he would recognise the very good and very effective education which the school has provided over the last  years.ldquoHe would admire the good relationships between teacher, pupils and parents and the high standards achieved by students of all abilities, particularly the most vulnerable.Fr McGrady acknowledged the contribution of all involved with the college: governors, PTFA, all staff and pupils, echoing former vice-principal Mrs Margaret Caugheyrsquos view that St Columbarsquos was ldquofamily school, whose door was always open to the community, supporting pupils through the joys, sorrows and their chosen paths in le.He said that many of the staff had spent  years working in the college and added: ldquoIrsquom very conscious also of the presence here today of many of the past and present staff members of St Columbarsquos including our own Fr John McManus, a past member of staff, who preached at the golden jubilee mass  years ago.Fr McGrady told the assembled staff: ldquoYou have all contributed to the reputation of the college. Your presence is a tribute to the strong bonds that have been forged through the past  years.ldquoMany past staff members have sadly gone and many more are enjoying retirement but we have a new wave of teachers who are continuing the work ethic that has been the keystone of our success and you are to be congratulated on your commitment and professionalism..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Archaeological dig uncovers skeletons dating back to 8th century  ","story":"ARCHAEOLOGICAL material found at Downpatrickrsquos Cathedral Hill dates back as far as  years after the birth of Jesus.Work from a Queenrsquos University Belfast team of archaeologists has dated skeletons buried some  years later, indicating a sizeable community living in Downpatrick at the time.The material was recovered during last Augustrsquos four-week excavation and community investigation which attracted , visitors from around the world.Local volunteers played a major role in uncovering the history of the site and there is another opportunity to get involved in another dig.Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin is urging local people, particularly students, to get involved in another dig which is to take place this August.ldquoI visited the archaeological dig on Cathedral Hill several times in August last year and was impressed by the community involvement, the volume of tourist visits and of course the incredible finds being made from our rich early Christian and medieval past, just a stonersquos throw from the traditional site of St Patrickrsquos grave, he said.ldquoItrsquos exciting to hear about the new discoveries that are being made and the Early Christian dates of some of the finds, and I am delighted to announce that a second season of excavation is to be funded by the Special European Union Programmes Body for this August, as part of its PEACE IV Programme, when young people between  and  will be invited to take part in the dig for at least four days. Itrsquos a great experience not to be missed.The material, including the discovery of  skeletons, has thrown up some interesting information on the Benedictine Abbey which occupied the site during the medieval period, as well as tantalising glimpses into the early Christian monastic site that was located there from the eighth century AD.Three trenches were excavated in the immediate vicinity of Holy Trinity Cathedral, two located in the old tennis courts and one located on the grass verge directly in line with the Cathedralrsquos west door, in advance of the replica of St Patrickrsquos Cross being installed.The trench on the verge revealed the existence of a substantial medieval cemetery with  skeletons being uncovered.Three of these were put forward for radiocarbon dating and the dates have recently been ed.The lowermost burial ed a date of - AD which indicates that this person lived and died before the Anglo-Norman invasion of  AD and before the present Abbey church was constructed on the site.This person would have lived at a time when the round tower mdash knocked down when the cathedral was refurbished around  mdash was still in use. The latest burial encountered ed a date of - AD showing that this person lived and died when the site was occupied by the Benedictine Abbey.Analysis of the skeletons is ongoing, but initial results of the latest burial indicate it to be a young, female, adult with severe dental trauma.The excavation in the tennis courts uncovered the kitchen and midden pit of the Benedictine Abbey.Site director Brian Sloan explained: ldquoA rich picture of medieval le was uncovered with masses of animal bone and pottery being recovered. We can use this evidence to build up a picture of the diet and everyday activities of the monks who lived and prayed here. The large pottery sherds have been painstakingly pieced together at QUB giving an idea of the shape, size and decoration of the vessels.He continued: ldquoA rich environmental picture is being established through the processing of the soil samples taken during the excavation. A multitude of blackberry seeds, sloe pips and fish bones have been recovered as well as charred wheat grains.Scientic techniques are now helping to identy and date the finds. An array of metalwork was recovered from the midden pit consisting of copper alloy and corroded iron artefacts, and these have been analysed and x-rayed. This has allowed us to see objects beneath the corrosion and the results have been quite startling. A number of items have been identied, including fine copper alloy dress pins, a socketed arrowhead, a horseshoe, a pair of iron shears and even aof chain with a suspension hook still attached.In addition, three samples mdash charred grain, charcoal and a fragment of twig mdash were put forward for radiocarbon dating.The twig fragment ed a date range of - AD which fits very well with the pottery types recovered from the midden pit. However, the charred grain and charcoal ed very similar dates of - AD and - AD respectively.This indicates that earlier activity relating to the early Christian monastic site of the th Century AD, when the original St Patrickrsquos Cross was erected, is there and waiting to be uncovered.A number of finds have now been placed on display in the High Cross Gallery at Down County Museum, in two new cases funded by the British Museum Trust, while research work continues on the collection of artefacts, dating from the Mesolithicthrough to modern times.This project was supported by the European Unionrsquos PEACE IV Programme, managed by the Special EU Programmes Body .Match-funding for this project has been provided by The Executive Office in Northern Ireland and the Department for Rural and Community Development in Ireland.To find out how to get involved in the excavation in August, contact Down County Museum on   ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Car park plan at ex council base blasted  ","story":"PLANS for a new car park at the site of the former Down Council headquarters in Downpatrick have sparked an angry response from local residents.The site of the local authorityrsquos old base at the Strangford Road is currently being used as an unofficial parking area for bin lorries and other refuse vehicles.Now a planning application has been submitted to formally designate the area as a car park for not only council refuse vehicles, but staff cars as well.Concerned residents who live nearby and Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran have expressed opposition to the move and are seeking an urgent site meeting with council officials to discuss the application.They have described the unofficial parking area in front of the remains of the townrsquos former workhouse as an ldquoeyesore and highlighted the noise created by heavy refuse vehicles starting up in the morning.Council officials say they have sold part of the existing Strangford Road site to the Education Authority to pave the way for the development of Down Highrsquos new multi-million pound campus.They explained that part of the land which has been sold to provide a new main entrance to the school includes an area which is currently used for council staff parking.The local authority confirmed that it is seeking planning approval to develop remaining land at the front and side of the old workhouse to provide parking for staff and its fleet of vehicles.Over the past number of months, council officials have been debating the future of the Strangford Road site mdash where its maintenance depot is also based mdash in secret.But the Recorder understands that potential options include selling both the remains of the workhouse and the maintenance depot to potential investors.While no final decision has been made, the future of large site is due to be one of the many items that will have to be decided by the new council following the May  local government elections.In the interim, council officials are pressing ahead with a proposal to provide additional parking provision at the Strangford Road, with Cllr Curran keen for them to meet with local residents opposed to the move.ldquoThis issue was brought to my attention during a canvass last weekend, he explained. ldquoI also noticed a number of bin lorries parked up and immediately wonderedthere somewhere  they could be located.ldquoBin lorries were never parked here when Down Council was based here and it would appear that when the old administrative headquarters were bulldozed, this area became an unofficial car park, with no consultation with residents.ldquoNow we have an application to formally designate the area as an official car park which, in my opinion, will do nothing for the image of this part of the town. The current area is unkempt and I share residentsrsquo views that it is a bit of an eyesore. I am concerned that what we are looking at here is a permanent bin lorry park.Cllr Curran said that while a number of Strangford Road residents were notied by planners about the plans for the site, there was no formal consultation. He said this must happen as soon as possible.In addition, he said those with ldquounderstandable concerns about the planning application require additional information and revealed he wants to know was an environmental impact assessment conducted as part of the planning application process.Cllr Curran said he believed there was other land which formed part of the local authority-owned site that could be used as a lorry park.He added: ldquoResidentsrsquo concern about this planning application need to be addressed and I fully understand where they are coming from.A council spokesman confirmed that the local authority sold part of its Strangford Road site to the Education Authority to allow the development of the proposed new Down High School.ldquoThe sale includes land which is currently used for staff parking at the front and side of the old workhouse, said the spokesman.ldquoThis planning application is to develop the remaining site under council ownership to provide parking for council fleet and staff vehicles.The council spokesman also confirmed that the future of the Strangford Road site was ldquocurrently under consideration..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Car torched in morning blaze  ","story":"POLICE have issued an appeal for information following an arson attack in Newcastle last week.A BMW car parked at the Burren Meadows area in the resort was set on fire around .am last Tuesday.Police and firefighters attended and the scene of the blaze which was extinguished, but a number of residents in nearby homes were moved out as a safety precaution.As police continue to investigate the blaze and the motive behind it, they have issued a fresh appeal for information.They are particularly keen to hear from anyone who may have been in the Burren Meadows areas either late last Monday evening or during the early hours of Tuesday.Officers are interested in hearing from anyone who may have noticed any suspicious activity at this part of the town with those who can assist PSNI enquiries asked to contact police on the non emergency  number, quoting reference    ..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Charity group celebrates raising huge sum  ","story":"FRIENDS of the Cancer Centrersquos Newcastle fundraising group is delighted to announce it has raised a phenomenal pound, since it began in .

I know several who are now no longer able to do that. Why not leave it so everyone can participate  We have raised this point with the organisers.”He added: “Increasingly there are sporting and social events on a Sunday. We would have a higher view of a Sunday, that it is the Lord’s Day from start to finish.“There’s a growing trend of secularisation. Christians are told ‘sorry mate, we hear what you’re saying but society has moved on’. Sadly, when it comes to religionthere’s a certain type of religious view then it’s disregarded.“There is a determination in the minds of some people to remove the Christian foundations of society. There are some who would disregard itbut others have a more definite agenda of ensuring that we remove it from moral and ethical issues, that we have to move away from a Christian-based society to what they call a ‘rights-based society’ which largely stems from a secular mindset.“There is a disregard and to some extent a contempt.”A spokesperson for Belfast City Marathon stressed that the event is “all inclusive”.\"  \"  Reported On This Day  Years Ago : Soldiers in Dublin charged with murder of a woman in barracks Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"They added: “The Belfast City Marathon management team have been working on changes to both the marathon route and moving the event to a Sunday for a number of years due to feedback from all stakeholders, including athletes, city centre traders and the PSNI. “After a series of consultations, the City Growth and Regeneration Committee approved these changes to further develop and improve the event.“The Belfast City Marathon management team have undertaken a role of engagement with all relevant stakeholders who could be affected by the new route and have received great support from an array of churches and denominations across the city.“Every effort has been made to minimise disruption.”try catch  TrendingCookstown  organisers issue statement on Guy MartinRat is crushed to death in N.I. restaurant -

It is a custom which has been maintained for over  years, passed through generations, and will continue to be upheld for many years to come.”Mr Stevenson will be in attendance at the Ballyronan demonstration.The senior Orangeman added: “We continue to welcome an increasing number of international visitors to our celebrations who are keen to experience first-hand the spectacle of the biggest day in the parading calendar. “High calibre music provided by some of the finest marching bands will only add to the festival atmosphere.

Now, the bridge has several operational regulations like alarm levels ndash we canrsquot balance the high level of noise needed for a bridge and the low level needed for a residential area. This is the reality that the council have to consider and resolve.A Vale of Glamorgan Council spokesman said: ldquoThe swing bridge is maintained and operated by Quay Marinas, who manage the Penarth Quays Marina site.ldquoIt was closed due to a number of safety concerns, with upgrades needed before it can be reopened, including audible warnings.ldquoThe council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report following which our health and safety officers and those from Quay Marinas will discuss possible solutions which may enable the bridge to be reopened in the future. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful.

They will also be supporting local communities and families as once orders are underway, the product will go into mass production in Welsh factories.Much of the product has been made in a family-run steel fabricators in Ferndale in the Rhondda.John said: ldquoI love the fact that the ZIGZAG has been made within  miles of my home in Penarth. Irsquove visited the factory literally hundreds of times in the last three years and that wouldnrsquot have been possibleit was made in China, but what it proves more than anything is that businessmen and women really need to look thoroughly at whatrsquos under their noses.ldquoIrsquove been amazed by the talent Irsquove seen on these shores - there are some incredible businesses here doing some world beating things, and they need our support. Regardless of how you voted in the referendum, whether wersquore in or out we should all be proud of what we produce on this island and Irsquom here to show you that itrsquos possible to create a great product without having to go to the Far East.ldquoIt has taken me three years to develop the ZIGZAG - from the seed of an idea to the living and breathing product you can see today. I want you to support our crowdfunding campaign so we can give a boost to the factories in Wales which have supported our development. Theyrsquore ready to make your ZIGZAG now!Factory boss, Jason Keetch, who runs the factory making the ZIGZAG, said: \"It has been an absolute pleasure working on the ZIGZAG with John.The majority of our workload consists of manufacturing sub components for larger designs so we rarely get to make a recognisably finished product like this. Seeing first hand the progression of the design and working so closely with John on it has made this project feel extra special.ldquoMy whole team are proud that the ZIGZAG is a fully Welsh product and that we have been a part of its story. Wersquore excited to see where it now goes!Those who pledge their support and buy a ZIGZAG in the first -days of the crowdfunder, which ends on Sunday  May, will benefit from an early bird price of pound.To find out more, visit: igg.me at zigzag-oven article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Scottish Labour education spokesman Iain Gray said: ldquoThis is absolutely farcical from John Swinney, and the latest example of him completely botching an issue in the education brief.ldquoThe will of the Scottish Parliament is quite clear ndash it voted to scrap these tests for primary one pupils.ldquoNot only has John Swinney ignored that for months, he is now ignoring his own independent review by pre-empting it.Liz Smith, Scottish Conservative education spokeswoman, called on Mr Swinney to scrap the tests in line with the vote.She said: ldquoWe listened to the voices of teachers and educationalists before that vote, and they did not see P tests as standardised or delivering meaningful results.The Scottish Liberal Democrats said more guidance is the ldquolast thing teachers want.A Scottish Government spokeswoman said changes from the forum recommendations are ldquoto improve practical advice for teachers when planning for and administering the assessments over the coming weeks, as most will take place in May and June.She added: ldquoThe independent review will take any recommendations from the forum into account, however its remit is much wider, focusing on the compatibility of assessments with CfE, the usefulness of the diagnostic information the assessments provide and the future of the assessments..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Primary pupil assessments to be reformed after teacher feedback article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

action ballot planned for   moy park workers  ","story":"More than , workers in Moy Park are to be balloted for strike action as frustration mounts over pay negotiations.The workers, mostly on the two main sites at Portadown and Dungannon, are to be balloted on whether they wish to take strike action within weeks.Moy Park is one of NI’s largest employers and, according to Unite, the union, there has been serious problems with management during negotiations.Sean McKeever, Unite Regional Officer representing his union’s membership at Moy Park sites, said the union would be balloting over ‘unreasonable management demands in ongoing pay negotiations’.“When Moy Park was sold by Brazilian meat-packing giant JBS SA to one of its own subsidiaries, Pilgrim’s Pride Corp of the USA, Unite the union forecasted that this would presage a broader onslaught on workforce terms and conditions. Sadly the accuracy of that forecast is now apparent to every Moy Park worker in NI.“From our first meetings with the incoming management team it was apparent that they were intent on attacking terms and conditions of workers in the region which remain among the best of any workforce in the UK agri-food industry. In recent pay negotiations they have brought forward proposals seeking to undermine Sht Allowances, Sickness scheme, Holiday entitlement, Attendance allowance, Nomi Statutory days and decent breaks – TCs that were hard won by this workforce over many years and which are simply not up for negotiation.“Moy Park’s workforce in NI has a strong and well-organised team of Unite workplace representatives. We recently defeated an attempt to ide maintenance engineers from the bargaining unit and saw off attempts to keep union officials off-site. Management need to think again – this is not a workforce that will stand by as they slash and burn their way in a race-to-the-bottom on rights and entitlements.“The company’s latest annual pre-tax profits were just short of £ million – an enormous increase of  percent on the year previously. Its current owners Pilgrim’s Pride declared net earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of  million in . These are not businesses that are struggling for survival, the attacks on workers’ pay and conditions are simply part of a drive to maximise profits and increase s for corporate shareholders.“Unite is now preparing the roll-out of a ballot on all-out strike action of our more than three thousand members working for Moy Park in NI. Management need to recognise the determination of this workforce before it leads to unnecessary and entirely avoidable disruption to their operations here”, Mr McKeever said.A Moy Park spokesperson said: “We are aware of the recent union statement and we will continue to engage with the union and work towards a negotiated agreement.”Former rugby chief gets MBE for service to sport Coremetrics

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/ub_11.jpg","title":"we need a sea change and this is just the beginning","story":"Posted on Thursday April  by Ulster Business Ulster Business sits down with a host of top femalebusiness leaders at one of Ulster Bank’s DSE dinners to look at the challenges facing women entering the world of business, what change is needed and how far we’ve already come  ‘This is just the beginning’. That’s a general sense of where Northern Ireland and the UK sits as a whole around female entrepreneurship.But it’s also widely agreed that a sea change is needed, from an early level, to develop the next generation of female entrepreneurs, and address a chasm in gender disparity across the business landscape.Sitting in a room with some of Northern Ireland’s female leaders in business during a dinner at Ulster Bank’s Belfast headquarters, the experience, enthusiasm and depth of knowledge which exudes is very clear.But there’s frustration at the challenges and hurdles which continue to prevent senior business and entrepreneurship being played on a level playing field.The gathering of business leaders in Belfast heard one of the challenges is that many women starting up their own companies, don’t consider themselves ‘entrepreneurs’.There’s issues around access to funding, but not only that, it’s about the lack of awareness of the funds which are out there – for both female and male would-be entrepreneurs.There are also some stark figures and findings, including those in the Alison Rose Review of Female Entrepreneurship.The Rose Review, carried out by Alison Rose, deputy chief executive of NatWest Holdings and chief executive, commercial and private banking, found that just one in three entrepreneurs are women, and cast a light on the disparity and challenges facing women of all ages in business, developing ideas, finding the funding, and expanding.It also predicts that closing the entrepreneurial gap between men and women, and creating a level business playing field, could add an additional £bn to the UK economy. On the ground in Northern Ireland, there are positive signs emerging for those at the very beginning of their entrepreneurial journey. Ulster Bank’s own Entrepreneur Accelerator, headed by Lynsey Cunningham, has already helped a raft of people on the road to becoming their own bosses and driving a concept to fruition – and refreshingly, around % of those using the scheme so far are women.The Rose Review has outlined a range of areas which can help realign and balance the start-up market, including investing in a ‘female entrepreneurs’ code – committing financial institutions to the principles of gender equality and transparent reporting of gender funding data.But there seems to be agreement that this sea change can, and should, start right at school – bringing in more hands-on skills and education, as well as fostering entrepreneurship for both boys and girls at an early age.The challenges facing women also raises the issue of ersity, in general, across business and entrepreneurship. It’s fair to say everyone is in agreement that a wide iety of ethnic, religious or sexual backgrounds can only be a positive element for any business or economy.That ersity should also feed into every element and strand of business – from the support at an early stage, to venture capital funding and further company development.While STEM subjects have gotten a bigger push in recent years, the question was posed – why would a school pupil consider starting a business, straight out of school,it’s not taught, fostered or encouraged Looking to the challenges facing successful women in business already, there’s one case in which a company owner – boasting a multi-million pound turnover – says she still faces both conscious and unconscious bias.There’s also a strong sense of talking about failure, rather than just success. It’s something most agree can be a positive step in any entrepreneurial journey, and that a ‘fear of failure’ can hold people back from taking any steps at all.In Northern Ireland, the top level of business leaders among our biggest companies is increasingly male-dominated. The Ulster Business Top  Companies  showed just two of the businesses on the list were headed by women. That number has actually dropped from six, from just a few years ago.But there is something of a gradual change happening in Northern Ireland and across the UK as a whole, albeit slowly. According to Dell, Belfast is among the top  cities for female entrepreneurship. But there’s still a long way to go.Of course, one of the toughest steps in getting an idea off the ground is funding. Crowdfunder is one organisation helping fuel that, and assists small start-ups in getting backing from everyone from friends and family, to the philanthropic who just want to see an idea succeed. It’s partnered with Ulster Bank parent company RBS, offering up reward-based crowdfunding to help test their business ideas.The conversation always comes back to education, key skills and changing the mindset of young people at an early age. If the next generation of school leavers can leave with a positive entrepreneurial attitude, free from any gender bias, then it could go a long way to balancing the breakdown of men and women in top senior roles in the years to come.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

The egg processing business includes big names such as Marks and Spencer and McDonald’s among its customers.Frylite, which started le when Eamon McCay opened a cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises, has seen its turnover increase to £m, with pre-tax profits sitting at £.m. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff.And helping highlight the firms which are still based in Northern Ireland and retain ownership here, accountancy firm Harbinson Mulholland hosted its inaugural HM Homegrown event in Belfast.Showcasing the top  SMEs here, it highlighted that Northern Ireland boasts more homegrown businesses per head of population than Wales, Scotland and all regions across the north of England.And almost % of them operate in just three sectors – manufacturing, construction and wholesale retail. Of the list,  are based in Co Antrim,  in Co Down, nine in Co Tyrone, eight in Armagh and one each in Co Londonderry and Fermanagh.The firms earned just over £m in operating profit in their last reporting year on a turnover of £.bn, while almost £m in wages and salaries was paid out to , employees.  out of the  businesses are family-controlled.Professor Mark Durkin, executive dean of Ulster University Business School, which carried out the research, says the economic impact of the  companies “is considerable generating as they do £.bn in revenues and wages of almost £m”.“These companies act as key enablers of Northern Ireland’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, an ecosystem that Ulster University Business School is proud to be part of. The results of this research demonstrate that just because businesses are local in origin does not imply, they are not global in ambition that because they are from traditional sectors does not mean they are not modern in outlook. Indeed, local homegrown businesses have a sense of place and origin that can really create competitive advantage.“Northern Ireland has demonstrated its ability to sell its agri-food, manufacturing and construction products and services overseas, but internationally successful companies tend not to emerge in isolation. “Domestic competition drives innovation, efficiency and productivity improvements, which in turn develop businesses which can take on any competitor across the world. As a result, there is merit in Government identying the most appropriate ways to support the continued growth of successful clusters to help power the economy into the future.”And Darren McDowell, senior partner of Harbinson Mullholland said that homegrown businesses were the backbone of the practice’s client base.“The Top  list underlines the vibrancy of this group of companies and the spending power they give to local communities through employment.“Attention is often focused on other sectors, but this research demonstrates the continued importance of traditional businesses and industries to the local economy and the extent to which they can be successful.”There’s also a raft of multi-generational businesses here, which have kept both ownership and controlOne of those is food giant Henderson. It’s now in its fourth generation of the Agnew family, and is undergoing further expansion at its Mallusk headquarters. But while it’s very much a family affair, the company is now the sixth largest Northern Ireland business, according to last year’s Ulster Business Top  – with turnover of £m.Martin Agnew told Ulster Business: “It’s important for us as a family to continue to run our business with the same values on which Henderson Group was established by my great-grandfather, John Henderson. We’re also proud that we have built a sustainable business which continues to proactively develop and expand, and provides employment for over , people in Northern Ireland.”    More than  years ago, John Henderson set up a stall selling butter, eggs and cheese – he was a well-known figure and frequently was a judge of cheese and butter at the annual Balmoral Show.That subsequently progressed into a stall at St George’s Market in Belfast, and then in , the business was incorporated as a limited company.In , William Agnew married John Henderson’s daughter, and in  William joined the company as a salesman, taking a controlling interest when John Henderson retired three years later. A few years later in  John Henderson, founder of the company died at the age of .Now, the company owns a range of brands – notably SPAR and Vivo – and has spent millions in the last few years expanding its operations.Operating out of its head office in Mallusk, it employs , people across Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
