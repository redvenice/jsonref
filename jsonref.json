Today it’s an incredibly multicultural district on the verge of gentrification, boasting luxury high rises with spectacular riverside views.My family – English mother, Nigerian father and seven siblings – lived on Eglinton Road, which wended its way to the vast expanse of Woolwich Common at one end and a parade of shops at the other. My first primary school, Notre Dame Convent, was next door to our house. My second primary school, Plumcroft, was a 10-minute walk up Eglinton Hill. My next school, Eltham Hill Girls’ Grammar, took 20 minutes on the bus. My local youth theatre was a short walk, and the only relative we visited was my maternal grandmother, a 15-minute bus journey away in Abbey Wood. The library, where I stocked up on books every week, and St Peters church, where I went for Catholic indoctrination on Sundays, were both less than a 15-minute walk away. Holidays were unaffordable and I don’t think I travelled to the centre of London, other than for a couple of school trips, until my teens. My world was small, contained and familiar.Woolwich library saved me from the boredom of uneventful weekends and long summer holidays, especially as we weren’t allowed to play outside our house because of my father’s fears for us in a racially hostile environment. Noel Streatfeild’s Ballet Shoes was an early favourite but I can’t remember other childhood books. In my teens I bought cheap second-hand books in a local shop, such as Thor Heyerdahl’s The Kon-Tiki Expedition, Aku-aku and Fatu Hiva, which transported me a million miles beyond my suburban parameters and inspired what would become a life-long love of travelling.I loved Tennyson, and performed in plays by Dylan Thomas and Shakespeare. I read their words aloud in bed at night, enjoying the drama and rhythm of their language. The soaring choral music and incandescent poetry of daily mass at the Convent from age four to nine, and weekly church services until I was 15, were also subliminal linguistic influences. When I came across secondhand copies of James Baldwin’s Go Tell It on the Mountain and Buchi Emecheta’s Second Class Citizen, I was first introduced to writers who wrote from black perspectives, which marked the beginning of my racial awakening, having lived through an overwhelmingly white childhood.This year Greenwich and Docklands international festival commissioned me to be the Woolwich laureate for this year and to write about it. Walking the streets of my former home town is like visiting a memory map of my childhood.I left at 18 and have never lived anywhere else for longer. Streets, parks, public spaces and old buildings stir up memories. I feel deeply nostalgic for the ways in which this town shaped my childhood and gave me the safe foundation to go forth and explore the rest of the world.• Bernardine Evaristo’s Girl, Woman, Other has been shortlisted for the Booker prize."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d4cc98160107d05c1296a91eb825f50c9442e9f4/1205_781_2451_1471/master/2451.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=507a29824b6e0a275162da16a497480a","title":"exclusive john le carre new novel brexit intrigue agent running in the field","story":"Agent Running in the Field, due out next month, reflects ‘the isions in Britain, and between Britain and Europe’Just as intrigue over Brexit is expected to reach peak intensity next month, Britain’s master spy novelist John le Carré will be releasing a new novel, set in 2018, where the UK is ruled by “a minority Tory cabinet of 10th-raters”, and the country’s new prime minister Boris Johnson is at that point merely “a pig-ignorant foreign secretary”.An early extract from Le Carré’s 25th novel, Agent Running in the Field, is published in Saturday’s . It shows Nat, a 47-year-old member of Britain’s Secret Intelligence Service (MI5), revealing his career choices to his daughter. As she picks away at his beliefs, Nat admits to serious reservations about the idea of England “as the mother of all democracies”, describing the country as in freefall, with “a minority Tory cabinet of 10th-raters … Labour no better. The sheer bloody lunacy of Brexit.”Le Carré’s editor at Viking, Mary Mount, said that the novelist “doesn’t pull his punches” when it comes to Johnson.“The thing about Le Carré is that he’s always been as much at home in Europe as Britain. A man with his experience of the cold war could not walk away from the isions in Britain, and between Britain and Europe … After the referendum, there was no choice for him except to look at where we are now,” she said. “It is incredibly prescient, and a very emotional book in terms of how connected he feels to the history of Britain and Europe. There’s no looking away, he addresses the very current political crisis.”Le Carré has long been a critic of Brexit, putting his name in May to an open letter in which authors urged readers to support the EU. But he has always been clear that “story and character must come first” in his novels – although he told David Hare in 2001: “I am now so angry that I have to exercise a good deal of restraint in order to produce a readable book.”In Agent Running in the Field, Nat plays badminton regularly with an introspective young man, Ed, who hates Brexit and Trump and, said Mount, is “seeking a way to fulfil his ideals”.“It’s not bleak because Le Carré does believe in the young in this book … there’s a sort of faith in certain kinds of idealistic people, so I definitely don’t think it’s his bleakest book. I think it’s ferocious about the political establishment, that’s where he puts real force,” she said. “He understands people’s motivations. He’s always been very good at human frailty. The thing I find most exhilarating is the way he sees through people, not just in a political sense. He gets to the nub of what people’s motivations are. And it’s very thrilling.”‘Steff, there’s something about me that your mother and I feel it’s time you knew.’‘I’m illegitimate,’ she says eagerly.‘No, but I’m a spy.’She too is staring ahead of her. This wasn’t quite how I meant it to begin. Never mind. I say my piece as drafted, she listens. No eye contact so no stress. I keep it short and cool. ‘So there you are, Steff, now you have it. I’ve been living a necessary lie, and that’s all I’m allowed to tell you. I may look like a failure, but I do have a certain status in my own Service.’ She doesn’t say anything. We reach the top, uncouple and set off down the hill, still nothing said. She’s faster than I am, or likes to think she is, so I let her have her head. We meet up again at the bottom of the lift.Standing in the queue we don’t speak to each other and she doesn’t look in my direction, but that doesn’t disconcert me. Steff lives in her world, well now she knows I live in mine too, and it’s not some knacker’s yard for Foreign Office low-flyers. She’s in front of me so she grabs the T-bar first. We have barely set off before she asks in a matter-of-fact voice whether I’ve ever killed anyone. I chuckle, say no, Steff, absolutely not, thank God, which is true. Others have, if only indirectly, but I haven’t. Not even arm’s length or third flag, not even as the Office calls it, deniable authorship.‘Well if you haven’t killed anyone, what’s the next-worst thing you’ve done as a spy?’ – in the same casual tone.‘Well, Steff, I suppose the next worst I’ve done is persuade chaps to do things they might not have done if I hadn’t talked them into it, so to speak.’‘Arguably. Depends which side of the fence you’re on.’‘Such as what, for instance?’‘Well, betray their country for starters.’‘And you persuaded them to do that?’‘If they hadn’t persuaded themselves already, yes.’‘Just chaps, or did you persuade female chaps too?’ – which if you’d heard Steff on the subject of feminism is not as light-hearted as it might otherwise sound.‘Largely male chaps, Steff. Yes, men, overwhelmingly men,’ I assure her.We have reached the top. We again uncouple and descend, Steff streaking ahead. Once more we meet at the bottom of the lift. No queue. Until now she has pushed her goggles up on to her forehead for the ride. This time she leaves them in place. They’re the mirrored kind that you can’t see into.‘Persuade how exactly?’ she resumes as soon as we set off.‘Well, we’re not talking thumbscrews, Steff,’ I reply, which is pilot error on my part: Humour at serious moments is simply an escape route as far as Steff’s concerned.‘So how?’ she persists, gnawing at the subject of persuasion.‘Well, Steff, a lot of people will do a lot of things for money and a lot of people will do things for spite or ego. There are also people who do things for an ideal, and wouldn’t take your money if you shoved it down their throats.’‘And what ideal would that be exactly, Dad ?’ – from behind the shiny goggles. It’s the first time for weeks that she’s called me Dad. Also I notice that she is not swearing, which with Steff can be a bit of a red warning light.‘Well, let’s say, just for instance, somebody has an idealistic vision of England as the mother of all democracies. Or they love our dear Queen with an unexplained fervour. It may not be an England that exists for us any more, if it ever did, but they think it does, so go with it.’‘Do you think it does?’‘Well, who wouldn’t have, for Christ’s sake?’ I reply, stung by the suggestion that I’ve somehow failed to notice that the country’s in free fall. ‘A minority Tory cabinet of tenth-raters. A pig- ignorant foreign secretary who I’m supposed to be serving. Labour no better. The sheer bloody lunacy of Brexit’ – I break off. I have feelings too. Let my indignant silence say the rest.‘Then you do have serious reservations?’ she insists in her purest tone. ‘Even very serious. Yes?’Too late I realise I have left myself wide open, but perhaps that was what I wanted to achieve all along: to give her the victory, acknowledge I’m not up to the standards of her brilliant professors, and then we can all go back to being who we were.‘So if I’ve got this right,’ she resumes, as we embark on our next ascent, ‘for the sake of a country that you have serious reservations about, even very serious, you persuade other nationals to betray their own countries.’ And as an afterthought: ‘The reason being that they don’t share the same reservations that you have about your country, whereas they do have reservations about their own country. Yes?’At which I let out a merry exclamation that accepts honourable defeat while simultaneously asking for mitigation: ‘But they’re not innocent lambs, Steff! They volunteer. Or most of them do. And we look after them. We welfare them. If it’s money they’re after, we give them a pot of it. If they’re into God, we do God with them. It’s whatever works, Steff. We’re their friends. They trust us. We provide for their needs. They provide for ours. It’s the way of the world.’But she’s not interested in the way of the world. She’s interested in mine, as becomes apparent on the next ride up: When you were telling other people who to be, did you ever consider who you were?’‘I just knew I was on the right side, Steff,’ I reply."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9860b33797faa754668f909e4c2f0dc49d6a4d1d/1885_553_2074_1244/master/2074.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8f744b6552b0a04e473ba432eb7acd3","title":"samantha power former us ambassador un interview","story":"Harvard Square in high summer is crisscrossed with tourists, but inside the university all is serene. Those academics who stay behind to work can enjoy the empty seminar rooms, loose deadlines and short queues at the cafeteria.Samantha Power used to dread such periods of calm. The former US ambassador to the United Nations, and foreign policy and human rights adviser to Barack Obama, was afflicted for most of her adult life with intense anxiety attacks that left her unable to catch her breath, as well as inexplicable but excruciating back pain. She called them “lungers” – a term coined by a former boyfriend who witnessed her struggling to draw air into her lungs.The symptoms would ambush her during the holidays, and later, while she was a freelance correspondent covering the Bosnian war, when the shelling stopped. “I had them in the summer of 1995 when there was a brief ceasefire,” she says. “I was like, what is wrong? I can’t breathe. There’s a ceasefire and I can’t breathe. That should have been a clue that something was a little bit amiss.”The panic attacks persisted in the rare lulls during the hectic years of her stellar career that followed. At 48, Power has now written a memoir, The Education of an Idealist, that charts not only her steep upward trajectory, but also her excavation of her Irish immigrant roots, where the clues to her bouts of breathlessness and pain lay hidden. She doesn’t believe in neat ideas of “closure” – “There’s no moment where you just tie a bow around that stuff” – but she has noticed that since burrowing into her childhood, the demons have remained largely at bay.“This period, after finishing the book, would be a perfect candidate,” she says. “But it’s really abated a lot.” The pressure will return however, as the book is published and scrutinised, because it will be not just the painful episodes from Power’s youth that are being dissected, but also the decisions taken by the Obama administration that were at odds with her own beliefs and recommendations.Before entering government, Power had a single all‑encompassing preoccupation: how to respond to genocide and mass atrocities. It was watching TV pictures of the Chinese government crushing the Tiananmen protests in June 1989, and the famous image of a lone protester standing in front of a tank, that turned her from sports journalism to foreign policy. It was the unfolding genocide in Bosnia that drew her there as a 23-year-old freelancer.I first met Power in Bosnia in the 1990s. We were part of a shifting group of journalists and aid workers who set up home in a Sarajevo bed and breakfast called The Hondo. Power was a decade or so younger than most, but even then was full of self-confidence and optimism about what she could achieve. She was already focusing on how she might change events rather than merely describe them. Looking back, she puts that drive down in part to a short stint working at a Washington thinktank, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, and the influence of its president at the time, Morton Abramowitz, a retired diplomat who became her mentor. “I think it was because of Mort that I had this annoying habit, which was to be constantly thinking: ‘What should Washington be doing?’ Which was ridiculous for a twentysomething stringer who barely knows how to file.”When, at the height of the war, Power left Bosnia for Harvard Law School, one older male reporter told her – somewhat derisively but more prophetically than he could have imagined – that she was on her way to becoming secretary of state. His implication that she was a calculating careerist still rankles: “It drove me crazy. It just seemed absurd but it did kind of follow me in a way that I found very discomfiting,” Power says. “I know this probably sounds not believable but I sincerely wanted policymakers to do something about the specific horror show in front of me.”At Harvard she imagined being a war crimes prosecutor at The Hague. “The idea was you go to law school and you go get the bad guy somehow.” But she became absorbed instead in the question of why and how successive US administrations since the second world war had failed to respond effectively to genocide, for all the vows of “never again”. So she dropped out of the law course and embarked on what ended up being a five year project on genocide. It culminated in her book A Problem from HellHer prominence caught the attention of the then senator Obama, who recruited her as a foreign policy adviser. But his rise to the presidency, and her ascent alongside him to the White House and then the UN, took her from foreign policy theory to practice, with all the compromises that entailed.One of the darkest clouds that hangs over the legacy of the Obama administration is Syria. Its decision not to intervene to try to stop the slaughter was arguably the most consequential. Power argued for action but ended up on the losing side, drawing accusations of betrayal and hypocrisy from many former supporters and colleagues. The US gave limited support and training to rebel groups, but made no direct military intervention, even after President Bashar al-Assad crossed Obama’s “red line” on chemical weapons, killing hundreds of people in rebel-held suburbs of Damascus with a sarin gas attack in the summer of 2013.Power’s memoir reveals for the first time just how close-run that decision was. Obama resolved to carry out air strikes in the aftermath of the chemical weapon attacks, but they were put on hold while a team of UN inspectors investigated Damascus. When they eventually left, having confirmed the use of sarin, Power rushed to call Obama’s national security adviser, Susan Rice, unaware that by then the pendulum had begun to swing away from intervention. “I call Susan and I can’t reach her, and I say to her assistant: ‘It’s really urgent because I know we are still going forward.’ And she’s just totally unreachable,” Power recalls.By the time Rice called back, Obama had changed his mind. David Cameron had lost a parliamentary vote on UK involvement in military action. Details of the planned strikes had leaked from the Pentagon, and Democrats were telling the president there was no appetite in their home states for military action. The president decided to go to Congress, which voted against giving him a mandate. “The conspiracy theorists believe that he wanted to fail. And they rightly see him as somebody sceptical of military entanglement,” she says. “But he absolutely thought he was going to succeed.”In A Problem from Hell, Power had written admiringly of the US diplomats who had resigned over US inaction in the face of the Bosnian genocide. When her turn came to step down, she decided against it. She felt she could still achieve results by continually pushing for human rights to be central in foreign policy making. “There was so much else we were able to do.”Power argues that it is impossible to know what might have happened had the US taken action. The consequences of not intervening are clear however. The Russians and Iranians have moved in to prop up Assad and help him wipe out the rebels along with hundreds of thousands of civilians, helping fuel the rise of the Isis caliphate. The exodus of refugees has destabilised the region and Europe, prompting a racist backlash exploited by populist politicians. “So with that logic of hindsight being 2020 then I think indeed we should have tried to push the envelope a little bit more,” she says.What distinguishes Power’s new book from most diplomatic memoirs is that the figure at the centre of these global political developments is a flawed, flesh-and-blood human being, plagued by personal problems. She details visits to therapists on the same page as debates about military intervention.The pressures of working in the Obama White House were heightened by the tension of trying to start a family with her husband Cass Sunstein, a fellow Obama aide, author and law professor. In the memoir we find her sprinting from policy meetings to IVF appointments and slipping into White House toilets with pregnancy tests. The couple succeeded in having two children Declan, born in 2009, and Rían in 2012.Power also seems more prepared than most of her male counterparts to talk about her mistakes. Her public career almost came to an end during the 2008 presidential campaign when, in an interview with the Scotsman, she took a call from a fellow Obama aide about the primary battle with Hillary Clinton, and called Clinton a “monster”.“It was such a rookie mistake,” she says, still kicking herself after more than a decade. Power was fired. “Suddenly to fall flat professionally in such a highly public way and to have no job ... I was just like a wandering person,” she remembers. “All my dreams of the future, all the campaign stops I was going to do and the fundraisers I was going to host and the help I was going to give this amazing team and this amazing candidate.” Power mouths the sound of an explosion. “It was suddenly an empty calendar.”The experience has left its mark. She calls it “Scotsman PTSD”. On plane journeys, Sunstein would walk in front of her to the toilet so she couldn’t be identified by fellow passengers. “I’m still much less free in public … I feel very much on guard,” she says. “But some of that was good. I was too trusting.”Obama quickly forgave her transgression and brought her into the White House, where she had to overcome her lack of experience. On her way to her first Oval Office meeting she realised she had no idea where the room was within the White House. She Googled a Washington Post floorplan of the building and still ended up on the wrong floor.But the emotional core of the memoir is set many years before the Obama administration and a long way away from the White House, in Dublin, where Power’s parents’ marriage fell apart over her father’s alcoholism. Power spent many days in her childhood doing her homework in a Dublin pub while her father, Jim, “brilliant, dashing and charismatic”, lined up pints of Guinness and held court. Her mother, Vera Delaney, a determined figure, fled to the US with Samantha and her younger brother to escape Jim’s downward spiral. On a return trip to Ireland, their father seized the opportunity to try to wrest custody, leading to a Christmas Eve showdown on his doorstep, and a brutal choice for the children.The 10-year-old Samantha obeyed her mother and walked away from her father. Five years later, he died alone, leaving his daughter feeling responsible for his death. She only discovered when she was writing the book that he was found lying on her bed. “There was just this fear that I was carrying and on one level, still carry,” she says. But, in writing the memoir, “I learned things I didn’t know.”Other than telling her story, Power’s broader purpose is a call to action during a time of despair, as Donald Trump lays siege to what is left of the liberal order at home and abroad. “I would like to make people feel, when they read the book, that they can do something about the problems around them,” she says.She will campaign for the Democratic cause in swing states and plans to spend the coming years teaching at Harvard, including a course on effecting change, taught with her husband. And after that she would consider a return to government or even elected office. “I think the defining crises of our time require good people who care and who are willing to put themselves on the line.” But her caveat, the first lesson from the education of this idealist, is that even if you put yourself on the line “it doesn’t always work out.”• The Education of an Idealist by Samantha Power is published by HarperCollins (RRP £20) .

And good fun too. Edward St Aubyn, snubbed by Booker judges in 2006 for the finale to his Patrick Melrose series, At Last, took revenge with the 2014 satire Lost for Words. That novel depicted clownish judges deciding which book, from a terrible shortlist, should win a thinly veiled version of the Booker.This week’s decision by Booker judges to shortlist The Testaments, Margaret Atwood’s much-anticipated sequel to her 1985 feminist dystopia The Handmaid’s Tale, might seem similarly worthy of derision. The book hasn’t even been published yet. Apart from 800 copies leaked to Amazon in the US, what takes place between its covers will be kept from most readers until its global release on 10 September – her publishers having broken with convention by not bringing the publication date forward once the novel was known to be in the running. Atwood, shortlisted for the Booker six times and winner with The Blind Assassin in 2000, is one of the most feted living novelists, so hardly needs the award’s imprimatur or £50,000 prize money. The novelist Amit Chaudhuri argued last year that the Booker is not fit for purpose. “The idea that a ‘book of the year’ can be assessed annually by a bunch of people – judges who have to read almost a book a day – is absurd, as is the idea that this is any way of honouring a writer.” Aesthetic judgments are subjective, which is one reason why prize organisers are right to see ersity on judging panels as important. Inidual tastes aside, Chaudhuri argued that literary value has increasingly become subordinate to commercial considerations. The Testaments can certainly be expected to succeed on these terms. Thanks in part to the Hulu adaptation of The Handmaid’s Tale, but also in light of political developments in the US and elsewhere, Atwood’s novel has become newly pertinent. Offred’s white bonnet and red cape have become real-life symbols of feminist resistance from Northern Ireland to Argentina.But while it is a pity that keen readers have not yet been able to read The Testaments, this year’s contest remains an exciting prospect. First won 50 years ago by PH Newby with Something to Answer For, the Booker has changed with the times, and in recent years has come in for a good deal of justified criticism after changing its rules so that American as well as Commonwealth and Irish authors can enter.Concerns remain about the increased difficulty, for non-US English-language novelists, of accessing what remains a vitally important shop window. But for now at least the signs are good. Last year’s deserving winner was the little-known Northern Irish writer Anna Burns. On this year’s shortlist, along with Atwood and another former winner, Salman Rushdie, is Lucy Ellman’s Ducks, Newburyport – a novel rejected by her regular publisher before being taken up by a tiny independent – and with most of its 1,000 pages taken up by just eight sentences."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a2078b55955f4c435fd41449cad9e7917788b357/0_0_6826_4096/master/6826.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=edc09bae8fe1f25adc7026e9226ce3ea","title":"50 best things to see this autumn cats joker kanye ad astra lizzo skepta goldfinch frozen charli xcx","story":"Introducing this season’s best culture, from Steve McQueen going back to school to Cher being ... Cher by  Alex Godfrey,  Ellen E Jones,  Michael Cragg,  Hannah J Davies,  Harriet Gibsone,  Miriam Gillinson,  Jonathan Jones and  Lyndsey WinshipAt last, fans can witness Brad Pitt in space. Ad Astra is this season’s big-budget sci-fi, but it’s far from breezy multiplex bait. Director James Gray is a maverick, a singular film-maker yet to make any creative compromises. This one has Tommy Lee Jones as Pitt’s rogue astronaut dad, Donald Sutherland warning of “the endless void” (bring it on), plus Liv Tyler, possibly atoning for Armageddon. With cinematography by Interstellar’s Hoyte van Hoytema and music by Max Richter, it’ll be a classy joint. AGOut 18 SeptemberBaby Driver’s Ansel Elgort leads this all-star adaptation of Donna Tartt’s devastating, Pulitzer-winning book. Elgort is Theodore, the boy whose life goes haywire when he nicks a painting from New York’s politan Museum of Art after his mum is killed in a terrorist attack. It’s directed by Brooklyn’s John Crowley, and the cast includes Nicole Kidman, a guarantee of quality these days, plus kid of the hour Finn Wolfhard. AGOut 27 SeptemberExpect an onslaught of colourful uppers and downers (mostly downers) in this Judy Garland biopic. Here we find the legendary performer down on her financial luck and reluctantly living in London to play a series of sold-out concerts. She comes to us in the form of Renée Zellweger, looking and sounding uncannily like her, while we also get Jessie Buckley who, after Beast and Wild Rose, is reason to watch anything. AGOut 4 OctoberDespite its lead character’s lauded status, this is blessedly unrelated to the DC cinematic universe, a tonal U-turn from the gaudy glitz we’ve been subjected to from that stable. Conceived and directed by Todd Phillips, this Joaquin Phoenix-starring, Scorsese-tinged drama, written by Phillips and Scott Silver (8 Mile, The Fighter), explores how someone might end up a psychotic murderous clown. Unshackled by superhero tropes, it looks delightfully troubling. AGOut 4 OctoberNearly a decade after Four Lions exploded the cliches of movie terrorism, super-satirists Chris Morris and Succession’s Jesse Armstrong reunite for this black comedy about Homeland Security. A fresh-from-drama-school Marchánt Davis stars as the unarmed leader of a small Miami commune who poses no real threat to the US government. That is, until an FBI officer (Anna Kendrick) spots an opportunity to impress her boss. EEJOut 11 OctoberDirector Ken Loach’s follow-up to the Palme d’Or-winning I, Daniel Blake is another gut-punch drama about struggling families and, this time, all of us internet shoppers are implicated. When Ricky (Kris Hitchen) becomes a delivery driver, he discovers the lie in the gig economy’s promise of self-determination. At age 83, Loach is more relevant than ever a fact that bodes well for world cinema and terribly for modern Britain. EEJOut 1 NovemberIn 2013, Frozen’s tale of a strong sibling bond melted hearts to become the highest-grossing animated film of all time. Now the royal sisters are back – plus Olaf the sunbathing snowman, of course – and embarking on a new quest. When Elsa hears a strange sound calling to her from the north, she ventures beyond the borders of the magical queendom of Arendelle to discover the origins of her icy powers. EEJOut 22 NovemberThe second nicest guy in America (Tom Hanks) plays the first nicest guy in America (Mr Rogers) in this film about the much-beloved children’s TV presenter. In 1998 a journalist (named Lloyd Vogel in the film) was sent to interview then-70-year-old Fred Rogers for an Esquire magazine profile, and the encounter transformed his outlook on life. The Americans’ Matthew Rhys co-stars as Vogel. EEJOut 6 DecemberGod only knows how JJ Abrams is going to pull this off. Returning to the series he resurrected with The Force Awakens, here he has to complete Carrie Fisher’s arc with cutting-room floor footage from Episode VII, wrap up a nine-film saga, and please an impossible-to-please fanbase. The involvement of the original trilogy’s characters – The Emperor (dead, but whatever), Lando Calrissian and, probably, Ghost Luke – provides the nostalgia, while Adam Driver provides the sexually frustrated oddness. AGOut 19 DecemberIf the trailer alone had us squirming with nauseated glee, what will the release of the film do? This screen adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s long-running stage musical brings together the varied talents of Judi Dench, Idris Elba, Taylor Swift and James Corden, playing CGI-feline-human hybrids on one fateful night for their tribe. Clearly Cats has the potential to be an exquisitely uncomfortable watch, but might it be so bad, it’s puuuurfect? EEJOut 20 DecemberFamed for her 6am house-party bangers (Boys, After the Afterparty, I Love It), the songs to emerge so far from Charli XCX’s collab-heavy third album proper swap uppers for downers. The Lizzo-assisted Blame it on Your Love dishes the flak for a failed romance Cross You Out, with Sky Ferreira, noisily dismisses a toxic relationship while Gone sees Charli and Christine and the Queens muse on anxiety over crackling, metallic electropop. It’s still a party, just one with a bit more depth. MCOut 13 SeptemberAnnounced on Twitter by his official PR, AKA wife Kim Kardashian, Kanye West’s ninth album looks set to double down on his recent move into the evangelical as showcased by his gospel-infused Sunday Service gigsfashion shows. Recent Pusha T collab, Coming Home, also suggests a return to the sample-heavy, retro soul-feel of The College Dropout era but, this being Kanye, all bets are off. MCOut 27 SeptemberIt was when Tegan and Sara were researching their forthcoming memoir, High School, that the Canadian twins stumbled across two dusty old cassette tapes featuring songs they had written between the ages of 15 and 17. With some minor tweaks, they have re-animated the punk-hued songs with an all-female cast of collaborators to create not just a time capsule but a clean slate for the future. MCOut 27 SeptemberDetroit rapper Danny Brown doesn’t care about expectations. His last album, 2016’s dense, sonically splenetic Atrocity Exhibition, referenced everyone from Joy Division to the Stooges, while this follow-up is executive-produced by the equally genre-agnostic Q-Tip. Expect the WTF quota to be increased by the presence of rapper-producer and kindred spirit JPEGMAFIA. MCOut 4 OctoberAt a recent gig by her label boss Mark Ronson, 20-year-old Brooklynite Mikaela Straus, AKA King Princess, got up on stage, vaped and then left without singing a note. Rules are for squares, basically, and it’s this sense of louche cool that has earned Straus a fevered following. It helps, too, that her songs are full of character, lurching from loping R\u0026ampB (last year’s excellent queer anthem Pussy Is God) to the off-kilter strut  of her debut album’s title track. MCOut 25 OctoberSince making his return to the live arena in 2017 after a five-year UK absence, the fz pseudotimestretch+e+3 hitmaker has barely stopped chasing that festival coin around the world, even confusing sun-burned pop fans at this year’s Coachella. He returns to his homeland for two shows in cavernous warehouses, ie the perfect locations for some head-scrambling beats and perhaps the chance to rub shoulders with day-one fans Madonna and Kylie Minogue. MCPrintworks, SE16, 14 September Mayfield Depot, Manchester, 20 SeptemberFourteen years after her farewell tour, actual legend and all-caps Twitter enthusiast Cher returns to the UK for the knowingly titled Here We Go Again tour. Ostensibly in support of recalibration of the very concept of camp, 2018’s Abba covers album Dancing Queen, it also promises the hits (Believe as an encore? You betcha), a ludicrous array of costume changes and – fingers crossed – some between-song banter. MCThe O2, SE10, 20 \u0026amp 21 October touring to 3 NovemberTwo parts pop star and one part motivational speaker, 2019 has belonged to Lizzo, whose single Juice was as ubiquitous as her shiny silver sidekick Sasha Flute. Third album Cuz I Love You also made her a proper star in the United States – helped by the single Truth Hurts appearing in Netflix romcom Someone Great – while a euphoric Glastonbury appearance cemented her as a live must-see. MCO2 Academy Brixton, SW9, 6 \u0026amp 7 November touring to 11 NovemberFresh from sampling Sophie Ellis-Bextor on his latest album, Ignorance Is Bliss, Skepta steps up to pop star-sized venues for the supporting tour. His recent Manchester international festival collaboration Dystopia987 created a sort of theatre-rave hybrid billed as “a waking dream”, representing what he called a “singular vision of the future: deep, dark, radical and riveting”. MCMayfield Depot, Manchester, 23 November touring to 29 NovemberNo other British artist has inspired the modern imagination as profoundly as Blake. His portrait of Newton mapping the cosmos with giant iders is one of the world’s favourite images of science. His insistence on the value of visions and dreams influenced everyone from Aldous Huxley to Jim Morrison and Patti Smith. Blake’s art is fiery, imagistic and heretical – a delight for the inner eye. JJTate Britain, SW1, Wednesday 11 September to 2 FebruaryThe Turner prize hits a town strongly associated with its namesake. If the ghost of JMW Turner wanders in from the wild winter shore, it may be confused by art’s many forms in the 21st century, from the political sound art of self-described “private ear” Lawrence Abu Hamdan to Tai Shani’s multimedia project inspired by medieval feminism. Meanwhile, Oscar Murillo uses painting to reveal the dark side of globalisation and Helen Cammock tells a women’s history of the Troubles with film and photography. What do you make of that, Mr Turner? JJTurner Contemporary, Margate, 28 September to 12 JanuaryThis is an exciting departure from recent commissions in Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall. We have had a string of interactive projects that avoided the traditional gratifications of art. Now here is a proper artist who uses vivid imagery to tell powerful stories about race in America. Walker’s tableaux revive the archaic Victorian craft of the cut-paper silhouette to portray black American history. JJTate Modern, SE1, 2 October to 5 AprilThere is a full-faced frankness to Eugène Henri Paul Gauguin’s portraits that seems to capture the wholeness of a person. The sensitivity with which he depicted his friend Van Gogh gives the lie to the biographical stereotype of a hard-hearted bohemian who bullied poor Vincent. But his most extraordinary portraits were done in Tahiti. Here he portrayed Pacific people with a compassion and respect a million miles from colonial ways of seeing. To look into Gauguin’s Pacific faces is to sense the sorrow of a culture on the verge of destruction. JJNational Gallery, WC2, 7 Oct to 26 JanuaryThis is a scintillating retrospective of one of Britain’s greatest-ever artists. Riley’s paintings reach into your mind and alter your perceptions. Her abstract curves create optical illusions of expanding and vibrating forms that rise up from the flat picture. She hit on her revolutionary method by studying Seurat, and her early landscapes after the 19th-century pointillist are deliriously beautiful. JJHayward Gallery, Southbank Centre, SE1, 23 October to 26 JanuaryThis savagely truthful painter once said wryly of a naked image of himself as an old man that, given how he painted others, portraying himself honestly was the least he could do. In time, Freud’s depictions of himself may be seen as his greatest works. You always sense the mirror he is looking into, be it in his lounge or a shaving mirror, in which he sees strange reflective effects so his children look tiny beside him or he resembles a wild animal at bay. He watches himself age with merciless precision. JJRoyal Academy of Arts, W1, 27 October to 26 JanuaryThis ambitious public artwork has the straightforward humanism that has enabled McQueen to make Oscar-winning cinema as well as compelling visual art. Here he turns his camera not on a hunger striker or a man who stands still while a house falls around him, but a generation who embody a city’s future. He has photographed every Year 3 primary school class in London, formally posed as in a traditional school photograph. JJTate Britain, SW1, 12 November to 3 MayAmazingly enough, this is the first retrospective in Britain for the artist whose installation The Dinner Party made feminist art famous four decades ago. The Dinner Party, a dinner table with places laid for notable women in history and mythology, is just one of her ambitious anthropological works. This show includes The Birth Project, begun in 1980, which celebrates childbirth, and The End, which contemplates death. Chicago is a modern visionary in the mould of Blake. JJBALTIC, Gateshead, 16 November to 19 AprilThere really was a Troy. The remains of this ancient city show that it was burned in a devastating war. But the legend of the Trojan war is just as “real” as any facts. From early Greek vase paintings of black ships laden with warriors to sculptures of heroes taken from Aegina to Munich in the 19th century, ancient Greek art was obsessed with Homer’s mythic version of this war in The Iliad. Artists since, from Rubens to Turner, have brooded on its tragedy. See the real and imagined horrors of the war that started all wars. JJBritish Museum, WC1, 21 November to 8 MarchAfter the American civil war, an island called Malaga off the Maine coast was settled by an interracial community whose embrace of ersity flouted the prejudices of the time. Malaga’s people were evicted in the early 20th century and all trace of their plural society eradicated by 1911. Chicago’s Theaster Gates resurrects this lost history in a series of installations entitled Amalgam, a word that in America’s past implied the dangerous “amalgamation” of races. JJTate Liverpool, 13 December to 3 MayAlexander Zeldin’s plays are total one-offs. In fact, they don’t really feel like plays. Instead, they’re deeply unsettling experiences that immerse the audience in the lives of people living on the fringes of society. Zeldin’s latest follows on from Beyond Caring and Love and takes place in a rundown community hall. It won’t be an easy watch but it will get under your skin. MGNational Theatre: Dorfman, SE1, Monday 9 September to 12 OctoberA new play from Caryl Churchill is always cause for celebration. Each play is so different from the last, pushing our feelings and theatre itself in all sorts of wild directions. Now we have got four Churchill plays all at once, which will include a girl made of glass, gods, murderers, serial killers and secrets. James Macdonald directs and the cast includes Deborah Findlay, Toby Jones and Tom Mothersdale. Do. Not. Miss. MGRoyal Court, SW1, 18 September to 12 OctoberThis co-production between National Theatre Wales and the Royal Court is written by Welsh playwright and TV scriptwriter Ed Thomas. It’s a loosely autobiographical work about memory, joy and identity, and is inspired by Thomas’s childhood growing up in the Brecon Beacons. Thomas will co-direct alongside Vicky Featherstone and the play will feature Rhys Ifans, who always brings a livewire energy to his performances. MGSherman Theatre, Cardiff, 20 September to 5 October Royal Court, SW1, 24 October to 23 NovemberNikolai Foster directs a stage adaptation of Hanif Kureishi’s groundbreaking 1985 film. Set in London during the Thatcher years, Kureishi’s story is about a young British Pakistani, Omar, who transforms his uncle’s rundown laundrette into a thriving business – busting taboos and breaking down cultural boundaries along the way. Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe of Pet Shop Boys have written the score and Omar Malik (East Is East) will star. MGCurve, Leicester, 20 September to 5 October touring to 9 NovemberWhere to start with this theatrical smörgåsbord? This year’s Dublin theatre festival includes 10 world premieres and an extended programme of theatre for younger audiences, including a new take on Baba Yaga. There is a new version of The Playboy of the Western World Marina Carr’s reimagining of Hecuba a play from Nancy Harris and a site-specific work from ANU Productions and the Gate Theatre about the queer experience in Dublin. MGVarious venues, 26 September to 13 OctoberArtistic director Matthew Warchus is flying high at the Old Vic, where his last show, Present Laughter starring Andrew Scott, was a huge hit. Next up is Duncan Macmillan’s brilliant play Lungs, starring The Crown’s king and queen Claire Foy and Matt Smith. It is a stunning piece of writing about a young couple racing towards parenthood, excited and terrified, bristling with doubts and bursting with joy. MGThe Old Vic, SE1, 14 October to 9 NovemberThis is the final show for artistic director Sarah Frankcom, who has had such a terrific run at the Royal Exchange Theatre. Her swansong will be a new play from Simon Stephens, who grew up in nearby Stockport. The show will connect five relatives in five disparate English towns and is all about love, death, community and kindness. To top it all off, there will be original music from Jarvis Cocker. MGRoyal Exchange, Manchester, 24 October to 16 NovemberThis Broadway smash transfers to London with six Tony awards to its name and a tremendous amount of hype in its wake. The score is composed by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul, the dream team behind The Greatest Showman and La La Land. The book, written by Steven Levenson, is about a troubled teen struggling to come to terms with the tragic death of a school friend. Should pack a punch. MGNoël Coward Theatre, WC2, 29 October to 4 AprilThe don of British contemporary dance is closing his company next year, so it’s the last chance to catch Sir Richard’s fine dancers as they embark on the first half of their ultimate tour (there will be more dates in the spring before a last ever show at London’s Sadler’s Wells). Most notable in the shifting programme is the premiere of Alston’s final work for the company, Shine On (debuts at Snape Maltings Concert Hall, 1 to 2 Nov), set to Benjamin Britten’s first published songs, On This Island, which features five poems by WH Auden. LWEdinburgh Festival Theatre, 27 \u0026amp 28 September touring to spring 2020Soweto-born choreographer Dada Masilo has form when it comes to updating ballet’s fairytales. After success with Swan Lake, Carmen and Romeo and Juliet, her Giselle is a #MeToo story for our times. Transported to a lively South African village, using a mix of ballet, contemporary and traditional Tswana dance, Masilo herself plays the heroine as a gutsy young woman who sets out for revenge after falling for a cheating creep. LWSadler’s Wells, EC1, 4 \u0026amp 5 October touring to 2 NovemberA modestly sized show for a major company – a small cast in the Royal Opera House’s second theatre – but all eyes will be on this triple bill, which features a new work by Pam Tanowitz, who wowed with her TS Eliot-inspired Four Quartets. Part of the Merce Cunningham centenary celebrations, the bill also includes Royal Ballet dancers tackling Cunningham’s work for the first time, plus the sublime modernism of Frederick Ashton’s Monotones II. LWRoyal Opera House: Linbury Theatre, WC2, 10 to 11 OctoberJeyasingh is not the first choreographer to be inspired by Egon Schiele’s warped and disquieting bodies but you can be sure she will approach the subject matter with her customary questioning intelligence, as she probes the murky relationship between male artist and female model in the Austrian artist’s intense portraits. Orlando Gough composes the score and the cast of four includes the brilliant ex-Rambert dancer Dane Hurst. LWDanceEast, Ipswich, 18 \u0026amp 19 October touring to 5 NovemberDescribed by the director of the Edinburgh comedy awards as “utterly unique”, this year’s winner takes his I’ve Got Nothing show on a victory lap. Jaw-droppingly brutal about his brain’s dark meanderings, it’s one for fans of dramatic existentialism – and material about seducing mums. HGSoho Theatre, W1, Saturday 7 September touring to FebruaryWith The Tez O’Clock Show, Ilyas proved there is a gap in the market for topical lols from different perspectives. And, given his identity as a British-Muslim, northern, working-class comic, there are enough perspectives to go around. Live, he offers a masterclass in how to talk about race and society without veering into cheap and nasty territory. HJDPart of Desi Central Comedy Show, Queen’s Theatre, Hornchurch, 15 September touring to 2 NovemberThe polyglot comic has always embraced his nonconformity, previously identifying as a transvestite before coming out as transgender. His latest show, Wunderbar, combines personal tales with an array of strangeness ranging from “humans over the last 100,000 years to talking dogs and animal superheroes”. HJDDe La Warr Pavilion, Bexhill-on-Sea, 15 September touring to 16 NovemberBristolian Adams is a formerly all-singing, all-rapping, Adele-parodying comic who’s recently done away with the bells and whistles. Her latest show, The Ballad of Kylie Jenner’s Old Face, is a case in point, tackling the feminism – and often lack thereof – demonstrated by celebs, among them the youngest scion of the Kardashian clan. HJDBloomsbury Theatre, WC1, 21 September touring 23 October to 26 AprilYou may well have spotted Kate Berlant in places as erse as 30 Rock-ish comedy The Other Two and Tarantino’s latest, Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood. While the LA-based comic steals every scene she’s in, however small, as a standup Berlant really comes into her own, with a surreal and often deadpan energy. HJDSoho Theatre, W1, 7 to 12 OctoberFrom The Mary Whitehouse Experience to Three Lions larks to an Olivier-nominated stage show, My Family: Not the Sitcom, David Baddiel has had nothing if not a varied career. His upcoming show, Trolls: Not the Dolls, sees him turn his attention to online insults and abuse. HJDRoyal Northern College of Music, Manchester, 20 October touring 24 January to 3 MayThe Tasmanian comic used to deal in self-deprecating lols, with barbs that made light of her own struggles as a gay woman. Her Netflix special, Nanette, was a turning point, however, with Gadsby deciding to terminate that type of material. Having sought a more authentic comedy, her latest show, Douglas, swerves trauma in favour of stereotype-skewing standup and a healthier kind of personal admission. HJDNew Theatre, Oxford, 24 October touring to 23 NovemberHughes’s two first presenting gigs were on adult channel Babestation and, er, CBBC, giving a taste of her comedy career to come: ribald yet also rather endearing. Having recently become the first black woman ever nominated for the main category at the Edinburgh comedy awards, expect big things for Hughes, whose current show, To Catch a Dick, is a celebration of female sexuality.

This well‑made, pleasingly large cloth is available in heaps of designs and colours, including solid black to hide any gross makeup stains (I confess I prefer a white cloth so I can see what I’m removing in all its deliciously mucky glory, but I’m also someone who watches hours of surgical blackhead popping for entertainment, so your mileage may vary). Each side is different in texture – the fine nap is for cleansing, while the longer nap on the reverse is for exfoliation (I still strongly believe a flannel makes a better job of this, so if you’re already a hot-cloth-cleansing fan, don’t switch).What I prefer about the Cleanse Off Mitt (€5.95), but shippable worldwide) is its honest messaging. Irish skincare guru Jennifer Rock invented this blue microfibre mitt, not because she believes it’s as effective as proper cleansing, but because she knows it’s a damn sight better than using environmentally unsound cleansing wipes her goal is to lure their devotees towards something more efficacious and ethical. Microfibre itself is not an environmentally friendly fabric, but it is reusable for up to five years or 1,000 machine washes, eliminating the need for countless disposable, and less effective, cotton wool discs and wipes, as well as packaged cleansing products. And so, like everything these days, it’s a question of compromise over whatabouttery. Even for the cleansing wipe averse, Rock’s tactile mitt, made from thinner fabric than the others I tried, makes a fast pre-cleanse for removing the bulk of makeup, giving a relatively clear canvas for a true deep cleanse with balm.• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.

This is a truth that has been learned the hard way by the new film from American independent writer-director Alex Ross Perry: a daring, grungily immersive and quite brilliantly acted character study that has been saddled, for reasons best known to Perry himself, with the buzz-killing moniker Her Smell.Try telling people, as I have for several months now, that they should be looking out for a terrific film called Her Smell – only to be greeted with grimacing, nose-wrinkling, “her what?” questions and often a swift change of subject. It hasn’t courted much of a crowd: after premiering to strong reviews at the Toronto film festival a year ago, the film eventually secured a tiny release in the States, grossing just over $250,000. UK distributors were particularly slow to bite: finally, Her Smell (Signature, 15) is being released directly to video on demand on Monday, skipping a traditional cinema release. I’m not saying that low profile is all down to the title – the film’s abrasive and challenging in more substantial ways – but it can’t have helped.In any case, I implore you to overlook the title, not the film, which is so hell-for-leather in its close-up study of a fictitious female rock star – played with thrilling, strung-out bravado by Elisabeth Moss – that you feel a little punch-drunk watching it. It shows up so many musical biopics in the Bohemian Rhapsody vein as the gutless cosplay exercises they are. In case you’re wondering, the olfactory system plays no obvious role in the film, though you can pretty much imagine how Becky Something (Moss) smells as the film introduces her in a mood-swinging backstage frenzy of post-concert adrenaline: sweat, sex and substances, and not in a particularly inviting way.Becky is the frontwoman of a popular all-girl punk band coming apart at the seams, mostly because she’s coming apart herself. The way Moss plays her, as a whirligig of ego, anger, untended talent and self-loathing, makes Courtney Love look like Taylor Swift. Perry’s film charts Becky’s self-destruction, self-reckoning and tentative self-renewal in five kinetic, unstinting acts, with a kind of updated, pressed-to-the-glass John Cassavetes energy. At over two hours, its deep emotional payoff feels hard-won. Moss should be up for every award going at the year’s end she almost certainly won’t be.Finally, while we’re considering the fates of festival films, this week’s column comes to you from the Venice film festival, where critics are swooning andor arguing over such big autumn attractions as Todd Phillips’s Joker and Noah Baumbach’s Marriage Story. If you want a taste of the programme’s less starry side, however, Venice has again teamed up with Festival Scope to launch the Sala Web, where a handful of this year’s sidebar entries are available to stream at home, for the equivalent of €4 each, until 19 September. Take a chance on Tunisian film The Scarecrows, an emotionally raw study of women escaping sex slavery on the Syrian front, or the intriguing, experimental Spanish memory piece Zumiriki. There’s every chance they won’t turn up farther down the road.High Life(Thunderbird, 18)Claire Denis may be our greatest working auteur, and her first English-language film shores up that claim: an exquisitely apocalyptic sci-fi nightmare, spiked with visceral sexuality and body horror.Long Shot(Lionsgate, 15)An odd-couple romcom that bombed cinemas but deserves a second life. Charlize Theron and Seth Rogen have surprisingly sparky chemistry as a swannish presidential candidate and her schlubby speechwriter.Only You(Curzon, 15)Harry Wootliff’s polished, autumnal debut is an essentially traditional relationship drama about a Glasgow couple struggling to conceive, but actors Laia Costa and Josh O’Connor lend it special emotional ballast.Beats(Altitude, 15)Centred on two Scottish lads united by small-town ennui and a love of techno, Brian Welsh’s 90s-set coming-of-age tale is a euphoric treat for rave-era nostalgists and a scrappy charmer for everyone else.

The grains are particularly delicious after slowly absorbing the aromatic liquids and juices in which they’re cooked, while releasing their starches as they plump up, and thicken the broth. I guess you could say it’s an osmosis of sorts (or a very welcome exchange): flavour in, texture and sustenance out.Iranian dried sour plums, known as aloo bukhara, are like nature’s candy they are beautifully orange, sweet, sour and hard to resist. They are used in a variety of Persian dishes but are also great to snack on. You can find them in most Middle Eastern supermarkets, but if you can’t get your hands on any, then use dried apricots or sour cherries instead. This is a celebration dish, perfect for sharing and well worth the effort.For the sweet almonds1½ tsp olive oil4 tsp caster sugar¾ tsp ground cinnamon100g blanched almondsFor the sour plum dressing10g dill, finely chopped10g parsley, finely chopped1 green chilli, finely chopped (10g)150g dried sour plums, pitted and roughly chopped (or 100g dried apricots, quartered)3 tbsp cider vinegar60ml olive oilHeat the oven to 180C (160C fan)gas 4 and line a small oven tray with baking paper. On a medium-high heat, warm three tablespoons of oil in a large saucepan for which you have a lid. Add the onion and cook, stirring often, until softened and browned – about seven minutes. Add the garlic, lamb, saffron, cardamom, cinnamon and half the rose petals, and cook, stirring to break up the mince, until no longer pink, about four minutes. Add 250ml water, a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, and cook for seven minutes, stirring occasionally, until all the liquid is absorbed.Add the rice, herbs, 520ml hot water, a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, and bring to a boil. Cover the pan tightly with foil, then a lid, and turn the heat to its lowest setting. Cook for 15 minutes, then set aside, still covered, for another 15 minutes.Meanwhile, make the almonds. Put the oil, sugar, cinnamon and a tablespoon of water in a small saucepan on a medium heat. Bring to a boil, stirring often, then add the almonds. Cook, stirring, for three minutes, then transfer to the lined oven tray and bake for 12 minutes, stirring once halfway, until golden. Leave to cool, then roughly chop. Meanwhile, mix all the dressing ingredients and a quarter-teaspoon of salt in a small bowl.To serve, spread out the rice on a large platter. Top with the almonds and remaining rose petals, and spoon over the dressing.You can’t get much more than this tender chicken by way of comfort and pure deliciousness. My favourite bit, though, is the orzo pasta, which drinks in all the chicken juices. Serve this with your favourite savoury chilli sauce, if you like.3-4 dried cascabel chillies (25g) 4 cinnamon sticks30g dried porcini 1 whole chicken (1.5kg)Salt and pepper2 lemons, 1 halved and the other cut into 4 wedges60ml olive oil500g celery (about 6-8 sticks), cut at a slight angle into 4cm lengths2 onions, peeled, and each cut into 8 wedges 6 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced8 thyme sprigs320g orzo1 tbsp flat-leaf parsley leaves, roughly choppedHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)gas 6. Put the chillies and cinnamon in a small frying pan on a medium-high heat, and cook for about eight minutes, or until fragrant and toasted. Transfer to a large bowl with the porcini mushrooms and 1.1 litres boiling water. Cover with a plate and leave to soak for at least 15 minutes.Meanwhile, pat the chicken dry and sprinkle all over with half a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper, then stuff the cavity with one lemon half.Put a large ovenproof, cast-iron saucepan, for which you have a lid, on a medium-high heat and add two tablespoons of oil. Add the chicken and cook on all sides until browned – about seven minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate, add the remaining two tablespoons of oil to the saucepan, along with the celery and onion, and cook for six minutes, until lightly golden. Add the garlic and thyme and cook for another minute, until fragrant. Return the chicken to the pan breast side up, then pour over the porcini liquid, along with all the aromatics, two teaspoons of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Bring to a simmer, cover with a lid and transfer to the oven for 50 minutes. Remove from the oven and stir through the orzo, pushing some into the bird’s cavity. Cover again and bake for 20 minutes more, until the orzo is cooked and has absorbed most of the liquid.Turn up the oven to 220C (200C fan)gas 7, uncover and bake for 10 minutes, or until browned on top. Leave to cool slightly – 10-15 minutes.To serve, squeeze over the other lemon half, sprinkle with the parsley and serve directly from the pan, with the lemon wedges alongside.The unique smoky and nutty qualities of freekeh are amplified here with the addition of charred shallots and cascabel chillies. The dish is robust enough to be served as a main course, with some lightly cooked greens or a chopped salad alongside.3½ tbsp white miso paste (70g)60ml olive oil1½ tbsp maple syrup1 tbsp tomato paste 5 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed ¾ tsp ground cinnamon 500ml vegetable stockSalt and pepper350g medium banana shallots (about 8-10), peeled 3 dried cascabel chillies, roughly broken350g cracked freekeh, soaked in cold water for half an hour, then drainedFor the tahini sauce80g tahini 1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed2 tbsp lemon juiceWhisk the first seven ingredients together in a large jug with 400ml water, a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper.Put a large saute pan for which you have a lid on a high heat. Once hot, add the shallots and char for 16 minutes, turning a few times, until slightly blackened all over. Add the cascabels and char for 90 seconds more, until fragrant. Pour over the stock mixture, bring to a simmer, then turn the heat down low. Cover and cook for 10 minutes, until the shallots begin to soften.Carefully transfer the shallots to a plate for a moment while you stir the freekeh into the sauce, then return the shallots to the pan, spaced apart. Cover with the lid again, and cook for 15 minutes, or until the freekeh is cooked through and most of the liquid has been absorbed. Remove from the heat, leaving the lid on, and set aside for 10 minutes.Put the tahini sauce ingredients in a small bowl with four tablespoons of water and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and whisk smooth. In a separate small bowl, combine the parsley, chives and oil.Drizzle half the tahini sauce over the freekeh, followed by all the herb oil. Serve directly from the pan, with the remaining sauce alongside."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/977fc5ab6d956f2304b5f59db61fe24770d33c0e/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69070b678b996714e06800a8663636ac","title":"arsenal wsl even better danielle van de donk","story":"Every time someone gets injured, a bit of your game falls away, and you have to fill the gaps. Last season, with a huge injury list including players such as Jordan Nobbs, Kim Little and Danielle Carter, I think we did amazingly well at Arsenal. Wherever people had to play they did – we picked up the roles quite quickly.As one of the players who was still fit, I weirdly didn’t feel more pressure. I just really wanted to win the title. We were all desperate for that first title for Arsenal in seven years and everyone was on the same page. That was the focus. We knew that we didn’t have many people and the whole experience brought us closer together.As we battled across the finish line we were just very thankful for the great start we had together. We built up a lot of points in the first block of games and ultimately that won us the league.That was the thing that we could fall back on. The team was still good, we weren’t panicking, but every time someone gets injured you feel scared, especially when it’s going well, because we were on fire towards the beginning of last season.I don’t think you can find a player who has one bad word to say about Joe. He’s very chilled, his tactics are on point all the time and the analysis is great – he’s basically always right. But it’s his human side that makes him a good manager. It’s easy to get caught up in needing to get trophies but he takes the pressure away from it.It wasn’t until we played Birmingham towards the end of the season that we felt any kind of relief from the injury pile-up. When Katie McCabe’s goal went in, in the 79th minute, it was the best feeling ever. We knew if we won we were back in the Champions League. We were all dying to get the club back into Europe but nothing was falling right in that game. No one was really hitting the ball at the goal. When Katie hit it I was just so grateful that we’d finally taken a shot.Two games later we were welcoming Manchester City to Borehamwood already knowing we were champions. I’d never had that before so I felt amazing. We could, not in a bullying way, sort of say: ‘Ha, it doesn’t matter what you are going to do now.’Now our team is stronger. The squad feels stronger. We’ve lost to Bayern Munich, Wolfsburg and Barcelona in pre-season, and beaten Tottenham. But those losses don’t mean we’ve had a poor pre-season – we have learned a lot from those games.As well as players coming back from injury we’ve also had players coming back late from the World Cup. It has taken me a while to get over the World Cup final, and to rationalise it. It was almost a month before I could really think about how proud I was of the team, and myself. You don’t play a final not to win. Everything goes into it: you put all your sweat and tears into it. It is fair enough to say that the USA were better than us and deserved to win, but it took a while to realise what an amazing achievement second place was for us.We have to be realistic. It was our second World Cup and the Netherlands had not achieved much before we won the Euros in 2017. Now we’ve shown that wasn’t a one-time thing and ultimately it is a small step for the future. I hope we inspire a lot of young kids in the Netherlands to play football and to be even better than we are now so that it keeps us on this high level. It is now the biggest-growing sport in the Netherlands and I’m proud of that but at the same time I hope the league is going to get a boost from it, because it is not strong enough, at the moment, to keep us at the top.Those of us at the World Cup have not had much of a rest but we also can’t wait to be playing again. This season is going to be the best yet. We’ve won the title, we’ve got Champions League football and we are going to be even better than we were last year – and we were already pretty good to watch.Retaining the title is going to be very difficult but that’s the thing I like about the league – it’s always a challenge. We’re at a stage now where everyone can take points off of everyone else. If the WSL isn’t already the most attractive league in the world then I think it will be in the near future. Hopefully we win, and hopefully the fans keep singing my song. I love it. It is a strange but brilliant feeling – and it’s got the best rhythm."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e54c3d75a3f760dbf4d96eb8ec9ac0fdfd8a48eb/162_339_3338_2003/master/3338.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c731d0762a7b03b9bf030be8d801e494","title":"manchester city v manchester united womens super league opener live","story":"Some pre-match soundbites to get the juices flowing. The England manager Phil Neville has his say on almost 30,000 fans heading to the Etihad Stadium for the maiden WSL Manchester derby. “It’s continuing the momentum that we built up in the summer,” says Neville, who’s wearing a mammoth black coat straight out of a headteacher’s wardrobe. “So many people were inspired by the performances of the players, so many people watched and I think they loved what they saw on the field. Today is another good example. We are all so excited.”Get the lowdown on each and every WSL side:There is another 3pm kick-off, which has also been upgraded to a bigger stadium with Bristol City playing Brighton \u0026amp Hove Albion at Ashton Gate. A lot of the discourse is inevitably around attendances, with City’s Demi Stokes keen for playing in bigger arenas to become the norm. “Playing in a packed stadium, it is hard to explain,” Stokes says. “It is the best feeling to look up in the stand and see family and friends, it is surreal and such a nice moment. To be able to do that every week would be really good and I do think we will get there.”Not one or two – but 10 things to look out for in the WSL:Essential pre-match reading, via Suzy Wrack and Louise Taylor:This is it, then. The big kick-off at the Etihad Stadium, where more than 20,000 supporters are expected to pour in to watch the Women’s Super League curtain-raiser between Manchester rivals. It is a much-anticipated maiden top-flight meeting between City and United, with the latter having cruised to promotion from the second tier under Casey Stoney last season. It is a showpiece match, one of three fixtures this weekend that have been moved to bigger stadiums and the mooted attendance has already ripped up the record books – the biggest crowd to attend a WSL match stands at 5,265 for Arsenal’s title-clinching win at Brighton in April. And on Sunday Chelsea host Tottenham at Stamford Bridge with an even bigger crowd expected at the 41,000-capacity venue. On the field, there is no end of exciting players to keep an eye on but Ellen White, City’s headline arrival following the departure of last season’s top scorer, Nikita Parris, is sidelined through injury, so the onus is on others to impress, namely another summer recruit, the South Korea captain, Lee Geum-min, who has further bolstered Nick Cushing’s forward line. Across town, United made a coup of their own, with the Netherlands midfielder Jackie Groenen – a World Cup finalist – joining Stoney’s ranks from Frankfurt. Hopefully we will have a game to match the occasion."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45ccb9e20ecdab57671159f625bf51894eac0b97/0_190_5700_3420/master/5700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c6e7363c927b96a6b0f5d53b005880c","title":"tell us who do you share your home with","story":"As part of a new series in the ’s Weekend magazine we are looking for interesting pairs who live togetherWe’re looking for unusual partnerships – two people who live together in a way that shows the changing nature of the traditional household – for our new series that seeks to reflect how the place we call home can now include extended family, friends and even strangers.In the first piece in a series talking to pairs of people who live together we met the McPhersons, a grandmother and grandson living together who tell us their story.

Four experts share their tips on putting the fun back into family, at every ageAnd, as a two-year-old could probably tell you, stressed-out, unhappy parents raise stressed-out, unhappy offspring. The UK’s annual Good Childhood report, out last month, found there are more unhappy youngsters now than at any point in the past decade. It feels like a good time to ask whether there’s a better way – and common sense tells us that it starts with parents, because if we can find the joy in raising our kids, our kids are more likely to find the joy in life. Somewhere along the way, parenting became just another chore on the list for already exhausted, up-against-it iniduals.I’ve sought the wisdom of some of the world’s leading parenting gurus, on how we can rediscover the joy of raising children at every age. Because who wants to wait till they’re gone?Philippa Perry is a psychotherapist and the author of The Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read. She says a major key to happier parenting is to simply take “parenting” out of the equation – because having a baby is more about being a human being in the throes of developing a new relationship. And thinking about it in that way will help you find the joy in it. “Don’t see a baby as a chore, or parenting him or her as something you have to ‘do’,” she says. “Instead, see the child as someone to relate to.” Be curious about your baby as a person, and revel in his or her curiosity about you.You also need to readjust, says psychologist Penelope Leach it will be hard to find the joy in babyhood if you have unrealistic expectations. Leach, the bestselling author of Your Baby And Child, first published in 1977 and out in a new edition next year, says, “The mistake people make is to think they can get ‘back to normal’, but in fact there’s a whole new normal. And once you know everything is going to be different, it’s easier to find the pleasure in the new life you’ve got.”And here’s an important tip from Rosalind Wiseman, whose Queen Bees And Wannabes, which examined female teenhood, was the basis for the 2004 movie Mean Girls: “Stop taking endless pictures of your baby and posting them online. Be in the moment with them and stop seeing them in relation to how you’re going to look on social media. It fans competitive parenting, which is the source of a lot of unhappiness.”If you do one thing, do this Be aware that your baby is not an accessory to your life he or she is a new person, and together you are forging a relationship that will last a lifetime.It’s easy to fall into the trap of worrying that your child is falling behind, or that they are wasting opportunities to get ahead. Nothing is guaranteed to kill the fun of parenting as quickly as obsessing over how fast they’re learning, and how they compare with other kids of your acquaintance. “If you think about what you can learn from your child, rather than what you have to teach them, parenting becomes much better,” says Perry.Try to live as they do, in the present, as much as you can, because this is the last time in their childhood when they won’t be tied down by the rigid timetable of the school day. “The more flexible you can be, the more you’re going to enjoy this phase of their lives,” says Leach. “Not having a rigid idea about how the day will work out is helpful, if you can do it. So, when you hear the bells on the ice-cream van, stop what you’re doing and go get an ice-cream.”“We’re in danger of missing our children in the moment, because we’re in too much of a rush the entire time,” agrees Perry.Steve Biddulph, a psychologist best known for his books on raising boys, agrees: “Let’s face it, how much chasing around parks, flying kites or eating ice-creams on the beach would we do, without kids to do them with?” he asks. “How much belly-laughing and bad joke-telling or scrunching up on the couch?” They’re capable of showing us how to have fun, but only if we pay attention.If you’re constantly comparing your kid with others, try looking at yourself rather than your child for a better way forward. Competitiveness always has its roots in our own insecurities – and valuing children for themselves, rather than in relation to others, is much more likely to help you appreciate them and, in turn, boost their self-confidence.What is it about your own insecurities that is driving your competitiveness? Sorting your own demons out always makes your relationship with your child a lot better. The therapy I had when I was undergoing treatment for breast cancer made me realise that I had a right to own my feelings, that I could have a story that was separate from my life as a mother. Understanding my fears better helped in the way I interacted with my daughters, and that made me a better parent.If you do one thing, do this Be open to their way of doing things.Boundaries are important, says Perry: but what you need to think about in laying them down is, what’s going to make you happy? Because if you’re happy, they’re happy. She advises parents to be more honest with kids of primary school age. “If you’re at the playground and you want to go home, instead of saying: ‘Let’s get you home, you need your tea,’ tell it like it is: ‘Let’s go home now, because I’m cold and I’ve had enough.’” Your child, she says, will know what it feels like to be cold, and they want to help.A gem from Biddulph is to develop interests that you do one-to-one with them, and make them entirely for fun (there may be some learning on the side, but make sure that’s accidental rather than the point). “A daughter who walks the dog with her dad, for example, develops a cast-iron self-esteem because she knows ‘me and dad’ love one another’s company. You need ritual times when the good talks happen.”It’s also important not to take their criticism personally. Honestly. Kids lay into their parents because we’re right there, and we’re easy targets. Practise Teflon parenting: let the criticisms slide off you and you’ll be happier.The most common time for orce is around 12 years after getting married, so primary school is prime time for relationship breakups. At this stage there’s still a lot of heavy-duty parenting to go, and you need to go on enjoying it – for the kids’ sake and yours. Leach’s advice is to keep in mind that “just because you found your partner in bed with your best friend, it doesn’t mean he – or she – isn’t the great dad or mum you believed they were”. It may be the hardest ask of your life, but keeping on good terms with your ex is the best recipe for keeping the fun in parenting.If you do one thing, do this Make space for your relationship with your child to grow by having regular one-on-one time, doing something you both enjoy: no siblings, no partners, just the two of you.Although they’re much maligned, it’s misplaced: teens (like toddlers) are a high point of parenting for many of us who have been there.“One of the big joys for me as a parent of teenagers is the realisation that they’re able to do so much to contribute,” says Wiseman. “One of my sons regularly cooks for us, and loves it, and the other will help by going to the shops.”And there’s so much to enjoy about having a teenager, if you’re tuned in to it. “I love their sense of humour, their honesty, their appropriate cynicism, their intense viewpoints,” she says. “Teenagers are really interesting people, as long as you don’t judge and go in with an attitude of respect.”“I loved having a kitchen full of teenagers,” says Perry, whose daughter is now 28. As do I right now. So learn to enjoy the drop-of-a-hat parties, the dancing in the kitchen, and the friends who keep turning up. “Our children give us a connection right back into the juice and intensity of being alive,” says Biddulph. “We’re creaking, dried-up worriers, and they are straight from the heart of life.”If you do one thing, do this Be clear about your own needs, as well as theirs – it’s a two-way street.“My parents always thought they were the grownups and we were the children, even when we were in our 50s,” says Perry. “But with my daughter I don’t: I feel we’re both adults. And she helps me such a lot – she keeps me up to date.” I second that: would I be listening to Loyle Carner, trying barre classes, selling my clothes on Depop or drinking kombucha if I didn’t have adult kids?They also go on to lead exciting lives that you can dip into: my eldest daughter, 27, lives by a canal in Amsterdam, which gives me an excuse for weekends away. Their world opens up your world, widening the horizons of your midlife.There’s one caveat, cautions Perry. “The one thing you always have to remember is that your opinion matters more to them than anyone else’s.”If you do one thing, do this Respect the adults they have become. It’s not about telling them what to do any more, if indeed it ever was. And you certainly can’t change them now.• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/eb0e1ffd59c709c2dd8be1877ac888cc7e232a50/146_114_835_501/master/835.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5e38b1f9ef034fad86694c8ca67662da","title":"longed for moment you would write love in siberian gulag","story":"Vladimir was sentenced to 10 years’ hard labour. Ivanna was Prisoner 108, and his secret correspondent. She looks back on a love affair with a man she never metIn 1953, a young Ivanna Maszczak trudged through the Siberian labour camp in which she was serving a 10-year sentence. She was 28 years old, 5ft tall, and hungry. Her shoes were wet from the snow and the temperature had dropped below minus 50. Ivanna and some fellow female prisoners were being escorted by guards through the camp to begin their day of gruelling physical work: mining gold, felling trees and hacking into the frozen ground.As they stumbled through the snow, a scrunched-up piece of paper landed at their feet, thrown from a truck transporting male prisoners. One of them picked it up before a guard noticed, and later the women huddled together and opened it. It was from a male prisoner asking whether someone would write to him, to distract him from the relentless bleakness. Ivanna was deeply moved. Five years into her imprisonment, she, too, was desperate for human contact. She decided to reply to this stranger.Ivanna, now 93, tells her story in her one-bedroom ex-council flat in London. The flat is on the top floor and there is no lift, but, although Ivanna is very small and thin, she’s strong enough to walk up and down three flights of concrete stairs several times a day. Born in Ukraine, she was taken from her family one frosty January morning in 1948 while her mother, a schoolteacher, made beetroot soup for lunch. She belonged to a Ukrainian youth organisation, and her brother was a member of the Ukrainian underground. “At that time every Ukrainian was under suspicion,” Ivanna recalls. “My father was a priest, which didn’t help, because the authorities were suspicious of priests, members of the intelligentsia, teachers and students.” Even after Nazi Germany’s surrender in May 1945, the civil war in Ukraine and eastern Poland continued, as underground organisations, including the Ukrainian Insurrectionary army, refused to live under communist rule. Ivanna was one of many thousands of ethnic Ukrainians sent to Siberia after being accused of aiding the rebellion.Military guards stormed the house and marched the 22-year-old out of her home and into a truck. “My mother’s eyes were full of tears,” she says, quietly, in her strong Ukrainian accent. “I told her that I would be back one day. I still can’t believe I ever came back alive.”Ivanna was sentenced to 10 years in Stalin’s labour camps. She was moved from one to another, before she and 700 other prisoners were put on a boat and taken to a gulag in Kolyma, a sub-arctic region in Siberia. “As we pulled into the wharf we could see snow, and guards in furs,” Ivanna remembers. “We were in our tatty, thin clothes and, getting off the boat, we were so weak that some of us fell into the snow. We were forced to strip outside and given a typhoid injection – all with the same needle – and a lice check.” Everyone got the same size clothes and shoes. “Imagine me in huge shoes when I have feet this small,” says Ivanna. “Numbers were sewn on to our backs – I was 108 – and we felt our identity was taken away from us.” At night she slept on a wooden plank in barracks alongside hundreds of others.Then the crumpled note landed at Ivanna’s feet. His name was Vladimir he was the same age as Ivanna and also serving 10 years. She asked around, found out which part of the gulag he was in and, with help from sympathetic construction workers who agreed to pass the notes on, managed to get a letter to him. She used the pen and paper the prisoners were sometimes given in order to write home. Their letters, which Ivanna has kept and shows me, stored in a wooden box, came back and forth, talking of life in the camp (“There is a roaring snowstorm outside even though it’s spring”), but also philosophy and the idea of freedom. “What is happiness?” writes Vladimir in one letter. In another: “One day the corrective labour system will be recognised as a huge political mistake.”“He wanted to find a kindred spirit and I became that person,” Ivanna says now. Despite the fact that they were unable to meet, she began to feel a deep bond with this young man. “After the cruelty I had seen, writing to him was some respite from the hell I was in. I was terribly lonely, so to have Vladimir wanting to know how I felt made things bearable.”It was illegal for prisoners to correspond with each other, so they relied on the construction workers to deliver the letters. “Sometimes it took weeks for a letter to come, and some letters disappeared,” Ivanna says. “But when our system worked, the notes were a salvation.” Soon the tone changed. “At first it was friendship, but when you talk for so long, so intensely, you start to feel love,” Ivanna says. “In one letter Vladimir writes, “Waiting for your letters causes my heart to beat faster.” In another, “Believe me that my love for you is so great that I will do anything for you.” They made tentative plans to meet if they were ever freed.Ivanna was finally released in August 1955, after almost eight years of her sentence. Stalin’s death in 1953 had somewhat thawed the regime prisoners had begun to rebel and were gradually being let free. Ivanna’s family had no idea she was coming home. “I walked to the door and my mother turned and screamed my name. She started crying with joy, but I wasn’t able to cry. I didn’t know how to live as a free person. Everything seemed strange – buying milk, going to a hairdresser, eating an apple.” Her freedom came too late for her to be reunited with her father he had died just two months before her return home.Vladimir was still imprisoned, and when she first wrote to him from the outside world, he replied: “If I had had the opportunity, I would have left everything behind and followed you. Have you now found everything you dreamed of during these dreadful years? One day we will have the opportunity to meet each other – but it will not happen soon.”When Vladimir was eventually released two years later, he wrote: “Dear Ivanna! Your prayers have reached the heavens and here I am, alive and healthy. Reunited with my parents. There were many events and stories to share but, most importantly, I am home.”Soon afterwards, Vladimir wrote again to tell Ivanna he was getting married. Under pressure from his father, he would wed his former classmate, someone his family had expected him to be with all along. “Despite the emotions we felt for each other, I was not surprised about the marriage,” she says. “This was what his father had planned – he had even tried to stop us writing to each other at one point, believing I would scupper his plans. I felt that, despite his marriage, we had an unbreakable bond: the bond of two people who have been in prison together for so long. We were both trying to adjust to freedom and learn to be with our families again. I understood how things were, that he needed to move on.” Yet the letters kept coming and Vladimir confided in her, telling her he found it difficult to adjust to normal life. “On the outside everything looks great: I have a wife, a house, a job, friends, but I cannot recover from the nightmares I’ve endured. I watch my life like a film that I am not part of.”A few years later, Ivanna got married, too. While visiting a friend in Britain, she was introduced to a Ukrainian man named Wolodomyr who proposed to her just five days after they met. “I never regretted it. We lived a simple life in London, and were happy together for 47 years,” she says. Wolodomyr, who passed away in 2012, aged 94, understood why the correspondence with Vladimir was still so important to his wife. In May 1965, Vladimir wrote to her in wonderment that it had been “10 years of knowing each other… of holding pieces of paper on which we shared our thoughts, hopes, doubts, expectations and love. I thank the heavens that you’re in my life.” The following Christmas they exchanged other family photos. Then one morning Ivanna received a curt letter from Vladimir’s wife demanding that the correspondence cease immediately. Ivanna never heard from Vladimir again.As darkness falls, she pauses in her story to reach across to switch on a softly lit lamp above the small wooden table where we sit. “It hurt me greatly. I didn’t write back to Vladimir. I didn’t want to interfere in his family life. I know I was lucky to be released from Siberia early,” she says, “but I lost out on a chance to meet him.”Three years ago, contemplating her old age, Ivanna wondered whether this might be a good time to re-establish contact. She Googled Vladimir and found he had his own website. “I recognised him immediately from the photos I’d seen over the years. He now looked older and had grey hair but I knew it was him, and was excited.”Yet after more research she discovered that it was too late, and he had recently died. “I should have tried harder to find him, I regret that I didn’t. But I worried that it would cause problems for him and his marriage if we ever actually met.”It has now been 64 years since Ivanna was released, but eight years in the gulag still has an impact on her daily life in ways that few outsiders would notice. She doesn’t eat much – maybe a baked potato at lunch, but usually no dinner. It doesn’t occur to her to want anything that she doesn’t have. She has a small bedroom, but sleeps on a futon in the living room as she hates feeling confined. “I don’t like to admit this, but I don’t like doors being closed because it reminds me of being imprisoned.” She points to the wardrobe doors, slightly ajar. “Even those I keep open,” she says sheepishly.It’s been more than 50 years since Ivanna received her final letter from Vladimir. Now in her 90s, she thinks more than ever about the bond they forged in the harsh extremities of the Stalin gulag. “Vladimir and I were linked by our experience. Those letters were a lifeline, they gave me some purpose. I felt a sense that things could be better again one day,” she says. It’s clear that Vladimir felt just as strongly. In a letter to Ivanna while he was still imprisoned, he wrote: “Life is very short and we only live once, but, wherever I am and whatever happens to me, I will remember and think of you always.”2 November 1955I am so glad I haven’t lost contact with you! The news of your departure shook me. I felt lonely and abandoned but then I thought – you have freedom! On the one hand I felt so happy for you, on the other hand I felt such pain. I knew that you would write, I longed for the moment you would… sometimes the loneliness became intolerable. Then I sat down and wrote to you without even having your address because it was like having a conversation with you.31 December 1955In these final minutes of New Year’s Eve, I think of you, my dear… look at the stars, maybe it’s possible that our eyes could meet while looking up at the same stars.4 February 1956I love you. But we’ve never met in person. This is probably not the way clever people act. It is so difficult, so difficult to define our relationship! You are so far from me now. But every day you become more dear to me. I can’t forget you and I don’t imagine a future without you.8 February 1956I was longing for your letters with an anticipation that can’t be described. I do not know how to thank you for everything you wrote. We owe each other so much and this is why there is no way we’d be able to forget each other. I know that if you get married, I will respect that person although I will be terribly jealous.25 March 1956You wrote that you felt indebted to me for many things – you do not need to explain – sometimes I am in awe of everything you have brought into my life. My dear friend! Some things do not need words because none of them could possibly reflect the complexity of our feelings for each other.18 April 1959Who knows? We might meet one day. We must believe this, otherwise there is no point to living.

Behind its beautiful brick walls, its creators would like you to immerse yourself in the sound of insects, to wander along paths as perennials tower above you, and glimpse, over hedges, other corners that burnish with late-summer colours, or tumble with vegetables. Then there’s a slice of cake and a cup of tea at a table tucked among the flowers.The glasshouse has been restored to its full glory and now grows fruit and vegetables for the cafe – from tomatoes and chillies to cucumbers and other fruits – as well as acting as a workshop space for courses. But the pair decided against a traditional restoration for the rest of the garden. “At the beginning we could see all four corners and we knew we needed to break up the design,” says Laura. The space is now a series of interlocking “rooms” ided by hedges. “There are intentional glimpses here and there into the next area to entice you, while also truly surrounding you by plants.” The result is a garden in which you feel utterly immersed, protected by high walls but with tantalising glimpses of the Shropshire countryside beyond.Every year, the couple trial annual and other shorter-lived plants, to find the best. “I think annual and tender perennials are wonderful, as they allow you to create a new garden every year, and that can be very freeing, particularly if you are working in a small garden,” says Laura. This year their test beds are looking at Cosmos next year it will be Nigella and Scabious.It’s a wonderful mix of sculptural hedges and informal, naturalistic plantings, full of movement, energy and joy. “It’s important to me that this space has enough for everyone,” says Laura. “It’s a haven for wildlife – there’s the odd mole, and a resident rabbit. It’s full of butterflies and bees. And it’s wonderful when people have an emotional response to it – I like to think we’ve created something spiritually fulfilling.”Chard ‘Charlotte’ A wonderful ornamental vegetable with fantastic bright red stems it looks wonderful with Tagetes ‘Burning Embers’.Helichrysum bracteatum ‘Scarlet’ An annual everlasting flower in brilliant red that looks great with red orach (Atriplex hortensis var. rubra).Molinia caerulea ‘Fontane’ A lovely statement grass that looks good dotted through monarda and persicaria, and turns the most wonderful buttery yellow in autumn.• Wildegoose Nursery is open 10am-4.30pm Friday, Saturday and Sunday to 13 October.

The road not taken. But these regrets are typically rooted in explicit choices and decisions we’ve made. Often, however, we regret things that we weren’t even aware were options – the roads we didn’t know about. This kind of regret is particularly pertinent when it comes to managing our money. Although we make dozens of choices with our money every single day, we are blind to the options we didn’t even consider.For instance, even if we’re prudent enough to put some money aside instead of spending it on items we hardly ever use, we typically just stick it into a savings account. Or we put it into bricks and mortar. Many of us don’t even consider investing.Perhaps this is one reason why people who have successfully met some of their financial goals often credit the advice and wisdom of those with more experience. So what advice would people who’ve been there and done that give to their younger selves – and others?Debby Clarke, 54 bookkeeper, HarpendenMy advice would be to make an effort. I had no financial education whatsoever and I really wish I had. When I was growing up my dad handled the finances and my mum had nothing to do with them, so that set a sort of example. It didn’t help that when I met my future husband he was more clued up and I found it all a bit boring.Many kids still leave school without a clue now. As parents we took it on ourselves to explain things like budgeting, interest and credit to our daughter and that had the effect of making me make more of an effort.The other thing I’d tell myself is to start a pension sooner. I was in my late 30s when I took one out, but then we put all our money into getting on the property ladder, which I don’t regret. But I realise I should have invested a bit more for later in life now that I’m headed in that direction. I won’t be able to afford to retire early like my parents did, probably not at 65 either – but perhaps that’s not the worst thing.Trevor Levy, 55, financial adviser, LondonPensions seem a million miles away in your 20s and I was no different – even though I ended up working in the financial services industry. I was trying to get people to take out a pension but I didn’t have one of my own for a while. Now, I explain to people that pensions aren’t an older person’s thing. A pension is your long-term financial friend and I should have made friends sooner. People get obsessed by property but it’s about having a balanced set of options to cover all eventualities.Making money was seen as cool in the 1980s. Everyone was buying and trading shares. I didn’t know enough about it but I invested in a funeral firm. I thought: “There’s something that’s never going to run out of business” – but there was no plan and I didn’t hold them for very long. Everyone expected to make a quick buck in that era, but it doesn’t work like that. You need to take a long-term view and have a portfolio to spread the risk.Richard Southgate, 70, retired, MaestegOne piece of advice my dad gave me was: “Spend a bit, save a bit, make the devils wait a bit.” I didn’t quite heed my parents’ advice. There’s probably something in that. They knew stuff I didn’t. They were upper-working class and had to be careful with money.If I could do things again I’d have got on the housing ladder quicker. For my generation property has proved great value. Though obviously it’s much harder to get on the ladder these days.There was a tech boom a few years ago. I didn’t have a lot of money but I wanted to get in on it. I had a financial adviser and he said: “It’s too late, don’t bother.” I didn’t listen and lost a fair bit – so that was a salutary lesson. I have taken advice since and have done OK on the stock market. I learned to ride the ups and downs and take a long-term view. I use a technique known as pound cost averaging, which involves putting a few quid in each month, rather than investing a lump sum all at once. You can’t time the market – the ups and downs average out.Whatever your level of confidence, HSBC could help you make better-informed investment decisions.

But with a bit of careful planning, you can pull it off. We spoke to three people who did exactly thatPutting money aside – whether it’s for short-term goals or major life changes – can be difficult. There’s the unappealing prospect of forgoing stuff, toning down your social life, or taking on a side hustle. But with a bit of careful planning, and a clear goal to motivate you, you can pull it off. We spoke to three people who did exactly that.To overcome the daunting prospect of putting away thousands of pounds, she broke her goal down into setting aside a few hundred pounds from her salary per month. When Sarah eventually started The Gluten Free Blogger alongside her day job, she set a new goal: to put away all the money she raised from the website. “It made it easier knowing I didn’t have to sacrifice everything and could still live my life, by funding my savings goal through a side hustle I was passionate about,” she says. Sarah’s savings plan was fairly traditional – using an ISA to build savings and putting away a little each month. Eventually, she shifted to a savings account that gave her better interest rates.Sarah recommends that anyone trying to save for a mortgage should set a monthly goal and stick to it. “I enjoyed being able to save and spend at the same time, but in hindsight it would have been nicer to commit a set amount each month and perhaps reach my goal a little quicker,” she says. Day-to-day she made small sacrifices, such as eating out less and forgoing takeaway coffees. She also decided to put off some overseas holidays until after she had raised her deposit. “As the end came nearer, it felt easier to somehow find the money.” Her next goal? Finding her dream home.She set up an investment portfolio and chose a lower-risk option. “I have always tended to take guidance and invested my money, I got an insurance policy paid out and it was all invested, for example.” Kay says that it was simple enough to amass the capital she needed to invest, by living a little more modestly. “It’s not the fact that I don’t like spending, but I’m just an ordinary, day-to-day person – I don’t yearn for fancy things,” she says. I’m very content. If I can live like I’m living now from today until tomorrow, I’ll be more than happy.”How to save to travel the world as a volunteerDorothy Selleck, 86, has spent 40 years travelling the world, volunteering in schools via the World Organisation for Early Childhood Education (OMEP). While she was still at university, Dorothy, who speaks Welsh as a first language in addition to multiple other languages, was approached by a friend who convinced her to use her skills in charity work. For weeks at a time, Dorothy would take time out from her job as a school’s inspector and visit places around the world, including Japan, India and South America. “We were still at our jobs – you couldn’t leave them for very long, but you could leave them for long enough,” she says.Dorothy paid her own way volunteering. Flights, accommodation, travel expenses and a membership fee to OMEP were funded through a full-time job and living a modest lifestyle. “I didn’t spend a great deal of money on myself,” Dorothy says. As well as setting up four separate savings accounts where she could budget her money for travel and day-to-day living expenses, Dorothy put some of her money into a house and approached HSBC for guidance on setting up an investment portfolio.Dorothy says being afforded the freedom to volunteer has allowed her to see hidden corners of the world and master three languages. Even now, long after her retirement 27 years ago she still volunteers at schools a few days a week – although much closer to home. “I’m still doing voluntary work,” she says. “It’s very important to me.”Top tips for saving for a major life goalInvestments can carry a higher risk than cash savings and you may not always get back what you put in.

The amount you have will determine what sort of plans you can turn into reality.Putting together a financial plan for each of these defining moments can give you greater freedom and choice. You’ll be able to enjoy each stage without worrying so much about money issues.If you are financially secure, you can take more informed decisions about moving jobs or changing career you may even get better deals on products such as mortgages and loans and you’ll have more time to spend on the things that matter to you – like leisure, travel and family.Taking time to set goals, thinking about what your priorities are, and putting in place a savings scheme for the future are all essential elements in good financial planning. The good news is that it’s never too early or too late to start.You would imagine that you need a lot of money in order to start saving or investing. In reality, even relatively small sums can grow into a sizeable nest egg over time.The real secret of financial planning is making regular contributions and sticking at it over the long term. Building personal wealth is not a quick fix. Taking a lot of risk with your hard-earned cash in the hope of securing a short-term gain could be counter-productive.Instead, you should think of managing your money as a lifelong strategy and the key to future freedom, which can change and adapt as your personal circumstances change. When you are younger, you might take a little more risk and perhaps consider investing as a way of protecting your savings against inflation. In retirement you might need to think about how to protect your funds against sudden falls in value.Whatever age you are, the best way to start is to put away a bit of money at a time and allow interest to accumulate and investments to grow. If you save or invest into an inidual savings account (Isa), then everything you earn will be free of income and capital gains tax – giving your savings plan a boost.If you think of managing your money as the key to freedom, rather than a chore, you gain a new perspective on your finances. There are three key elements to planning for the big events in your life: setting goals, making it a habit, and reviewing your progress.What do you want to achieve with your savings and investments? Identifying a tangible goal – such as saving up a deposit for a home, being able to afford a wonderful honeymoon, or taking time off work after the birth of a baby – can be more motivational than having a vague idea of saving for some undefined future event. It’s important to have a rainy day fund first, for those unexpected events, so you won’t need to dip into your goal pots in troubled times.Now build in a timeframe – when will you need the money? What will you need to do in order to start saving? How much can you start with and could you make savings in your monthly spending in order to free up some spare cash? Small changes can make a big difference over the long term. For instance, if you have one less takeaway coffee at £3 a day, this equates to £15 a week, which over a year will amount to more than £700.If you have multiple goals, split your saving priorities into pots of money – short term, medium term and long term. Short term might be money for a fantastic honeymoon or overseas trip in a year or two medium term might be wanting to save for a house deposit over five or six years and long term will be your retirement planning.When you are clear about your goals and your timeframe, then you can start to think about the best home for your money.For funds you want to access within the next five years, you might consider a deposit account. You can make small incremental payments into a savings account or cash Isa. Moving money from your current account to a savings account on the day you get paid, or setting up a standing order, will mean you’re not tempted to spend it. However, as many of these are instant access, you’ll need to be disciplined about not touching it. If you think you might be tempted, consider a fixed rate savings product that locks your money away, often in return for a better interest rate.If your goal is five years or more away, you could consider investing in a variety of ways, at different levels of risk. Although these carry a higher risk than cash savings, they can also protect your money from the effect of inflation if your investments outperform the rate of interest offered by savings accounts. As you start this journey, it might be wise not to chase big wins or follow fashion – but instead to opt for a slower but safer approach, perhaps choosing funds that invest in a broad range of shares rather than trying to pick inidual companies. There are many sources of information about market trends, and it’s always good to become familiar with these.Any money you put into Pension savings has the benefit of being boosted by tax relief, but you can’t access the fund until you’re at least 55 and it’s best to wait until you retire. You should join a scheme at work if they have one, or save into your own private pension.It’s easy to start off with good intentions, and then forget to continue because of a lack of time or motivation.The key to successful money management is automating your financial commitments. Set up a regular amount to leave your bank account and be paid directly into your Isa or savings account. That way, the money has moved before you spend it, and you never have to set a reminder.Playing the long game can work in your favour, because the interest you build up in a deposit account will accumulate naturally. If you are investing for the long-term in the stock market, you’ll be less concerned with the short-term ups and downs of share prices. Sometimes people approach saving and investment in an emotional, rather than a rational way.It’s easy to buy shares when the stock market is doing well, and then panic after they have fallen. Try to take a long-term view, and check how your strategy is working for the long term, rather than from month to month. Remember: investments should be viewed as a five-year commitment, so make sure you think of these as a long-term strategy.Investments can carry a higher risk than cash savings and you may not always get back what you put in. Remember, the value of any tax benefits described depends on your inidual circumstances, and tax rules may change in the future.Whatever your situation, and no matter your level of confidence, HSBC could help you make better-informed investment decisions.

For one thing, the money market rates that dictate the pricing of many savings products slumped to record lows this week.That would be great news for borrowers, but terrible for savers at a time when many older people appear to be using easily accessible savings accounts as a “safe haven” for pension cash.And perhaps we cannot completely rule out the possibility of interest rates going negative for savers in the UK, as they have done in European countries including Switzerland and Denmark, where some banks are now charging wealthy iniduals for looking after their cash instead of paying interest.Andrew Hagger at the financial website MoneyComms says: “It’s not looking good for savers at the moment.” Asked whether savings rates could potentially head towards zero, he says: “Potentially on some instant-access accounts, that could happen. If the base rate was cut, in some instances we could be heading towards zero or pretty close.”The move by NS\u0026ampI is especially notable because as well as being one of the UK’s biggest savings providers, it is also a government department.When we invest in NS\u0026ampI products, we are lending money to the government, and in return it pays us interest (or prizes for premium bond holders). But there is a big problem for savers: it is now cheaper for the government to raise cash on the money markets instead, which it does by issuing bonds.Sarah Coles of the investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown says: “At the moment, the enormous uncertainty in the market means investors want bonds and are willing to accept low yields in return.”Rates might be falling, but Ray Boulger at the mortgage broker John Charcol – who tracks gilt yields – says that if you are a saver who has some money you don’t need right now, there is an argument for locking it up for a year or two on the basis that over the next few months, rates are more likely to fall than go up.So what can you do?• Consider an offset mortgage. If you have a mortgage, plus a decent amount in savings that you want to hang on to but is probably earning very little interest, it may be worth considering an offset home loan, says Boulger. These mortgages link your savings to your home loan, so your savings balance is used to reduce – or offset – the interest you pay on your mortgage.• Keep it in the family. Ultra-low interest rates may mean more loans and handouts from the Bank of Mum and Dad. “The lower the return you are getting on your savings, the more value there is in helping out a child or grandchild with a deposit,” says Boulger."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7c4a8aeb41739d97f2d9caa0325c064f95506e7/0_88_1866_1120/master/1866.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1465cae0f9d426990e242164c8afe322","title":"bernard haitink final prom 60 emanuel ax review vienna philharmonic benvenuto cellini gardiner orr","story":"Royal Albert Hall, LondonWith a minimum of fuss, to momentous effect, Bernard Haitink conducted his final UK concert taking risks to the lastHe arrived with Bruckner’s Seventh Symphony, in 1966, and left with that same majestic work, a sustained blaze of brass fanfares, poetry and angst, 53 years later. Bernard Haitink’s final Prom, and his last UK concert, attracted record queues and desperate jostling for tickets. As performance, and as momentous occasion, it exceeded expectation. That long-ago debut Prom – in the midst of the swinging 60s – triggered a new interest in the Austrian composer, always central to Haitink’s musical preoccupations. He calls Bruckner’s music “a mountain… a steady ascent”. Now 90, Haitink has climbed this particular peak all his professional life. The prospect of never again having this quiet, modest Dutchman on the podium leaves us bereft.His manner may be restrained – incisive baton beat with his right hand, small indications of expression with his left – but his music-making has rare freedom, transparency and amplitude. Minimal signals achieve maximum effect. He demonstrated that at the start on Tuesday, by making a simple, dampening gesture to the excited audience, cheering wildly before a note had been played. The silence was instant. For so many present, this musician’s performances will have been at the heart of their listening lives: aside from the huge catalogue of recordings, as chief conductor of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, Amsterdam music director of Glyndebourne, and the Royal Opera House principal conductor of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the Staatskapelle Dresden. He conducted one of the first Proms I attended while still at school. A pivotal event, it changed my comprehension of music for ever.This UK farewell concert, which Haitink had already conducted in Salzburg, and was due to repeat, finally, in Lucerne on Friday, was with the Vienna Philharmonic, an ensemble he knows well, and of which he is an honorary member. It opened with Beethoven’s Fourth Piano Concerto with Emanuel Ax as soloist. Supple and subtle, Ax’s playing in some ways mirrors the Viennese sound, effort scarcely visible, drama imaginatively blended and shaped, never exaggerated. The first-movement cadenza, almost a sonata in itself, captured a sense of improvisation, with the VPO accompanying like chamber musicians.For the Vienna Philharmonic, above all other orchestras, tradition and collective memory are of the essence. Bruckner, who lived much of his life in Vienna and died there, is core repertoire. The glowing, integrated string timbre, the drier oboe sound and the mellow radiance of the Vienna horns – distinguished by their unique double-cylinder valve (the technical difference from a standard French horn is obscure to a non-brass player, but you hear it) – bring a particular clarity and gleam to Bruckner. Certain moments stood out: the oboe and clarinet theme early on, the optional cymbals and triangle at the climax of the Adagio, purposeful rather than hysterical the primal energy of the Scherzo and that abrupt, perfectly placed conclusion to the finale. Yet Haitink’s singular gift is to balance detail, contour, entity. He has always said he prefers to use a score, since anyone is capable of mistakes. Here, he kept the score, closed, on the stand in front of him, happy to take one more risk. At the end, with the leader of the Vienna Philharmonic guiding him gently by the arm, this revered and loved conductor took three bows, then slowly left the platform a last time.Berlioz’s Benvenuto Cellini, a mix of humour, tragedy and happy ending, isn’t to all tastes. John Eliot Gardiner, with his period-instrument Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique and Monteverdi Choir, couldn’t be finer advocates. A semi-staging at the Proms, in the 150th anniversary year of the composer’s death, brought Gardiner’s five-year Berlioz cycle to an end. Self-identifying with the racy, inidualistic, misunderstood Florentine goldsmith of the title, for whom he wrote one of the most difficult of all tenor roles, Berlioz packed glorious choruses, arias and ensembles into this protracted work so you almost forgive its bagginess.The American tenor Michael Spyres, generously committed as Cellini, and an exceptional Berlioz singer, had vocal problems as the evening progressed. Other singers suffered at the hands of the staging, their voices not always audible above the orchestra (no doubt affected by where you sat, and not likely to have been a problem for Radio 3 listeners). Lower voices came across best, especially Ashley Riches (Bernardino) and Tareq Nazmi (Pope Clement VII). The Monteverdi Choir was on top form. Can I tentatively suggest we may have had it with dance-round-your-handbag choir-bopping? That said, in all other respects choir and orchestra were unsurpassed.Star ratings (out of five)Vienna PhilharmonicHaitink ★★★★★Benvenuto Cellini ★★★★• Both Proms can be heard on BBC Sounds.

With MPs agonising over the gravity of the current political crisis, the member for Somerset North East nonchalantly closed his eyes and rested.For some MPs in the chamber on Tuesday night, it was the moment the man nicknamed “the honourable member for the 18th century” lost any remaining anachronistic charm.Rees-Mogg had gained a reputation among some parliamentarians and the public as a winning curiosity. His politeness, deft use of parliamentary procedure and precise pronunciation of 29-letter words like floccinaucinihilipilification won over those who disliked his populist politics. During appearances on the BBC’s Have I Got News For You and several magazine programmes, he is asked about his decision to campaign during an election alongside his nanny or to name his sixth child Sixtus.But his nonchalant posture enraged MPs on the opposition benches as they debated a plan to shut down parliament amid warnings of a wrecked economy and medicine shortages. Caroline Lucas, the Green party MP for Brighton Pavilion, had watched Rees-Mogg slouching for at least an hour before she finally took him task.“The leader of the house has been spread across three seats, lying out as if that was something very boring for him to listen to tonight,” she said.Other MPs shouted “Sit up!” and “Sit up straight!”Looking both embarrassed and defiant, Rees-Mogg shook his head, before adjusting his glasses.But by this point, social media users across the globe who were watching the debate had begun to respond with dozens of creative memes.The reclining Rees-Mogg was superimposed dancing with the 1980s ska band Madness, high-jumping the Fosbury flop and dropped on to the sofas of The Simpsons and Friends – renamed “No Friends”.Lucas said the public response to his unusual parliamentary pose has been magnified by the importance of the debate.“It does demonstrate an extraordinary confidence and a sense of entitlement if you literally take up far more social space than anyone else, and that manifested itself in looking so contemptuous of everyone else. I think he has suddenly learnt that what you can get away with on the backbench you cannot do on the frontbench. This is an image that is going to follow him for many years to come,” she said.His performances at the dispatch box – he was accused of being dismissive of questions posed by remain-supporting colleagues – enraged some of the 21 Tory MPs who voted against the government that night.Here is the list of the 21 Conservative MPs who voted with the opposition and against the government on Tuesday night’s motion to seize control of the parliamentary timetable in order to pave the way for a bill to block a no-deal Brexit.Philip Hammond, Runnymede and WeybridgeCaroline Nokes, Romsey and Southampton NorthRory Stewart, Penrith and The BorderSoames told the : “Jacob Rees-Mogg’s performance, his rudeness and casualness to colleagues, shows he just doesn’t understand the way it works ... it was just bloody bad behaviour, you wouldn’t see Andrea Leadsom lying about.”Chris Bryant, the Labour MP for Rhondda and former deputy leader of the house of Commons, said Rees-Mogg’s performance in the house has failed to take into consideration the government’s weak position. “The thing about the leader of the house job, is you have to do it with a great deal of grace, especially when it’s a minority government. Leaders with pointy elbows don’t tend to get much done,” he said.Rees-Mogg’s week went from bad to worse on Thursday when he compared a consultant who helped draw up no-deal medical plans to the disgraced anti-vaxxer Andrew Wakefield. Rees-Mogg eventually apologised following pressure from Westminster colleagues and the chief medical officer of England, who said that the leader of the house’s comments about the respected neurologist David Nicholl were “disrespectful”.Rees-Mogg was elected to the Commons in 2010, but his profile rose considerably in the wake of the 2016 Brexit referendum when his calm performances in front of TV cameras led him to being seen as a possible future prime minister. Queues for his speeches at party conference snaked round buildings, and Moggmentum, an online conservative campaign and grassroots movement supporting him was created.The son of the former Times editor William Rees-Mogg, he dismissed questions last year about investment funds established in Ireland by Somerset Capital Management, a firm he co-founded. SCM had warned investors about the dangers of a hard Brexit as Rees-Mogg spoke out about “scare stories from project fear”.He has also refused to bow to mainstream views on abortion, which he opposes even in cases of rape.But Andrew Bridgen, the Eurosceptic MP and a close colleague of Rees-Mogg, said his difficult week should not detract from his talents.“It is clear that the opposition see him as a very capable and able leader of the house. They clearly want to get some hits on him because they see him as a threat in what has been a very bad week for the party.“Jacob was the darling of the Labour party when he was attacking May or Cameron. Now that Euroscepticism is mainstream he is the enemy. There is no politician I have met who is consistently more polite than Jacob.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/876450a1c40dda405528214e030431f570513216/0_466_3088_1854/master/3088.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2164afc51ea0d141d15fce570f19b0e","title":"britons in eu no deal brexit","story":"British citizens living in EU27 nations tell of feeling abandoned as a no-deal exit looms on horizonIf Brexit ends in no deal, many British people who live in the EU will become foreigners overnight – “third-country nationals” in legal language.There is no EU equivalent of settled status for the 1.3 million British citizens in EU27 countries, although the European commission has urged EU governments to “take a generous approach” to securing their rights in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Many countries have announced plans to guarantee British nationals’ residence rights in the event of the UK crashing out. But questions would remain about qualifications, pensions and long-term status.For many Britons in the EU27, this is why the prospect of no deal is deeply worrying, adding to a sense of anger and frustration that they have been forgotten.Jacqui Brown, 48, who has lived in a village in western France with her family since 2004, has been losing sleep over a possible no-deal Brexit.She and her husband, Adrian, 49, run an IT services company, with him running training courses around Europe. If Britain crashes out of the EU without a deal, she fears the family income will be hit.“The things that worry me most in the small hours of the night is Adrian’s ability to move easily and cheaply between home in France, the UK and wherever the client wants him to go to work. If travel becomes more difficult, less frequent, more expensive that eats into our profits.”She worries the French authorities will in future require the family to have a minimum income to operate their French-limited company, as non-EU nationals. “My worry is always as third-country nationals, we will have to have ‘x’ amount of money to fit in with the rules that are there. And Brexit has already compromised our earnings because of the sharp fall in our exchange rate.”Deal or no deal, she says her life is going to change. Currently serving as a local councillor in her village, she will no longer be eligible to stand in elections after Brexit. “For the last three years, I have been angry, upset you feel betrayed by the UK,” she says. “It just seems that we don’t count.”Kathryn, 51, and Jon Dobson, 57, have lived in the Poitou-Charentes region of west France, with their three daughters, Jennifer, 22, Emily, 20, and Sarah, 18, since 2003. The Dobsons publish an English language magazine called Living Magazine.Kathryn says her primary concern over a hard Brexit is for her daughters who are now in limbo because of the prospect of freedom of movement ending. They have lived most of their lives in France, but may not qualify for French citizenship or residency cards because they have no salaried jobs or insufficient incomes. They are also worried about studying or working abroad in case they are not allowed to return to reside in France with their parents.“When we came to France we thought the one thing we could give our children that money couldn’t buy was a second language and that inspired us to move to an EU country. We thought our children would benefit the UK and we didn’t even think about changing our nationality,” Kathryn says.““They feel abandoned by their own country while at the same time they cannot get citizenship in the country in which they have spent most of their lives.”Jane Golding, a Berlin-based lawyer, says British people in Germany are feeling “a certain amount of relief” after the German government published legislation enabling them to stay in the country. “We still have to go through the details with a fine-tooth comb, but certainly for those who’ve already been here for five years or more, it is looking pretty good,” says Golding, who is co-chair of the British in Europe campaign group.Sara Gordon, a teacher in Berlin, describes herself as “one of the lucky ones”. She now has a permanent right to live and continue her job as a teacher of 9-12 year olds in a German school. But she has friends who are still waiting to hear about their status. “There are many people who are still in limbo and everything is insecure. They don’t know if they will be able to continue to stay and work here.”Like many long-term British nationals outside the UK, she was unable to vote in the 2016 EU referendum. Her letters to MPs went answered and she feels Britons in the EU are being ignored.Above all, she is saddened for her family and the next generation, who will not have the same opportunities to study, live, work or retire in the EU. Freedom of movement, she says, is “a beautiful dream full of opportunity and that is being destroyed by a government that seems to have forgotten thousands of citizens who live and work and study in Europe”.Joanna Newman, 54, has lived in Barcelona for 29 years. Her two children, now grown up, were born in Spain but are British citizens, as being born in Spain does not confer citizenship unless at least one parent is Spanish. She also has a one-year-old grandson.“I’m really worried about no deal, most of all for my kids, because they won’t have the choices to work and study they had under free movement. The scariest thing is no one knows what’s happening or what, if anything, we should do. I don’t want to apply for Spanish citizenship because I feel British, despite living here for 29 years. But I will if I have to.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4da3851af80756d5b2d86363d0029b5b0235f2be/0_267_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dd63079ec67c1e2affa3343e84dd0aa5","title":"please ireland help sort out my eu membership","story":"Thousands of Britons who have applied to become Irish since the Brexit vote are still waiting•British and want an EU passport? Here’s where you can apply Like millions of other British citizens, Paul Gadsdon from Somerset was unhappy with the result of the EU referendum. He values the feeling that he is European, and the freedom to live and work across most of the continent. But unlike many others, he had a get-out-of-jail-free card: an Irish-born grandfather, which meant he could apply for citizenship there and obtain an EU passport.So Gadsdon set about pulling together the sequence of birth and marriage certificates that would be the first step in becoming a fully-fledged Irishman.It’s a two-step process: first, the applicant has to prove Irish heritage and obtain citizenship via the Foreign Births Register.Then they have to separately apply for an Irish passport. And it’s not cheap – anyone applying is likely to have to spend nearly £500 on fees and certificates, but with Britain heading to a crash-out Brexit, Gadsdon thought it was worth it.But two years after he began the process, he is disillusioned. Ireland’s Department of Foreign Affairs has cashed his cheques – but done almost nothing in return.As he says: “I spent a year gathering evidence (birth, marriage, death certificates), along with certified copies of identification, to get dual Irish citizenship through its foreign birth registry, and I haven’t heard a thing since. That was one year ago, and I was told it would take six months.“I know they have been swamped, but I did pay €278. It’s not so much the application, or the money – it’s all the documentation that I needed to apply, that I need back. It took around a year to get the 20 or so legal documents in order to start this application.”What irks Gadsdon and some other applicants, is that the Irish authorities cash the payment immediately on receipt of an application, knowing that it won’t be examined for months if not longer.Even when Gadsdon obtains his citizenship, he is likely to face another nine-month wait or longer – plus the €80 fee – to obtain a passport.Tim Minogue, from Lewes, Sussex, shares Gadsdon’s concerns. “I submitted the online form and paid the fee in late September last year, followed up by the notarised copies of my UK passport and the various family birthdeathmarriage certificates required.“I received an emailed acknowledgement of receipt of the completed application in October. Since then, not a dickybird.”Minogue says emails to the Irish authorities have not produced replies, while phone calls go unanswered.Meanwhile, the information on the Irish government’s website seems to vary, he says, with some saying that applications will take six months, and others six to nine months. Eleven months on, he’s still waiting. “Of course you have got to be sympathetic as they are obviously dealing with a flood of applications,” says Minogue, who is contemplating retirement in Ireland.“It’s just that nothing happens … on the DFA site there is a phone number, but it either just rings and rings, or it takes you to a recorded message. I sent a polite email but did not receive a reply.”He says he feels in limbo, not knowing if his application has gone astray, if he has sent the correct documentation, or if he will have to re-apply.“I have no way of finding out. And there will then be another long delay when I can actually apply for a passport,” he says.The Irish authorities told  Money that it has, indeed, been deluged with applications from Britain, but has now created a new team to deal with the rush. The DFA says: “Until 2016 the number of applications for Foreign Births Registration was relatively low, at approximately 6,000 a year. The department has seen an increase in the number of applications, from approximately 6,000 in 2015 to over 25,000 in 2018. More than 19,000 applications have been received already in 2019. The majority in 2019 have come from Great Britain (over 11,000 to date).”It added that even a straightforward application for citizenship can take six to nine months to process, and that complex ones can take up to 12 months."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a311eb62e550907351f1e6ad414fa6d4ee328025/0_0_4000_2560/master/4000.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0de7748809725015d18e8a7c997168fe 700w","title":"even a few minutes exercise is good for you new guidelines state","story":"Activities such as sprinting up stairs are positive for health, says UK chief medical officerExercise is good for you even if you clock up just a few minutes at a time, new UK guidelines state, overturning previous recommendations that physical activity needed to last at least 10 minutes to bring benefits.The updated guidelines on physical activity, released by the UK chief medical officers, mean that even a quick sprint up the stairs can contribute to the 150 minutes of moderate to brisk exercise (or 75 mins of intense activity) that adults are recommend to undertake every week.“We are emphasising the benefits of all activity at all levels, ideally working towards this threshold,” said Dr Charlie Foster, from the University of Bristol, chair of the CMO’s expert committee for physical activity.The report reiterates that adults should minimise time spent sedentary, as well as undertaking activities to develop or maintain muscle strength twice a week – such as gardening, carrying heavy shopping bags or doing aerobics.“Physical activity is an under-appreciated asset in our clinical arsenal. It is cheap and brings a long list of health benefits,” said Prof Dame Sally Davies, chief medical officer for England.Foster stressed that advice on muscle strengthening was too often overlooked. “It has become the forgotten guideline,” he said, adding that such activities were important in staving off a natural decline in muscle mass and bone density as we age. “It is much more important than we have probably thought,” he said.Older adults at risk of falls are again advised to take up activities like bowls or tai chi twice a week to improve balance and co‑ordination, while for the first time the guidelines for adults have also explicitly been extended to disabled adults, again recommending 150 mins of moderate activity and two days of strength and balance exercises a week.“Any myths about physical activity being inherently harmful for disabled people should be dispelled,” the report states.The updated recommendations also mention pregnant women and new mothers, with at least 150 minutes of moderate activity recommended a week, together with twice-weekly muscle strengthening exercises. However, it adds that women should tailor their physical activity to their stage of pregnancy, or delivery, and that vigorous activity should be avoided if an inidual is not used to it.For pregnant women, the guidelines state that exercise can bring benefits including reduced weight gain and a reduction in risk of gestational diabetes. The report also says moderate activity after giving birth helps women regain strength, improve their emotional wellbeing and return to their pre-pregnancy weight.“Being active won’t affect the quality of your breastmilk or breastfeeding,” said Foster, adding that the guidelines also advise new mothers to undertake pelvic floor exercises, and that women should wait until six to eight weeks after giving birth before gradually building up vigorous exercise.The guidelines also include recommendations for babies as well as children and young people. Among them, babies that are not yet crawling are recommended to have at least 30 minutes of tummy time throughout the day while they are awake.Holly Holder, evidence manager at the Centre for Ageing Better, welcomed the report.“It’s great to see these guidelines focusing on the importance of exercises which improve muscle strength and support good balance, which we know can have a huge impact on keeping us healthier for longer and reducing the risk of falls in later life,” she said. “Many of us don’t realise the huge difference this kind of activity can make to our wellbeing, especially as we age.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60c942aad6294f731e57b9a2a900c7ccc26ab992/0_35_4222_2533/master/4222.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8691fbf4fbef8f3703123c38d9a7b637","title":"rafael nadal matteo berrettini us open semi final tennis","story":"Rafael Nadal reached his fifth US Open final – and third grand slam final of the year – beating the big-serving Italian Matteo Berrettini in straight sets on Friday night.

It means a lot for me to be back after some tough moments early in the season.”Nadal, injury free, has been on fire all tournament and Berrettini, who had spent five hours and 40 minutes longer on court than him over the fortnight, needed a pair of aces to survive two break points in the first game of the match. The bustling Spaniard held without fuss in quick time. It was not a mismatch, but there was unease among the 24,000 paying customers that they might not get five sets out of these guys.“Everyone’s assuming Rafa’s going to win this easy,” John McEnroe said of the 18-1 odds available on Berretini, a first-time slam semi-finalist.Berrettini’s big serve was cutting through the cool night air at up to 133mph, and he struck the first of nine aces in getting on the board. The bookies might have been teasing the punters, but the gulf in experience was obvious. The 23-year-old Berretini was only the second Italian since Corrado Barazzutti in 1977 to go this deep here. The 66-year-old former world No7 and current captain of Italy’s Davis Cup and Fed Cup teams was in the stadium, as were a fair number of the city’s Italians, watching their young hero do his best against one of the game’s finest players. They no doubt were proud of his efforts.Berrettini has had an excellent season, winning two ATP titles, and arrived in New York ranked 25 in the world. He had nothing to lose, and played like it.He continued hitting big winners and stayed in the fight with a sprinkling of aces, holding to love to force the tiebreak, where the Nadal went 0-4 down and was relieved to see a lob go long for 3-5. Berrettini, playing without fear, drew Nadal to the net and patted the winner into an empty court for two set points. But he netted a backhand, failed to challenge a Nadal serve that was long and butchered a drop shot.Nadal outlasted him in a 23-shot rally, the longest of the match to that stage, for set point, and fist-pumped with glee when Berrettini hit long. It took him an hour and 13 minutes to get ahead of the Roman, the last 13 of them in the shootout.Berrettini was making him sweat, but the cracks widened in the second set. Time and again, he struggled to hold and the aces arrived less frequently, although his resistance was stubborn. Nadal cashed in on his 10th break chance to go 4-3 up, however, and, from there to the end, the inevitability of Berrettini’s predicament slowly crowded in on him. Nadal served out to love for a two-set lead in a little over two hours.Nadal is one of the most polite players on the Tour but, when he drilled a volley at Berrettini to get to deuce in the first game of the third, then break, he betrayed his innate ruthlessness. The Italian, trapped at the net, parried the ball away and did not look best pleased.Nadal was in total control now, cruising through the points to go 4-1 up in just over 20 minutes. A stunning, 360-degree swivelling backhand that clipped the line in the opposite corner left Berrettini gasping in awe and frustration as Nadal served out to love again for 5-1. Berrettini’s racket looked as heavy as a brick as a forehand dribbled into the net, although he found a final ace, as he ended a tournament he will leave with lots of fond memories, despite his losing struggle here.A double fault, Berrettini’s second, handed Nadal match point, and the Spaniard struck the white line again with a ripped crosscourt forehand to wrap it up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/463370f692c3434f9f89970ca8d606d9ea4ba9ca/0_0_3077_1976/master/3077.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c2cc4ea7fe6196e9e14d79c0e9eae8e5 700w","title":"ashes 2019 england v australia fourth test day four live","story":"Warner is gone! Six times in the series for Broad, and six balls faced today by Warner. The dominance continues.Robbie Chedburn emailed a little while ago. “As we are approaching the Aussie second innings what do you think of setting David Warner back in the order a bit? He’s such an attacking batsman and arguably Australia want to accumulate quickly today if he can be protected from the new ball he could really add runs quickly.”It’s not crazy, but I think he’s so firmly a career opener that there would have been no consideration of that. It would have looked like hiding, even if it was tactically sound, and it might have thrown off his concentration. Things to watch in this innings: Given the clatter of wickets in the first session, England did pretty well to get beyond lunch. We’ve got rid of 33 overs today, plus a couple for the change of innings. That still leaves something like 60 more today and another 98 tomorrow, which should still be more than enough for Australia to rack up a lead and bowl England out, but we’ve all seen that cricket isn’t always that simple. What happens next?107 overs: England 301-10 (Leach 4) Bowled! It’s all over. Last ball of the over. Pat Cummins returns for Lyon, who hasn’t been able to do any damage in this innings. The field has come back to a regulation setting. Rather than trying to work a single from the last ball he tries to hit it into the media centre, misses some deck off the seam, and loses off stump.106th over: England 301-9 (Buttler 41, Leach 4) Buttler decides that it’s time to go. He drags a drive off the inside half past mid-on and gets back for two. Tries to wallop over cover and skews a lobbed shot that plugs in the deep for two more. Then gets a full ball and creams it through cover! England go past the follow-on mark and reach 300, then Buttler takes a single to farm strike. Every run and every over is a little extra help to England. 105th over: England 292-9 (Buttler 32, Leach 4) Buttler takes a single from the fifth ball of Lyon’s over. Keeps strike.104th over: England 291-9 (Buttler 31, Leach 4) Leach with Starc to deal with. Hops across to block one, ducks a bouncer. Then he drives Mitchell Starc for four! Wasn’t intending to, it was just a straight push, but he times it nicely, beats mid-off, and rolls down the ground. Matthew Wade belts after it, es, scoops back... but his elbow is touching the rope. The crowd go up! Just as well for Leach, because he’d stopped in the middle of the pitch to chat with Buttler and might have been run out. Last ball of the over, and... hit on the pad! Appeal! Not out! And that was hitting leg stump, says HawkEye. Starc just laughs in disbelief, he was sure it was plumb. Australia have no reviews left,once again. It had some angle on it, looked halfway like it might be sliding down, but HawkEye says smashing leg stump.Brace yourself for the response.103rd over: England 287-9 (Buttler 31, Leach 0) Buttler is in two minds about what to do here. He plays a big swat at Lyon, along the ground to mid-off for none. Then prods and gets an inside edge past his stumps for none. Then tries to cut a single but hits it too well and gets four! With the leg-side field packed and close, he can’t turn a single from the last ball. 102nd over: England 283-9 (Buttler 27, Leach 0) Big cheers as Jack Leach comes to the crease. What can he do with the bat this time, in a summer of big innings for him. He defends Starc’s sixth ball and survives.Bowled him! Straight through, and Starc’s record of hitting timber continues. The over starts with swing and difficulty, Broad somehow getting a bit of bat on it. Then hops across his stumps and tries to glance, but misses. The same again. But eventually a length ball seams back into the left-hander a bit, beats his prod, and takes his off stump out of the ground.101st over: England 283-8 (Buttler 27, Broad 5) Lyon again to Broad, who manages to squeeze a single after a few balls. You keep thinking that Buttler will tee off against Lyon, but he plays circumspectly with the ball still spinning big, and only keeps out the last ball rather than trying to work the strike. Broad will have to face Starc for up to a whole over.100th over: England 282-8 (Buttler 27, Broad 4) Starc to continue after his one over before the break, and Buttler is willing to take the single from the second ball. I’m not sure about that, Starc could run through Broad more easily than most. Not this time though, as Starc bowls too much on leg stump and it thuds away for a leg bye. Buttler aims a big drive but straight to mid-off. Misses the next down leg side. Then hit on the pad from an inside edge. 16 to avoid the follow-on.99th over: England 280-8 (Buttler 26, Broad 4) Back from the buffet and ready to rumble. Lyon has changed ends, given that Starc changed ends before the break. Lyon is now bowling from the Statham end of the ground, facing the Pavilion. Broad is facing, adding a couple of runs on the sweep before carefully extending his long limbs to block out the rest. That’s a definite concern. We saw how it ruined Aaron Finch for a good six months or so. He finally got his mojo back for the World Cup, but playing Test cricket didn’t help him beyond being something he had wanted to achieve. Roy looks pretty miserable out there for the most part, and that’s reflected in the poor fielding too.A tiny victory for England, at least making sure that they’ll take two more overs out of the game for the innings changeover, whenever that may be. Every additional over that they can take out by batting could be vital, and a double whammy: not just the overs that England bat, but each run they score is a run that Australia have to take the time to score back.England are 20 short of avoiding the follow-on, but after bowling 98 overs there is no chance that Australia will enforce it. They will bat again, add to their lead which is currently 219, then declare when they feel very, very safe. Or Jos Buttler will make a freakish hundred with the tail and Australia will bat for a draw, or Australia will be rissoled in the third innings and England will have a decent target to chase. Or it will rain.Some of those are less likely than others. It’s lunch time! Grab a sandwich, and I’ll be back in a bit. 98th over: England 278-8 (Buttler 26, Broad 2) Bowling change, Starc with the last over before lunch. Buttler’s tactics have changed, as he glides the second ball to third man but doesn’t take a single. No interest in giving Starc a look at Broad. Nearly bowled third ball, left alone near off stump! Nearly bowled fourth ball, by one that shapes into the right-hander, beats his inside edge and misses his off stump. Starc errs too wide with the fifth, and as the field creeps in, the sixth is just wide enough to leave. Buttler survives! England get to lunch!97th over: England 278-8 (Buttler 26, Broad 2) Half the field is on the fence, half is up. Two slips, cover, mid-on, mid-off. Then in the deep, third man, point, square leg and long leg. Buttler chooses the third ball to work a single square of the wicket. Broad with a short leg, leg gully, and a point quite close. Only long leg is deep. Short balls coming. Ducked. The next hits him, on the shoulder as he turns away. It’s a no-ball. Broad won’t like that because now he has to face another. I wonder if that was deliberate, just to have another couple of balls at him. Broad blocks out the rest of the over though.Buttler needs to find 20 more runs to avoid the follow-on. (Not that Australia will enforce it. But it’s nice to do.)96th over: England 276-8 (Buttler 25, Broad 2) Lyon to the left-handed Broad, with two slips in place, but Broad eases it wide of the second and gets through for a single. The field spreads for Buttler, so he takes advantage of that by driving another run. Happy for Broad to face up. Lyon shreds a ball away from the bat, but Broad leaves. A straight one from around the wicket could do him. The next beats the edge and Paine takes the bails. Another over done. Eight minutes until the scheduled lunch, but the umpires might extend the session at eight wickets down. The follow-on is 22 away. “Is every second email complaining about lack of discipline?” asks Andrew Hammet. In short, yes. But go on. “English batsmen like impatient kids, not able to just stick at something for a while – like defending? I am puzzled as to how they just fall regularly for the offer to swing at one. Like everybody else?”95th over: England 274-8 (Buttler 24, Broad 1) Cummins to Stuart Broad then, who is no longer the most confident against fast bowling. He plays a couple of false shots, bouncing the ball near the keeper, then near the bowler. Cummins tries a bouncer but gets too carried away. It flies! Huge bounce, over the stepladder dweller in Broad, over Paine, and deemed five wides. Broad punches the fifth ball to point for a single, then Buttler flays a square drive for four! England are 24 away from avoiding the follow-on.94th over: England 264-8 (Buttler 20, Broad 0) Lyon getting plenty of stick from the crowd, and Buttler drives him firmly through the covers for four! Top shot. Big appeal to follow though, as Buttler steps outside off to play, then decides to pad the ball away, but turns his body and lets it hit him. The Australians appeal, and it’s an arse-before-wicket decision that they’re asking for. Buttler has been hit on the butt(ler) in front of off stump.Paine reviews! I think they just want this comical moment immortalised in a dismissal. And it’s not a bad shout, but HawkEye says the ball is just creeping over the off bail. Lyon finishes the over on leg stump, and Buttler glances another four!93rd over: England 256-8 (Buttler 12) Very little left for Buttler then, with Broad coming down the staircase and Leach to come. Buttler has no interest in protecting Archer. Takes a single off his pads first ball, a no-ball, and leaves his teammate to the bowling. Most of the over is short balls for Archer to duck, but he has a big slash at a wide ball that misses, then a dabble at a ball closer to his body that produces an edge. Short and cramping him for room, and the last ball of the over brings his wicket. A simple take for Paine.92nd over: England 254-7 (Buttler 11, Archer 1) Lyon on to bowl to Archer, in the hope that the tailender will play another daft slog like the one he tried at Headingley that could have cost them the run chase. Boundary riders to the leg side. The ball spinning into the pads, short leg interested. Archer restrains himself, keeps the bowler out. 91st over: England 254-7 (Buttler 11, Archer 1) Mitchell Starc can be so off, and then so on. He’s barely playable at the moment, hooping another ball straight through Buttler that somehow misses his stumps. Then gets one that straightens and takes the outside edge, parried by Smith at slip for two. A third ball is well outside the off stump, bounces in front of the keeper, hits a rough spot of turf, and nearly whacks Paine in the face as it shoots up and over the keeper for four byes. How are batsmen supposed to anticipate anything?90th over: England 248-7 (Buttler 9, Archer 1) Hazlewood to Archer, who does the right thing and doesn’t try to swing anything to the fence. A lot of short balls, and he just gets out of the way. A maiden. Marie Meyer wants to know what the follow-on mark is: 297 is indeed the number. David Seare is arguing that Tim Paine should pop England back in and have Sunday off. That’s great if it works, but if doesn’t you have a cooked set of bowlers with three days until their next outing.89th over: England 248-7 (Buttler 9, Archer 1) The new ball has done it for Starc, and Starc has done it for Australia. Both overnight batsmen removed by the left-armer without much scoreboard damage. Jofra Archer is next to the crease, and he strolls a single that should have seen him run out by yards. Buttler has little choice but to get things moving, surely? He gets an overpitched delivery from Starc and drives it gorgeously for four. All power. Before Stokes was out, Buttler had already driven the first ball of the over in the air for another four.That’s the big one! Stokes caught at second slip. Starc is the bowler who has made the left-hander uncomfortable – he did in the World Cup and he has again this morning. And in the end he gets his man. Pace, a decent length, no appreciable swing, and it just had Stokes pushing down the line of his off stump but not quite covering the line of the ball, which takes the outside edge for a comfortable catch. England in real trouble now, still 50-odd runs short of the follow on.88th over: England 238-6 (Stokes 26, Buttler 0) Back from the hydration interval, Hazlewood bowls short and he’s hooked for four! Off the top edge, all streak, but it soars high and long! Mitch Marsh is standing in uffish mood in his orange vest outside the boundary behind the keeper and for a minute it looks like the ball will clobber him on the scone, but it bounces in front and he takes it calmly in one hand and lobs it back to Paine.How’s this: Paine, having chased all the way back towards the rope by this point, takes the throw, throws it up in the air, hops over the rope, hops back in, and takes the rebound. Wicketkeepers don’t get many chances for the boundary-line glory catch, so he practises when he can.Next ball Paine is in action again, ing and trying to stop a short ball that erts from Stokes’ hip, but it goes wide for four leg byes!“Did anyone else spot a peculiar moment yesterday?” asks David Brown. “Lyon removed and then swapped the bails at his bowling end. I believe this is a superstition of his. As soon as Lyon returned to walk back to his mark, Root,the non facing batsman, cheekily reversed the process.”87th over: England 230-6 (Stokes 22, Buttler 0) Starc looks a decent show against Stokes, who has taken Australia’s right-armers apart with such composure in his last two Tests. A few hopping shots before the batsman gets one full enough to drive, though Cummins keeps the scoring to one from mid-on. Drinks.86th over: England 229-6 (Stokes 21, Buttler 0) Just to the crease and Hazlewod is already giving Jos Buttler a working over. Past the outside edge. Into the body. “Can you here the ridiculous noise from the microlites?” asks Stephen Morley about the camera drones over the ground. “Are the commentators not hearing this?Why is no one saying anything about it. It must surely be distracting for the players.”I’ve seen some suggestions that certain commentators may be the ones creating the drone. I can’t hear it because I’m inside, but I’ll duck out later and investigate.85th over: England 228-6 (Stokes 20, Buttler 0) Well. No mattter how loose Starc can be, there’s always that chance of threat. A couple of balls after a short wide plonk that Bairstow clobbered through cover for four, there’s the ball that Bairstow is expecting just outside off stump but that hits middle instead. It still was nowhere near the length to drive. A real mistake from Bairstow to be thinking anything but getting through the first few overs of the new ball.Here comes Mitchell Starc at last! Gets him this time, with another fast and swinging delivery. There was that sense of threat immediately with him bending the ball. But where Bairstow played the first over of that sensibly, this time he decides to play a big drive at the ball on his pads. Bad idea, as it curves in the air to beat his straight whack and take middle stump. 84th over: England 224-5 (Stokes 20, Bairstow 13) Hazlewood torches Stokes! Beaten all over. The ball cuts back into the left-hander off the seam, beats his inside edge and somehow creeps over middle stump! More close shaves than intake day for the Marines. Maiden.Alex emails from Whittington Hospital. “Long time reader, first time emailer here. I’m currently at A\u0026ampE after a fall this morning out running. Really enjoying focusing on the precarious nature of England’s position to detract from my ailments. Keep up the great work!”I was in St Vincent’s when they brought Joe Root to emergency in 2018. Exclusive access. You might seem him come in to get his tackle repacked after that crotch shot he took yesterday from Starc. Get better soon Alex. I’ve often said that running takes more lives than it saves. 83rd over: England 224-5 (Stokes 20, Bairstow 13) Stokes is looking ominous again. Gets a short ball from Starc that’s an in-between length, so he plays a whip-wristed swat shot, like a tennis cross-court volley, out in front of square towards the boundary for two runs. Deep square leg is back for the bouncer. Starc combs back beautifully with a curling ball that takes the inside edge and... beats leg stump! For four runs! No control there, it should have bowled him but he’s got away with it. Next ball, Stokes drives and he’s dropped! Dropped by Starc in his follow-through! That went back fairly fast, a bit to Starc’s right but he got both hands to it. We’ve seen him take some unbelievable catches off his own bowling, one-handed and all. That was relatively simple in comparison, but it’s gone down, and Stokes gets another run. You don’t give Steve Smith chances, and you don’t give Ben Stokes them either... (Well, obviously that’s a meaningless statement because people do, and have, which is why I’m saying it, and the fact that you shouldn’t is an inherent precondition of the idea of a contest itself. But you know. There are things we have to say in reporting on sport, or the Guild writes a stern letter.)82nd over: England 217-5 (Stokes 13, Bairstow 13) Hazlewood has the shiny new toy from the Anderson End, and immediately has the ball cutting back in as he did yesterday, up in an appeal but it was hitting Bairstow high on the thigh pad and slightly too close to leg stump. He overpitches next ball though, and Bairstow drives back past the bowler’s e and too straight for mid-off! Wade ends up on the turf as well. Four runs. Hazlewood comes back with another corker, decking back to miss the off stump by a fraction as Bairstow leaves.81st over: England 213-5 (Stokes 13, Bairstow 9) New ball. New bowler. Mitchell Starc had a fairly dirty day yesterday, as you can read about in my piece below. He is of course the sort of bowler who can suddenly have a great day in the space of five or six balls. His first is on target, just outside Bairstow’s off stump. His next two are beauties! Swing, from a fuller length, on the line of the off stump. One Bairstow allows to go just over his bails, the next he manages to get bat behind, just. He’s teased by the fourth, leaving as it bends back towards him. Serious movement. Another, into the pads, but Bairstow is playing this tough over really well, hanging back and anticipating the swing and this time even scrambling a single as he deflects to leg. Starc with one ball at the lefty bowls a good fuller ball that starts on middle and swings to off, but Stokes reads it. Great start for the bowler. 80th over: England 212-5 (Stokes 13, Bairstow 8) The last over before the new ball becomes available. Bairstow drives a full ball back underneath Lyon for a single. Stokes clips cleanly square but straight to Warner at square leg. Steve Smith is back at first slip for the spinner, and there’s a second slip in the form of Marnus Labuschagne. Stokes sees out the over.Kim Thonger emails from Madrid to say that nobody has heard of Steve Smith there. I’d also guess that The Bull might have met a nastier end than he did in South Africa. 79th over: England 211-5 (Stokes 13, Bairstow 7) Lovely ball from Cummins! Across Stokes, then it decks off the seam away from the bat and just beats the edge. He was nowhere against that from over the wicket. Cummins too full the next ball though, and flicked fine for a run. Three slips for YJB who leaves the ball alone so as not to give any of them any work. Backward point for a big shot, no gully in the conventional sense. Short-ish cover, mid-off, mid-on, midwicket, but he splits the last two off his pads and Hazlewood fumbles as he es to give away two extra runs, having to track back towards the boundary. Then nearly adds an overthrow but Wade at mid-off backs him up. 78th over: England 207-5 (Stokes 12, Bairstow 4) Big appeal against Bairstow who doesn’t offer a shot! He was hit miles outside off stump but the ball is spinning miles. It could easily have turned enough, but there’s no way an umpire can be sure of that, it would be guessing. HawkEye reckons it was missing off stump by a sliver. In the old days batsmen could pad up to those all day. Now you have to be careful. If the computer says yes...77th over: England 206-5 (Stokes 11, Bairstow 4) Young Jonny Bairstow has a job to do, and so far he’s being a good boy. Not trying anything expansive as he blocks and leaves a Cummins over. There’s still a bit of conventional swing with the old ball, even at this stage of decrepitude. It’s sprightly.76th over: England 206-5 (Stokes 11, Bairstow 4) Nathan Lyon will start from the Jimmy Anderson End. Old mates, those two. Starc and Hazlewood to take the new ball in a few overs, presumably. Lyon gives it good flight and drop immediately, he doesn’t need to warm up. The right-handed Bairstow has a look at him. There’s big turn immediately for Lyon, one ball going all the way across Bairstow and past his legs from well outside off. He plays a similar ball off his pads but the backward square is in the right spot. Finally there’s a single to end the over, tapped to midwicket. 75th over: England 205-5 (Stokes 11, Bairstow 3) Cummins may be feeling a bit stiff and sore after yesterday. He bowls a relatively gentle couple of first balls, then on the pads of Bairstow for a single. Drops too short to Stokes, who swivels and pulls in a contained fashion along the ground to deep backward for four. Cummins is on the money by the end of the over, just outside the left-hander’s off stump at 87 miles per hour. Hello all, thanks JP. Pat Cummins will start the day after his marathon spell yesterday. Bairstow to face, Stokes at the far end, England 297 behind. Great mood in the ground already, it’s still grey but not nearly as cold or windy today. Should be an excellent day of cricket ahead (here’s hoping, anyway).Here’s the TMS overseas link. Listen and watch, folks.There’s a Geoff Lemon heading your way shortly to take you through the opening session of play. If you want to let him know your thoughts you can find him on Twitter or send him an email. I’ll see you again tomorrow (presuming England don’t do something utterly horrendous over the next few hours). “What’s all this ‘only Australia can win’ stuff?” emails Andrew Cosgrove. “I seem to remember England once played in a match where they were bowled out for 67, conceding a first innings deficit of plenty. I’m pretty sure people were saying then, only one team could win that.” That first-innings deficit was only 112, and time was not a factor. England are still 300 from a lead before they even have to contend with taking ten Australian wickets. So, yeah, I’m comfortable tempting fate. Scott Blair wants to nominate another sunshine song to brighten your morning. “If we’re looking for songs that contain encouraging thoughts about today’s weather, the legendary Nazareth have it nailed. May the Sun Shine...” Worth it for the braces alone.I like this image. Something a bit LS Lowry Going To The Match (2019) about it. All those people milling about on the oval, the grey sky, and the Manchester cityscape in the distance. Mitchell Starc seemed to be blossoming into the most feared bowler in cricket a couple of years ago but now he finds himself on the fringes of Australia’s attack. Geoff Lemon put his considerable intellect towards figuring out why.Starc is the best white-ball bowler in the world. He can be unstoppable in a format where batsmen have to attack him and where the approach for his 10 overs is known ahead of time. One-day bowling is a sonnet, Test matches are a verse novel. The tyranny of the white page applies to the white clothes.Simon McMahon is joining in with the Brexit bantz. “I think I might have heard this somewhere else this week, but let’s just get this done, eh? If Stokes goes first ball we can all then get on with the rest of our day. It’d be nice if the series went to the Oval, but that’s just more delay. Get it done now. I’d rather be ... well, you get the point.”Rory Burns has been one of England’s few bright spots this series so far and he showed again yesterday he has the temperament to open the batting for his countries for many years to come. Barney Ronay sings his praises here.Burns has been a little frantic against the short ball. Understandably so. County cricket does not provide regular 90mph pace trios to help groove your method. But something has changed here. Burns is a problem-solver, a man constantly refining his technique, an example what the tracksuited gurus on the A team tours he was never asked to attend would probably call a Growth Mindset.And after his heroics with the bat Burns did his best with the chat, speaking to an assembled press gallery containing Ali Martin.We’re in a fight and it’s very obvious what we need to do. A couple of good partnerships and then we are up close to them, and we’re asking them to make a play. We have got to look at from a positive aspect. The way Headingley went, anything is possible.The pitch: Still looks full of runs to me. Those footmarks will encourage Nathan Lyon bowling to England’s left-handers, but apart from that no obvious demons. “Good morning,” howdy John Starbuck. “How does this Fourth Day compare with other Fourth Days in the Ashes (apart from Headingley)?” Presuming this is a literal question and I’m not missing some subtext, Steve Smith was batting at the start of the fourth day in the opening two Tests. Although, there’s a good chance if you picked any slice of time during this series the answer would be the same.Slap on the factor 50, knot your hankie, and make sure that portable hand-held plastic fan thingy has a brand new battery in it, today is going to be a belter. Well, comparatively. In the way that The Wiggles occupying the front bench of the House of Commons would be an upgrade on the current state of parliament. For the first time this Test the Met Office reckons there is practically no chance of rain falling on Old Trafford, and we may even see prolonged spells of sunshine. The scheduled 98 overs will be bowled with a gentle northerly, as opposed to the biting westerley that has turned a few fielders into Michelin men. The top, wait for it, could get as high as 17 (seventeen) degrees! Unfurl the bunting and pre-pour the pints, for today is a day to celebrate.Day three was nip and tuck Test cricket of the old fashioned variety and Vic Marks has written all about it right here.Three late-evening wickets from Josh Hazlewood have left England with a mighty struggle to save this game and keep the pursuit of the Ashes alive. In a six-over spell just before the intervention of bad light Hazlewood dispatched two of England’s most adhesive batsmen, Rory Burns and Joe Root, who had assembled a dutiful partnership of 141. Then he clean bowled Jason Roy, who attracts many adjectives which do not, however, include “adhesive”, whether batting or fielding.Hello everybody and welcome to live OBO coverage of the fourth day of the fourth Test of the Ashes from Old Trafford. And what a day we have in store. After three rain-interrupted days the match is delicately poised. Australia are the only combatant with a chance of winning but to do so they must engineer 15 English wickets on a surface containing few demons not to mention find enough time to plunder enough second-innings runs of their own to bolt the backdoor behind them. It’s a well-worn cliche this series but the opening hour, and opening session, will be crucial. Should England survive the remaining six overs with the old ball and progress through the early stages of the second new Dukes without much alarm, Australia’s task will grow in difficulty by the minute. A rapid collapse and England will be staring at an almighty rearguard action this evening and throughout tomorrow. Once again England turn to Ben Stokes for protection. He has the complexion of a Wildling and the glacial melt eyes of a White Walker but with Stokes on night’s watch his teammates could sleep soundly knowing the best-equipped batsman in the team will be at the crease for potentially the most significant passage of play in the Test. Around him Jonny Bairstow, and in particular Jos Buttler - when he strides out as a specialist No.8 - must prove their worth. The latter is a luxury England can ill-afford in recent form, unless he switches codes and transforms into Steven Gerrard or Frank Lampard but not both, never both, we don’t want to open that can of worms again. Australia’s day will be determined in two phases. In the morning session with the new ball the relentlessly impressive Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins will hope to recapture the venom that threatened to rip the match decisively their way late yesterday. After lunch all eyes turn to Nathan Lyon to exploit a surface that is increasingly receptive to spin. It all amounts to what should be an engrossing day of Test match cricket.If you want to be a part of it you can drop me a line on Twitter or you can send me an email.

Whether they’ll return in 2020 is another matterI think that is important, though. The VMAs provide a vital cultural service in that, a little bit like opening night during the heyday of Big Brother, they tell us broadly who is going to be famous for the next five years, and they do that by throwing a mess of crap at the wall and seeing which bits of it stick. So for example: Lil Nas X will be famous, and Rosalía. Megan Thee Stallion will still be about, as will Normani. Ava Max, not so much. Lizzo, yes.And then there’s Tana Mongeau, arguably one of the most fascinating personalities on the planet right now, not because of her actual personality but due to her sheer, naked desire to be seen as one: turning up in diamond-frame sunglasses with a snake round her shoulders on the red carpet, weeks after her not-fake fake wedding to vlogger Jake Paul in a Los Angeles mall, fresh from her MTV blockbuster show Tana Turns 21, simply screaming of that early-aughts famous-at-all-costs energy that saw everyone release a sex tape and a self-titled perfume. We criticised Kim Kardashian for it, didn’t we, and now we bow at her knees like a queen. We had a pop at Jodie Marsh for doing more or less the same and … well. She’s got her thing going on. It is impossible to know where Mongeau will be in the year 2024: she’ll either be selling footpics on OnlyFans or she’ll be a world-dominating billionaire. Whichever way, we will be forced to watch it happen.But we all know the real reason the VMAs exist, which is to get cutaway shots of Taylor Swift dancing just a little bit out of time to the beat before getting her on stage to receive five to six awards for something.The first ceremony was in 1984, five years before Swift was even born, but you feel that, even then, it was designed with this culmination in mind: that Madonna performing Like a Virgin in a wedding gown was actually just careful groundwork laid so that Taylor Swift could accept the best visual effects award for that weird crap snake in the ME! video.The deep truth of the VMAs, whatever year it happens to be, whatever as-yet-unborn celebrity they Red Carpet Intro next year, whichever currently obscure pop-adjacent rapper is right now uploading the SoundCloud hit that will, in 12 little months, see them headlining the stage, is this: Taylor Swift will be there, affecting a look of shock at winning a best video award, every year for ever, until the sun burns out of the sky."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/41eba6ef670e825c6c0cd01b531bd89b0d9e0957/0_0_653_392/master/653.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23f9882fb17f13bc5d30280ad10f3548","title":"thysia huisman describes alleged by jean luc brunel","story":"Ex-model is one of three women accusing the model scout and friend of Jeffrey EpsteinThysia Huisman had just turned 18 when, late one evening in September 1991, she arrived before the door of an imposing apartment building on avenue Hoche in central Paris carrying a small backpack and three photographs from her portfolio.A young would-be model from Leiden in the Netherlands, she was impressed, but also alarmed. “It was very grand,” she says. “A vast, grand apartment, right by the Arc de Triomphe. Fancy furniture, paintings on the walls. But it was his home.”Not long before, Huisman had met Jean-Luc Brunel in a chocolate shop round the corner from Models Office, the Brussels agency that had just begun to represent her. Its owners, Pierre and Marielou Eggermont, had said she must see him.He was in his mid-40s and a charmer. “He said: ‘You’re unbelievable. You’re stunning. You must come to Paris, right away. I can make you a star,’” says Huisman, now a TV editor-in-chief, sitting in the kitchen of her home in a neat new suburb of Amsterdam.Her agents were sure: Brunel could launch her. Karin Models, his agency, had done it before and would do it again: Monica Bellucci, Sharon Stone, Christy Turlington, Jerry Hall, Milla Jovovich – all, Brunel has since claimed, owe their careers to him.So Huisman, 46, went to Paris. She was so special that she was to stay in his apartment, Brunel told her. But within a week she had left, because on her fourth or fifth night, she says, Brunel – who has been accused of supplying the late Jeffrey Epstein, his close friend, with underage girls – spiked her drink and raped her.Allegations of misconduct against Brunel date back decades, but he has faced no action. Husiman and two other former models have told the  they were sexually assaulted by Brunel in the 1980s and 1990s in and around Paris, where he was a power player in the global fashion industry.Brunel and his attorney did not respond to requests for comment. In a 2015 statement, Brunel vehemently denied involvement “directly or indirectly” in Epstein’s crimes. “I strongly deny having committed any illicit act or any wrongdoing in the course of my work as a scouter or model agencies manager,” he said then.But from the first evening Huisman met Brunel, she says, relating the events of 28 years ago with calm but clearly painful precision, the Frenchman was “coming on to me. Really flirting. Like in a jokey way on one level, saying I was so lovely, that we’d get married one day. But then also more menacing.“So when I asked where I was supposed to sleep, he said: ‘Oh, my bed, of course.’ One time, later, he came into the closet where I was, locked the door behind him, and told me: ‘You know, one day we’re going to have sex.’ I kept him away, made a joke of it, told him he was too old for me, and too short. A short, old Frenchman.”But Huisman felt deeply uncomfortable. “There were lots of other girls there, some I recognised from magazines,” she says. “Maybe half a dozen. Young girls, certainly some underage, from Czechoslovakia, Russia, Yugoslavia. They looked … sad. And these older, much older businessmen. It was obvious they were sleeping together.”Part of her wondered whether this was all simply normal for the fashion industry. Part of her realised it could not possibly be right. And part of her thought: “I want to be a model, the whole world awaits, and this man can make it happen. I just have to be careful. Not drink. Stay in control. Keep focused. I thought I could handle it.”The first night, she slept on blankets on the floor of another girl’s room. The next day, Brunel’s assistant Pamela took her to the agency and to lunch. The third day there was a test shoot, and a couple of go-sees – preliminary castings for multiple jobs. Every night there were dinners, groups of 15 or 20, in expensive restaurants.One night, Brunel told Huisman that she could have a career in the movies too, and that “his good friend the CEO of Miramax – I realised later, Harvey Weinstein – would be in Paris the following week, so I should really meet him.”On what was to be her final night in Paris, after a restaurant and nightclub, the party returned to Brunel’s flat, Huisman says. “He gave me a drink. I don’t know what it was, a mixed drink of some kind, he said he made it specially for me. I drank it and straight away I started feeling tired, woozy.”Her recollections after that, she says, are “vague, but with really clear, like, snapshots – like a fuzzy, unclear movie, all in slow motion, but with a few super-sharp stills. I remember he took me to his room, laid me on his bed, said I should relax. I recall him lying on top of me, me trying to push him off.“I remember trying to move, but not really being able to. Like almost being paralysed. I heard the sound of my blouse, a black blouse, ripping. I had a black skirt, too. I felt him – this is difficult – between my legs. Pushing.”She was awoken the next morning, Huisman says, when Brunel’s butler (he employed an Indian couple as cook and factotum) came in with a cup of tea. “He didn’t seem surprised to see me there,” she says. “Jean-Luc wasn’t there. But I … felt we had had sex. I had marks, bruises, on my inner thighs. I knew. I know.”She was naked but for a kimono that was not hers, her clothes in a pile on the floor. “I just ran,” she says. “I was scared. I grabbed my clothes, rushed to the other girl’s room, got my backpack and left. Like a thief in the night. He was on the phone in the living room. I was scared what he would say.”On the street, she says, all the buildings “were like … moving. Everything sounded really loud. I felt totally disconnected.”Huisman mentioned the incident to her Dutch boyfriend, she said, but in the vaguest terms, and told no one else. “I was really ashamed,” she says. “I felt really stupid. Guilty. Angry with myself.” Over the years, she said, she told various friends of an “unpleasant incident” in Paris. “I buried it, really,” she says.Her current partner, whom she met eight years ago, says she told him soon after they got together that she had been “molested”. More details emerged gradually over time, he says, until, two years ago, he heard the whole ugly story.“A lot of things happened at the same time,” says Huisman. “I started therapy and it came up. The #MeToo movement really stirred something in me. I began looking into Brunel saw the scandals he was implicated in realised the ties to Epstein talked to women with similar experiences … It feels good to have brought it all out of the dark, to realise I was not the only one and it was not my fault.”Justice may be too late for Epstein, who was found dead in his cell earlier this month while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. But she hopes Brunel will be prosecuted, even if he is now in his 70s. She has consulted a French lawyer and is considering filing a formal complaint in Paris.“I recorded the call. I asked, did they still work with Brunel? She said: “Yes, as a matter of fact he was over a few months ago.” So I told her exactly what had happened, why I’d come back in such a rush. And she said: ‘You know, he can’t have done that. He would never do that. Jean-Luc, he’s just too sweet.’”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a099a76eb22b44f419b0346fdf6b8eaa32ab28c7/0_172_5150_3090/master/5150.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e16f5a22c6cde2a848db7f592ffc0e9b","title":"clergy hardship church of england wealth","story":"Exclusive: Some vicars are tens of thousands of pounds in debt and reliant on charity handoutsHundreds of clergy are in financial hardship, with some resorting to credit cards or even a high-interest payday lender, despite the Church of England sitting on a multibillion-pound investment fund.Some vicars are tens of thousands of pounds in debt, with many struggling to survive – especially those supporting families – and relying on charity handouts to make ends meet, the  has learned.Clergy Support Trust’s chief executive, Jeremy Moodey, told the  that in at least one recent case, a vicar had been forced to use a high-interest payday lender. He also highlighted how some clergy had been hit by the government’s controversial introduction of a two-child limit on benefits, which restricted the child allowance in universal credit and tax credits.It comes amid dwindling congregation numbers and raises questions over whether the C of E should be doing more to help impoverished vicars given that it has an investment fund worth £8.3bn and is paying asset management executives six-figure sums, including one who earned more than £530,000 last year. The archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby – who has two grace-and-favour homes including Lambeth Palace – is paid £83,400 and last year attacked Amazon for not paying a living wage and railed against poverty.The bishop of Buckingham, the Right Rev Alan Wilson, told the  “there’s always more to be done” to help financially struggling clergy. “Clergy people’s circumstances and the stresses of ministry are becoming more complex and erse all the time,” he said. “Often people are kind and there is help out there, but there are holes in what’s available.”Moodey, a former banker who is training part-time to become a vicar, said he was shocked by the levels of financial hardship among some clergy when he took on the trust role.“Clergy are not going to be serving their communities as well as they might if they’re worrying about paying bills or getting a holiday,” he said. “They live in a goldfish bowl in the vicarage. They need to get away but often they can’t afford it if they have got families.”He said they often struggled to cover everyday costs, such as fixing a broken washing machine or paying for new school uniforms. Many clergy had an “innate tendency not to come forward for help”, Moodey added, also expressing concern for those who suffered relationship breakdown.“There’s a sense of: ‘There are many in my congregation who are worse off than me. Why should I regard myself as a special case?’”In the case of the vicar who was forced to use a payday loan firm, Moodey said: “He is now working through a debt repayment plan with a debt advice charity which is a partner of ours, with some help from us to get that sorted.”Welby has previously attacked payday lenders, but his criticism backfired when it emerged the C of E held an indirect investment in the now defunct Wonga. Moodey said: “Payday lenders are causing significant suffering amongst the wider population and you would hope that clergy would be able to mirror what is the church’s position which is that, actually, payday lenders are bad news. But if you’re desperate and you really can’t make ends meet, then desperate people do desperate things.”Most vicars receive a stipend of up to £27,886 plus housing but there are nearly 3,000 “self-supporting” ministers who are not paid, according to newly released C of E figures. The C of E’s website lists a series of adverts for “house for duty” roles, which are unpaid.Wilson said: “Mental health issues pose an increasing challenge, and I worry about retired non-stipendiary clergy and some clergy spouses who are in real difficulties. There is always more to be done, not only for iniduals who are struggling, but in order to understand the underlying trends. Above all, it’s important that people experiencing problems alert archdeacons and bishops to what is going on.”A C of E spokeswoman said: “We take the wellbeing of our 20,000 clergy extremely seriously. We note with concern the cases highlighted by Clergy Support Trust and we are grateful for its support for clergy struggling financially, as well as for the work of the Churches’ Mutual Credit Union, launched in 2015 with the backing of the Church of England.“Problem debt is a widespread and serious issue in our society and it is worrying that a group of clergy is also affected.”The C of E said it was “hugely appreciative” of self-supporting ministers “who work voluntarily for the church, many already with successful careers in the secular world”.The archbishop of Canterbury’s stipend is set independently and Lambeth Palace also houses offices for staff and space for other groups, and welcomes visitors, the C of E added.He is a familiar face on TV screens, fronting BBC documentaries exploring religious issues.But while many viewers will recognise the Rev Peter Owen-Jones, most will have no idea that he would not be able to continue in priesthood without charitable handouts.The 61-year-old is a non-stipendiary vicar – serving the villages of Firle, Glynde and Beddingham in East Sussex – meaning he is not paid by the Church of England for his duties.Instead, Owen-Jones is reliant on a yearly charitable grant of up to £3,000 and an “honorarium” from the diocese of £430 every quarter. “I would not be able to continue as priest were it not for the support of the Clergy Support Trust,” he said.“I get a grant from them and I’ve had a grant from them for the last three or four years. This is my choice. I love being a parish priest. I’ve taken the moral decision to be a non-stipendiary priest because I think that just sits easier with me. I don’t have an issue with priests not being paid. I have an issue with that system subsidising what appears to be an unchanged and an unchanging centre.”Last month, the former advertising executive revealed that in his early days as a vicar supporting a young family, he had once been so broke he made money posing naked for an art class.In theory, Owen-Jones’s unpaid role – which comes with a house in Firle – is part-time, but the reality is different and he questions the C of E’s approach, describing its reliance on self-supporting ministers as “morally questionable” given that they are often expected to perform full-time duties.Owen-Jones, who is orced and has four adult children, said: “When I tell people I’m not paid they say: ‘What?’ This has been coming for 30 or 40 years. The more and more non-stipendiary priests, the greater the clamour will become.“I think there is an increasing reliance on non-stipendiary vicars. How much of the church is being kept afloat by self-supporting ministry? Whether those ministers can continue to be treated as full-time ministers, that to me is morally questionable.”In 2002 there were 2,091 self-supporting ministers, but that has now risen to 2,920 following a slight decline in recent years. Self-supporting ministers tend to be older, with an average age of 62.3 compared with 52.1 for stipend posts. Nearly a third (190) of vicars in training last year were preparing for non-stipendiary roles.Owen-Jones, who was a stipendiary priest earlier in his career, added: “What’s happening is that the church is increasingly relying on what they call ‘self-supporting’ ministers and ‘house-for-duty’ priests.“At the moment I believe it’s been happening under the counter. We need to have a frank and open discussion about whether the church can afford to maintain its working apparatus or whether there needs to be root-and-branch reform, given the number of people that are going to church and given the expectations that are placed upon the church by the state. At the moment it’s not adding up.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1d1894bb555bb203abf50940d9db6b62453ee59/0_0_5782_3468/master/5782.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a86d0f909c17d5b8e38a0863722d5fee","title":"hurricane dorian bahamas grand bahama abaco latest news","story":"Lashing rain, 185mph winds – the ferocious storm has left 43 dead and hundreds missing. Oliver Laughland reports from the rubble of Grand BahamaAs Erica Roberts clung to a tall mango tree, the winds and sea water churned up by Hurricane Dorian pounding her face, a single thought ran through her head: “I will not die like this.”Her home, in the small town of High Rock on the eastern side of Grand Bahama, had been swept away. Her 24-year-old daughter Natori survived too, clinging to branches beside her.Roberts’ face and arms still bore dry, bloody cuts. The pair eventually lost their grip, she said, but they were swept close to a home that still stood. They got inside.“By the grace of God, we made it,” she said. “We are survivors.”The 41-year-old had not heard from seven close family members: two sons, a sister, two nephews, cousins, uncles. All were still missing. In a community of about 600, two were confirmed dead. At least 20 had not been heard from since Dorian spent two days destroying almost every building in sight.“We need aid,” Roberts said. “We have nothing. Everyone is doing this self-sufficiently.”The hurricane’s devastating 185mph winds brought destruction to Grand Bahama and the Abaco Islands and left at least 43 people dead – a toll that is sure to rise as emergency crews search for survivors.Parts of the road just outside town had been stripped of tarmac, leaving rubble, exposed pipework and pools of bronzed water where trapped fish still swam. Broken pylons dangled in the street. Palms were bent at 45 degrees, leaves shaved off by the wind.The storm surge here, about half a mile from the sea, rose to around 20ft. Wind gusts were recorded at 220mph. Many who have lived here for generations said the brutality of the storm was something they had never seen or even heard of before.For Roberts, who works at a nearby casino – also obliterated – the unprecedented intensity of Dorian, the way it strengthened so quickly to category 5 and stood over the island for more than 24 hours, had a simple explanation.“I think the climate is playing a big role in all of this,” she said, starring at the muddy tiled floor of a partially destroyed home in which she had taken shelter. “The severity of this … it’s global warming.“I’ve recycled all my life. I use less plastic. And think about less emissions. I’ve always been committed. But the world is not.”As residents of High Rock began to assess the damage, the global climate crisis was on the minds of many.Euridice Kemp, a 40-year-old resident of Freeport, had returned to help salvage what she could from her grandparents’ home. All that was left of the building were the concrete foundations. Belongings – crockery, family photos, clothes, wooden furniture – were strewn on the muddy grass. She pointed to the horizon where six coconut trees once stood, where she played as a child.“It’s all gone. What we’re doing to Mother Earth and the way this turns around on areas like here … I just can’t. Never … never in my life. My heart is broken. I’m in shock.”Did she consider herself a victim of the climate crisis?“We are the biggest victims of climate change. But how can we fight for ourselves against bigger, global countries? How do we move forward?”At the shoreline, the sea still churned. A lighthouse was partially destroyed, its light blown away, leaving only a red-and-white striped tower.Pastor Joey Saunders, 61, was counting his blessings. The storm surge crept up to the roof of his house. He spent two days clinging to the branches of a tree, waiting for the water to recede, terrified that sharks might lurk below. The wind lashed him so hard, he began to feel numb.“I couldn’t feel anything any more,” he said. “I was just so afraid.”Limited aid has recently arrived in Grand Bahama and the Abaco Islands – with officials battling flooding and poor weather conditions for days.On Grand Abaco, the Royal Bahamas Defense force assisted around 160 evacuees to leave the island via ferry. The British navy is also assisting aid operations in the region and private vessels have begun to arrive as well.The Royal Caribbean cruise liner Symphony of the Seas arrived in Grand Bahama on Friday morning bringing with it 10,000 meals the company has provided itself. The food will be distributed by local NGOs and the Bahamian government.The United Nations has announced the purchase of eight tons in ready to eat meals and is aiming to provide other assistance including satellite communications and generators.The UN has said since Wednesday that around 70,000 people in the northern archipelagos of the Bahamas are in need of life-saving assistance."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfe3f98ba5a47451672c5a05c7ba90df38685951/0_281_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a2d6ba175a0e5df321417b82ef93cd41","title":"indian woman 73 gives birth twin girls mangayamma yaramati andhra pradesh","story":"Mangayamma Yaramati and babies in good health, say doctors in Andhra PradeshA 73-year-old woman in southern India who has given birth to healthy twin girls described motherhood as “the happiest time of my life”.The babies were delivered through caesarean section on Thursday. Uma Shankar, the woman’s doctor, told the  the mother and her children were in good health.Mangayamma Yaramati and her husband, Sitarama Rajarao, 82, from Andhra Pradesh, said they had always wanted to become parents but were unable to conceive. Yaramati told BBC Telugu they had been stigmatised in their community because they were childless.“They would call me a childless lady,” she said, adding: “We tried many times and saw numerous doctors, so this is the happiest time of my life.” Yaramati had a baby shower this week, before the delivery.Shankar said his patient was cared for “in the scientific way”. “During the treatment we had three groups of doctors: one took care of her general health, one took care of her nutritional status and one to took care of her pregnancy.” These three areas were monitored every day, he added.Manngayamma started the menopause 25 years ago, and so an egg was taken from a donor and fertilised with Rajarao’s sperm through IVF, Shankar told the Hindustan Times. “Luckily, she conceived in the first cycle and was found to be pregnant in January.”|Shankar said many of the women who came for IVF had had children but they were killed in road accidents. “They come for IVF at a later age. We have many women from the 40-50 age group.” The social disapproval associated with not having children was a problem, he added.Manngayamma may be the oldest woman to conceive. Shankar said according to her patient’s birth certificate, she was born in 1946.In 2016, another Indian woman, Daljinder Kaur, who was thought to have been 72 when she gave birth to a boy.Asked how they would care for their children, Rajarao said: “Nothing is in our hands.

Then he was accused of faking itAnthony Ekundayo Lennon remembers the moment his life spun out of control. It was late morning, Friday 2 November 2018. The actor and director was giving a talk about the performing arts to university students, and his phone kept flashing. It was so incessant that the students suggested he’d better take a look. He told them it wouldn’t be anything important, turned the phone over and got on with his lecture. When the class broke for lunch, he saw missed calls from Talawa theatre company, where he had been working for the past year, as well as several unknown numbers and messages.One text stood out. It was from a journalist at the Sunday Times, asking for a comment on a story the paper was preparing to run about Lennon’s place on a prestigious scheme – the artistic director leadership programme (ADLP) for black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) theatre practitioners. Lennon had been awarded an 18-month residency with Talawa, Britain’s best-known black-led theatre company. He scrolled down the text.“It does seem striking that neither the ADLP nor the Talawa has ever made clear that you are a white man,” the journalist wrote, adding: “Why has neither Talawa theatre or the ADLP programme made clear that you have received BAME funding as a white man with Irish parents?” Lennon decided not to respond. It was true that his parents were white, but this was no secret nor was the fact that he believed he had African heritage. He had always been treated by people as mixed race, and so identified as a person of mixed heritage. “I didn’t think I had anything to answer,” he tells me now. We’re sitting in a pub in north London. “Talawa knew about my being of mixed heritage while having white parents. I’ve never not spoken about it.” Two days after Lennon received the text, the Sunday Times published its story, accusing Lennon of “passing” as black. “A theatre director who has won funds meant for ‘people of colour’ has admitted his parents and grandparents were all white,” ran the introduction, going on to quote one unnamed black actor who had expressed disquiet: “When I discovered his background, I thought it was unfair that a white man had taken a black person’s place on a BAME scheme.” The article compared Lennon to Rachel Dolezal, the former president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in the US, who claimed she was black despite having white parents, and when challenged in 2015, argued that “the idea of race is a lie”.Lennon was floored. “I call it the hit,” he says. “It really did feel like an assassination – a character assassination.” But there was more to come. The story was picked up by other journalists, and Lennon was portrayed as a conman who had cheated his way to the top at the expense of people of colour. As a dramatic plot, it appeared to have everything: hubris, nemesis, mistaken identity, even the occasional hint of comedy.Apart from the friends and colleagues closest to him (both Talawa and the Arts Council stood by Lennon, arguing that they had never been misled), he found himself damned right across the political spectrum. He was hardly a household name, but as an actor with 30 years’ experience – much of it with black theatre groups – he was well-respected within the industry, and starting to show promise as a director. But overnight he had become a pariah.Lennon wrote a column for the , explaining that the Sunday Times had misrepresented him – but refused all other requests for comment. The controversy was taking its toll. He went to ground, took time off work, and came very close to taking his own life.Ten months on, Lennon has chosen to tell his story for the first time. Rather than trying to “pass” as black, he says, he has spent a lifetime failing to pass as white – from babyhood to the present day. And many years ago he decided to embrace that – to live with the identity the rest of the world persisted in giving him.Lennon first calls me out of the blue in July. We have never met, but a mutual friend has suggested he get in touch. He outlines his story, and says he has just received information that sheds new light on his racial identity. He sounds nervous, and asks if we can meet.A few days later, we get together for a coffee. Lennon, aged 53, has an extraordinary face – sculpted cheekbones, caterpillar eyebrows, flared nostrils, piercing blue eyes. These days his head is shaved, but as a child and young man he had an afro that was the way his hair grew naturally. He shows me a series of photographs. Here he is with his younger brother, Vincent, aged six and four – two cute, gap-toothed, mixed-race boys, or so you would assume. There he is at 18, body-popping with his all-black crew in London. And in his early 20s, as a politicised young man with a big afro worn under his black leather beret. Sometimes he looks black, sometimes mixed race. The one thing he doesn’t look is white.We agree to meet again in a couple of weeks. Meanwhile he emails and texts me regularly, almost obsessively – notes, mini essays, childhood recollections, most of them painful. He remembers being with Vincent in a cupboard upstairs, hiding from the prying neighbours who had come round for a nosy at the two strange children friends asking where his black parent was the school caretaker threatening to set dogs on him and telling him, “Run, nigger.”Almost a year into his stint at Talawa, Lennon says he was warned by the company’s artistic director Michael Buffong that a number of people weren’t happy about him winning the award, but he didn’t think much about it. Nobody had said anything to him, and he assumed any mutterings would subside.When the story broke last year, Buffong released a statement saying, “I have always been aware of Anthony’s unique and complicated story. For my generation, and when Talawa started as a company in 1986, there was a spirit of inclusivity which meant that he was accepted by many, inside the organisation and externally, as a person of mixed heritage.” The Arts Council backed this up, arguing: “This is a very unusual case and we do not think it undermines the support we provide to black and minority ethnic people within the theatre sector.” Forty-eight prominent black artists and activists wrote to the  in support of Lennon, including Michaela Coel, Clarke Peters, Roy Williams and Lennon’s friend, the actor and writer Lennie James. Lennon shows me a text he recently received from James: “I just want to check in to make sure you’re good and looking after yourself. Remember you don’t have to say, answer or justify yourself to anyone. Those who know you know you. If people aren’t ready for the nuance of the conversation, you may just have to wait for them to catch up. Don’t get dragged back. I’m thinking of you, my friend. Be strong.”Lennon was anything but strong, though. The allegation that he was a fraud was devastating. All his life, he says, his mother had worked to instil in him her core values: don’t lie, say please and thank you, don’t bring police to my door. And here he was, accused not only of living a lie but of making money out of it.His first worry was the impact the accusation would have on her. “I saw a look in my mum’s eyes when she was telling me about the reporters knocking on her door or loitering around the back. I’d never seen her looking so frightened and so confused. I felt completely helpless and I wanted to take it all away.” His voice rises, and he starts crying. “From the moment I was born, I used to feel I’d damaged my family – that my arrival was like a bomb had gone off.” It had taken him so long to feel OK about himself, and now he felt he’d done the worst thing possible: he made life difficult for his mother.When I ask Lennon why he is so sure that he is not the result of an affair, he smiles and says he knows his mother. But there is more to it than that his two younger brothers also looked mixed race, the youngest less strikingly so. But Lennon asks if I really believe that his mother would have such a long-term affair, given the hostility she faced. She told him that when he was a baby, people would stare at the two of them in the street – if they were lucky. “Some would shout at her from the other side of the road, some would spit, some would throw stones at the pram. But we’re talking the 60s – Enoch Powell, teddy boys, skinheads,” he says. Even his grandmother told him he was a curse on the family, and sent him to bed clutching rosary beads so he could pray for forgiveness. A Sunday school worker chastised him for using a light brown pencil when drawing a picture of himself and Vincent maybe they looked the way they did because they had been bad when they were younger, he said.His mother hated talking about “it” – the bewildering appearance of her boys – so she didn’t. As an adult, Lennon discovered that his father had accused her of having an affair. He says his appearance must have created such tension, he is amazed they stayed together for so long – until he was 12. “How do you apologise for accusing your partner of having an affair when they didn’t?” he asks. “And if you’re the mother of this child and you’ve got all these fingers pointing at you, the pain that must have come with that...” He trails off. While he and his brothers looked mixed race, they also resembled their father. Lennon says he doesn’t like to use the word, but can’t think of another that does the job: he believes he is a “throwback”. Yes, his family is white as far back as he can go – but he is sure that there is African ancestry somewhere.At school, Lennon says, most of his friends were black or mixed race. He doesn’t know why he always gravitated towards people of colour – and they towards him. Back then, he didn’t have either the language or perspective to describe what was happening. He has some happy memories of that time: the school friend who snuck him an afro comb in solidarity the neighbours who cooked him and Vincent African-Caribbean food and sorted out their hair on Saturdays the ticket collector at the underground station letting him sit on the tall stool inside his ticket box, because he looked like his son the friends who called him “Sidders”, after Sidney Poitier, when he told them he wanted to be an actor.As teenagers, both Lennon and Vincent developed nervous tics. He says that Vincent struggled with his identity, but in a different way he couldn’t understand why Anthony embraced his “blackness”. Vincent became a skinhead and petty criminal, and suffered from depression. At the age of 19, he died after a terrible incident on a train: a door opened and he fell on to the tracks. That day, he had phoned their mother to tell her that he loved her – something he rarely, if ever, did. An investigation into Vincent’s death (in which a witness described him as “half-caste”) concluded that there was no fault with the door, and Lennon has always been convinced that his brother intended to take his own life. “I was devastated by his death, and still am.”As a teenager, Anthony found his home in drama classes. He loved acting and decided he was going to make a career of it. But as soon as he turned professional, he realised the range of roles he was being offered was limited. “Casting directors often told my agent that there were no parts for mixed-race characters,” he says. Again and again, the same roles came up: loud, aggressive men, running into trouble or away from the law. Often the characters were criminals occasionally, they were victims of a miscarriage of justice.He started to turn down roles because of the negative stereotypes. One part he did accept was in The Bill, playing a young man falsely accused of robbery: “The only reason I did it was because my character wasn’t guilty.” He watched the clip again recently and was reminded how many of the characters he played were the butt of racism. “At one point the police officer says to my character, ‘We know it’s you because we’ve got a set of prints.’ I say, ‘Fingerprints?’ and he replies, ‘No, lip prints.’”Lennon says that, more than anything else, it was the prejudice he experienced as a child and young adult that made him want to identify as black. The Sunday schoolteacher and his own grandmother may have thought his appearance was something to be ashamed of, but he didn’t. If their attitudes were representative of being white, he was happy to renounce his whiteness.In 1990, Lennon appeared in a TV play called Chilling Out, as part of the BBC’s Everyman slot. He sends me a link: it’s a brilliantly nuanced exploration of race, class and identity, in which seven young actors – including Lennie James – talk about the “experience and spirit of being black” in Britain. Although the actors played themselves and the scenes began with improvisation, the end result was a scripted docudrama. When Lennon is asked about his backstory, he says he is from Ireland. The other actors nod approvingly, and ask which island. “No,” he says, “Ireland, Ireland”, and goes on to explain that both his parents are white. The others look at him astonished and suggest he is in denial about his blackness there are jokes about his mother and the milkman.The conversation moves on: if it is true that his parents are white, is he in denial, his fellow actors ask. Is race an objective truth, or a construct based on what others see in you, and what you see in the mirror? Lennon is asked how he himself identifies. He looks bashful, and says he has never talked about this before. “When I’m alone in my bedroom looking in the mirror, thinking about stuff I’ve written down, thinking about my past, relationship-wise, pictures on the wall, I think I’m a black man. I’ve not said that to anyone. And I won’t say it outside.” James tells the group he has seen Lennon changing over the six years of their friendship, and is puzzled by it. “Sometimes I feel like you are watching me,” he says. “Watching me to say, this equals a black man. Then you’re taking it from me and sticking it on yourself.”When the Sunday Times story appeared, Chilling Out was cited as evidence that Lennon was a fraud, with James quoted as a witness for the prosecution. For Lennon, this was a deliberate misreading – of him, of James, of their friendship. At the time the drama was made, James had known about Lennon’s parentage for years. Perhaps more importantly, Lennon says, it should be obvious to anybody watching Chilling Out that the other actors were eager to help him make peace with his complex identity, rather than accuse him of cultural misappropriation. Soon after making Chilling Out, Lennon decided to change his name formally. Anthony David Lennon did not reflect who he was, he thought, so he became Soweto Alkebulan Ekundayo: Soweto because his friend and mentor Paul Kinch had a son called Soweto (now a celebrated saxophonist) Alkebulan because it is said to be the earliest name for Africa Ekundayo because he liked the sound of the Yoruban name, and discovered it meant “weeping becomes joy”. He started reading literature about black culture and politics, withdrew from the acting world and moved to Manchester, where he dedicated himself to developing his political consciousness. He read up on the history of British imperialism. “I’d be lying if I said all the literature I read was about loving black culture – some was derogatory about white people. I just wanted to read stories by black people, about black culture and history.”He had two daughters, who are now in their 20s – one is a dancer, the other works in the film industry – and named the oldest Soweto, too. Lennon’s mother continued to call him Anthony, but quietly embraced his African identity. His father, who died in 1999, thought Lennon had lost the plot. “One of the last conversations I had with Dad was him saying, ‘As far as I’m concerned you’re white and I think you’ve got an identity problem.’”Some time after changing his name, he met the educational consultant Paul Wilson-Eme, who went on to have a huge influence on him. Wilson-Eme asked him why he had called himself Soweto. Lennon mentioned the obvious: the associations with South Africa, black pride, the uprising. Wilson-Eme asked him if he knew what Soweto meant. “To my shame I had no answer. Then he filled in the missing gaps – it stands for South West Township. Then he said, ‘I love you, my brother, but I think you need to check in with yourself as to why you have named yourself that.’” So he simply became Ekundayo. Then he changed his name legally again, choosing Taharka as a first name.His agent got in touch and said that directors were still keen to hire him, but there was a problem: if he returned to acting as Taharka Ekundayo, there would be too much explaining to do. “She said, ‘Why don’t we compromise – bring Anthony Lennon back, and put Ekundayo in the middle? Casting directors will know it’s the same old Anthony Lennon, but Ekundayo is there out of respect for your ancestry.”And so began his fifth, and happiest, incarnation – as Anthony Ekundayo Lennon. He returned to the theatre, working largely for black-led companies, and segued from acting to directing. For two decades, he lived easy in his skin – a man with white parents, unknown African ancestry, and many friends, none of whom questioned his right to be who he said he was. When I ask if he ever considered he might not meet the criteria for the Talawa award, he says no: “To doubt my eligibility would be akin to doubting my existence.”After the story broke, Lennon tells me people pointed at him in public places. I can’t help thinking of the little boy and his mother who were demonised in the streets 50 years ago. “It was surreal and scary, and the start of many panic attacks and sleepless nights,” he says. His worst childhood memories returned.He says he reached his nadir soon afterwards. “I’m going to be totally up front with you. There’s a little part of me that knows I don’t want to say this next bit, because I worry about what family and friends will think.” He sips from the pint of strawberry and lime lager he’s been nursing for two hours. “I went to a tube station. I took myself to the mouth of the tunnel and looked at the tracks. I just felt I didn’t want any of this any more. I didn’t want the toxicity, the pain, the accusations. I was imagining everything my dad went though, my mum, my brother. I came so close.”In the end, he says, what stopped him was thinking about his mother and his daughters. He sweeps away a tear. “And this is a message for anybody else thinking about it: force yourself to think about somebody you love, or who would desperately miss you if you are no longer there. Find a reason not to do it, then don’t. Let the next morning arrive.” He repeats the last sentence, more to himself than to me. “Let the next morning arrive.”He returned to work and saw out his contract at Talawa, which ended a couple of weeks ago. During his final months he mentored young artists, directed a reimagined Othello called Men Are Not Gods, and continued to learn the craft of running a theatre company. It’s been a tough year, but he says Buffong and other staff have always been supportive. In March this year, Lennon was invited to the Globe theatre’s press night for Richard II – the first all-women-of-colour production of a Shakespeare play in the UK. Despite Talawa’s backing, it was the first major industry event he had attended since the media storm. He says it was an inspiring night – both the production, and the support from friends. But at the afterparty he struggled. “I noticed a few people who I didn’t know looking over at me, and it was clear I was being whispered about. I felt othered for the first time ever, in a space with a group of artists.” But he says no actor or director has ever challenged him to his face. A couple of months ago, Lennon was verbally attacked by a stranger on the underground. “A black guy came up to me, and said, ‘You’re a fraud, you’re a thief.’ A couple of people stood between us because they thought he might physically attack me. He was really angry: ‘You’re that guy in the paper. Why are you pretending?’” Did Lennon defend himself verbally? “No, because there’s nothing to defend.” By now, he was feeling stronger.Would he have qualms about working for a black-led theatre company in the future? “No!” He sounds appalled. “I’ll work with anyone who wants to have a conversation with me, anyone who’s interested in telling stories. I’d really like to direct plays, please, and lead a company. That’s why I was put on the artistic directors’ programme in the first place.”• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ef9d1267e5cb83bddb313ae445accab86da60d7/56_0_3578_2147/master/3578.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c60a8ccc6df37b79386a794e1055f980","title":"iranian tanker seized by gibraltar photographed off syria","story":"Adrian Darya 1, formerly the Grace 1, was only released on condition it did not discharge its load of 2.1m barrels of oil in SyriaThe Iranian oil tanker Adrian Darya 1 at the centre of a dispute between Tehran and western powers has been photographed by satellite off the Syrian port of Tartus, a US space technology company has said.Maxar Technologies Inc said the image showed the tanker Adrian Darya 1 very close to Tartus on 6 September.

Iran in retaliation seized a British-flagged tanker in the Strait of Hormuz leading into the Gulf.Gibraltar released the Iranian vessel on 15 August after receiving written assurances from Tehran that it would not discharge its 2.1m barrels of oil in Syria. However, shipping sources say the tanker is likely to try to conduct a ship-to-ship transfer with another vessel for part of its cargo after Iran said a sale had been concluded.Washington has warned any state against assisting the ship, saying it would consider that support for a terrorist organisation, namely Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard.

At the time, this was around 7 per cent of all bitcoins and the market inevitably crashed68 Would the real Satoshi Nakamoto please stand upIn 2015, Australian police raided the home of Craig Wright after the entrepreneur claimed he was Satoshi Nakamoto. He later rescinded the claimOn 1 August, 2017, an unresolvable dispute within the bitcoin community saw the network split. The fork of bitcoin\u0027s underlying blockchain technology spawned a new cryptocurrency: Bitcoin cashTowards the end of 2017, the price of bitcoin surged to almost $20,000. This represented a 1,300 per cent increase from its price at the start of the yearThe cryptocurrency hit a record high\u0026nbspof $20,000 in 2017, coinciding with record-high search levels on Google.Since the recent online search surge, the price of bitcoin has risen steadily, but is nowhere near the levels it reached two years ago.\u0026nbspThe cryptocurrency is currently trading at around $10,800, having been trading below $9,400 before 29 August.The rising price over the last week\u0026nbsphas\u0026nbspbeen attributed to escalating economic and geopolitical uncertainty around the globe.Market analysts told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspearlier this week that turmoil surrounding Brexit, along with the trade war between the US and China, had caused investors to turn to bitcoin as a relatively safe haven asset.However, this analysis came before this search trend was spotted and some now believe that it may be having a significant impact on the price. It\u0026nbspremains unclear is who is behind it and how they are doing it.It is reasonable to assume that someone is behind these radical changes, wrote cryptocurrency analyst Bendik Norheim Schei.\u0026nbspThat the same pattern can be seen all over the world may indicate that VPN services have been used to distribute the search across the world, thus achieving a global trend.The price of bitcoin is notoriously volatile and is often difficult to both predict and explain.The correlation between online search interest and bitcoin\u0027s price has until now been a rare constant.\u0026nbspA study in 2017 found that high search volumes for bitcoin-related terms like \u0027btc usd\u0027 often preceded price bubbles, while low engagement usually signalled a good time to buy.Data gathered by digital marketing firm SemRush noted an 80 per cent correlation between search volume and bitcoin\u0027s price, though no conclusions were drawn as to which was the determining factor.Cryptocurrency analyst Anton Lucian described\u0026nbspthe latest increase in bitcoin search levels as just plain strange and pointed to manipulation as the likely culprit.Bitcoin investor and author Glen Goodman explained how such manipulation might be used to augment the price of the cryptocurrency.There are algorithms programmed to look at Google Trends data and try to find correlations between numbers of searches for the word \u0027btc\u0027 and the movements in the bitcoin price, he said.If they detect patterns, it may be profitable to trade off that data. This hacker may be buying some bitcoin, then sending a ton of \u0027btc\u0027 search queries to Google.\u0026nbspThe algoirthms see search numbers have risen and are triggered to buy a lot of bitcoin, which pushes the price up, and the hacker then sells their bitcoin at a profit. Easy money.Google has measures to prevent people manipulating searches, though practices like Google Bombing have proved in the past that it is possible to game the system.\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbsphas reached out to Google for comment.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A\u0026nbsp(non-fashionable) fashion retailer with food, or\u0026nbspa non-essential food seller with fashion?Click to followThe IndependentNothing lasts forever. Of course, I know that. But for someone who grew up in a family that, like many, worshipped at the altar of St Michael, the fall of Marks and Spencer and its brand still comes as a shock.Our clothes were M\u0026ampS, our food was M\u0026ampS, my father even bought my mother shares in the chain – so much did we pour into its tills. For many years, until the arrival of an Asda, it was the only shop of any serious presence in the town. There was a Boots and a Tesco, but they were nothing compared to the Marks, sitting as it did in the plum position in the main shopping street. Now that branch has just closed, and coincidentally or not, M\u0026ampS has dropped out of the FTSE100.There’s a huge Tesco, an Aldi, a Lidl, a Morrisons, and still, the Asda. But the once grand M\u0026ampS lies empty. Meanwhile, the company that was the first retailer to break through the £1bn profits barrier, no longer ranks among the country’s biggest 100 stock market-listed concerns. It’s a sad, sorry state of affairs. And once unthinkable.There were early clues as to what was coming. The M\u0026ampS was on two floors but even I, as a schoolboy, noticed that hardly anyone went upstairs. They just didn’t. Every so often the manager would try selling something different up there\u0026nbspand it didn’t matter. The escalator would continue to whirr upwards, devoid of passengers.M\u0026ampS would have one colour of sock in all sizes but not the hue you wanted. Likewise, with shirts, plenty of a certain variety, but lacking in others. Clearly, the group had an issue with its supply lines.Marks and Spencer to be relegated from FTSE 100As Tesco moved to the other side of town, to giant premises with lots of free parking, the contrast between the venerable M\u0026ampS, stuck in the town centre amid tight streets with double yellow lines, and the once budget purveyor now transformed, thanks to a dynamic management superbly led, first by Ian MacLaurin then by Terry Leahy, could not be more marked. Tesco always had what you were looking for, its lorries were forever unloading their wares, the firm’s skill was in perfecting just-in-time delivery. M\u0026ampS started to appear outdated, and where fashion was concerned, outmoded.Along came Next, offering much as an alternative shopping experience, then a lot more with the launch of its mail order catalogue. This giant book soon became a staple in middle-class homes. We didn’t know so at the time but it allowed Next to perfect warehousing and logistical systems and was a precursor to the onset of online.M\u0026ampS was snooty about Next, as it was about any aspect involving so-called competitors. They could dream up as many gimmicks as they wished, but it, M\u0026ampS, was the bellwether of the high street, the prime tenant in any decent new development, the great name that all others aspired to. It would not be side-tracked by the rest.That feeling of detachment was confirmed by a visit to the old M\u0026ampS headquarters in London’s Baker Street. Going there was like entering a section of the civil service, with long corridors, and closed doors with numbers on them. There was a sense of anonymity, of people doing their jobs, but minus any passion and creativity. There was no collective buzz, no evidence of urgent energy.Its staff were famously treated better than anyone else’s, enjoying all manner of benefits and perks. But instead of encouraging them to be daring and think the impossible, it merely fuelled a corporate smugness.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But while M\u0026ampS was bedding down, other retailers were motoring – creating new ranges, finessing their internet services.In clothing,\u0026nbspH\u0026ampM and Zara were producing brighter, modern items, (along with Topshop they were known for fast\u0026nbspfashion, a phrase that was never applied to M\u0026ampS) while Primark was undercutting on price. Even Asda chipped away with its George range, providing essentials for less.In food, Waitrose and Tesco Premium matched M\u0026ampS at the top end, with Aldi and Lidl showing what could be bought for a fraction, without a significant drop in quality, at the other.M\u0026ampS dallied with homeware, but against John Lewis, which long ago stole its hegemony as the company-to-look-towards for indications of economic buoyancy. While John Lewis\u0026nbspbecame the anchor that shopping centre managers and online specialist suppliers craved,\u0026nbspM\u0026ampS failed to excite.Successive managements tried to steer the ship. None succeeded in arresting the drift. Increasingly, M\u0026ampS seemed not to know what it was: a (non-fashionable) fashion retailer with food a non-essential food seller with fashion.In its latest incarnation, the leadership team of chairman Archie Norman and chief executive Steve Rowe is probably the best M\u0026ampS has had for a while. They know their stuff.But Norman and Rowe have inherited a bloated vessel, one with too many stores in the wrong places, and not enough high-tech knowhow and resource to pack a punch on the internet. They should be striking out with newness and innovation\u0026nbspbut instead they’re forced to devote too much time and energy to cutting and fighting fires.Ejection from the FTSE100 is further evidence of that contracting business. M\u0026ampS’s downward spiral continues.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from theTry for freeAre you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds.Try for freeWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

The same is true of construction, 45 down from 45.3, and manufacturing, 47.4 down from 48. The difference is the latter two sectors are now shrinking, as is business activity overall. UK plc only avoided a cricketing hat-trick because the video replay umpire didn’t overturn a marginal LBW decision made on the field after the third ball.\u0026nbspUK manufacturing output slumps to seven-year low amid Brexit concernsPMI survey reveals biggest slide in UK construction output since 2009How a no-deal Brexit will affect the economy — now and in the futureBusiness expectations are at their lowest for three years, with economists starting to pencil in the first recession since the financial crisis, unless there is a dramatic pick up in September. It’s hard to see where the fairy dust might come from.\u0026nbspThese are the sort of figures that should be of deep concern to any sane and sensible government of whatever hue, all the more so to\u0026nbspa Conservative government with its\u0026nbspmuch ballyhooed, and largely undeserved, reputation for economic competence. In more normal times, they’d scare the pants off it.\u0026nbspBut these are not normal times and this is not a normal government. It is run by a party that has completely lost its marbles, having been dragged to the edge of a cliff by gangsters who have just one policy of note. \u0026nbspThe global situation mightn’t be terribly cheery, but the contraction that is getting underway in Britain is an entirely self created one, a squeeze manufactured in Downing Street.\u0026nbspAnd remember, this could just be a taste of what’s\u0026nbspto come, a red balloon or two of warning of what Johnnywise the dancing clown of Downing Street could yet brings down on us as he emerges from his sinister house.\u0026nbspThis brings us to another set of figures published this morning. They concern household debt and come courtesy of the TUC ahead of its annual Congress.\u0026nbspThey give voice to the disturbing level of unsecured borrowing engaged in by the average Briton before one even starts to consider things such as mortgages.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

One-in-10 have also been victims of fraud.It is not just cyber security risks that people who view or host\u0026nbsppirated streams face. Several UFC fans have been hit with major fines after inadvertently breaking the law, with one man from Bradford fined £45,000 for sharing a broadcast last year.Waqas Rasheed claimed he had accidentally created the streams while watching a free online stream.\u0026nbspAnother man who broadcast part of the pre-fight coverage of a pay-per-view fight on Periscope on his phone also received thousands of pounds worth of fines.World Cup plagued by ‘industrial-scale’ piracy“I went round to my friend’s house to watch a pay-per-view boxing match and while we were waiting for the fight to start I started scrolling through Periscope,” Josh Mellor told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbsplast year.“I’d heard in the pub, and from friends, that you could watch free live streams of the fight and wondered how as we’d paid to watch it. Whilst on Periscope, I saw a number of streams and while exploring I clicked the ‘Go Live’ button. I streamed the pre-fight coverage from my mate’s TV for a few minutes before quitting the app.”Mr Mellor\u0026nbspsaid he\u0026nbsphad no idea he had broken the law. He said:\u0026nbsp”I think there are a lot of people out there who don’t understand that digital piracy comes with some very real risks.

This means data doesn\u0027t need to pass through servers controlled by internet and technology firms, essentially handing back people control of their data.\u0026nbspHTC Exodus 1 hopes to bring blockchain technology, bitcoin and cryptocurrency to the masses (The Independent)When it was first launched,\u0026nbspHTC described it as the first smartphone built for this new internet, representing a paradigm shift away from the big data business models of large tech companies.All out private data - from credit history to search data - is handled by third parties, Phil Chen, who led the development of the HTC Exodus 1, told\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspat the time.\u0026nbspFacebook offers $10,000 to anyone who can crack its cryptocurrencyWe don\u0027t own or control any of it. Instead, it is just seven companies in the world that control almost all of the data. They have become more powerful than governments.One of the things that this new wave of phones could transform is payments, with each phone coming with an in-built cryptocurrency wallet.This allows owners of these phones to store and spend cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, as well as forthcoming digital currencies set to be launched by apps like Telegram.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The research showed that the marks on their genomes that represent their “epigenetic clock”, as well as their immune systems, actually improved despite the passing of time.The scientists involved in the study were shocked by the results.“I’d expected to see slowing down of the clock, but not a reversal,” researcher Steve\u0026nbspHorvath\u0026nbspfrom the University of California, Los Angeles told Nature, which first reported the findings. “That felt kind of futuristic.”Scientists caution that the study was done with a very limited number of participants: only nine people took the drug cocktail, and there was no control group.

Scientists\u0026nbspthen monitored\u0026nbspthe test subjects’\u0026nbspepigenetic clocks, to understand the effect\u0026nbspon how they aged.Nobel Prize given to scientists who explained the biological clockThe epigenetic clock is measured by the body’s\u0026nbspepigenome\u0026nbsp– a record of chemical changes to an organism’s DNA. As people age, chemical modifications or tags are added to people’s DNA, and those change throughout their lives,\u0026nbspso by looking at those tags\u0026nbspa person’s biological age can be measured.Researchers had actually intended to look at how the growth hormone would change the tissue in the thymus gland, which helps with the body’s immune functions and sits in the chest. It normally shrinks after puberty but they hoped to see whether it could be pushed to regrow, by giving participants the growth hormone.It was only as a secondary consideration that researchers then checked how the drugs changed their epigenetic clocks. The study had finished when the analysis began.Professor Horvath then looked at four different measures of the epigenetic clock to understand the differing ages of each of the patients. And he found that every one of them had reversed significantly – so significantly that he is optimistic about the results, despite the limited number of participants.Scientists now hope to test the same effects with more people, through a controlled study, and with different age groups, ethnicities and with women.The changes could still be seen in the blood of six participants who provided samples\u0026nbsplong after the study finished.Some of the drugs used in the cocktail are already being researched as ways of fighting age-related diseases. But the discovery of the combined effect of the three of them could have major implications for the ways that a variety of different drugs are tested, scientists say.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Suddenly, the all-encompassing full-time job into which you poured all your time and effort becomes harder to juggle with what’s going on at home.Ruth Davidson is the case in point, after tendering her resignation as leader of the Scottish Conservatives because, among other reasons, the thought of getting on the road to fight two elections in  months would have once fired her up but now fills her with dread.Ruth, who will remain as an MSP, adds: “Additionally, I fear that having tried to be a good leader over the years, I have proved a poor daughter, sister, partner and friend. The party and my work has always come first, often at the expense of commitment to loved ones. The arrival of my son means I now make a dferent choice.”It was a similar story when former sports minister Tracey Crouch revealed she recently turned down the chance toto Government because of her three-year-old son Freddie.She’s still an MP but says: “I may or may not ever get the chance again to join the Cabinet, but I definitely won’t get this time back with Freddie.”And therein lies the rub for any Government, or indeed corporation, trying to inflate the number of women appointed to jobs that pay extremely well and, consequently, often involve great responsibility and super-human levels of commitment.As I have frequently suggested in this column over the years, the paucity of women in the Cabinet and certain boardrooms isn’t necessarily down to sexism, it might also be because women have chosen not to be there.We have the wombs, therefore we have the babies. That’s unlikely to change any time soon.Some manage — with the help of nannies or wider family — to juggle a high-powered job with motherhood, somechoose the route of flexible working and somechoose to stay at home.

In public they pretended their disruptive tactics were rooted in concern for those poor, misguided souls who had voted for Brexit not knowing what it really meant.But in private they were rubbing their hands in glee at how they were tying the Government in knots with their cleverness and, consequently, thwarting the democratic will of the .million who voted Leave.But look at them now – they have come up against someone who not only knows all their cunning moves but has a few of his own to head them off at the pass.The smugness has evaporated – replaced by panic or, in the case of former Blue Peter presenter Konnie Huq on the Jeremy Vine show, angry screeching while asking a Brexiteerhe would vote to leave the EU , er, it meant he would be decapitated in the process.Meanwhile, superannuated student Jeremy Corbyn – devoid of any solutions – suggests protests that will paralyse our cities and merely disrupt the rest of us trying to get to work. In short, the wheels are starting to come off the Remainer bus.Britain will leave the EUon October  and honour the democratic vote of .

It is a pathetic showing for a main opposition party at a time when it should be sailing ahead.Corbyn — branded a chicken by Boris Johnson for blocking a snap election — is doing so much worse than he did in his unexpectedly strong  ­election campaign.That’s because voters have seen so much more of this unreconstructed Marxist than they had then. And the more they see, the less they like it.Gradually it is dawning on the country that the economic policies advanced by Corbyn and his even more left-wing shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, would not so much redistribute national wealth as obliterate it.Earlier this week McDonnell came up with his latest wheeze for robbing the rich and — as he sees it — giving to the poor.He promised to give private tenants a “right to buy” their homes at a discount. I can see why this policy might initially seem attractive to young people who have been priced out of the housing market — a group with whom I have a lot of sympathy.Notionally, the policy may seem little dferent from Mrs Thatcher’s right to buy which enabled a generation of council house tenants to become homeowners for the first time.But there is every dference. If private investors were forced to sell their properties at a discount it would crash the housing market. Who would want to buy a property, knowing that the Government could come along at any moment and confiscate it If you crash the housing market, you crash the ­mortgage market, too. Private tenants might in theory gain the right to buy their homes, but that will not be much usebanks refuse to lend them any money.Confiscation is a thread which runs through so much of Labour’s programme.McDonnell has already announced a plan to snatch ten per cent of the shares of all private companies with more than  employees.He wants to put these shares into what he calls an inclusive ownership fund, invested on behalf of the workers.The workers shouldn’t get too excited, though. They would be allowed a maximum of £ a year in idends — and that onlytheir ­company was able to pay a idend.Meanwhile, the value of ordinary people’s pensions would plummet by far more than £. According to an analysis by law firm Clford Chance, workers would gain £billion — but overall, investors would lose £billion as share values crashed.Labour’s plan would dilute a company’s shares, effectively confiscating wealth from existing shareholders.Corbyn and McDonnell ­promote a fantasy that shareholders are a bunch of capitalist fatcats.Yet the reality is that almost everyone who works in the private sector is indirectly a shareholder. Share investments form the bedrock of the pension funds on which we will rely in old age.EvenMcDonnell was only helping himself to ten per cent of company shares initially, he could be sure to come back for more when his tax revenues failed to match his vast spending plans.These include spending £billion nationalising utility companies — that is £billion for gas and electricity firms, £billion for water firms, £billion to buy out Private Finance Initiativecontracts for schools and hospitals and £.billion for the Royal Mail.Labour claims this will save householders an average of £ a year on the basis that these firms will no longer have to pay shareholders.But he overlooks the poor record of nationalised industry. Lower efficiency could well lead to higher prices.How is McDonnell going to bring in the revenue for his massive spending plans He seems to live under the delusion thatyou raise taxes by x per cent, revenue, too, will rise by x per cent.Thus he claimed, in Labour’s  manesto, that reversing corporation tax cuts would raise £billion. But tax doesn’t work like that. In fact, cuts to corporation tax made by George Osborne increased revenue as multinationals erted profits to, rather than away from, Britain.So it is perverse for Labour to claim jacking up rates again will raise extra money. On the contrary, McDonnell would likely end up with LESS revenue.As for iniduals, McDonnell has promised to increase income tax for the top ten per cent of earners, which means anyone on more than £, a year. The top rate of income tax would go up to  per cent.But the real damage could come from a wealth tax — an annual levy on the value of homes, shares, bonds and all other assets.Although not yet Labour party policy, McDonnell has previously expressed approval for a whopping  per cent levy on the wealthiest ten per cent of the population.It wouldn’t be the super-wealthy who paid — they would quickly be off.In the s, a high-tax Labour ­government caused a brain drain which led to net outwards migration of , people over a few years.It would be worse now, as wealthy iniduals and businesses are much more mobile compared with the s.The real victims of a wealth tax would be ordinary people who have spent years saving to buy a home and build themselves a half-decent pension. To qualy for McDonnell’s wealth tax you would only need to own a home, and to have a pension with a combined value of £,.With Labour on just  per cent in the polls, of course, the nightmare of a Corbyn government — or at least a Corbyn majority government — is at the moment unlikely.But no one should be ­complacent.We could all too easily end up with a Labour-SNP coalition with the ­Scottish Nationalists happy to inflict pain on English, Welsh and Northern Irish voters infor the promise of a second independence referendum.Over the past couple of years we have had endless attempts to blame Brexit for every economic woe. Actually, over that period, employment has risen to an all-time high and the economy, except for the last quarter, has grown.But international investors, have been shy of Britain.The uncertainty over Brexit doesn’t help but talk to wealth managers and they tell you a very dferent story.What really strikes terror into investors is the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn arriving at the door to No.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s right that five years since the SEND reforms were introduced the government takes stock and assesses how they’ve been implemented, and what impact they are having in meeting the challenges faced by the families we support.“It’s vital that parent carers are at the heart of this review – their confidence and engagement is essential to improving the system. We look forward to working with the government as the review progresses.”Disabled children and their families are desperately struggling because of a lack of support.We want the Government to reinstate the £m of funding it has cut from early intervention services - such as respite care and vital equipment.It is time for the Government to Give It Back.The number of disabled children in the UK has risen to nearly  million over the past  years - up by a third.But funding and support has been cut.Families with some of the most vulnerable children in the country are struggling to cope.That’s why we’re working with the Disabled Children’s Partnership to help them.Together we can make a real dference and hugely improve the lives of disabled children and their families.We want you to share your stories, email us on giveitback@the-sunPlease sign Ollie’s letter to put pressure on the Government to act now.Jolanta Lasota, Chief Executive of Ambitious about Autism, also responded to the review, saying: “It’s important to assess whether the system is currently working in the best interests of SEND children and their families.We welcome this review and we hope it will result in smoother, joined up working between education, health and care services and enable parents to work more collaboratively with local decision-makers to ensure children have the best support.”The new review aims to ensure vulnerable children have the same opportunities as anyone , while their families get the support they so desperately need to.“The Sun readers should be very proud of their campaign – and I want to pay tribute to the bravery of these children, and their families,” Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said. “Every child should receive the support they need to live a happy and fulfilled le, which is why we’re investing over a billion extra pounds in social care, on top of the % increase, over £m, in funding for children with special educational needs and disabilities this year. “I hope this goes some way towards addressing the concerns of those families with disabled children highlighted in The Suns campaign and I will continue to do everything I can, including through the review of support for children with SEND I announced today, to make sure children achieve the best outcomes possible.”In  the Government launched Education Health and Care plans, aimed to help , children with the most complex special educational needs get educational support.This review will examine how things have changed since then, and ensure there is a level playing field for kids who need help across the UK.While The Sun is pleased this area is being examined, much more must be done.Research shows only four per cent of families with a disabled child feel they have the right support.A lack of support, including access to education and respite care, often results in families splitting up and parents suffering mental health problems.Independent Provider of Special Education Advice- for specialist legal adviceNewle - a charity that provides help with equipmentGOV.UK - to understand your childs entitlementsNational Autistic SocietyVickey Kowal, whose seven-year-old son Ollie has an ultra-rare genetic condition, said: “I feel like we are the forgotten people.“People only see parents of disabled children on our good days.

internet,” said the star, staring intently at magazine execs in the room.It wasn’t Gemma Collins or Kim Kardashian or even ­Victoria Beckham who made this ­declaration as she prepared to guest edit Vogue magazine but rather the Duchess of Sussex.After a summer of negative headlines, Meghan had just decided to take back ­control of her faltering public image.As I revealed for the first time this week, a series of decisions has seen the full-time royal realign herself closer to Holly­wood than many inside the Royal Family believe is appropriate.In fact, some concerned courtiers are now openly asking: Does Meghan want to be a real royal or a Calornian princess There were many whispers at Buckingham Palace on Monday as Prince Harry and Meghan’s staff moved into their suite of offices off the lavish master corridor within the Queen’s London residence.Some pointed out the irony that they appear to be moving further away from the traditions and expectations of being a publicly funded British prince and princess.But the gossip about the most unconventional of royal couples got worse as the week went on.Staff were shocked by my story on Tuesday that Meghan had hired controversial US crisis manage­ment PR firm Sunshine Sachs, which once represented Harvey Wein­stein and Michael Jackson, behind the backs of Palace staff to try to change her image.Since then, I’ve learned Meghan has shelled out at least £, of her own money for the advice from the company’s chief Shawn Sachs and her friend Keleigh Thomas Morgan, who repped her when she was an actress on TV drama Suits.On Tuesday, the American firm was put to work publicly for the first time as it managed Prince Harry’s launch for the Sussex Royal Foundation in Amsterdam.Against the advice of royal advisers, the Duke went ahead with the event to promote an eco-travel online initiative.The advisers warned he would be asked how to justy his support for the scheme after taking four private jets in just  days.When put on the spot during a QA, Harry claimed  per cent of his flights are commer­cial — a figure that raised a few eyebrows.Yesterday I revealed a trio of Hollywood power­brokers — attorney Rick Genow, business manager Andrew Meyer and talent agent Nick Collins — are actively involved in Meghan’s future work projects.And today Meghan is facing fresh criticism for her decision to fly to New York to watch her friend Serena Williams in the US Open final, instead of travelling to Balmoral to be a guest of the Queen.All the activity has led to a very realistic conversation about wheth­er Harry and Meghan’s future could be in Los Angeles.According to sources, the couple have discussed a future that could mean spending a signicant time in Calornia, where Meghan was born and raised.But first Meghan has decided to surround herself with a tight-knit group of non-royal advis­ers she considers “her people”.A senior royal source said: “Meghan is creating a team that is not bogged down by the traditions and regul­ations of the Palace to work for her and Harry on passion projects.“She had been seeking advice from the PR company Sunshine Sachs privately for weeks but decided to officially hire them for the launch of her Vogue Magazine guest edit.“Even thought it was the UK version of the mag, she wanted maximum coverage in America, which is the country she really cares about in terms of the media.“She was incredibly hands-on with the strategy and in one meeting told the staff: ‘I want to break the internet.’“It was an honest thing to say but still quite shocking for a royal to express it that way. It made her sound like a celebrity wanting to publicise a new album or movie.“I mean, in reality she is a celebrity. She’s very familiar with magazines and social media and PR — she prides herself in the knowledge she has.”Officially the company will now be working Stateside on the new Sussex Royal charity foundation, which Meghan and Harry formed following their split with Prince William and Kate.But it means the couple now have access to American PR and crisis management experts on their payroll whenever they want advice.That’s even though they already have well-regarded global PR chief Sara Latham — who was a senior adviser to Hillary Clinton’s  presidential campaign — working for them at Buckingham Palace.Another royal source added: “This is Meghan’s way of being able to get a Hollywood answer to a questionshe’s not hearing what she wants to from the Palace.“But that’s a dangerous precedent to set because there is a reason why courtiers and advisers treat members of the Royal Family dferently — they are not celebrities, they are publicly funded official figures with a formal role.“And they need to hear the truth, evenit’s not the answer they want. That’s something Harry does not like and Meghan isn’t familiar with from her former career.“They appear tone-deaf to criticism at times, which was proven this week by Harry in Amsterdam and by Meghan going to New York and not Balmoral.”But Meghan is said to be concern­ed the public is turning on her after damaging revelations over her relationship with her estranged father Thomas Markle, stories about her negative relationship with William and Kate, and hypocrisy over taking private jets while claiming she is an eco-warrior.The clearest suggestion Meghan is choosing to ignore formal advice is shown by the growing influence of her secret team in Hollywood.Gersh is one of the leading agencies in Hollywood, with many Oscar winners and major TV stars in their client roster including Kristen Stewart, Adam Driver, Tobey Maguire and Jamie Foxx.A separate senior royal insider revealed: “Courtiers at the Palace are aware of these three men working in some capacity for Meghan on the quiet. They have been involved in her finances which is understandable given her former work in America.What’s worrying is their role in ongoing projects like her children’s book, which would usually be handled by Palace staff.“But she’s learning how dferent le inside the Royal Family is compared to her previous career. There are times she feels frustrated.”There is a growing feeling within royal circles that Meghan could be preparing to spend at least part of the year back in Calornia in the future.Prince Harry has already announced his first major TV project will be produced by Oprah Winfrey’s com­pany for US giant Apple’s new streaming service.But senior Palace staff hope a plan for the couple to spend part of the year living in South Africa will stop them getting restless and unhappy in the UK.The royal source added: “From just a few months after the royal wedding there has been a growing drum­beat about Harry and Meghan moving to the US eventually.That’s one of the reasons they are being encouraged to spend time in South Africa because it’s a Commonwealth country and keeps them part of the fold.”Some Palace staff wish Meghan had taken an exten­ded maternity leave after Archie’s birth so the goodwill from the public and media initially granted to her ed. But in fairness to Meghan, her allies point out that isn’t her style.A source close to the Duchess explained: “Meghan is a working woman. She has spent her le using her talent, ambition and desire to create a successful career.“She loves being busy and her intention was never to disappear because she became a mum.“She wants to prove herself and doesn’t want to let criticism or tradition change what she sees as her purpose in le.”You could argue that Meghan has never hidden her ambition.During her televised engagement interview, Meghan artfully dodged whether she was quitting showbiz altogether.Asked about her career change, she replied: “I do not see it as giving anything up. I see it as a change. It is a new chapter.”But with the criticism of the couple’s unconventional behaviour growing, it’s as yet unclearthe unlikely love story of the B-list Hollywood actress and beloved English prince has a happy ending. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I think it’s the Spitfire. And neither of us is going to sht. Ever.So here we are. We cannot do a reasonable deal with Europe because our No Deal bargaining chip has been taken away.The Prime Minister can’t do anything meaningful because he doesn’t command a majority. And he isn’t even allowed to call a General Election.I understand why Remainers are doing everything in their power to delay our departure from the EU for as long as possible. And I understand why this is making Brexiteers so furious.Me  I’ve reached the point where I’m past caring. I just want something to happen and so long as Corbyn is kept out of No  Downing Street, I don’t really care what.Sadly, the only way forward is to crawl across the Channel on our hands and knees and literally beg for a deadline extension to next February. Or June. Or the year .And then what  Europe will either offer us the same deal that’s already been rejected by Parliament three times or they will offer us something worse.We are — and there’s no other word for it — f***ed.Right up to the moment when there is a General Election Corbyn will win.And then we will come to know what being f***ed really means.To prevent that, we must do what any right-thinking person does in a time of real emergency and turn for guidance to the US soap opera Dallas.You see, back in , the American actor Patrick Duffy went on a bit of an ego trip.He’d been the Man From Atlantis and Bobby Ewing in Dallas. He’d even recorded a song that reached No  in the Dutch hit parade.So he obviously figured the world was his oyster and he’d be the new Al Pacino.It didn’t work out well. The only role he got was as a goat in a TV movie no one watched, so he decided the following year that he’d like to go back to Dallas, the show that made his name.So in order to accommodate his wishes, the scriptwriters decided his death — and every single thing that happened in the  subsequent months — had been a dream.And guess what We bought it. We all turned to one another in our lounges and our sitting rooms and said: “Yup, that seems reasonable.”So this is what I suggest.On Monday morning, David Cameron walks out of Downing Street and says that, having considered all the options, he is NOT going to call a referendum.Andanyone says, “Hang on a minute, what about Article  and Theresa May and the last election ”, we just say: “Nah, mate, you must have been dreaming.”YOU must have noticed that ever since the fire brigade were given those huge pliers that can cut the roof off a car, they always, always, ALWAYS cut the roof off any car that’s been in an accident.“We must, in case one of the occupants has a broken back,” they always say.Yes – but once, a couple who’d been completely uninjured in a minor traffic accident were invited by Plod to shelter from the drizzle in the police car.When the fire brigade arrived – and I’m not making this up – they cut the roof off the police car so the couple could get out again. And it seems they have the same problem in America.Because this week, the comedian Kevin Hart was a passenger in his exquisite and very rare Plymouth Barracuda when it crashed.Fire crews could have pulled him out through the door, so the car could then be repaired.But no. They cut the roof off, so now it can’t.Yup. Kevin will get better soon but his ’Cuda has gone to the great muscle-car graveyard in the sky.MORE evidence that mankind is losing the capacity for reasoned thought came this week when a bunch of “trans-feminist anti-speciesists”Meanwhile, in Syria . . .VISITORS to a new exhibition at the very traditional Royal Academy will find the only door is partially blocked by a naked man and a naked woman.The only solution is to squeeze between them.This begs many questions. But first up, this naked man.He has to spend all day with no clothes on, face to face with an attractive naked woman while people brush past his parts.I do hope he takes, um, precautions every morning. Or it is very likely he’ll become the world’s first human turnstile.WE had more proof this week that animal rights enthusiasts are not completely right in the head.They tried to claim in an advert that wearing wool is just as cruel as wearing fur – forgetting, perhaps, that to make a woolly jumper, the sheep doesn’t actually have to be killed.In fact, you HAVE to shear a sheep before the hot summer begins because very few breeds are capable of moulting by themselves.If you’ve got all that wool lying around, what are you going to do  Throw it away and make a jumper out of . . . nylon Great idea. Because nylon is made from crude oil.It’s basically like plastic. So we’d end up one day with lots of jumpers that won’t rot, floating around in the oceans choking turtles.Happily, the Advertising Standards Authority told the idiotic animal rights people to think of a new ad.Which means they’ll probably ask Naomi Campbell to climb off whatever piece of horrible Eurotrash she’s sitting on this week and get her kit off again.Excellent.The judge described her as “arrogant”.Hmm. Not sure about that.I thinkyou take someone ’s child to the doctor and ask him to lop off half the kid’s penis, you’re not being arrogant.You’re being deranged.THERE have been some unusual breakthroughs in the world of cars this week.Bugatti announced a specially modied Bugatti Chiron had become the first road-going car ever to break the mph barrier.Even though there is no road in the world where you could physically reach such a speed.Meanwhile, Nissan unveiled an app that allows you to see where your car is.Which is something Malaysia Airlines never thought of.And which won’t go down very well with cheating spouses.But Ford topped the lot by saying it can now fit a projector into the boot lid so that you can watch a movie in the cold and the rain.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in the past few years his image has become somewhat tarnished.He’s no longer the boy wonder who can do no wrong and this week Brad revealed how he spent  months going to Alcoholics Anonymous meetings after his marriage to Angelina Jolie broke down.He was with an all-male AA group and described it as “removing his drinking privileges” — but said it was a “freeing” experience. I suspect he is the kind of straight man who prefers the company of other fellas.He seems far happier just watching baseball on TV with some of his mates than dressed up in a tuxedo at a red-carpet event with a glamorous woman on his arm.There were rumours that his drinking was a factor in wrecking his relationship with Angelina — with accusations of him having a booze-fuelled rant at one of the older kids — and even close pals agreed that he needed help getting back on track.While he has been trying to get his act together — and all credit to him for seeking help —  months down the line Brad is still trying to officially “consciously uncouple” from Angelina.The y orce proceedings and bitter child-custody battle have at times been highly toxic but now we are told it is all being settled behind closed doors. This means that the lawyers will be having a field day and it will be costing an absolute fortune.The whole split will have been incredibly stressful so it’s maybe no wonder Brad sought solace by hitting the bottle. But let’s just take a look at Jenner.It’s hard to believe she was once an object of pity after Brad fell head over heels for Angelina when she was his movie co-star in Mr  Mrs Smith back in .Jenner is now light years from the supposed “woman scorned” who everyone felt desperately sorry for — she is currently right at the very top of her game.Jenner has turned  and appears on the current cover of Instyle magazine, glowing with health and happiness and looking at least two decades younger.As well as the famous split with Brad, she didn’t have the easiest time finding her feet in Hollywood. After Friends came to an end, her film career failed to take off and then stalled with a series of pretty dire rom-coms.To her credit, Jenner bounced back spectacularly with a string of hits and critically acclaimed roles — in movies such as Cake, Mother’s Day, Dumplin’ and, most recently, Murder Mystery.Although none of her post-Brad relationships lasted the distance and her marriage to Justin Theroux ended in orce, Jenner now seems very comfortable in her own skin.She has said before that she doesn’t want people to feel she needs their sympathy and that she is extremely happy with her le. She is clearly frustrated at being labelled the “deserted we” and has long since made her peace with Brad.So much so that he was a guest at her th birthday party and they are friends — with real affection for one another. Brad and Angelina have always insisted they got together after his marriage to Jenner was in trouble, but all couples go through bad patches and you do have to wonder just what would have happenedMr  Mrs Smith had never been made.Perhaps Brad and Jen would have been able to talk through any tensions and misunderstandings and save their relationship. A lot of people would like to see these two back together again, but I reckon Brad is now carrying too much baggage for a woman such as Jenner.Who would have thought she would end up being the stronger of the two  They do say the best revenge is living a good le — and Jenner is the proof of that.SHE looked frail and unsteady at times walking up Downing Street to No  but Barbara Windsor’s glorious smile never faded. The -year-old was on a mission as she delivered a letter to Boris Johnson calling on him to improve dementia care.It was typical Barbara, drawing on every ounce of her strength and resilience to make sure the needs of dementia sufferers are heard. Leaning on the arm of devoted husband Scott, above, who has been her rock since her Alzheimer’s diagnosis, it was heartening to see glimpses of the Barbara we all love.She was immaculately made up and her trademark blonde beehive was teased higher than ever. She smiled, waved and joked with everyone, but you could seeshe was exhausted as well as exhilarated. Seeing Barbara and Scott together – and the tender way he takes care of her – is so moving.This vile disease might be cruelly robbing him of the woman he loves, but the two of them endeavour to make the most of every day and they are doing a vital job in raising money and awareness so one day we might even conquer dementia.What a tribute that would be to one of the most delightful women I’ve ever been lucky enough to come across.MY thoughts are with Alexandra Burke and her footballer partner Angus MacDonald, who has been diagnosed with bowel cancer at the heartbreakingly young age of .The Hull City defender is a fit sportsman and the news proves this hellish disease can strike down anyone. I hope the cancer has been caught early and he will go on to make a full recovery with singer Alexandra by his side.It’s going to be a very tough time for them both – but I hope all the support and good wishes being sent their way will be of some help and comfort.I’M a bit bemused that Harry and Meghan have apparently declined an invitation to his granny’s Highland home, saying baby Archie is too young.Their four-month-old has already flown to Ibiza for a week on a private jet and is about to go on a long trip to South Africa. By all accounts, there is also an upcoming trip to Calornia so Mum and Dad can go househunting.So to say he’s too small to pop up the road to Scotland seems somewhat disingenuous. The Queen always invites her family to Balmoral to spend part of the summer with her. Princess Anne, Prince Edward and Sophie and princesses Eugenie and Beatrice spent time there last month.The Queen also showed her unquestioning support to Prince Andrew, who is embroiled in the scandal surrounding the late convicted pervert Jeffrey Epstein.William and Kate flew up with their three kids for a family break – somewhat pointedly on a Flybe plane – the day after the Sussexes went on that Ibiza trip in a private jet financed by Uncle Elton.Maybe Meghan simply doesn’t fancy the chilly BBQs and outdoorsy le at Balmoral. Harry’s mum Diana was never a big fan and I wouldn’t blame Meghan for not wanting to be part of the hunting, shooting and fishing brigade. But it’s the excuse of Archie being too young that doesn’t ring true.It was the same with Harry’s response to their flights on private jets when preaching to us all about reducing our carbon footprints. He claimed it was to protect his family but big bro William will one day be king and he took Kate and their three children on a commercial airline to Scotland.As I’ve said before, Harry and Meghan have good intentions and a lot to offer. They could do so much good but they seem to have lost their way and there is a growing disconnect between them and us that is really sad.WHAT the feck have we all done in a previous le to deserve the complete and utter balls-up currently being played out in our parliament  It makes the deranged and sweary TV comedy The Thick Of It look like a sensible political documentary.We have become a country full of people who are either permanently angry or completely and utterly fed up to the back teeth of the whole Brexit debacle.

This was a very scary time as they said my liver would only last a couple of days.The next day Diana was told another organ was ready for her, but her spirits were low.She said: I didn’t really get too optimistic then as I realised that someone was losing their le for me to live. It messes with your head big time, but due to toxins in my brain from my liver not working properly, this didn’t really hit me fully till after the operation.AIH happens when you immune system mistakes you liver cells for foreign bodies and attacks them like it would a disease.Doctors don’t know exactly why this occurs but have identied certain risk factors that increase the likelihood of contracting it, including: a family history of AIH, a history of bacterial or viral infections, being a woman and the use of certain medications, such as minocyclineSymptoms of the disease include: enlarged liver , abnormal blood vessels on the skin, abdominal distention, dark urine and pale poo.They came and said we going to harvest your liver which is a horrible way of explaining it.Derby lass Diana said the transplant took more than a year to get over and she could not walk or even open a bottle of milk after the operation.She said: When I first went home I couldn’t walk, open a bottle of milk, or get off the sofa without help. I had lost all my muscle and I looked so poorly.Before her transplant, Diana was a keen sportswoman and she was worried she would be unable to participate in sports like before, but then she discovered the World Transplant Games.She said: I thought my le as I knew it was done and I was only . But then I saw a poster for transplant sport and all the people on there looked normal. I thought I will get better.I got in touch with them and never looked back.Since then Diana has won seven gold medals, three silver, medals and one bronze, and has travelled to places including Sweden and South Africa in cycling.Diana, who now just has medication now and check-ups every six months, said she will always be in awe of her donor, who has given her at least  extra years of le with her family."},{"url":null,"title":"plane toilet mile high club","story":"Passengers busting for the loo were filmed queuing on the United Airlines flight before a man finally exited - quickly followed by a woman.And the clip, filmed by beach volleyballer Stafford Slick, has since gone viral with the athlete joking now Ive seen everything.The footage first shows a line of women waiting for a ballpark of ten minutes outside the loo.At one point, a flight attendant with a drinks trolley walks past - remarking youre still right here to one of the women waiting.The passenger then replied: Theres folks in there.Finally, the bathroom door opens, with a man in a red jumper and black bumbag appearing.Just a few seconds later, a woman in a matching red jumper also walks out from the cramped room, apparently having just joined the Mile High Club.Were you there  Do you know those involved  Contact The Sun Online at tips@the-sun or call   .

This is flooding of biblical proportions.North Carolina Governor, Roy Cooper, said about  people had remained on the island to wait out Dorian.The storm made landfall yesterday morning over North Carolina’s Outer Banks as a far weaker storm than the monster that devastated the Bahamas.Yet despite having been downgraded to a Category  storm, it still sent seawater surging over neighbourhoods, flooding the first floors of many homes.There is signicant concern about hundreds of people trapped on Ocracoke Island, Cooper said.The U.S. Coast Guard began landing local police officers on the island on Friday via helicopter and airlting out the sick, elderly and others in distress.Dorian is expected to remain a hurricane as it sweeps up the Eastern Seaboard today.The chaos the storm left in its wake was brought to the fore yesterday as it was claimed survivors in the Bahamas were looting and shooting each other for food.The mph megastorm bought near-total devastation to the Abaco Islands, with eyewitnesses saying the area smells of death with corpses floating in the water.Tearful survivor Alicia Cooke wept: Everything is gone, people are starting to panic. Pillaging, looting, trying to shoot people for food and water. Its just no way everyones going to get out.No homes. No banks. No gas stations. No hardware stores. Everything is gone.The death toll officially sits at  but officials expected that to rise dramatically over the coming days.Last night Health Minister Duane Sands warned of a staggering final number.The public needs to prepare for unimaginable information about the death toll and the human suffering, he told local radio.On social media thousands are still listed as missing as British and American rescue teams hunt through the rubble for survivors.People are also using websites such as DorianPeopleSearch, which currently lists the names of more than , missing people.Speaking to the Daily Beast, the sites founder Vanessa Pritchard-Ansell said: “When you see that somebody has been found and their family knows where they are, you feel a moment of elation.”“But you also know that there are so many thousands of others who have not been accounted for.”In grim development officials in the Bahamas have deployed a team of morticians loaded with body bags to the Abaco Islands, the BBC reports.Chilling pictures taken there over the past  hours show the catastrophic damage caused to thousands of homes.The wooden-built properties were completely shredded as the mega-storm bulldozed towns and villages, ripping up trees and felling power lines.The storms punishing winds and shocking floodwaters destroyed or severely damaged homes, crippled hospitals and trapped people in attics.Terrying time-lapse footage has now emerged which shows the killer storm barrelling across the Atlantic and over the Bahamas before heading towards the US coast.Mark Lowcock, the United Nations under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, estimates about , people in the northern Bahamas now need vital help.However, with no ing water systems in accessible areas, workers had not been able to establish a permanent rescue site on the Abacos.Lia Head-Rigby, who helps run a local hurricane relief group and flew over the Bahamas hard-hit Abaco Islands, said: Its total devastation. Its decimated. Apocalyptic.Its not rebuilding something that was there – we have to start again.She said her representative on Abaco told her there were a lot more dead, though she had no numbers as bodies are being gathered.The Bahamas prime minister also expected more deaths and predicted that rebuilding would require a massive, coordinated effort.Hubert Minnis said: We are in the midst of one of the greatest national crises in our countrys history.

We know what your conditions are.But with airports flooded and roads impassable, desperate rescue efforts are being severely hampered.Locals rescued used jet skis and bulldozers as they were forced to improvise to reach those trapped.The news is sure to send shivers down the spines of those hunkering down in the US.Dorian sideswiped the Carolinas with shrieking winds, tornadoes and sideways rain on Thursday as it closed in for a possible direct hit on the dangerously exposed Outer Banks.At least four deaths in the Southeast were blamed on the storm.One dad was forced to fling his son onto a roof to save him from sharks that had swum inland after Hurricane Dorian decimated the Bahamas.Adrian Farrington was trying frantically to save his son from the predators in Murphy Town on the island of Abaco and thought hed succeeded only for the howling winds to sweep away his boy back into the shark infested in the flood waters.He recalled how his five-year-old, Adrian Jr, was reaching up and calling out “Daddy” as the winds blew him away.The -year-old told the Nassau : I still could remember him reaching for me and calling, Daddy,Adrian had thought his boy would be safer out of the water after spotting a shark beneath the waves so flung him onto a nearby roof.He then tried to make his way to his son, Adrian Jr, but before he could sit down to hold him, the hurricane dragged him across the roof back into the surge.Twisters spun off by Dorian peeled away roofs and flipped trailers, and more than , homes and businesses were left without power as the hurricane pushed north along the coastline, its winds weakening to mph by evening.Trees and power lines littered flooded streets in Charlestons historic downtown. Gusts topped mph in some areas.The damage from the same storm that mauled the Bahamas was mercully light in many parts of South Carolina and Georgia as well, and by mid-afternoon many of the . million people who had been told to evacuate in three states were allowed to .Still, forecasters warned that Dorian could run straight over North Carolinas Outer Banks the thin line of islands that stick out from the US coast.To the north, Virginia was also in harms way, and a round of evacuations was ordered there.We have a long night ahead of us.

New national guidelines have been issued for the first time since  with a focus on trying to prevent frailty as we get older. Health leaders hope they will act as personal blueprints to avoid dangerous weight gain as well as reducing the strain on the NHS. Falls are the biggest reason older people end up in AE, but experts say they could be avoided through daily activities such as swimming, gardening, a walk or climbing stairs.  The Chief Medical Officers for all four UK nations said over-s should do activities such as bowls or dancing on two days each week. The new guidance also focuses on the importance of older people doing “strength activities” at least two days a week. Experts said these could be yoga classes or carrying shopping.Prof Dame Sally Davies, CMO for England, said: “As we age, our muscles weaken and we can become stf, leading to falls and dficulty performing everyday activities.Physical activity can prevent fragility and support mobility in old age. “By keeping active, both throughout the day and also through hobbies, we can slow muscle and bone decline, ultimately keeping us independent for longer.” The guidelines suggest OAPs wear step counters to remind them to get moving. The report states: “Older adults should break up prolonged periods of being sedentary with light activity, as this has distinct health benefits.”  Strength activities include lting weights, using resistance machines, heavy gardening, carrying heavy shopping, and holding young children.

Which might seem weird, but when a Prime Minister elected by a handful of golf club bores with no majority attempts to drive us off a clf, it seems quite logical that a Rasputin figure should call the shots. And Dominic Cummings ­undoubtedly is. The man who ­masterminded Vote Leave by making his goons repeat ad nauseam the soundbite “take back control” has come up with another one to keep his master in power: “the surrender bill”. That’s the mantra every Tory will spout over the coming weeks to describe Parliament’s legitimate over-ruling of Johnson’s reckless attempt to force through a no-deal Brexit. And it works for them on many levels. It fits their depiction of all ­politicians who don’t buy into their vision as cowards and traitors. It paints Johnson as a liberator of oppressed people. And with the implied surrender being to European dictators, it takes them back to their comfort zone: the Second World War.  That’s where right-wingers withdraw to when they want to claim a monopoly on patriotism. Back to the myth that Britain alone, under a Tory leader, defeated the Nazis – even though anyone whose brain hasn’t been pickled in a Wetherspoon’s cask knows three other factors were equally as vital: American money, Russian blood and the English Channel. Never in the psyche of any nation has one war obsessed so many for so long. During the ­referendum campaign buses blared the soundtrack to The Great Escape and roadside ­billboards urged drivers to “Halt ze German advance! Vote Leave”. David Davis said“our civil service can cope with World War Two it can easily cope with this”. His TA chum, Mark ­Francois, claimed “my father was a D-Day veteran, he never submitted to bullying by any German. Neither will his son”. And another Tory said that Hitler had tried to turn Europe into a single entity and “the EU is an attempt to do this by dferent methods”.  That man  Prime Minister Johnson – who has a Churchill ­obsession. Look at the jutting jaw, listen to those calls for the British lion to roar, read his bang-average book The Churchill Factor: How One Man Made History, where the author draws countless parallels with himself. Which only shows how ludicrous one of his Cummings-inspired acts this week was: Sacking Churchill’s grandson as a Tory MP for not buying into ­Johnson’s Churchillian vision, even though Nicholas Soames believes Winston would have remained in the EU. It’s utter madness but it will get more insane as an election looms. The Tories will label Jeremy Corbyn a “lentil-eating surrender monkey” and mock him up as Lord Haw-Haw. There will be more pictures of Spitfires taking off in their TV broadcasts than new cars rolling off our production lines, and at rallies you’ll hear speeches effectively saying that VE Day should have guaranteed Britain supremacy over Europeans forever. And at next Saturday’s Last Night of the Proms, Johnson, dressed in a bowler hat and bow tie, pulling on a cigar, will be seen weeping as he sings “Britons never, ever shall be slaves”. Our best hope is that Churchill’s grandson offers to fight him on the beaches.  "},{"url":null,"title":"price stupid cost educating boris","story":"NewsPrice of stupid: Cost of educating Boris Johnsons cabinet revealed to be £.millionEXCLUSIVE: Youll be surprised how much was spent educating Boris Johnsons cabinet... and they STILL cant solve BrexitShareCommentsByMatt Roper:,  SEP NewsPrime Minister Boris Johnson \"Get the biggest politics stories by emailSubscribe We will use your email address only for the purpose of sending you newsletters.

Phyllis Diaz Campbell, , has now been able to fly home after politicians and the community rallied to her support following her horric ordeal. She flew to the UK from her home in Georgia, Atlanta, to visit her poorly sister, planning to stay for five weeks. But officials at Birmingham Airport confiscated her passport, ushered her into a detention area and held her there for five hours. Birmingham Live reports homeless support and kindhearted strangers helped Phyllis, a aposWindrushapos era nurse who lived in the city in the s and s, during the traumatic time which followed. Desmond Jaddoo, chairman of the Windrush Movement UK, took up her case and organised her flight home, paid for by the Home Office, and is pursuing a compensation claim on her behalf.    It was a very traumatic time for Phyllis and there was obviously a lot of confusion but she ended up stuck here through no fault of her own. We were very glad to be able to help her get the right outcome, the activist said. Phyllis, speaking just before her departure, said she was very glad to be finally leaving and going home. The retired nurse, who has  great-grandchildren, thanked those who had helped her resolve the issue, including Mr Jaddoo and Labour MP Jess Phillips, who represents Yardley, east Birmingham. Phyllis, a Jamaican by birth, said of her time in Birmingham: It has been like being imprisoned but I have not committed a crime.    Her ordeal began when she flew in for a five week stay last July to visit her sister, who has Alzheimeraposs disease. On landing at Birmingham Airport, she was detained for several hours because she did not have a visitor visa, and her passport confiscated. It was only ed to her seven months later. Phyllis lived in Birmingham from her mid teens, marrying a Brit and having two sons here, before moving to America when her marriage broke down. She said: Birmingham was once my home - but now I never want to come back. It has been a nightmare. She flew in on her Jamaican passport, as she had on all previous occasions, only to ushered into a detention area and held for five hours because she did not have a visitor visa. In  years travelling to and from England she had never previously needed one but visa rules had tightened since her last visit.  Phyllis was eventually allowed to go on with her visit - but without her passport. It was then seven months before the passport was finally ed - by which time Phyllis had long missed her flight home and had moved into emergency homeless accommodation provided by Birmingham City Council. Her family back home in America have been helping her to survive, but live themselves on meagre incomes, she said. The initial cause of the passport being held is a cause of some confusion, with conflicting explanations. She says she sought legal help after being released from the airport and was advised by a lawyer to apply for an indefinite right to remain, which would then enable her to stay for the duration of her visit andhome as planned five weeks later.

You took immediate offence at her having the audacity in your view to wake you up. It seems that that was the beginnings of what turned out to be on your part an opportunity for you to get very upset without any justication at all. That manested itself in the most unpleasant of ways. It was thoroughly unpleasant period of conduct by you such was your conduct that members of staff were called to deal with you and they had cause to contact the pilot.    Itaposs quite plain albeit this wasnapost the most serious case the court hears, that it had an impact on Ms Pryke who we heard in evidence was upset and ended up in tears because of your behaviour. It was completely unacceptable and Iaposm entirely satisfied that it was contributed by that you had drunk a signicant amount of alcohol during the course of that flight. I accept this conviction will have profound ramications for you and your employability so Iaposm just persuaded that this can be dealt with with a financial penalty.

Mohammed Abu Sammour suffered horric injuries, including fractures to his face, skull and ribs, after he was allegedly brutally attacked and run over by his work van. The High Court in Glasgow heard harrowing details of a police interview in which Scott Pearson, , denied involvement in Mohammed’s death. Mr Sammour, , was working for at a housing development in Lanarkshire, Scotland, when he died on October  last year, the Daily Record reports . In an interview at four days later, Detective Constable Craig Bates said to the accused: “Mr Sammour had fractures to his face and skull, his left knee was shattered and his pelvis and ribs were fractured. “Do you know the poor guy didn’t die straightaway   “He was screaming for help, probably thinking of his four kids and his we. “He was working to earn a couple of pounds for his family. “It’s beyond comprehension how someone could do that, don’t you agree ” Pearson replied: “Aye.” The detective then told the accused that Mohammed’s sons would grow up without a father and his we without a husband. He added: “Don’t you think they deserve answers ” Pearson, of Newarthill, replied: “It’s got f*** all to do with me.” The court also heard yesterday that Pearson, who denies murder, had told a friend he thought he had reversed over the security guard before driving off in his work van.  It is alleged that while acting with Ryan Hunter, , and an -year-old who can’t be named for legal reasons, Pearson repeatedly punched and kicked Mohammed, knocked him to the ground rendering him unconscious, then kicked and stamped on his head before reversing the van over him. Hunter has already admitted the culpable homicide of Mohammed. Connor Payling, , a warehouseman, told the court that between am and .am on October  last year, Pearson drove to his home in a van with Osprey marked on the side. He said: “I told him, ‘Get to f***’. It was a company van and I know Scott doesn’t work. “He just drove away and came back between .am and am without the van. “I asked him where he had got the van from and he said they were heading up to Newarthill. “He said they didn’t think there was anyone in the van but a man was sleeping.

Cashaposs Well, is in Langdon Hills Country Park near Basildon, Essex, is said to have been haunted by spectres since . It has stood derelict and abandoned in the decades which have followed and now ghost hunters believe spooks are re here.Elliot Hawkins, a reporter with Essex Live , explored the site, surrounded by remote woodland. Hereaposs what the journalist had to say after Essex Ghost Hunters led the special tour...   Just minutes into the walk, we came to a gate. When we do our investigations our first stop is these gates, Russell explained. Itaposs right on a joining path that takes you into the forest three or four dferent ways, and there are about three or four dferent stories depending on which way you face. There is a gentleman in unorm, heaposs law abiding. The men tend to pick up more on this gentleman and you hear him quite clearly shting and moving. Weaposll stand and watch out and a couple of times guests have asked whoaposs walking down the path. When we go inside there are two ladies, one on each side, with two completely dferent stories. Now that weaposre talking, I know that one lady has joined us.    The ghost hunter claimed that he could sense one of the spirits. Some of the group have been coming to Cashaposs Well for almost  years, but they still have the same experiences every time they . My arms have gone goosebumpy, Russell added. Weaposve all got an aura, which is scientically proven. Weaposve all got a two-inch energy bubble that surrounds us all the time. When spirits come close they will interact with that bubble, something has moved your aura and itaposs wobbling. The two energies pull apart and thataposs what causes the vibration.  As we got closer to Cashaposs Well, Russell explained that the group have seen and sensed the spirits of  children. The group believes they come down from the old sanatorium at the top of the hill. We get our guests to stand there and the children will come and hold their hands, Russell said. Weaposll get them to pull on the guestsapos fingers, two for a boy or one for a girl, and theyaposll get that physical sensation. As striking and awe-inspiring as it is, the well isnapost the easiest thing to spot. Itaposs tucked away in the corner of the woods, surrounded by towering trees and covered in overgrowth. As Russell put it, you could walk straight past it. We all work with spirit guides, a spirit from the other side that helps you in everyday le, he said. On our first visit here we were walking around the outside thinking weaposre never going to find this place and all we heard was aposturn left!apos  Simon, who runs the company, askedwe heard it. There was a gap in the forest and we turned into it, through the gap was the well. And itaposs a sorry sight. Left to degrade and waste away, much of the stone has been stripped back, leaving the walls barren and bare. While it maintains its history, itaposs now merely a shadow of its former glory. Russell added: Every time weaposve come here itaposs been deteriorating, and itaposs such a sad state of affairs. When we came here the first time our mouths dropped. Itaposs a shame, you can see how much itaposs deteriorated. Look at how much itaposs lost in a year. Weaposve cleared out the well of printers and fax machines before, why would you carry those things down here  Built in the s, the well was the fth of its kind in the local area.  The man behind the build, Mr Edwin Cash, attempted to source local water renowned for its high mineral content and potential health benefits. He went on to yield, bottle and sell the water to local chemists and stores, before his company went under just a few years later. He died in , but according to the group, his spirit remains at the site. Mr Cash wonapost like me down there tonight, he doesnapost like me and I donapost particularly like him, Russell explained. Thereaposs no love lost between us. This is well number five. The sanatorium flooded and all the dirty water flowed down the hill and flooded his well. This is why Mr Cash doesnapost like me because of what I call his water. But he never stopped selling his water, he continued bottling it and selling it and he called it the best clear-out water in Essex because it gave everyone upset stomachs and made them feel sick.  Weaposve always tried to get our hands on a bottle but thereaposs only one that we know of. You can see where the bottling area used to be because you can see all the glass. As we made our way inside the well, I was hit with chills. Chills of knowing the history and what happened on this very site  years ago. When investigating the location, the group have to throw coins into the well - something Mr Cash tells them to do. He was money-orientated, everything was money with him and he was a businessman, Russell added. We pay him, we throw a couple of p coins down there. He always says heaposs hid something down there from his we, whataposs down there  We donapost know. Russell then paused: Heaposs here now.  After ten years of investigations at Cashaposs Well, the group have plenty of stories to tell. We conduct our séances here, Russell said. We all stand up, hold hands and draw the energy in. Weaposve had peopleaposs noses going down that well after being pushed over, and weaposve had the whole group pushed out the door. Weaposve had people who come here, do not believe us, and theyaposve got their noses touching the floor. People stand there saying aposwhy are my hands moving apos Theyaposre trying to push it down but they canapost, then all the hands are in the air. On the other side through the bushes, itaposs a bit sinister, you see a lot of light anomalies. A lot of it is psychological but youaposll get a lot of people who donapost want to stand with their backs to the window or by the door. Weaposve had so many people who just burst out in tears, he added. When people come on a paranormal investigation or a ghost hunt, theyaposre looking for a ghost. What they want is Casper to come up and shake them on the hand, but that doesnapost work.  Spirits work very minutely at first. Weaposre all laughing and youaposre interested, butall of a sudden you told me that you feel really emotional and want to cry then Iaposd be thinking why  Spirit is just tweaking into that. How many times people have seen things in here, people physically moving. You see people stop and look, but theyaposre sometimes too frightened to say because theyaposve seen something. A lot of women come with their husbands who are coming along for the ride, turn up, arms crossed. A good hour into it theyaposre asking you questions and their mind becomes interested and youaposre into their chain of thought. The séances are intense because youaposre concentrating the energies. Thereaposs a bridge that we very rarely go to because itaposs dark and sinister, Russell claimed. We also had a guy who was seven feet tall, stocky, broad, and he was the nicest guy youaposd ever spoken to, but we took him up to the top of the hill and he got so aggressive. The others were telling me that he wasnapost right and heaposd never spoken to anyone like that. He was cursing and throwing his arms around, so we had to turn him around. He wasnapost under attack, he was just feeling the energy.  We had to talk to him to get him out and all of a sudden he came back to us. He said aposI just wanted to kill everybodyapos. You do worry, you could see his hands and he was really containing something. While the group donapost intend to change peopleaposs minds, there have been instances where guests have come away from an investigation feeling changed. We had one bloke that didnapost want to know who came with his girlfriend, Sandra explained. You get smells in forests, we get perfume but we donapost wear perfume when weaposre out and about and we could smell lots. He was convinced that Iaposd got vials in my pockets that I was breaking, and that was fine because it was his thoughts. We did a spirit board and we found out all sorts of information about him including his class number at school and the house he was in, and he had an argument with his girlfriend because he thought sheaposd told us everything.

Hartley, who got a job as a maintenance man, was caught after a freelancer working on No Time to Die noticed the light reflecting from the lens similar to light reflecting off the face of a watch and used a screwdriver to take off the grill. He was jailed at Aylesbury Crown Court on Friday for  months and will be on the sex offenders register for ten years. Prosecutor Daniel Wright told the court the device was marketed as a spy camera and Hartley had used a piece of tape to cover its LED light to try to stop it being detected. Hartley, who has a history of similar offences dating back to , contacted his public protection officer at the Met Police later that morning to tell him he had reoffended.    He has previous convictions for placing cameras in a council building in Coventry in  and for placing one in the changing rooms of a leisure centre in . The -year-old has a total of three convictions for eight offences, although at his first conviction he asked for  offences to be taken into consideration. When asked by police why he had placed the device in the Pinewood toilets, he said: I suppose sexual gratication is the main reason - as Iaposve learned from my past whenever something bad or stressful happens I act out. Hartley, of Uxbridge, said his partner had been in hospital undergoing tests for cancer when he committed the offence. He later pleaded guilty to one count of voyeurism at Milton Keynes Magistratesapos Court. In a victim impact statement, the young woman who found the camera said she had needed mental health treatment and had suffered from acute anxiety.    She said: I am not eating or sleeping properly and I donapost feel safe anywhere - I check the whole house for cameras. I donapost doubt that I will check every bathroom I go into for the rest of my le. She added: I donapost believehas any remorse, this was a deliberate act using high definition, wide angle and vibration triggered equipment. He knew exactly what he was doing and must have seen the damagelast time. The court heard Hartley had completed a sex offenders rehabilitation programme only eight months before reoffending. He claimed it had made him worse by opening a Pandoraaposs box in his mind. Jailing him, judge Francis Sheridan said the victimaposs le has been devastated by a dirty-minded inidual who preys on women using the lavatory where he can compromise them.

Roberts, from Hull, went on to tell her ex their apossonapos had become poorly in hospital, had been put up for adoption and later died. When her ex began asking for pictures of the child, he became suspicious when she denied his requests - although he continued to hand over cash and even take out loans.The court also heard Roberts had threatened to go to the police and claim he raped her unless he sent her more money, reports Hull Live.Prosecutor Richard Thompson said the complainant and the defendant had ended a previous pregnancy, but Roberts had initially wanted £ for a second abortion after claiming to be pregnant again.    He told the court on Friday: “The complainant says that in that time he put on three stone with comfort eating. He said that he did not want to wake up to his phone being bombarded with a serious of texts and missed calls. “He now has a son with his new partner and feels devastated that the money should be spent on his actual son who he has now. “It was money that he had saved up since he was aged  and could have gone towards a deposit for a house. “It later transpired there was actually no baby at all and the complainant has described the entire situation and period of time, which was just a little over a year, as the worst of his le.” The court heard the blackmail victim’s partner had received “weird” messages alerting the complainant to Robertsapos intentions that she would carry out the threats. Roberts and the man had cut ties in summer , which, the court heard, had caused her to “feel upset, jealous and rejected”. She was soon caught in a “tissue of lies”, according to defence barristers. Following the course of the blackmail, she had even claimed the child had died due to birthing complications after being handed over to new adoptive parents.    But this was just a tale of fantasy, the court heard on Friday morning. Roberts had wanted thousands of pounds for the fictional child’s funeral and then promised the victim he would get the money back. She had even written out cheques to the complainant, but told him not to cash then otherwise they would bounce. Charlotte Baines, defending, told the court Roberts had a series of mental health problems and the court proceedings had worsened her mental well-being. She said: “She has two children with another child on the way. “She is pregnant now and it is a high risk birth with complications with pre-eclampsia. “The defendant is thoroughly disgusted and ashamed with what she has done. “She said this was only time she could get away with this and took the opportunity, saying that the money was too good and got used to it being an easy way to get money.” Roberts, of Wingfield Road, east Hull, pleaded guilty to a single charge of blackmail at an earlier hearing.

Diana Higman was complaining of fatigue at her GP surgery before the harrowing diagnosis. But now  years on she has told how a total stranger saved her le. The single mum was working as a trainee nurse when the tiredness began. After the death of her dad, doctors put her exhaustion down to stress, but sent for blood tests to rule out anything serious, Derbyshire Live reports. The -year-old said: It was nearly  years ago I became ill. I was doing my nurse training and my dad had died not long before. I was really tired but the doctor put it down to stress.    It was recommended that I have some blood tests and I left them for a while but one day I was on placement at the hospital and I popped down to have it done. Next thing I know, I was being put on a super urgent transplant list and was given  hours to live. Diana was diagnosed with auto immune hepatitis and was in desperate need of a new liver, as hers was shrinking rapidly. She said: I was transferred to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham for a liver transplant which I was not expecting. I was so scared, miles away from home and all alone. They came Friday and said we have a liver, but after tests later that day they said it was too big and wouldn’t fit. They put me on a list which searches all over the UK for an organ. This was a very scary time as they said my liver would only last a couple of days. The next day Diana was told another organ was ready for her, but her spirits were low.    She said: I didn’t really get too optimistic then as I realised that someone was losing their le for me to live. It messes with your head big time, but due to toxins in my brain from my liver not working properly, this didn’t really hit me fully apostill after the operation. They came and said we going to harvest your liver which is a horrible way of explaining it. Diana, who lives in Derby, said the transplant took more than a year to get over and she could not walk or even open a bottle of milk after the operation. Before her transplant, Diana was a keen sportswoman and she was worried she would be unable to participate in sports like before, but then she discovered the World Transplant Games. She said: I thought my le as I knew it was done and I was only . But then I saw a poster for transplant sport and all the people on there looked normal. I thought I will get better. I got in touch with them and never looked back. Diana said it was an uphill struggle which started with baby steps. She said: I started swimming with a rubber ring and then I tried my hand at cycling. I got an old bike off eBay.    I did the race in Bath in  but I kept getting lapped and said that I would never get on a bike again, but guess what - I did. Since then Diana has won seven gold medals, three silver, medals and one bronze, and has travelled to places including Sweden and South Africa in cycling. Diana, who now just has medication now and check-ups every six months, said she will always be in awe of her donor, who has given her at least  extra years of le with her family.

A small gate, built into an unassuming brick wall barely gives away the fact that it is actually the way down to an underground passage linking at least three cave systems. Old tales suggests the caves, hidden ft below Berry Head in Brixham, Devon, were often used by smugglers in times gone by. One was used historically as a apossepulchreapos containing human bones and there is rumoured to be a four mile passage connecting it to nearby village, Kingswear. The entrance to the caverns initially appears to be the way into a basement beneath one of the homes.Nearby street names, like Cavern Road, Cavern Mews and Cavern Steps all allude to the quaint little archway, Devon Live reports .   The site is also scheduled under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act . It is known as Philpaposs Cave and was open to the public until  when it was shut because of aposinsurance issuesapos. It was discovered by builder John Lane Philp in  who was searching for a pickaxe that had fallen into a hole in the ground during construction of a house on Mount Pleasant Road. When the cave was entered for the first, it was found to be completed sealed up and undisturbed, with its stalagmite floor still intact.   The stunning pictures of Berry Head were taken by Darren Murray and Vicki Whelan also stumbled across a large seal snoring happily in the caves and filmed him as he slept, bobbing up and down - totally unaware that he was being watched by the kayakers.Berry Head is famous at the top for its iconic lighthouse and the spooky remains of the Napoleonic Fort. The long peninsula of land, surrounded by water on three sides, has panoramic views from the top with views across Torbay from one side and down towards Dartmouth on the other.    The lighthouse is known for being the smallest one in the country - but at the same time it is one of the highest, at ft above sea level.The clfs were made famous  when Hollywood heartthrob Tom Hardy was filmed jumping into the sea at the spot known for deep-water solo ing for a TV advert, despite emergency services regularly issuing warnings about the dangers of tombstoning in the area.Not far away from Berry Head, you can also find Ash Hole Cavern, a -metre walk from Berry Head Road, through woods and undergrowth near Shoalstone Pool.    There is evidence of human habitation since Neolithic times. It has been a scheduled ancient monument site since  and there are due to be new investigations carried out in . In around , an excavation was carried out by hymn writer Revd Henry Francis Lyte,  who penned the famous rugby anthem Abide With Me and lived at what is now the Berry Head Hotel nearby. There have always been rumours that the cave was once much bigger, with a passage led to Kingswear, four miles distant.

And it turns out even the Royals get tempted by the Peri-Peri goodness, and both Princes William and Harry have spoken about their love for it a number of times. Prince Harry was introduced to the South African chain a few years back by his personal protection officer and has been spotted at the chain several times, including a midnight visit to the restaurant in Fulham Broadway, south west London in . Harry, who was  at the time, forked out £. on his takeaway dinner for himself and a friend at .pm on a Tuesday night. Two members of the Prince’s personal security sat patiently behind him while he waited more than  minutes for his Portuguese inspired grub to be prepared.    Harry was seen fidgeting with his mobile phone and making animated hand gestures to his mate as the pair killed time to distract themselves from hunger. A stunned onlooker said: “It was surreal. He was very charming and politely refused a member of staff who approached him for a picture. I was gobsmacked to see him.” Another witness added: “Moments after he left the restaurant clutching his dinner in a paper bag a member of staff jumped on the bench the Harry was sitting on and shouted: “I’m on the Prince’s throne!’ Nobody could believe what happened.”    However not everyone will be particularly impressed by what the royal ordered from the Nandoaposs menu. He ordered a pitta with extra cheese and a side of creamy mash, along with a double chicken wrap with chips. He also got a soft drink and bottle of water. However the pitta was lemon and herb, the chainaposs mildest offering which many people see as a terrible order. It’s unclear whether Harry – who wore a green polo shirt, denim jeans and a baseball cap partially disguising his face according to a witness - paid full price for the grub or took advantage of the  per cent discount the chicken-chain offers to military personnel.    After picking up their order Harry, who was dating Cressida Bonas at the time, and his pal casually exited through the car park which is connected with the building. The late night visit wasn’t his first trip to Nandos. He ordered a similar meal in Stevenage in  with a group of Army friends at a branch near their Hertfordshire base. And Harry isnapost the only royal who likes a cheeky Nandoaposs, and his brother Prince William has also spoken about his love for the chicken in the past.

Once sheaposd finished counting and as the tally reached £, Hannah seemed to be a little shocked, as she gasped in amazement. It was a really weird experience, Hannah said. I was just looking through the charity shops in Stockton Heath on Saturday, as I absolutely love charity shops. I try not to buy anything new and like buying second-hand. I was just flicking through the records outside the Mind shop and I was quite shocked and perplexed when the money fell out.    She thought she was being pranked, but realised that the £ and £ notes were old-style currency. We went in the shop and Kate was just counting and counting the notes watched by the other couple who were being served. It was a lot more money than I thought it would be, she said. They then checked all the albums in the basket, and found there was no more hidden cash. Hannah, , is a chemistry graduate who works at the National Nuclear Laboratory in Birchwood, Warrington, said she had no hesitation about handing the money in. My first thought was the money has been accidentally donated to the charity shop when the record was given, she added. My grandmother used to hide money in a place she thought was safe and could never remember where the places were. Kate Holt, the assistant manager, checked and realised the album was not a Gt Aid item, so they couldnapost trace the owner.

The father had fought for more than two years to seek justice for his tragic daughter Beth, who died after taking pills sent by Shepelev. Mr Shipsey, a company director from Worcester, held up a picture of -year-old Beth as he told the dealer: I want you to look into my daughter’s eyes and apologise for selling her the pills that killed her.

She claims her operation by the “fake” plastic surgeon led to her “genitals being lted into the wrong place” and skin “sticking out of the sides like fish tails”. She suffered acute pain and could not bend her body and says her relationship with her husband has “deteriorated” as a result. “The new surgeon told me it is a miracle that I survived”, said Anastasia, who said that the horror of having her genitals stretched upwards was now over.    Verdy, , has been in custody since April facing criminal action after it was claimed she deformed up to a dozen women who lodged complaints after trusting her with boob and nose jobs and other plastic surgery. She appeared in court in a fur coat and is also under suspicion of faking her medical qualications. Dr Elena Chirikova, who carried out the repair job on Anastasia, told of giant scabs removed from the woman’s body. “We had to remove the tissue deformed by the scars,” she said. “In particular, we had to take away a huge scar above the pubic bone. It was almost three inches thick. “We were taking it out it bit by bit, it was a delicate work. Any moment we could fall into the pelvis and hurt her bladder. “But as soon as we removed the scar, all her skin went back into place.    The surgeon watched a video made by “Dr Frankenstein” of the original surgery. “I am still surprised that after such dangerous action the patient’s abdomen was not perforated,” she said. Anastasia added: “The new surgeon cleaned me up well. She told me: ‘It’s a miracle that you have survived.’“All the scabs she removed could have led to sepsis . My pelvic bones might have rotted. I was lucky that my body managed to get through all this.”A detailed statement on Anastasia’s case from Dr Chirikova has gone to detectives investigating the criminal case against Verdy. Another victim went through a four-hour surgery last month to correct eyelid problems.

The hate for Thatcher was pure and the depth of feeling surged through concerts and rallies.He says with a chuckle: “Them were the days.“We thought it was bad then, but everything can get worse, as we see now. It’s a case of careful what you wish for.“I don’t get involved in politics now, like I say when didn’t anyone complain about politicians “Can you point me to a golden era where# everybody liked being ruled  F***ing never!“But there are some real creeps nowadays. But then again I expect the worst from any politician.”So what can fans in Dundee expect when John rolls into town for his show at the city’s Gardyne Theatre on Saturday October  Without missing a beat he fires back: “A right f****** good night!“And they can expect more of the same#and then some. There will be a few classics and there will maybe be a few extra poems.“Then I will add a bit of fun and I can guarantee – solid, copper-plated guarantee – that everybody is going to leave with a smile on their face.”John has fond memories of Dundee and spoke of savouring the atmosphere of a waterfront hotel and added: “I love coming to Scotland and Dundee. I’ve been many times and the reaction of the crowd is great.“I was here last year and saw the VA which is fabulous. I know of DC Thomson and the Sunday Post, the Beano and the Dandy plus Oor Wullie.“Maybe I will buy one of those sculptures.”Posh hotels and venues seem a world away from the clubs and student venues of the s with smoke-filled rooms and plastic tumblers full of warm beer.He used to travel to the shows on public transport and chuckles at the memory.John said: “Yeah, long time ago now, mate. Now I have a driver and I am too old for public transport.“But I still love doing live gigs. It’s smashing. Anywhere where there’s people is greatI’m doing my stuff.“I am working on my book of poems right now. It’s called ‘The Luckiest Man Alive’ and I’m also working on the memoirs. vw, px\"  “I am thinking of calling that ‘I Wanna Be Yours’ after the Arctic Monkeys. I just hope to live long enough to finish it.“But I am not finishing up any time soon. I have never even thought about that. I am not retiring, not yet and not in the foreseeable future.”John has the tour to contend with first and is also lining up some television work.And at the age of  there is definitely no holding him back.

The owner of the garage opposite the building noticed it first thing on Wednesday morning.”The committee have reported the vandalism to the police, but are yet to add up how much it will cost to have the graffiti removed.Kathleen said: “At this stage we don’t have an idea of how much it would cost or who to even ask.“We’ve reached out to our local councillor to seehe could help.”Angus councillor Derek Wann added: “Although it is a private building, I’ve askedthere is anything we can do to help remove the graffiti. I’ll be pressing the issue at the next council meeting.”The Guide Hall has been in use by the Girl Guides since , and is also used by a host of other local groups including dance classes and an art group.If the group does need to pay to have the graffiti removed, the money may have to come out of funds that had been earmarked for improvements to be made to the building.Kathleen said: “We’re working hard to improve the property, using our own time and resources, which is no mean feat.“Our latest plan is to create access to the rear garden area where the vandalism took place. We’re currently pricing how much this will cost but believe it’s an essential improvement to our premises.“The committee would welcome those responsible repainting the wall or helping with a fundraiser for the hall in the near future.”A spokesman for Police Scotland said: “We’re aware of the incident and will be investigating.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/06/Dunsinane-Industrial-Estate-772x564.jpg ","title":"decisions to refuse plans for gym and development of flats at dundee industrial estate to go under microscope","story":"Council decisions to refuse plans for a gym, a development of flats and the amendment of a takeaway’s opening hours could be overturned next week.Elected members will hear appeals on the plans at a meeting of the authority’s local review body on Tuesday.They will hear from the applicants behind a gym proposal for Dunsinane Industrial Estate and a plan to replace the Frank Kelbie building on Milnbank Road with flats.If persuaded, the committee has the power to overturn the refusals handed down to each applicant by council planning officers.Fitness fanatics Sam McCluskey and Shelly McColl had hoped to open their Sweat Box gym at a unit at the newly constructed Webster Park development on the estate to the south of the Kingsway.Despite a nearby unit having permission for a gym approved on appeal, council officers turned down the latest proposal on the grounds that the industrial estate did not support the inclusion of a gym in the area.Planners said in June: “The proposed change of use would result in the loss of a purpose-built industrial unit which has been designed to accommodate small and start-up businesses.”Meanwhile, Frank Kelbie Ltd will bring its application to demolish its former premises back to council, having been refused permission to build six flats on the site.The scrapyard firm has moved to a new home in Lochee and, rather than leave the old space empty, wanted to repurpose it for residential use.However, council officers said the proposals would not “contribute to the creation of a street with a strong sense of identity” and could hamper neighbouring industrial firms.In addition, they said the Milnbank Road development would also hamper the local car parking offering.As well as the building applications, councillors will also be told about a proposal to extend the opening hours at an out-of-town deli.Doc’s Deli on Strathmartine Road – a takeaway located in the Downfield pub – wants to extend its opening hours from am-pm to am-midnight.The council refused the plans because of fears the extended hours would disturb local residents.All three appeals will be heard in the Committee Rooms on Tuesday at pm."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2019/07/5d1dba5d3b6627.41351149.jpg ","title":"dundee uniteds goal machine shankland fit for arbroath cup tie","story":"Goal machine Lawrence Shankland will be available for Dundee United’s Tunnock’s Caramel Wafer Challenge Cup clash with Arbroath this weekend.Shankland made it eight goals in four league starts last Friday as he scored from the spot in the Tangerines’ crushing - derby win over Dundee.There was concern as he limped off  minutes from the end at Tannadice.United, however, have confirmed the problem was nothing serious and the -year-old is back in training this week.“It was just a cramp in his leg he couldn’t get rid of, so we took him off,” said assistant boss Gordon Forrest.“He did a great job in the game but when you look at our bench there are players who can come on and score.“Again it is credit to all the boys who are working hard in training and keeping themselves fit and sharp.

confident Scott McKenna’s latest injury setback will not hinder his Scotland career.A hamstring tear has ruled Aberdeen centre-back McKenna out of the Euro  qualiers against Russia and Belgium.McKenna was set to retain his starting position in Steve Clarke’s squad for the vital Group I qualiers.However, the -year-old suffered a hamstring injury on the articial pitch at Kilmarnock that will rule him out for up to a month.In reaction to injury withdrawals of centre-backs Grant Hanley and Liam Palmer, boss Clarke handed a late call-up to Aberdeen’s uncapped Mikey Devlin.McInnes accepts it will be a major setback for McKenna to miss out facing World Cup quarter-finalists Russia and a Belgium side sitting number one in the Fa world rankings.But he is confident McKenna will remain pivotal to future

Scott is obviously disappointed that he is not going to be playing in these qualiers as they are two great games.“It would have been two brilliant games for him to go into.“However, I think the good thing is that when Steve took the Scotland job on he played Scott in the first two games.“He sees Scott as part of that .”The hamstring tear suffered at Kilmarnock was the latest injury setback to marr McKenna’s international career.The centre-back suffered a hamstring tear against Rangers in the opening game of last season that ultimately ruled him out of action for six weeks.That injury saw him miss Scotland’s opening UEFA Nations League clash against Albania and the friendly with Belgium last September.McInnes believes the recent injury was particularly cruel for McKenna as he was in good form despite the speculation over his Aberdeen future.McKenna had submitted a transfer request days before the English transfer window closed on August  for Premier League and Championship clubs.Nottingham Forest and Queens Park Rangers both had bids for McKenna rejected before he handed in the request.Sheffield Wednesday came in with a late bid on transfer deadline day that was also rejected for the defender who is contracted to Pittodrie until .McInnes said: “Scott’s level of performance have been very strong. Unfortunately he missed spells of football last season with two hamstring injuries and this is another one.“This is a similar injury to when Scott over-stretched itagainst Rangers here making a blocking tackle.“He has over-stretched it again having lost his footing on that pitch and is out for the region of three to four weeks.“It may be a bit longer, maybe a bit shorter, but Scott has been a quick healer in the past.”Devlin’s call-up came  hours after histo the Dons starting line-up for the first time in six weeks after a hamstring injury.McInnes said: “It just shows you need that squad and how it changes because Mikey thought he was not getting into my team a couple of weeks ago.“Mikey is now in charge of he jersey and he comes back in now and plays.“We know we can rely on Mikey when he is called upon.“It is great to have that quality in the squad to call upon when you have injuries.McKenna is one of five centre-backs ruled out of Clarke’s Scotland squad with John Souttarand Stuart Findlayboth omitted with injuries.Grant Hanleyand Liam Palmerwere called up but dropped out with injuries.In reaction Clarke called up the Dons’ Devlin, , and Hamburg’s David Bates, on loan at Sheffield Wednesday.Uncapped Devlin was previously in the squad last November and was set to earn his first cap only to suffer an ankle injury training with Scotland that would rule him out for three months.McInnes said: “What looked like an innocuous injury when he was away with Scotland saw him miss the best part of three months.“He missed out on the League Cup final, playing for Scotland and a number of key games for us.“For a young lad he has a lot of injuries to deal with but hopefully he will have better times ahead.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2019/08/5d6004abb61e43.23715313.jpg ","title":"logan and campbell fitness boost dons","story":"Aberdeen have received a double fitness boost with right-back Shaleum Logan and midfielder Dean Campbell both set tofor the next Premiership clash.Logan missed the - defeat of Ross County prior to the international break having undergone a minor procedure on a groin injury.The defender is on course tofor the next clash against St Johnstone at Pittodrie next Saturday.Teenage midfielder Campbell has been sidelined since the - League Cup defeat of Dundee with a hip injury.Campbell had to withdraw due to injury from the Scotland Under- squad to face Japan in Pinatar, Spain, in two friendlies as preparation gets underway for UEFA European championship qualying in October.However, Campbell is also set to be fit to face the Perth Saints.Dons boss Derek McInnes said: “I think Shay will be all right for St Johnstone.“Under medical instruction he was advised not to play against Ross County.“Hopefully we can get him back in contact training in the week building up to St Johnstone.“Dean Campbell will hopefully be fit for St Johnstone.”Logan’s expectedwill be a timely boost for McInnes who had only four fit defenders for the clash with Ross County.Centre-backs Scott McKenna and Ash Taylor were also sidelined with hamstring tears.The manager said: “You could see on the benchthere were no midfielders and no defenders. That was not through choice.”McKenna and Taylor are both set to miss the St Johnstone match.Taylor was on course toto action after the international break following more than a month out.However, he suffered a setback in his rehabilitation and will miss a few more weeks.McKenna is out for up to another three weeks.The injury, sustained in the - draw on the articial surface at Kilmarnock, ruled him out of Scotland’s Euro  qualier with Russia tonight and with Belgium on Monday.With the national team also experiencing defensive injury problems boss Steve Clarke called up Dons centre-back Mikey Devlin on Sunday night.Devlin and Sheffield Wednesday’s David Bates were added to the squad after Norwich City’s Grant Hanley and another Wednesday player, Liam Palmer, pulled out through injury.The defeat of Ross County was Devlin’s only first-team game time since suffering a hamstring injury in the - Europa League defeat of RoPS Rovaniemi on July .Devlin had  minutes for the Dons reserves’ - defeat of Ross County’s second string last week.McInnes praised him for his performance.

I also have signicant issues with road safety.“Broadstraik Road is already very busy, with very few sticking to the speed limit, making it already challenging to get out of the junctions at Broadstraik Drive Grove Crescent, as well as at the roundabout between Broadstraik Road and Carnie Crescent.“The junction at the B and A also has long-standing traffic congestion and safety issues that keep getting ignored.”Lesley Mavor, of Skene, also formally objected to the shop being part of the proposal.She said: “We should be supporting existing businesses not adding competition.“I therefore object to the inclusion of a convenience store.”However, loss of trade is not a factor the council can consider when responding to the plan.Mr Williamson declined to comment.The council is

We do at the moment have a dentist and fully qualied staff and are happy with their work.Rumour has it that the aforementioned dentist and staff will be taking on patients from Mid Argyll Hospital, which I presume they tend to already.But the practice is to lose its local NHS patients, so they will deal solely with patients who require dental treatment from the hospital. I think this situation leaves the NHS patients in limbo.I am sure we would rather that the current dentist and all of her staff be given a chance to voice their opinions on this matter as much and as well as the local populace.Yes, it will be brilliant to have both dentists in the town. There is the possibility that those on the local list who are currently treated well by the dental department at the hospital maybe still seen by the dentist and her staff, but I would like this to be confirmed by the local NHS trust.Brian MacDonald, CrinanSir,Hundreds of people across Scotland have been helped through their exam results by a local group of Skills Development Scotlandcareers advisers.Based across the north of Scotland, the advisers were part of a team taking calls at the SDS Exam Results Helpline from am on results day.The helpline is a vital service, supporting young people and their families at what can be one of the most stressful times of their lives.Expert advice and guidance is available all year round, not just on results day.Our professionally qualied careers advisers are working in every state secondary school in Scotland and from our network of high street centres across the country.In schools, careers services are delivered one-to-one, in classrooms and at school events across all year groups, supporting young people to develop the skills to make informed career decisions throughout their lives.

The deadline was broken on  minutes when Lee MacLean broke from midfield and managed to beat the offside trap, his cross from the left channel was met by the in-form Stuart MacLean whose shot beat Martin to give Star the lead.Tarbert looked to commit bodies forward in a bid to get back into the game which made for a more open contest, however the Star defence of Coll McCallum, Ricky Reid and Kyle Selfridge coped well throughout.Red Star should have made the closing stages a lot more comfortable for themselves with Gregor Peacock going close with a couple of opportunities and Aaron Moore having a shot well blocked but in the end Stuart MacLean’s goal was enough for a hard-fought but deserved win.On Saturday August  Star welcome Dunoon to the joint campus for their final game of the group stage, where a victory for the Lochgilphead side will see them progress to the quarter-finals.The kick-off time will be announced on the club’s social media pages during the week."},{"url":null,"title":"easy like summer busking","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe music club designed for everyone continues its summer of busking on Wednesday August .Get along to Lochgilphead Resource Centre for an evening of music from the much-missed Danny Kennedy with bagpipes, percussion and plenty of chances to sing along to the music.The event starts at pm and is free other than donations.

These songs were associated with the Tlell River on Hai Gwaii in Canada. These tracks, with a selection of later collaborations, make up River to Sea from Tlell to Tiree. The title documents Sheila#s journey from the coast of Canada to Tiree, where the track All You Really Need is the Sea was written.This artist is probably best described as a folk blues singer. She has the sharply observing, descriptive eye of the classic singer songwriter troubadour and while her voice is given gravitas and character by time, she swings and has the timing of the blues singer.Wild Biscuit#s musical accompaniment gives Sheila#s characterful voice depth and presence. The menacing guitar on I#ve Waited a Long Time and the atmospheric double bass and keyboards on Where the Pebbles Grind and Scrape complement Cameron#s lyrics and singing.Remembering Mr Toast is an atmospheric and evocative, less bombastic or overblown Scottish Jim Morrison, finding real beauty in a melancholic memory. The delicate hesitant guitar and reflective lyrics continue on Don#t Sigh and Go on Then, beautul, bitter sweet country love songs. All You Really Need is the Sea and Deep and Real are spiritual songs, again moving between an intimate relationship to consider the huge landscape and the restorative natural world.Is it blues, country, easy listening, folk or poetry set to delicate sympathetic music  It doesn#t matter. Close your eyes, listen to Sheila#s rich voice, with its cadence and rhythm. Enjoy the flow of words and the pictures they conjure on this warm and captivating set of recordings."},{"url":null,"title":"macalister wins tarbert golf championship","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe delayed fourth and final round of the Tarbert Golf Club championship took place at Glenralloch on Saturday August  in glorious conditions.The greens were freshly cut with captain Smyth choosing some interesting pin positions to test the players# skills.Iain Macalister held a one shot lead over Bruce MacNab and a five shot lead over John MacNab heading into the final round.If there were any nerves at the start of play this was not evident as Iain started with four fours then followed that with an excellent -foot birdie putt at the fth and a chip-in birdie at the sixth.

Now I am not saying this is the simplest or even healthiest of activities. All this crouching, hand staining, pricked fingers and even eye strain.Often when you reach for a large black juicy berry it seems to disappear. It’s like the behaviour of politicians. They offer so much but when you reach for it # it disappears. Do you remember the Scottish government passed a law guaranteeing one would be seen by an appropriate health specialist within a stated limited time  The SNP government daily breaks this law – be it on cancer, accident and emergencies, or mental health.Or what about the promises made to the people of Arran and the Outer Hebrides on improved ferry services. The Scottish government is responsible for Caledonian Maritime Assets, CMal, which own and manage ferries. MV Glen Sannox was intended to commence service to Arran in  but lies incomplete for all to see in the Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow. Part of the delay is because of disagreement over the fixed-price design and build contract for the two vessels.The SNP seems obsessed with this type of contract which has adversely affected schools, colleges and community centres. Worse still, while the SNP ridiculed previous government public private partnerships they have introduced a system clearly no better. What about the £. million each month we the taxpayers have to pay for the unopened Edinburgh sick children’s hospital  Jeanne Freeman, the SNP Cabinet Secretary for Health and Social Care, stepped in so late that she does not know whether this much-needed hospital will ever open.The second part of the bramble experience is the delicious mouthwatering bramble crumble. A crumble which gives joy and stimulation. Not like the crumbling state of the SNP government which has a sour taste and clearly disappoints.Finlay Craig, CoveSir,Your readers may be interested to know that there are currently  people in need of a kidney transplant in Scotland whose diet will be restricted due to kidney disease.It is likely that they will be on fluid restrictions of around just ml of liquid a day # including liquid found in foods like sauces and ice cream. That is roughly the equivalent of only being able to have a small cup of tea and one can of soft drink per day.

The tragedy is I cannot tell my grandchildren the same because we messed up.ldquoBut so long as there are young people like those I met on Zomba Plateau about, we can have hope and faith in a future where all can share the bounty of this beautul creation.Afterwards, the youngsters moved on to the Liwonde Game Reserve where they helped restore no less than fourteen houses damaged in the severe floods of March.Then everyone got to experience a safari drive, many of whom for the first time, seeing elephants, hippos, warthogs, and lions up close.Also, a site visit was arranged to YONECO, one of the main sponsors of the camp, to learn of their special approach to promoting youth empowerment.To reinforce the talk the RYLA participants engaged with the women who live on the Plateau and men who make a living there passing on their newfound knowledge on how to minimise the effects of Climate Change.And handed out mango plants in small plastic sleeves that will provide a crop of fruit in three years.Nineteen-year-old leader, John Little said: ldquoThe pilot Malawi RYLA camp was a massive success.

Not only are volunteers providing fresh food for locals, they are also regenerating unused spaces, transforming them into lush green patches for all to feast upon. When filming wrapped, reporter Hilary Scott caught up with community gardeners Adam Skelton and Shirley Spence, to ask them how their gardens grow.THE High Street is the heart of the bustling town of Peebles.A derelict bit of land behind the former court building has been transformed into a tranquil greenspace and is now the Courthouse Community Garden.Adam Skelton told the Peeblesshire News: ldquoDuring the filming we discussed Borders Food Community Facebook Group which is a popular place for people to share food, plants, seeds, tools, and materials, as well as advice and information related to food growing, preparing, cooking and storing.ldquoAnyone can join the group free and there you can connect with lots of knowledgeable and very helpful grower, composters, cooks, preservers, picklers. The list goes on.ldquoWe also discussed land sharing. Various group members have allowed us to share their land and create group food gardens.And the Courthouse Community Garden is one of those havens.ldquoIt was an unused overgrown patch of land and we have converted it into a very productive little garden, explained Adam.ldquoThere is no contract or rent and we have not received any funding.The creation of this garden is down to the hard work of green-fingered volunteers and waste products, which Adam says is a ldquowin-win for all involved.He added: ldquoThe land owners get their land tended and access to free fresh food on their doorstep and we get to grow as we wish in this lovely space.Despite the success of Borders Food Community, Adam says he finds it odd that the vast majority of people are not eating truly local food when there are so many benefits.ldquoFor example therersquos the environment. There is no packaging or food miles, itrsquos so much tastier when fresh and all the nutrients intact and its better for local economy.Adam is very passionate about the work of community gardens and is encouraging locals to join Borders Food Community Facebook Group where they can discover their nearest community garden and get involved.The ITV crew headed to Innerleithen in the afternoon to discover a garden maintained by little and large green-fingers.Volunteers from community gardens across the Borders gathered at the Edible Garden along with St Ronanrsquos Primary School pupils.ldquoEveryone who wanted to got the chance to say a few words. It was great to have people from all the community gardens together in one place discussing more ways to collaborate together to further promote local food growing across the Borders, said Adam.The Edible Garden team were delighted to host the ITV Border Le crew.Shirley Spence said: ldquoWe enjoyed meeting the dferent groups of community growers and making new contacts. We were pleased with the comments and feedback about our garden and learning about other community gardens and their work in the Borders.And the children from St Ronanrsquos Primary School also

Yet it is also one of the worldrsquos poorest countries, with % of its . million people living on less than two US dollars a day.Environmental groups and Transparency International have long highlighted the illegal logging of Madagascarrsquos rosewood forests and other endangered tree species as evidence of the rampant corruption that has made multimillionaires out of a few ldquorosewood barons who have plundered the islandrsquos northeastern forests.ldquoYour lovely island of Madagascar is rich in plant and animal bioersity, yet this treasure is especially threatened by excessive deforestation, from which some profit, Francis said. He cited forest fires, poaching and the ldquounrestricted cutting down of valuable woodlands as particular threats.More so than any pope before him, Francis has made environmental concerns a pillar of his papacy, linking global warming to the persistent exploitation of the worldrsquos poor by the wealthy. He has issued an entire encyclical on the need to care for Godrsquos creation and next month will preside over a meeting of bishops from the Amazon, where an outbreak of rainforest fires have once again focused international attention on the need to preserve what he calls the ldquolungs of the planet.Francis has also frequently called attention to the devastation wrought on the poor by corruption, often calling public officials to account on his foreign trips.Transparency International, which ranks Madagascar among the most corrupt countries, has accused local public officials of complicity or negligence in the illegal logging, mining of gold and sapphires and the poaching of tortoises, turtles and exportation of lemurs.In his speech, Francis urged Mr Rajoelina, who came to power on a campaign to fight corruption, to make good on his pledges.ldquoI would encourage you to fight with strength and determination against all endemic forms of corruption and speculation that increase social disparity, and to confront the situations of great instability and exclusion that always create conditions of inhumane poverty, he said.Francis, the worldrsquos first pope from the

There was a lot of spirit and a feeling that a number of towns in Scotland which have been forgotten, like Campbeltown, will not be left behind after independence.#He put the turnout at more than , and added: #The fact that the march extended theof Longrow gives a fair indication of the numbers who were there.He also told the Courier this week that he remained the #legal indentity# of the All Under One Banner group, despite a bitter public row among the hierarchy which looks like splitting the group in two.It was the biggest rally held in the town in recent years with marchers coming from as far afield as Aberdeen and Alloa and as well as Oban, Glasgow and Islay, with many travelling on the weekend ferry from Ardrossan.#It really exceeded expectations and made a big splash in the town, Ron Wilson of Yes Kintyre told The National.#There was a real buzz as people came early and most of the hotels were booked up. The pubs and cafes were busy so it was good for local businesses. Campbeltown is a Yes town and it was brilliant to have all these people come here.

Ryan McConnachie opted to go straight down the middle and evaded the e of the Dunoon keeper.There was a moment of worry at the other end, though, when goalscorer Souden also committed a handball in the Pupils’ box, and referee Peter Laing pointed to the spot. Dunoon halved the Pupils’ advantage, making it -.Then, just  seconds later, the Pupils restored their two-goal lead through Donald McCallum, who met left-sided substitute Kenny Kerr’s low cross to squeeze a shot between the Dunoon defenders and the frame of the goal.Soon after, the Pupils made it -, when Kerr guided another delightful cross onto the head of John McCallum, who guided an effort past the keeper from six yards, but it was the goal creator Kerr who was rightly mobbed by his team-mates.Not content with four, the Feathers-sponsored Pupils scored again, with # stand by # Kerr making it three assists in one match.Played in by McConnachie after some strong play in midfield by fellow substitute Michael McKinlay, Kerr set up young winger Ross Brown, who gladly tucked home goal number five with a close-range finish.With the match drawing to a close, McConnachie sealed his brace # and the Pupils’ sixth goal # with an excellent inidual effort, surging past a defender before rounding the hosts’ keeper and slotting the ball low into an unguarded net, adding gloss to an already emphatic cup win.After a great team performance, the Pupils will be hoping for more of the same tomorrowwhen they welcome a Tarbert side # who last week also defeated Dunoon # in a Kintyre derby.The match is scheduled for a pm kick off at Kintyre Park."},{"url":null,"title":"third round of tarberts golf championship","story":"Former champion Bruce MacNab held a four-shot lead going into the third round but a horror start saw the lead wiped out at the very first hole when Iain Macalister birdied and Bruce had a seven.Iain went on to birdie the second hole as well and despite the windy conditions was very much in control of his game over the first nine holes to be out in .John MacNab was also playing his normal steady game also ing , enjoying birdies at the st and th holes.After nine holes Iain had turned a four-shot deficit into a four-shot lead over Bruce and six ahead of John.Over the next four holes both Iain and John dropped four shots allowing Bruce some breathing space to claw back some of the deficit.When play was complete and all scores checked the totals after round three were as follows: Iain Macalister , Bruce MacNab , John MacNab .In the John Reid Quaich the silverware again headed south to Largieside with Duncan Johnstone retaining the trophy, shooting  nett over the two rounds.

Work is expected to start at the end of the month and should be completed by the send of September.Councillor Frank T. Spears stated that the work would not involve any long-term closure of the main roadway.The #dry bridge#, owned by Lord Margadale, has been the subject of much discussion and minor rows for the past several months. Since Western Ferries Ltd. began their sea service, heavy articulated lorries carrying malt and grain to the island#s distilleries have been unable to go under the bridge. Matters came to a head three months ago when Argyll County Council re-imposed a weight limit on the Glen road # the ersion used by the transporters to avoid the bridge.The bridge owners came quickly to the rescue and allowed the heavy traffic to use their private road at Bridgend for a three-week period, but following local protests and legal consultations the transporters were again allowed to use the Glen road.Leboat saves three on rocksThe crew of a lobster fishing boat were marooned on a partially-submerged rock for more than two hours when their vessel foundered off the north-east coast of Islay on Thursday morning.The ft #May#, owned and skippered by -year-old Mr Lachlan Clark of Port Charlotte # the veteran of several sea-dramas # struck the rocks while they were lting lobster creels.The Islay leboat was called out to rescue the skipper and his crew # Alastair MacDonald, a -year-old fisherman, and Norman Gardiner, a -year-old Colonsay doctor#s son who was making his first trip and deputising for a sick crew member.Following the rescue, the crew # who were unhurt # were landed at Port Askaig.ONE-HUNDRED YEARS AGONational Health Insurance ActA number of contraventions of the National Health Insurance Act were the subject of prosecutions in Campbeltown Sherf Court on Thursday # Sherf MacMaster Campbell on the bench.The first case was that of a Clachan merchant who was charged with neglecting to stamp the card of a female servant.Mr M. Dick, solicitor, who appeared for accused, tendered a plea of guilty, and said the observations he was about to make would apply equally to all the cases subsequently to be heard. These were the first prosecutions of the kind in this court. The Act, as his Lordship knew, was a most voluminous and complicated measure.The sherf observed that some excellent and very lucid summaries had been circulated.Mr Dick, proceeding, asked his Lordship to examine the contribution card. He would find that the part which was the very kernel of the offence was embodied in the middle of Art.  in very inconspicuous type. The employer was there required to stamp the card #not later than the time at which wages are paid# but to read that one required to hold the card at about  degrees.The sherf askedhe was to understand that this was the first occasion on which a domestic servant had been employed by accused  If not, he must have been trained in the use of this wonderful document years ago.Mr Dick said his Lordship must consider this, that in cases of this kind there were two standards of clearness. What was clear to the judicial mind might be very far from clear to the lay mind.It was a matter of common knowledge that there was a very general belief in this part of the country thatinsurance cards were stamped at the time they were run out the Act would be complied with.The card, of course, bore that the stamps must be affixed #not later than the time wages are paid#. He asked his Lordship to consider the phraseology. These cards came into the hands of many rustic employers of labour. Why should it not be stated in bold characters on the card that the stamps must be affixed at the time wages are paid In the country wages were paid sometimes by the half-year, sometimes by the month, and sometimes at irregular periods suitable to the circumstances of the worker.The cards represented not the half-year of the feeing terms, but the calendar half-year. All these circumstances contributed to the confusion of the lay mind, and encouraged the widespread impression thatthe cards were stamped at the end of the period the duty of a citizen was thereby fulfilled."},{"url":null,"title":"leader august 23 2019","story":"The Courier is honoured to deliver news to the community # during the good times and the bad.This week we were delighted to share the news that Campbeltown now boasts the #whisky bar of the year#, according to judges at the Scottish Bar and Pub Awards , who bestowed the title to the Ardshiel Hotel.Since buying the hotel more than a decade ago, Flora Grant and Marion MacKinnon have more than tripled the number of whiskies on offer, turning the hotel into something of a tourist attraction in itself.However, we also revealed that nine jobs have been lost at Campbeltown Creamery.While it is still hoped that a take-over by local farmers is the future for the site, it is terrible for the iniduals who have lost their jobs, some after many, many years.We know there is a market for Campbeltown cheese, and while the number of farms supplying the creamery has fallen over the years, there are still almost .Here#s hoping the future is bright for both Campbeltown#s whiskies and cheeses."},{"url":null,"title":"fun in the sun at first mokfest","story":"India enjoyed herself at this year#s Up The Close event, which included children#s entertainer Funky Chicken and ious fair attractions, and was made all the better by the glorious sunshine.India was joined by her mum Lynsey Mcshannon, who was able to get into the spirit of things this year having been heavily pregnant last year, and her dad Gary Anderson.This year#s Up The Close was a particular hit, with the welcome , after nearly a decade, of indie rockers a new hope "},{"url":null,"title":"more music in store for the wee toon","story":"On Wednesday, September  at .pm, well-known folksinger, entertainer and broadcaster Alastair McDonald will be in concert in Campbeltown Free Church.This will not be Alastair’s first visit to the Wee Toon.

When the corn was eventually gathered in early September, it is said decaying corpses were discovered. They had lain in the fields since August , a day of barbaric infamy in Tranentrsquos history. The dead were victims of the Tranent Massacre, and one of the bodies may have been that of Jackie Crookston or Crookstone.I say lsquomayrsquo for there is ironically so little known about this well-known woman. A statue by David Annand of Jackie on Tranent High Street shows her beating her drum with a clenched fist, defiantly leading the protest against the Militia Act. The plaque by the statue calls her a ldquoresolute woman who joined the protest, and states she was one of those killed by the cavalry.Her heroic reputation is well established in local lore. The th-century historian John Martine called her ldquoa Tranent virago. This word describes a woman of brave, fearless qualities, but it has a sting in its tail. It can also be used to mean a woman who has overstepped her mark, broken cultural rules in relation to her role as defined by gender.And by leading the protest against the Militia Act she most certainly did this.Another th-century historian and collector of traditions, P. MrsquoNeill, was clear on her role: ldquoJackie indeed was the prime mover in the whole affair, he states.We have accounts of her beating her drum and leading the protest with chants of ldquonae militia. She is said to have threatened a captain of the cavalry and declared defiantly that ldquoshe didna care a pin though she were cut in halves, she wad hae nae militia. Another account has her telling a member of the yeomanry to leave or she would ldquothraw his neck, at which he duly rode off.If these accounts are true, she was indeed resolute on that day in defending her family, her neighbours and her community. Jackie was not the only woman on the streets that day, for women took a leading role in defending their families. But she was the most prominent, it seems.The Militia Act aimed to conscript young men into a militia by means of a ballot. It was resisted for a number of reasons, but for the poverty-stricken mining and farming communities of Tranent and the surrounding area, it was seen as an imposition which would take young men of working age away and potentially cripple their families economically.There is no space here to recount the details of the massacre, but much of what happened on that day remains hidden behind a mist of cover-up and official indference.And somewhere in the bloody carnage of August , , Jackie Crookston was killed, along with many others. Yet despite her leading role, her name was not included in the original list of people killed. Eleven deaths were recorded, but no mention of Jackie. ldquoHow her death escaped recording is dficult to explain, reflected P. MrsquoNeill in his book Tranent and its Surroundings.Perhaps an explanation can be found in an eyewitness account written immediately after the massacre. It was a letter from Archibald Roger to his we in Edinburgh.It begins: ldquoDear we, this comes to acquaint you that you need not weary for my ing home, for my sister is to be buried this afternoon at four orsquoclock, and I cannot come away till I see her decently interred. I am sorry to inform you of the cruelties that were committed here yesterday there were six persons shot dead on the spot, of which my sister was onehellip the number of wounded is not yet ascertained, but I am just now informed that  dead corpses were this morning found in the corn-fields and it is not known how many more may be found when the corn is cut.Was Jackie one of those lying undiscovered in a field  It seems so by some accounts. Is that why her death was not on the list  Sandy Mullay in his book The Tranent Massacre says she was shot in the streets, but there is also a tradition which states her body was found well away from Tranent much later in a field, with stab as well as gunshot wounds.Was she initially wounded and then a victim of later retribution  Was she hunted down in an unrecorded atrocity because of her role as ring leader, and a woman who didnrsquot know her place  She will have been easy to identy because of her prominence in the protest.Her death, just like her le, is unrecorded by history. Despite her leadership in the events, she was a woman and she was poor, and history lacks interest in such characters. A tax on the registration of births and deaths at this time meant many poor people lived and died unregistered even in parish records.So who was Jackie  We know she was born in Gladsmuir in June  and was a mother. Perhaps not all her children were registered because of the tax, but it seems she had at least four surviving at the time of the massacre. She was only  when she died, but how do we imagine her le  What was behind her passion in defending her community When I spoke of her to artist Mags Nisbet-Macfarlane, she was inspired to use art to search for the woman behind the historical glimpses.ldquoI felt connected to this woman I did not know, she told me, ldquoshe will have had a le that explains her defiance that day she had so little, but was protecting what was important to her. Magsrsquo image of Jackie tells a story without the need of words.The plaque by the statue in Tranent says there were  killed in the massacre, as Jackiersquos name has been added to the original . But in truth we will never know for sure how many were really killed and maimed that day.There was no prosecution of those responsible, no investigation and no interest by those in authority to allow the truth to be told."},{"url":null,"title":"new-dunbar-area-radio-station-hunt-volunteers","story":"Sescot Radio, previously known as Dunbar On Air, is looking to take to the airwaves and have the community at the heart of its programmes.Andrew Morris, who is behind the proposals, was keen to get people involved, whether that was on air or behind the scenes.He told the Courier: ldquoFirst of all, we are an internet radio station so our catchment area is all around the world.ldquoBut, from a common sense point of view, there is no physical radio covering from East Linton and Dunbar right down the coast to Burnmouth and along to Kelso wersquove got a triangle.ldquoIrsquom keen that these little places that have got two or three cottages are just as involved.ldquoWhat we are doing is covering Eyemouth, Dunbar and Kelso but we donrsquot want to preclude these folk either.ldquoWe want to involve everybody and preclude nobody.Already, the fledgling station has been out in the community and got involved with Dunbar Civic Week earlier this summer.Mr Morris was keen to see the radio station cater to as large an audience as possible.The -year-old was previously involved with both East Coast FM in Haddington and Tranent-based East Lothian FM, which is now Radio Saltire.He told the Courier that he had interviewed a number of East Lothian councillors on air but the focus was firmly away from politics and instead looked at a number of dferent topics.That was something he was keen to consider repeating, with other shows looking at ious genres of music, as well as cooking shows.As well as music, the station would promote local good causes and encourage involvement from schools, charities, clubs and other organisations.Now, Mr Morris, who lives on Dunbarrsquos John Muir Crescent, is calling on members of the public to come forward and offer a helping hand to get the station off the ground.A meeting takes place at Hallhill Sports Centre in Dunbar on Wednesday evening.Mr Morris said: ldquoWe are progressing but a lot slower than I hoped.ldquoWe have got ious applications out for grant money and have been awarded some but we need a lot more before we think about buying the gear that we need.ldquoWe are also anxious to find some suitable premises.In-house training will be provided at the station, which will be run entirely by volunteers.The station also intends to offer work experience opportunities for those looking to find their way into a career in the media.The meeting takes place at pm, when members of the public will be updated on the stationrsquos progress."},{"url":null,"title":"up-and-coming-band-go-first-scottish-tour","story":"Johnny Brown and the Devanties, made up of frontman Johnny Brown, , Erin Ritchie, , Andrew Dobie, , and Struan Blacklock, , will be heading to Aberdeen at the start of next month on the first gig of their headline tour.Johnny told the Courier: ldquoIrsquove been singing and writing music since I was about  years old.ldquoI knew the tour manager for The View so ended up playing a few gigs with them.ldquoIrsquove played the EH festival and once I had the chance to play with Republica.ldquoIn January I reconnected with a few people I went to school with through the music scene and we decided to form the band.ldquoWersquove released one single and our next one, Streetlights, will be released after the tour.Johnny of Edinburgh Road, Cockenzie, met his fellow bandmates while at Preston Lodge High School.He said: ldquoWe had to make sure that we were able to sell out shows before we knew we could tour.ldquoWe sold out about seven gigs in a row, so thatrsquos when we thought we should give it a go.The bandrsquos first single, Brooklyn, was released just after they were first formed in January and garnered good reviews, in particular from Discover Music, Scotlandrsquos Music Blog.As to the future, Johnny said: ldquoWersquore hoping our tour and our new single will do really well, hopefully itrsquoll help us break through.

Wersquore not falling for that trick ndash no way Jose. Asking for an election was just Boris Johnson trying to use democracy to get off the hook, said Labour and the LibDems.Jeremy Corbyn may have spent the last two years demanding ldquoa General Election now, but he didnrsquot actually mean ldquonow, according to Labourrsquos Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary, Tony Lloyd, on Newsnight. He meant: ldquoonly when the Opposition parties choose it. They want to stop No Deal first by mandating the Government to ask for an extension of Article .:Brexit: Boris Johnson to seek election after Commons defeatNow, the original objection to the election, as with the prorogation, was the threat that Mr Johnson might cunningly schedule the campaign to last beyond Brexit day, on October , thus forcing the UK out when Parliament is not sitting. That would have been outrageous. But even the offer of an election on October  ndash two and a half weeks before Britain is set to leave ndash seems to be unacceptable to Labour or the Tory rebels. Or at least most of them. There were many contradictory statements yesterday, as Parliament went into meltdown.You can understand why many Labour MPs might want to delay an election. A lot of them would lose their seats for a start. Mr Corbyn is thought to be a closet Brexiter, so maybe he doesnrsquot want to risk the possibility that Labour might actually win, leaving him with the poisoned chalice of Brexit.All Opposition MPs relish the prospect of Mr Johnson, who said he would leave the EU on October  ldquodo or die, being forced to go cap in hand to Brussels to ask for yet another extension to Article , as ordered by the Extension Bill. Butthe Tory rebels stay strong today, and the bill becomes law, could Parliament really order the Prime Minister to do something he has repeatedly promised not to do Outside Downing Street on Monday, Mr Johnson said there were ldquono circumstances in which he would ask Brussels for a delay. But it would be the law of the land, chorus MPs and commentators. He would just have to do what hersquos told by Parliament. But it isnrsquot quite as easy as that. You can take the PM to water, but can you make him drink He could refuse to give the Extension Bill what is called ldquoQueenrsquos Consent, because it interferes with royal prerogative ndash the right of governments to conduct foreign affairs, and sign treaties. This has been used by Prime Ministers before, Labour included.The similar Cooper-Letwin Bill, last March, didnrsquot require Queenrsquos Consent because Theresa May accepted it. Indeed, she went ahead and requested the extension of Article  before the bill had finished going through Parliament. She wanted an extension to avoid no deal. Mr Johnson doesnrsquot, so he could refuse to let it become law.Alternatively, he might just note the Extension Act, and then noty Brussels that,the EU  agree to an extension, he will not cooperate. He could just empty-chair the whole process, as he did the TV debates during his leadership election. Or he could attach unacceptable conditions over budget contributions. The European Union does not negotiate with inidual MPs or with parliaments ndash it negotiates with the governments of member states. Would the  EU countries agree to extend British membership under such a recalcitrant, delinquent PM Mr Johnson would argue that the constitution is on his side. If the Commons keeps him in office, and by not supporting a confidence motion, it would be reaffirming him as the Prime Minister, then he has to act according to Government policies. This would be an absurd situation of course. A demeaning spectacle.:What the papers say about Boris Johnson and BrexitIn times past, when a PM lost on a key plank of government policy, he or she would simply resign and call an election. This was what James Callaghan did after he was defeated in . But because of the Fixed Term Parliament Act ndash passed by the Cameron coalition in  without thinking through the consequences ndash the Prime Minister cannot actually call an election. Mr Johnson has to win a two-thirds majority in the Commons.Labour appears to be saying that it would vote to keep him, pro tem. It wants the Extension Bill to be law before there is an election, to prevent Britain crashing out of the EU at the end of October. But the idea of a Prime Minister being forced to act, as it were, by an alternative government based in Parliament, is not something our constitution can handle. The Westminster system is based on the assumption thata government has no majority for its actions, it ceases to be it is a dead parrot. The Fixed Term Act allows the Opposition parties effectively to hold the Prime Minister hostage.The matter will probably end up in the courts. Remain groups already have their legal teams working against the prorogation and will roll that into an action claiming that the government is acting unlawfully. Willy nilly, democracy is moving from Parliament to the judges benches. Irsquom not sure this is a good thing.Whatever happens this week, there will have to be an election soon. It could destroy both the main parties.

Conservative MPs are crossing the floor, like Phillip Lee, or leaving like Justine Greening.:Andrew McKie: Contradictions at heart of SNPs Brexit election strategyLabour isnrsquot in much better shape. It is hopelessly confused over Brexit, still apparently committed to negotiating another deal with Brussels before putting it to a referendum.

In part, this could be because her fiction is risky, challenging, sometimes riotously funny, but as often sizzling with rage. Her titles include Man or Mango , Dot in the Universe, and Mimi, savage satires on gender politics which are nevertheless also filled with tenderness and optimism. Her fondness for emphasising words in capital letters or italics has irked some critics, who prefer the page to look ordered and calm. But since when was fiction a form of beta blocker  With Ellmann, you feel yoursquove had an injection of adrenaline, quickening your heartbeat and bringing the world alive.Compared with her other novels, Ducks, Newburyport takes something of a new turn. As always, a woman is at its heart, but in this instance, instead of a slim work, it is big: just shy of , pages. Told by an Ohio housewe, who bakes her way through the tale, it is a stream-of-consciousness portrait of modern-day America, in all its confusion, consumerism, and cupidity. A y glossary of abbreviations is appended, ranging from Ato ZPGby way of IHPand WMD . You get the picture.Theof the story is ambitious enough, but asshe needed something more to spur her on, Ellmann has written the entire book ndash barring the opening passage ndash in a single sentence. Does this sound intimidating  Probably. Or make the book hard to read  Not at all. It is like stumbling on an oasis in a desert, a refreshing, invigorating, restorative immersion in a piece of remarkable, thoughtful and truly innovative fiction. Too many headline-grabbing novels are dull and predictable, enervating rather than enjoyable, derivative when they should be daring. Such tedious stuff makes you forget that the original meaning of the word novel was something dferent, unique, and new.Thankfully the Booker  has recognised a work of exceptional talent. Its presence on the shortlist adds lustre to a prize that has been dogged over the years by accusations of mediocrity and popularism, charges that last yearrsquos winner, Milkman by Anna Burns, helped to refute. Ellmannrsquos fellow shortlistees are prestigious, including Margaret Atwood and Salman Rushdie, both of whom have won before, along with El Shafak, second only to Orhan Pamuk in Turkey for international acclaim, British writer Bernadine Eisto, and the Nigerian Chigozie Obioma, shortlisted for his second novel, as he was with his first.The competition is stf, but already statistics are being trotted out: were it to win, Ducks, Newburyport would be the longest to prevail in the historyrsquos prize, beating even Eleanor Cattonrsquos doorstopper, The Luminaries, by more than  pages. Apart from their size, however, these two novels are poles apart. There is nothing conventional about Ducks, Newburyport. Indeed, Ellmannrsquos literary credentials can be traced back to James Joyce, the exemplar of stream of consciousness, where the reader has to surrender themselves to the flow, trusting the author to keep their head above water until they reach their destination. In the fluidity of Ellmannrsquos prose therersquos an echo of Henry James, with his sharp and self-conscious interrogation of America. Therersquos a nod to Virginia Woolf too, but Ellmannrsquos wit and acerbity, her scorching political lens, are all her own.The direction her style has taken is perhaps no surprise. Ellmannrsquos late father Richard was a world-renowned expert on Oscar Wilde and Yeats, but above all on James Joyce. His biography of the myopic Dublin genius has never been surpassed, remaining one of the most acclaimed literary biographies of the last century. The linguistic poetry and emotional range of Joyce, who must have been an invisible but constant presence in the Ellmann household, seems to have got under his daughterrsquos skin at a formative age.The announcement of the Booker Prize next month, on October , will mark  years to the day since its only Scottish winner, James Kelman, took the prize in  with How Late It Was, How Late. This was a highly contentious choice, not just because of its interior monologue narration, but also its liberal use of the F-word, which horried one uptight judge. The controversy it sparked has never been forgotten. These days, though, you canrsquot help thinking the title sounds like a lament for the lapse of time between Kelmanrsquos success and that of anyone  living north of the Border.There is no doubting Kelmanrsquos status as one of our finest novelists. Along with Alasdair Gray, he is an obvious contender for a Nobel Prize, though the chances of that idiosyncratic telescopersquos lens turning in this direction seem slim. Unlike many others, winning the Booker did not make Kelman rich or famous. It did, however, raise his profile internationally, and set a benchmark for those keen to add something memorable to the literary cairn.Ducks, Newburyport certainly does that. Other than in their tireless search for a mesmerising and distinctive way of expressing themselves, at first glance there is little obvious common ground between this pair. It is only when you read their books and recognise their seemingly effortless brilliance that you realise how similar, and rare, they are.In the acknowledgements at the end of Ducks, Newburyport, Ellmann thanks ldquoEdinburgh City Council for my Saltire card, a dandy aid to the impecunious. Itrsquos a cheerful reminder that unless yoursquore a bestseller, the literary le is not deluxe. Yet listening to the naturalness of her narratorrsquos voice, and the stories she tells, makes you grateful that the writerrsquos feet are firmly on the ground, be it a New Town pavement, No.  bus, or mid-west America, where the future is unfolding fast."},{"url":null,"title":"TV REVIEW  Big Yin takes Manhattan  and the Pilgrim Fathers get a kicking too","story":"ITV, pmOVER the quarter century Billy Connolly has been travelling the world for television the viewer has become accustomed to some astonishing scenes.

Polling this week by You Gov suggests that the Scottish Tories could lose nearly a third of their votes and up to  of their  hard-won Westminster seats when the much-discussed General Election finally comes around.:Boris Johnson suffers devastating blow as brother Jo quitsBut the picture in Scotland is the reverse of what is happening UK-wide, where Boris Johnsonrsquos poll ratings have risen steadily since July. He may be polling only  per cent of the vote but Nigel Farage is open to an electoral pact. With that in place, then thanks to the hopelessly unrepresentative Westminster voting system, Mr Johnson could well win a thumping majority on well below  per cent of the popular vote.This might be fabulous news for the SNP, since Mr Johnson is the most effective recruiting sergeant theyrsquove ever had Sturgeon speeches could not, by pushing support for independence above  per cent.But for the wider rebel alliance seeking to prevent a hard Brexit, it is very challenging indeed. A Johnson win would undo all the unprecedented cross-party effort that has gone into trying to block a no-deal Brexit.The timing of an election has been much discussed, with Opposition parties more or less agreeing that they cannot allow a poll to take place before Boris Johnson has been forced to delay Brexit.But even , prior to the election, Mr Johnson had bowed to the demands of the Extension Bill and asked Brussels for a delay to Brexit , once elected he would most likely steer the country towards no-deal at the end of January instead of October.Of course he might be able to use those three months to negotiate a deal with the EU, but in spite of the Government spin suggesting that a deal is imminent, therersquos been precious little progress so far. Like a lazy child who insists hersquos nearly finished his homework when it lies untouched in his schoolbag, Mr Johnson has come up with nothing concrete yet to replace the Irish backstop, according to the EU, which is still waiting.So what can be done to prevent a hard Brexit  Mr Johnson must be kept out of Downing Street ndash which means Opposition parties forming an electoral pact.:Ian McConnell: No escape from Johnsonrsquos dire Brexit farce in Paris metro and airportNow, Irsquom not saying this will be easy. How, one wonders, do you sit down over tea and biscuits with a bunch of folk yoursquove been loudly slagging off for years  Is it like a school mediation session Perhaps they all have to write down something nice about each other and read it out loud.Itrsquos not easy for politicians of opposing parties to work together, but theyrsquove done it over the Extension Bill, and now they need to do it with the election. The latest poll shows Labour on  per cent, the Lib Dems on  per cent and the Greens on five per cent, UK-wide. Add in a strong showing for the SNP and Plaid Cymru, and an anti-no deal majority is possible ndash but onlythe pro-Remain parties are prepared to work in concert.They did it in the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, where the Greens and Plaid Cymru graciously stood aside to help the frontrunner Lib Dems win. Now the Lib Dems, Labour and the SNP must consider similar action.What are the other options  Try to force through a referendum bill  There wasnrsquot enough support for adding a referendum provision to the Extension Bill, so that looks unlikely. Get the Extension Bill through, then hold a no-confidence vote in Mr Johnson in order to create a government of national unity to seek a new deal on dferent terms which could then be put to a referendum  This is an appealing prospect andpoliticians were characters in a childrenrsquos TV drama, then we could trust them to come together like this ldquoin the national interest , but again, it would require trust across tribal lines and a willingness to suffer the brickbats such an arrangement would inevitably trigger. Jo Swinson has said Jeremy Corbyn could not lead such a government, since few Tories would back him, and she may be right, but thatrsquos not to say a compromise candidate couldnrsquot be found.An election, however, remains the most obvious way out of the impasse, so the Opposition parties must be ready.It has felt at times in the past few days asthe plot of a Simon Pegg movie is unfolding at Westminster, one where a crazy sect of androids has taken over the government and is ejecting respectable Tory pensioners onto College Green in the rain, dropping the torn fragments of their Conservative Party membership cards at their feet. The fightback is surely imminent: Irsquom sure wersquod all like to see what Nicholas Soames can do with the parliamentary mace.But in the absence of a septuagenarian revolt, wersquoll have an election to try and put right this mess.

The event will be live streamed to four regional hubs ndash in Stornoway, Lerwick, Lochgilphead, and Aberdeen ndash where women can take part remotely.Scottish Parliament deputy presiding officer, Linda Fabiani MSP, will be chairing  discussions.She said: ldquoHaving women in elected politics at all levels matters. The Parliament recognises this, and we are delighted to welcome Scotlandrsquos Women Stand into our chamber. There is just such a buzz to see all these women in the chamber.ldquoWomen, particularly younger women, are much more reticent about coming forward as potential elected members than young men are. And older women too, they think lsquomy time has passed for thatrsquo.ldquoIrsquom hoping the women will see that they can put themselves forward for elected positions. I want them to recognise that their voice is very, very valid, and so useful, because women make a big dference in all these dferent legislatures and organisations.For three years, Lee Chalmers, the founder and director of the Parliament Project, has been running workshops to help women who are interested in getting involved. She believes politics is not easily accessible, and this puts women off.She said: ldquoItrsquos not easy to find information about how to join a party, or a what party does, what campaigning means. Itrsquos a bit of a mystery.Ms Chalmers also explains that women often think that they are not good enough to enter politics, and that they do not have the skills to do so ndash a myth that female Scottish parliamentarians are eager to debunk.Minister for Older People and Equalities, Christina McKelvie MSP, who will be speaking at the event, said: ldquoI want women to realise, thatI can do it, then you can do it too. Women have the skills and talent to do it, they just need the confidence ndash because they are definitely as good as anybody .Alison Johnstone MSP, who will be part of the , agrees.She said: ldquoI didnrsquot study politics, I didnrsquot have a political background. I got involved when I was in my thirties, so I feel thatI can get involved, and become a member of the Scottish Parliament, then socan you.There are still barriers, however, that make a political career more dficult for women, for example for those with a family. Ms McKelvie said: ldquoIt is very dficult for parents ndash I was supported by members of my family, but going back to work was, like for any parent, very dficult. But itrsquos worth making it work,you want to change the world.Ms Johnstone believes there is now the support to make things possible for mothers. She said: ldquoThe Prime Minister of New Zealand is demonstrating that it is possible for women with young families to play an incredibly important part in their national development. In Scotland, my party is doing a lot to help ndash we have a co-convener system for example.Ms Chalmers believes there is a prejudice in society that needs to be overcome: ldquoThe conversation has to move away from from seeing women as mothers first.Misogynistic abuse on social media can also be daunting. Ms Johnstone said: ldquoIn my experience, where I have had to contact the police, which thankfully has been rare, the abuse I received has been notably gendered abuse. These are comments that would not have been sent to a man.Over the years, the share of female MSPs has not improved ndash it peaked in  at .%, a level not equalled since.Ms Johnstone said: ldquoThere is a long way to go, but I do feel we are talking about these things a lot more than we were twenty years ago.

Either stay in or leave with no deal. The decision should then be implemented and the following election can be around the manestos of each of the parties without the toxic issue of leaving or staying in the EU.Bill Eadie,Gfnock.I MAY be being incredibly naive, but I can only see one way to start to mend the deep isions throughout the United Kingdom. Surely the only course of action is to call a second referendum on EU membership A second referendum must not be advisory but binding so we avoid the verbal gymnastics as practised by John Redwood MP when he tried to suggest that the  referendum was binding when it was clearly advisory. It should be made very clear to all voters the implications of each option. If Leave then the inevitable result is leaving the EU on a specied date irrespective of whether there is a deal in place or not. If Remain, then Article  will be withdrawn and we stay in the EU.In these circumstances voters cannot claim that they have been duped or did not realise the effects of their vote. One dficulty is deciding who will provide information to voters and who will police the mechanics of the referendum. Given the breaches of election law perpetrated by the Leave campaign and the willingness of the Prime Minister to destroy democracy by any means gives rise to the assumption that an independent body oversee the process verying documentation before issue.If we genuinely want the will of the people this is the only solution and those who oppose this course of action, we must assume believe they cannot achieve their goal without chicanery.David Stubley,Prestwick.GORDON Bannatyneis absolutely on target with his analysis of our present situation with regard to leaving the EU.First, Theresa Mayrsquos negotiating team was not forthright enough in making it abundantly clear that the UK, implementing the result of a referendum, was leaving the EU, and it was only a matter of discussing how ndash deal or no deal preferably a deal, but being prepared to walk away with no deal Boris Johnsonrsquos sensible position, albeit, stupidly derided by delusional Remainers who actually seem to imagine that they can somehow negotiate an equitable deal with No Deal off the table ndash sheer lunacy from people who do not live on this planet.Secondly, the EU certainly is petried thatone member leaves, this could be the start of others deciding to do so.Thirdly, Remainers do indeed seem to be subscribing to a form of democracy whereby they only move towards implementing decisions that they agree with we can see this bias in Remainersrsquo calls for a second EU referendum in the hope that their preferred option would carry the dayhowever, this conveniently ignores the question thrown-up by the logic ndash eventhey were to get a Remain vote ndash of a third or fourth referendum: this is delusional nonsense which would condemn any government to a permanent state of doing nothing.Of course, with their present dither-and-delay concerning the EU issue, we can all see that this is what many Remainers are extremely good at ndash doing nothing.To whom it may concern: note this and vote accordingly at a next election.Philip Adams,Crosslee.I READ Gordon Bannatynersquos anti-EU diatribe with sadness. He seems to have swallowed the Brexit pill whole. I presume that he is a fan of our current Prime Minister and his gang of dubious, disingenuous gang of truth-distorters.He asks how we managed before we joined the EU and answers his own question with \"perfectly well\". But that could, indeed, apply to any other EU nation before it joined. He misses the point that political and economic unity is the strength of the EU when dealing with large power blocs where in the world. Thatrsquos why nations join in order to achieve a better status than before.The UK is the one and only nation trying to leave. The rest have the common sense to avoid such arrogant inidualism, the embodiment of which we saw in the contemptuous, reclining posture of Jacob Rees-Mogg in the Commons recently.Mr Bannatyne claims that those who want to avert No Deal are \"scaremongering\". I presume, then, that he is happy to ignore those people who may be dependent on a regular supply of medication, business supply chains and the many vulnerable iniduals who do not have the ability to cope with prices increases.We have already been warned by the British Retail Federation and the Road Haulage Association and others that we are in for a hard time.

The society now also delivers animal welfare educational programmes, reaching more than , children in .So it’s fair to say that it has come a long way in the last  years.But for all the successes, there are also new issues it has to face – not least thanks to the advent of the internet.Mike explained: “For years, we have looked after all of Scotland’s animals – wild, farm and domestic.“Farming has come on leaps and bounds in the last few decades and we now have very few problems in the industry.“When I was a kid growing up, you used to have pet shops selling cats, dogs, budgies and the like.“Now, thanks to the internet, people have far more exotic animals in their care which all of our inspectors need to know how to care for and handle – from bearded dragons to massive boa constrictors!“We also have to contend with puppy farmers plying their trade online and selling puppies from car boots.“Some of the puppies die within a few days of people buying them, having paid a lot of money for the animal and thousands on vet fees.“Sadly, we also still see things that I saw  years ago such as Dobermans with every rib on their body sticking out.“However, thanks to our education programme, we are reaching the children of today who will be the animal lovers of the future.“And the majority of people our inspectors visit are not harming animals for fun – it’s a case of ignorance and neglect. In those cases, we’re not just helping the animals, but humans too.“Only five to ten per cent of cases every year are intentional cruelty. So Scotland is still a nation which, in the main, loves and cares for its animals.”That care and concern shines through as the public helps fund the SSPCA’s £ million budget annually.That covers the cost of  employees, including  inspectors,  ambulance drivers and the -strong team based at its nine centres across Scotland and its widle sanctuary.The society receives no government funding and relies solely on the public to fund its work.Mike added: “We are really lucky that, from a population of five and a half million, only  people were prosecuted last year for animal cruelty.“We will never be out of a job but the vast majority of people in Scotland are law abiding and animal loving.“And we couldn’t do what we do without their support.”In December, the Society plans to launch celebrations to commemorate the th anniversary that will run throughout .Anyone with interesting anecdotes or memorabilia they’d like to share should get in touch via its website or by emailing .years@scottishspca.org.The SSPCA is the only animal charity in the UK able to report animal cruelty cases to the Crown, with reports sent to the Procurator Fiscal Service. The charity receives no government funding and relies on donations and grants to continue its work, which costs £ million each year.In , it found homes for  rescued animals, helped more than  wildle casualties and spoke to more than , children.For every pound it receives, p is spent on animal welfare, p on fundraising and promotion and p on administration.So you can rest assured that the bulk of any donation you make will make a huge dference to the animals in the SSPCA’s care.Last year, its animal helpline received almost a quarter of a million calls, the inspectorate attended more than , incidents and more than , animals were cared for across its nine rescue and rehoming centres and at the national wildle rescue centre.

Yet it is also one of the worldrsquos poorest countries, with % of its . million people living on less than two US dollars a day.Environmental groups and Transparency International have long highlighted the illegal logging of Madagascarrsquos rosewood forests and other endangered tree species as evidence of the rampant corruption that has made multimillionaires out of a few ldquorosewood barons who have plundered the islandrsquos northeastern forests.ldquoYour lovely island of Madagascar is rich in plant and animal bioersity, yet this treasure is especially threatened by excessive deforestation, from which some profit, Francis said. He cited forest fires, poaching and the ldquounrestricted cutting down of valuable woodlands as particular threats.More so than any pope before him, Francis has made environmental concerns a pillar of his papacy, linking global warming to the persistent exploitation of the worldrsquos poor by the wealthy. He has issued an entire encyclical on the need to care for Godrsquos creation and next month will preside over a meeting of bishops from the Amazon, where an outbreak of rainforest fires have once again focused international attention on the need to preserve what he calls the ldquolungs of the planet.Francis has also frequently called attention to the devastation wrought on the poor by corruption, often calling public officials to account on his foreign trips.Transparency International, which ranks Madagascar among the most corrupt countries, has accused local public officials of complicity or negligence in the illegal logging, mining of gold and sapphires and the poaching of tortoises, turtles and exportation of lemurs.In his speech, Francis urged Mr Rajoelina, who came to power on a campaign to fight corruption, to make good on his pledges.ldquoI would encourage you to fight with strength and determination against all endemic forms of corruption and speculation that increase social disparity, and to confront the situations of great instability and exclusion that always create conditions of inhumane poverty, he said.Francis, the worldrsquos first pope from the global south, acknowledged that some of the islandrsquos poor have no choice but to cut down forests to find soil or extract minerals in illegal ways that damage the environment.ldquoSo it is important to create jobs and activities that generate income, while protecting the environment and helping people to emerge from poverty, he said.copy -.

The judges have a hard task ahead of them.The quality of the albums featured reflects the strength and breadth of the Scottish music industry it is home to creativity that for decades has produced globally recognised artists. Its cultural importance is matched by its economic importance, and it is only right that we take this opportunity to recognise not just those competing for the SAY Award, but all of those that work for and support Scottish music.: Shortlist for  Scottish Album of the Year revealedFor unlimited access to Scotland’s best news, sport and expert analysis, SUBSCRIBE to The Scotsman website hereAccording to the most recent report from Creative Scotland, the music industry employs over , people in nearly  businesses. This accounts for almost  per cent of the country’s creative and cultural employment. The Scottish public also shows a marked commitment to music consumer spending on recorded music is above the UK average, and the country accounts for a greater share of the UK’s live music revenue than its population suggests it should. In the SSE Hydro, Scotland also has the fourth most popular live music arena in the world.This passion and the music it creates deserves support. As the UK’s licensing company for more than , performers and record companies, PPL works to offer this by ensuring that those who perform on or own the rights to a recording receive the royalties they are due when it is played on TV, radio or in public.We have more than , members in Scotland, a membership which includes artists releasing their first demos session musicians, orchestral performers, independent record labels, and renowned festival headliners. We are here to support those artists and record labels from the very start of their career all the way through to their highest heights.This is especially important in Scotland, where  per cent of music businesses have a turnover of under £ million and  per cent have fewer than  employees. These are enterprises that are embedded within and contributing to their local communities. Each source of income for these businesses can be crucial to their success. The SAY Award is an ideal time to champion and support these companies and the contribution they make to the pipeline of Scottish talent.We are proud to help remunerate and nurture this new music. Along with our friends at PRS for Music, we have provided funding via PRS Foundation to help many Scottish artists develop their career. Every SAY Award shortlist since it began in  has featured at least one PRS Foundation-supported performer or band, and more than ten Scottish artists so far in  have received financial support to play shows internationally, produce music and market their releases.

The High Street is also set to be closed to traffic between North Bridge and St Marys Street.And the strategy includes proposals for \"reallocation of traffic lanes\" on a host of streets including Cowgate, the Bridges corridor, Lothian Road, St Andrew Square and Princes Street to improve provision for buses, cyclists and pedestrians.There would be a widened pedestrian priority zone and a more joined-up cycling network.And a \"hopper\" bus operating around the city centre will be trialled as a step towards the councils long-term aim of having more buses routed to but not through the central area.Proposals for a city centre tram \"spur link\" to join up a networkthe line is extended north to south in the future has not officially been included in the proposals, but space has been leftplans are progressed.The councils final strategy for the Edinburgh City Centre Transformation has been published after around  per cent of the public backed the vision in the second round of public consultation. It will be discussed by the authoritys transport and environment committee on Thursday next week.The first phase of the ambitious project, to take place over the next five years, includes closure of Waverley Bridge in conjunction with Network Rails Waverley Masterplan, ambitious cycling infrastructure projects, the trial of the city centre public hopper bus and car-free streets in the Old Town. But more than £m will need to be found for the final phase of the strategy, which includes creating a tree-lined bouled on Lothian Road, integrated public transport ticketing and timetabling and a new cycling and walking bridge linking Old Town and New Town.Officials say that the project could potentially generate £m of \"quantiable benefits\" based on £.m of investment.Project director Daisy Narayanan said there has been a \"head in the stars, feet on the ground approach\" to the vision.She added: \"Phase one of the project we have funding for already, phase two is feasibility studies which we are hoping to have about £.m for and phase three is £m capital and £m of revenue - its a very cautious figure. Its making sure the delivery plan is rooted in reality and we can deliver it.\"If and when tram line three happens, the business case should include the spur line. As a city centre, we think that spur is necessary. Its not part of the costs, buttheres a tram line three, it is future-proofing the city centre.\"The council aims to provide \"a cohesive network of pedestrian priority and car-free streets connecting Waverley with key areas of the Old Town\". Footpaths will be widened on key pedestrian routes - with traffic lanes removed to make way. A pedestrian priority zone would be created in the city centre \"where people have priority and vehicles are guests\".The strategy also points to a \"reduced volume of buses crossing the city centre without a loss in the routes served\" - while bus journeys will be speeded up \"through signal prioritisation and bus-stop rationalisation\".The plans are likely to be welcomed by many, including environmental campaigners, but others may be concerned about aspects of the proposals, including the impact on bus services.: Edinburgh : \"This is le affirming stuff....\" What you had to say about radical new city centre plansTransport and environment convener, Cllr Lesley Macinnes, said: \"This is broadly what we think we will be doing across  years.

The extended hours are due to roll out in Cunningsburgh after the October break. In the meantime, children have already enjoyed their first week in the refurbished setting.It follows a somewhat lacklustre report at Cunningsburgh last year, which classed early learning and childcare as no more than #satisfactory#, with improvements required.Quality improvement officer for early learning and childcare, Samantha Flaws, said the redevelopment was #fabulous#, and added staff had really grasped the nettle.#What struck me about here is that the practitioners have been on a real journey, and have all researched what good early level pedagogy is.#They#ve set up an environment that really supports that. Every space has been thought through about how the children can learn from it.#Pointing to a small workbench, she said the use of real tools in a play environment gave youngsters a lesson in risk assessment.#The idea is we no longer just replicate things in plastic, because we have to teach children about risk and about dangers.#The nursery#s early learning and childcare support worker, Tracey Malcolmson, said staff wanted to adopt an ambitious approach to improving the nursery after last year#s inspection.#We wanted a curiosity approach that would allow children to come in and explore everything,# she said.#It was very much adult-led before our HMI inspection. After that it changed. You could change it bit by bit, but we just decided #no, we#re going to go all guns blazing# and did it all at once.#They#re due to come back in November. She#ll not recognise the place.#Senior practitioner Rachel Hewitt said thanks was due to staff at Hayfield for giving staff the freedom to make the changes necessary.#We just said, #we have a vision#, and we showed them one or two things – ideas that we were thinking of – and they really have just let us go with what we wanted.#The vision was to make the setting a warm, cosy loving atmosphere for children to be able to come and learn, and I feel that we#ve achieved that.

This would be completed over the next two or three months, he said.On the issue of smell, the two sources are from the -metre chimney and from the hatches of the fish meal boats. The former was cleaned out last week after contaminants were discovered inside the base of the stack, said Mr Jonermark, and the amount of bacteria used to pury the air in a filter chamber has been increased. Highland Council would be approached to seethey would agree to a -metre extension to the height of the chimney.As far as the feed boats are concerned, Mr Nilsson said the problem arises when the hatches are opened so that the fish meal can be delivered to the plant. This will occur for about  hours per year, he said, and the firm is currently working on a solution to that.Mr Jonermark added: #We do not want this to be a problem for anyone. We do not want this situation to continue.#We want to make a positive contribution to the village and we will continue to invest to make sure the problems go away.

But this week the #Peatbogs# will be back on home turf to showcase their energetic brand of traditional-inspired electronica as part of this year#s Skye Live Festival.The rare Skye gig will mark the start of another autumn tour for the six-piece group, for whom constant re-invention has proved key to longevity spanning almost three decades.The sound that#ll boom out in the tent high above Portree Harbour this Saturday will be far removed from the group#s roots as a folk band playing in local pubs. But the Peatbogs, like more recent successors such as Niteworks, are a reminder that a grounding in traditional music is no barrier to a letime of instrumental experimentation.Le for the Peatbog Faeries began with a gig in Edinbane Lodge in the spring of . Peter Morrison and bass player Innes Hutton from Braes # the two constants in the line-up # were joined by Davie Tait, Ali Pentland and Alan Edmunds.Pubs and village hall dances became their early staple, but gradually more adventurous elements crept into their set and the audiences lapped it up.Morrison recalled: #We#d bring in a blues or a reggae sound, and we found it was these things that started to go down best with audiences.#We moved to more of a world music sound around about , but we never expected much to come of it. We were just out to play at pubs and parties and have a bit of fun#.Their first tape # the #Great Ceilidh Swindle# # sold well locally and paid for a demo in Edinburgh, which in turn caught the ear of Greentrax Records, the specialist label in Scottish traditional music.With bands like Shooglenty and Martyn Bennett also arriving on the scene it proved a perfect time to be breaking new ground and the Peatbog Faeries# debut album #Mellowsity# would stay in Greentrax#s top ten for the next decade-and-a-half.Morrison remembers: #Because of our size and sound, bands like us and Shooglenty cost a lot more to record than other folk bands at the time. So there was a worry at the start.#But as soon as we signed to Greentrax, we quite quickly got an agent and we got sought-after slots at Glastonbury, Nomad and Celtic Connections.#We didn#t really notice what was happening, in a way # it felt like one day we were playing in the pub, the next day playing in front of thousands.#There weren#t that many precedents for bands like ours. Most folk bands just played in pubs. There were some accordion bands that were full-time or groups like #Silly Wizard#, but for us coming out of Skye we never thought it would turn into a full-time occupation.#We just went with the flow and luckily for us it proved a lot more popular than we thought it would be.#The band#s line-up has changed several times, and in turn, each addition helped explore new sounds # the most dramatic sht coming when Rick Taylor and Nigel Hitchcock arrived on Skye in the s to add a three-piece brass section.Taylor # who passed away earlier this year # was a revered musician who had toured with Elton John, while in recent years the Peatbog#s fiddler Peter Tickell left the group to take to the road with Sting.The current scaled-back line-up has seen Morrison and Hutton joined by Edinburgh-based Tom Salter on guitar keyboard player Graeme Stafford from Ardnamurchan drummer Stu Haikney and Shetlander Ross Couper on fiddle.For Peter Morrison, the global tours, the record deals and the Glastonbury stage all owe their origins to the chance he got to learn the chanter in the long-since closed Vatten Bridge primary school.He explains: #Every year Norman MacLeod # the teacher#s husband # and John Laing used to pipe us all in to the Christmas Party, so that was where I first heard the pipes.#Every pupil got the chance of learning the chanter at school, and I think nine of us started playing. It was either that or an hour of maths.#I think I was the only one who carried on into secondary school, but I got the bug. I didn#t like the competing part, but I enjoyed listening to the pipes and learning to play them.#My pal Donnie MacAskill from Roag also played the accordion, so I learned to play drums along with him and from about the age of  I was always in bands.#Morrison#s early piping tutor was Cameron MacFadyen, and he received additional help from Nicol Campbell # another well-known local piper and character from Dunvegan, whose memory has been honoured across the globe.Morrison added: #When he passed away Nicol left me his kilt, which has since been worn on stages in Japan, Africa and America.#A joiner to trade, who also worked for aperiod as a hotelier in Dunvegan, Peter Morrison has seen attitudes to traditional music change over the years, and with it opportunities flourish.He still lives in Roag with we Johan and grown-up kids Jenny and Calum, and it#s no surprise to hear him promote the virtues of free access to music tuition in local schools.He continues to be #amazed# at some of the local talent learning traditional instruments, some of whom he can be heard playing alongside at regular music sessions laid on in the Edinbane Inn and the Old Inn in Carbost.#It#s changed a lot since when I was a youngster whenyou wanted to learn music the only real opportunity was the pipes,# he recalled.#Things like the fis movement have been really helpful in creating opportunities. There now seems to be a constant stream of really good young musicians coming out of Skye.#When I started you would never have thought of making a career out of it, but now with some of these youngsters, it seems to be the only thing they think about. #A lot of these kids are now at a standard that in previous years only a handful of people in Scotland were achieving.#In Skye you have the likes of Daimh, Niteworks, Bridghe Campbell # the list goes on and on. #At these regular sessions there are some great young local players going along like Anna Scott, Dugald McKiggan, Archie and Isobel Maclean and Malin Lewis.#Morrison continued: #Recently over in LorientI saw a great act. It was a Sikh beatboxer, accompanied by step-dancer Sophie Stevenson along with Catherine Tinney from Portree singing puirt-a-beul.#This was another Skye person on the international stage, singing to an incredible standard, but she was someone I#d never heard sing before. #In the past, going somewhere like Lorient,there was a person from Skye on stage you would know exactly who it was # they would be an established name. Now you can go somewhere like that and get a surprise.#It shows the strength in depth there is now.#Some of that west-coast musical talent will be showcased at Skye Live this weekend among a ied line-up that will also include some of the country#s top nightclub DJs.Morrison urged the local community to rally behind the festival weekend, which this year starts with a Thursday-night concert to the Waterboys.He added: #We played at the very first Skye Live five years ago and are looking forward to getting on stage at the Lump in Portree again.#It#s an iconic setting, but organisers have kept the festival to a level that is comfortable for the place.#A capacity of , people is about a fth of the population of Skye and is manageable. When you start to go into the tens of thousands it brings pressures, and it#s a risk to go too big without the infrastructure to support it.#Whenever anyone organises a festival there will always be people who might want to pick holes in it or knock it in some way.#But people need to remember that these guys are putting on a  for so many types of music.#It#s something people of all ages can go to and hear some of the best music in Scotland in Portree. I would hope local people can support it in any way they can.#The Skye Live festival runs from Thursday th until Saturday th September.

On Friday , Mrs Steenson received a call informing her that no bus was available due and mix-up between the EA and the transport provider. Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Mrs Steenson said she had “issue after issue” during the summer months due to their errors.“My experience of it is that the Education Authority has a lot of people off sick, they are understaffed and there is a lot of pressure, and there just isn’t enough transport places available for the kids that need them. There are children being let down, and for us personally, it’s just not doable. We both work, and it’s an hour-and-a-half to get down to Fleming and back up again, so to do that while working and bringing our other child to school is impossible.”She continued: “This week we have been very lucky that my work has been flexible and allowed me to take some times, but that’s not sustainable. I hope that her transport can get organised very very quickly so that she can go to school. We have prepared her for going on the bus or getting in a taxi and she’s wondering why it’s not happening – it’s confusing for her.”She added: “I don’t know what we’re going to do. It’ll be very stressful. There’ll probably be days where she can’t make it in because we can’t get transport. I might have to take more time off or my husband might have to.”Despite complaints from parents, the Education Authority has said there has been no reduction to transport services.A spokesperson for the Education Authority , said: “EA provides transport assistance to over , children every day, including , children with Statement of Special Educational Need.“We remain committed to ensuring that all necessary arrangements are in place ahead of the new school year.“In this case, EA’s transport service provision has been maintained and there has been no reduction to services at either school. Where parents are experiencing any issue with their child’s school transport we would encourage and advise them to call their local school transport office, which can be accessed by calling the EA Transport enquiries line   .”"},{"url":null,"title":"sign up for our weekly brexit newsletter","story":"Your browser is outdated, it may not render this page properly, please upgrade.Select any of your favourite newsletters and get them delivered straight to your inbox||||Main Area|Daily News Headlines - checkbox|Pos[:]|\"type\"checkbox\" name\"newsletters\" id\"f-newsletters-BT_DailyNews\" value\"BT:DailyNews\" class\"tick-a\"  Daily News Headlines Daily News from belfasttelegraphPreview Subscribe||||Main Area|Weekly Business Digest - checkbox|Pos[:]|\"type\"checkbox\" name\"newsletters\" id\"f-newsletters-BT_WeeklyBusiness\" value\"BT:WeeklyBusiness\" class\"tick-a\"  Weekly Business Digest Weekly Business Digest from belfasttelegraphPreview Subscribe||||Main Area|BelfastTravel - checkbox|Pos[:]|\"type\"checkbox\" name\"newsletters\" id\"f-newsletters-BT_Travel\" value\"BT:Travel\" class\"tick-a\"  BelfastTravel Travel news headlines and offers directly to your inbox.

The event attracts thousands of marchers, bands and spectators.It will be the first unionist parade in the city since the Apprentice Boys march in August, when a band from Larne wore emblems supporting a soldier facing Bloody Sunday murder charges, sparking anger among the wider nationalist community.This, along with anger from within the unionist community over the action taken by police against the band, led to a breakdown in the parading agreement, known as the Maiden City Accord.A series of meetings between the Apprentice Boys, the Bloody Sunday Trust and nationalist politicians - along with an independent inquiry into the police operation - have left all parties optimistic that the December parade will pass off peacefully.Meetings which were described as \"cordial and constructive\" by the chairman of the Bloody Sunday Trust, Tony Doherty, have already taken place and others are planned in the run-up to Lundys Day.Governor of the Apprentice Boys, Graham Stenhouse, said: \"There has been  years of discussions to get us to where we were and I am sure with calm head and good intention we will get there again.\"We are hopeful that by December, the good relations that existed will have been restored.\"\"I do welcome the admission by the chief constable that the actions by the police on August  were regrettable.\"Policing Board member and Apprentice Boy, Gary Middleton, MLA quizzed the chief constable about the policing operation at Augusts parade during this weeks meeting.Mr Middleton said: \"There is still a signicant level of anger within the community at the policing operation during the Apprentice Boys Parade. \"As public representatives we are now left to deal with the consequences of what happened. Confidence in the PSNI has been damaged as a result, and it is important that this is restored.\"Important lessons must be understood by the police. I welcome that the chief constable has committed to a review of the practices from that day by introducing an independent review of the policing operation.\""},{"url":null,"title":"claims ian paisley funded loyalist bomb are all filthy lies fumes widow","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsRugby World CupNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishBilly Weirs ColumnRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

We have a very simple saying, Happy pupils, high expectation, high achievement and thats it in a nutshell.\"The school is well led by a supportive board of governors.\"Principal of Loreto Grammar, Omagh, Grainne OHanlon, said she was \"delighted\" at its joint top ranking, the first time it has topped the league table.\"It is the result of the professional relationship and trust which the teachers establish with the pupils,\" she said. \"Theres a strong, supportive pastoral Special Educational Needs and safe environment surrounding the pupils and thats fully endorsed by the parents.\"Its the overriding belief that our young girls are creative, talented and able, and with a lot of self belief and hard work they can achieve.\"Lumen Christi College principal Siobhan McCauley said her schools academic success is largely due to \"the excellent relationships that exist between students and staff\".She added: \"The strong support of parents coupled with the hard work and dedication of the staff enables our students, who are well-motivated and enthusiastic, to perform at the highest level and thus achieve outstanding exam results.\"Principal of Rainey Endowed Mark McCullough said the results were enabled by a \"three-way partnership between the school, parents and pupils\".\"Its a great accolade - we just work and do the best for them that we can,\" he said.\"Im absolutely delighted and would like to thank everybody for all their hard work.\"Principal of St Dominics in Belfast Carol McCann said that % of all GCSE grades achieved in her school were A* A.\"Our performance at GCSE is the highest it has ever been in the A* A grades,\" she said. \"We are very proud of the achievement, which is down to the hard work of the pupils, staff and parents, who have worked together.\"Our Lady and St Patricks College principal Deborah McLaughlin said her schools joint sixth position was \"testament to the positive attitude of our students, who are supported by our committed staff and our parent body\".\"Were very much a team,\" she said. \"It is a balance between academic and extracurricular activities for students.\"Principal of St Louis Grammar School in Ballymena Sean Rafferty paid tribute to the work of pupils, staff and teachers.\"I would like to congratulate the pupils, teachers and parents for their magnicent effort.

outlined the impacts of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union without a deal during a speech to business leaders in Dublin on Thursday evening.He said there will be checks on goods and live animals, which he said would take place “as far as possible” in ports, airports and at businesses.“But some may need to take place near the border,” he said.Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald came down on Mr Varadkar for “thinking out loud” about possible checks, that she says would be in contravention to the Good Friday Agreement.“We were very concerned to hear the Taoiseach think out loud and concede the point that there might be checks anywhere on the island of Ireland,” she told media on Saturday.“We all committed to a bottom line, to protect our economy and peace process and never conceding any damage to the Good Friday Agreement, and the Taoiseach shouldn’t concede that now at the th hour.“It’s very important that he remains steady and retain focus and we present a united front when dealing with EU authorities and in particular with the British system and Boris Johnson.“You can dress it up anyway that you want, the introduction of tarfs and customs means you have breached the all-island economy and a fundamental building block of the Good Friday Agreement.” @MaryLouMcDonald criticizes the Taoiseach over announcement of border checks. pic eGdRKHYY— aoe-grace moore.September , “There cannot be any check anywhere on the island of Ireland, it would be an act of absolute political vandalism and anywhere checks might be located, it would represent a serious breach of the Good Friday Agreement.”Mr Varadkar says there will be a ‘grace period’ for no-deal Brexit changes to cross-border trade, however Ms McDonald says the issue is not related to the timing, but the checks themselves.“You can dress it up any way you want, whether it’s a big bang or gradual process, the introduction of checks and customs and tarfs at any speed means you have not only breached the all-island economy but a fundamental building block of the Good Friday Agreement so that can’t happen.”“The EU agreed with us all of us, there was an agreement that the bottom line was no disruption to trade and protection of people’s livelihoods, but above and beyond all , protection of the status quo that underpins the Good Friday Agreement, we take no comfort that this will happen slowly, it can’t happen at all.“It shouldn’t be down to a choice between protecting the single market and the Good Friday Agreement, it should be both.“If the Tories cannot reconcile that, then we’re straight into the terrain of removing the border.“One way or another we cannot go backwards, we cannot envisage a repartitioned Ireland almost a century on.”Likewise, Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin said the Irish government must be “absolutely honest” and “up front” about their plans for customs checks.The political rivals have been calling on the Irish government for months to publish their no-deal Brexit preparations.Meanwhile, the House of Lords passed a bill on Friday effectively blocking a no-deal Brexit, paving the way for it to become law.On the same day, the Prime Minister told reporters he would not entertain seeking another deadline extension from Brussels, as the incoming law, expected to receive Royal Assent on Monday, compels him tono agreement is in place by October

As part of his instructions, which he wrote in , £, was each given to Labour MP Dennis Skinner and Private Eye investigative journalist Paul Halloran. Another £, was donated to two English residents.The remainder of his estate, which included assets in Ireland, England, Singapore and New Zealand, was handed to the executors and trustees of his will - Joe Cahill and Dessie Mackin - for Sinn Fein.At the time Mr Cahill and Mr Mackin were the partys national treasurers. Their address is listed as  Parnell Square, which is the partys headquarters in Dublin.It was outlined in Mr Hamptons will that the money was to be used to cover election expenses, to fund Sinn Fein offices and advice centres, and to aid republican prisoners and their families in both Ireland and Britain.Mr Hamptons will stated: \"In the event that the organisation which is now known as Sinn Fein should cease to be in existence or should have split or taken a dferent name at the date of death then I direct that my executors and trustees are to apply my monies to the political party to which Mr Gerry Adams MP then belongs.\"\"Should Mr Adams pre-decease me or not be a member of any political party at the date of my death then I direct that my executors and trustees shall apply my monies to the republican or nationalist political party in the six counties, other than the SDLP, which has the largest number of elected councillors.\"Mr Hamptons donation was made public on Thursday by the Electoral Commission.A Probate Registry of Wales document confirms that when he died on January , , at a nursing home in Pembrokeshire, Mr Hampton left an estate in the UK worth £,,.However, at the time of writing his will in , he was living in a mobile home in Ireland.

The pensioner, who was unmarried and had no children, was born in London and was a long-term supporter of Sinn Fein.Mr Hamptons will and probate document, as in the case of any deceased person, are available for public inspection. The donation to Sinn Fein was paid to the party in instalments of £m and £, in April and May this year.The size of the UK estate and the mention of other global assets means that Sinn Fein may yet be in line for further donations from Mr Hampton.Under HM Revenue  Customs rules, Sinn Fein will not have to pay any inheritance tax on the £.m gt as any political party that has at least two MPs in the House of Commons is not liable to do so.Sinn Fein has seven MPs but because of a Westminster abstentionist policy they do not take their seats in the house.A political party also qualies for exemptionit has one MP and received no less than , votes at the last general election.

Yet it is also one of the world’s poorest countries, with % of its . million people living on less than two US dollars a day.Environmental groups and Transparency International have long highlighted the illegal logging of Madagascar’s rosewood forests and other endangered tree species as evidence of the rampant corruption that has made multimillionaires out of a few “rosewood barons” who have plundered the island’s northeastern forests.“Your lovely island of Madagascar is rich in plant and animal bioersity, yet this treasure is especially threatened by excessive deforestation, from which some profit,” Francis said. He cited forest fires, poaching and the “unrestricted cutting down of valuable woodlands” as particular threats.More so than any pope before him, Francis has made environmental concerns a pillar of his papacy, linking global warming to the persistent exploitation of the world’s poor by the wealthy. He has issued an entire encyclical on the need to care for God’s creation and next month will preside over a meeting of bishops from the Amazon, where an outbreak of rainforest fires have once again focused international attention on the need to preserve what he calls the “lungs of the planet”.Francis has also frequently called attention to the devastation wrought on the poor by corruption, often calling public officials to account on his foreign trips.Transparency International, which ranks Madagascar among the most corrupt countries, has accused local public officials of complicity or negligence in the illegal logging, mining of gold and sapphires and the poaching of tortoises, turtles and exportation of lemurs.In his speech, Francis urged Mr Rajoelina, who came to power on a campaign to fight corruption, to make good on his pledges.“I would encourage you to fight with strength and determination against all endemic forms of corruption and speculation that increase social disparity, and to confront the situations of great instability and exclusion that always create conditions of inhumane poverty,” he said.Francis, the world’s first pope from the global south, acknowledged that some of the island’s poor have no choice but to cut down forests to find soil or extract minerals in illegal ways that damage the environment.“So it is important to create jobs and activities that generate income, while protecting the environment and helping people to emerge from poverty,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"derry needs gallery art lovers devastated loss ebrington gallery","story":"Art lovers in Derry have expressed their “disappointment” at the loss of an Ebrington gallery space which hosted the most prestigious modern art competition in the UK a matter of years ago.The Derry News exclusively revealed that Nerve Visual is set to close its doors at the end of this week.Artists based in the city say we should “demand” that this space is used to showcase the local arts scene and,properly promoted, it will prove to be a “massive draw” for both tourists and the local community.Since the announcement, people who are passionate about arts and culture have aired their views.National Museum NI curator, Kim Mawhinney, said: “I am devastated to hear this. We worked with Nerve Visual to bring two of our most impactful exhibitions from the Ulster Museum to Derry.”The exhibitions referred to are Silent Testimony and Art of the Troubles. “Derry needs this gallery!” she added.The Nerve Centre reopened the former Turner Prize gallery space as Nerve Visual in June  when it was lauded as a “major new venue for visual arts in the Northern Ireland”.A spokesperson for the Nerve Centre said it has received no core funding and was programmed and funded on a project by project basis.In just over three years it has hosted  successful exhibitions.However, writer and art critic Dominic Kearney said he couldn’t understand why it was so poorly attended, particularly as the Turner Prize was such a success at the same location.Nerve Visual only took over a section of the Creative Hub Building   in  but during the City of Culture year in  the same gallery space hosted the prestigious Turner Prize - one of the best-known visual arts prizes in the world.Mr Kearney believes the location is “terric” and “exactly” what Ebrington needs. “The space is perfect for a gallery and the exhibitions that they had there were very impressive.“The Troubles Art exhibition, Future Artist Makers and the Colin Davidson one was stunning, I’d hesitate to say beautul given the nature of its subject, but it was incredibly powerful.“It’s the only gallery that’s open to the public in Derry that deals with mainstream, accessible, representational art. For this to close is really going to detract from the local art scene, from Ebrington, the Waterside and Derry as a whole. Like a pebble dropped in a pond, the ripple effect will spread out from that building to the outer ring of the entire city.”He added: “It’s such a shame, in six years it’s gone from hosting the most prestigious modern art competition in UK to a couple of empty rooms.“People can only have so many cups of coffee, tourists need something to do when visiting the city. If there was a gallery dedicated to Irish art with links to galleries in Dublin, the Ulster Museum, and maybe Britain. Tourists would definitely want to go there as galleries are the type of thing people look for.”‘Massive draw’Local artists were regularly showcased at the Nerve Visual gallery.Stephen Lewis has lived in Derry for over  years, he’s an artist based at Bishop Street Studios who also works with the arts charities Creative Village Arts and ArtLink at Fort Dunree. He expressed his “disappointment” at the gallery’s closure.“There have been recent initiatives by the Nerve Visual, Tower Museum and An Culturalann to give folk here a chance to see art that is held in their own national collections - but it simply goes back to the inability to keep a space that is equipped to do this open.“People in the North West should not have to travel to Belfast to see their own art - The Ulster Museum often has  or  art exhibitions on at any one time - we built a world class gallery in  and we really should demand that this becomes our space to see our own art collections - properly advertised it could be a massive draw for locals and tourists alike.\"It’s understood there will be plenty of people interested in taking over occupancy of the building but at this stage it is unclear what will be based there.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh"},{"url":null,"title":"magnificent moon monty cracking cornish sunset super images powys county times camera club members","story":"Moonshine over the Mpontgomery War Memorial from David Lister.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetA Buff tailed bumbleebee on Cosmos from Lizzie Wood.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetA frog in my wildle garden, says Lizzie Wood. \" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetA beautul Cornish sunset as sent in by Paul Hanrahan.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetA beautul Cornish sunset as sent in by Paul Hanrahan.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetA duck along the canal from Robin Bridgen.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetA dragonfly at Llandrindod Wells lakeside from Laura Shepherd.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetA beautul Cornish sunset as sent in by Paul Hanrahan.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetSunrise over Newtown from Robin Bridgen.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetThe Royal Welsh may be gone, says Steven Derek, but this is still worth posting.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetDferent birds, dferent wire says Toni Mannell with reference to her earlier ltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtposting.lt spangtlt spangt\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetMore fun with fungi on the Rainbow Walks near Llangadfan from Toni Mannell.\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetNot all Montgomery visitors are human - bugs enjoying our herb garden, says Daviltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtd Wilson.lt spangtlt spangt\" Magnicent Moon over Monty and a cracking Cornish sunsetCamera club\" Skip to next photo Show caption  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\" href\" my account emailthispage \""},{"url":null,"title":"elan show one best","story":"The championship in the terrier section went to Jason Davies of Pantydwr with Toltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtnic.

Competing in the competition for the first time, Andrew ploughed excellently over both days, winning a bronze medal on day one.With an aggregate score over the two days of competition used to crown the world champion, it was all to plough for on day two which focused on grassland.And Andrew was in good company with three former world champions making up the top five positions on the first day.He ploughed another fantastic plot to finish in fth place on day two, which placed him fourth overall, picking up the best newcomer award.Andrew said it has always been his dream to compete at the world contest.ldquoIt has been an unbelievable experience and I am so delighted to have won a medal. I am indebted for all the support I have received, particularly from my family, he said.Listooder Ploughing Society chairman Martin Gill spoke of his delight following the gala awards presentation.He said: ldquoTo go to the world contest for the first time, using borrowed equipment and to compete with the best in the world, winning a bronze medal and best newcomer title is a fantastic achievement.ldquoListooder has a long and successful history in ploughing. All three of our members who have competed at the world contest have all come home medal winners.In the reversible class, Hillsboroughrsquos James Coulter, who was also competing at the world contest for the first time, produced another fantastic performance.After finishing th on day one, James ploughed a fantastic plot the day after to win a bronze medal on grassland, finishing fourth overall and winning the best newcomer for the class.There will be little time for Andrew and James to celebrate as they prepare to compete in the Northern Ireland Championships at Cookstown this weekend..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 Aughlisnafin.jpg","title":"Aughlisnafin primary school opens new sensory garden  ","story":"CHILDREN, teachers and parents at St Maryrsquos Primary School, Aughlisnafin, celebrated the completion of a sensory garden and outdoor learning centre at the school with a barbecue and family fun night last Friday.The garden was officially opened by the school principal, Paddy Hardy, and Laura Brennan, chairperson of the schoolrsquos parent-teacher association.The Northern Ireland Fire and Rescue Service and the RNLI were in attendance to advise the children on fire and water safety.Another special guest was Down gaelic footballer Rory Burns, who took on the children in a lsquoBeat the Goaliersquo competition.The school staff got involved by raising funds with a lsquoSponge the Teacherrsquo event which was a highlight for the children.A total of pound, was raised from all the activities and the barbecue.The school wishes to Fresh Food Centre, Castlewellan, Finnegans Butchers, Castlewellan, and Eurospar, Clough, for their donations.The school also wishes to thank everyone who attended the event for their support..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 Ban.jpg","title":"Ban on circuses with live animals  ","story":"CIRCUSES using live animals will be banned from performing throughout the Newry, Mourne and Down Council area.The move calling for the council not to grant entertainment licences to circuses using live animals was passed at Monday nightrsquos full council meeting.It echoes back to a previous ban enforced by the legacy Down District Council which prohibited circuses with live animals performing on council facilities.The notice of motion, tabled by Alliance councillor Patrick Brown, was supported by  councillors. The only dissenting voice came from the DUPrsquos Harry Harvey, who voted against.The DUP councillor took an alternative view on the perceived harmful effect that circus le has on animals.Cllr Harvey said: ldquoI wonrsquot be supporting this motion as circus animals are very well trained and well trained animals are generally happy and well looked after.Cllr Brown told the meeting that many animals travelling with circuses were ldquosubjected to constantly being moved around cramped temporary housing, forced training and performance, loud noises and intimidating crowds of people.He continued: ldquoTravelling circus le is likely to have a harmful effect on animal welfare as captive animals are unable to socialise, get enough exercise or exhibit natural behaviours. Many animals develop behavioural and or health problems as a direct result of the captive le that they are forced to lead.He said that a recent report commissioned by the Welsh Government concluded that: ldquoLe for wild animals in travelling circuses... does not appear to constitute either a lsquogood lersquo or a lsquole worth livingrsquo.ldquoThe Irish government recently saw footage from the Animal Defenders International group which showed elephants and camels being repeatedly punched and hit with sticks to perform, said Cllr Brown.He added: ldquoIn May, the UK Government announced it would be banning wild animals in circuses from early . The Irish Government banned wild animals in January .ldquoAs usual, this being a devolved issue, Northern Ireland is behind the times yet again. This issue was actually raised in the Assembly as far back as  by my good friend Jim Wells MLA, who was very critical of the failure of Michelle OrsquoNeillrsquos Agriculture department to include such provisions in the Welfare of Animals Act .The councillor argued that some of the worldrsquos best circuses, such as the Cirque de Soleil, ddid not use any animals which ldquoreflects a global trend towards human-centered performances that no longer use animals, including the Russian and Chinese state circuses.He added: ldquoHopefully council will lead the way on animal welfare and pass this motion.The motion was seconded by fellow Alliance councillor Gregory Bain.Downpatrick SDLP councillor John Trainer, who also supported the motion said circuses did not provide a natural habitat for animals.DUP councillor Billy Walker, UUP councillor David Taylor and Sinn Feacuteinrsquos Willie Clarke all supported the motion on behalf of their respective parties..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th September 2019 Community.jpg","title":"Community bid to halt church’s sale of Crossgar centre  ","story":"CHURCH officials in Crossgar are being asked to abort plans to sell a building and consider donating it to local people instead.The community centre in Downpatrick Street mdash which was a former pub mdash was purchased two decades ago but is now on the market for sale as a commercial unit.Representatives of the Church of the Immaculate Conception and St Joseph are planning to meet with community representatives to explain the reasons for the sale which are understood to centre around increased running costs and reduced numbers of people using the facility.Community officials have expressed an interest in working with Newry, Mourne and Down Council to take over the running of the building,agreement could be reached to donate it to the people of Crossgar.They believe that the building offers major potential and could be developed to provide a range of services to meet the needs of a wide range of cross-community groups in the village.Community representatives want the meeting with church officials to be open to localpeople, arguing that a lot of public money has already been invested in the property over recent years which is used by the Crossgar Youth League among others.ldquoThe building could be transformed into a modern community centre with the right investment and commitment. There is a parking area at the rear with spaces for around  vehicles andthese are lost what happens, especially during the summer months when the villagersquos popular Youth League is in full flow, said one community official.ldquoLocal people have been using the property for around  years and we would very much like church officials to consider donating it to them so they can take it over and work with others to manage the running costs.Community officials say there was a need for a dedicated indoor community facility in Crossgar which would meet the needs of many groups and organisations.The added ldquoplans for a major new sports complex unveiled a number of years never came to fruition and were unlikely to in the future.Officials believe thatthe Downpatrick Street building was donated to the people of the village, its future as a community base could potentially be guaranteed.Community officials insist that one of their key priorities is looking after Crossgar Youth League which continues to go from strength to strength and also uses the car park at the rear of the building to store equipment.ldquoIt is no onersquos fault that the Downpatrick Street building is being sold. If there are concerns around its running costs why doesnrsquot the parish come and talk to us and give us the opportunity to work alongside others and take it over  suggested one community official.ldquoThere was a major push to open this building many years ago and a lot of public money was invested in it. The property is critical to the success of the Crossgar Youth League and is an enormous community benefit. It is the best thing we have in the village.ldquoThe loss of the building would have an enormous impact on the Youth League and indeed the Crossgar community. There is potential to do so much with the property and we hope it is not lost to the people of the village.

Existing paths will also be upgraded.Rowallane councillor Billy Walker mdash who has been lobbying for the existing pedestrian crossing to be upgraded mdash is delighted that it is finally going to happen.ldquoThe scheme has been included in the Department for Infrastructurersquos programme and will be installed as pat of the forthcoming environmental improvement scheme, he explained.ldquoI am delighted that after years of lobbying, this much-needed scheme is finally now in the programme and will be delivered. I hope that it will be delivered as soon as possible, given the huge volume of traffic which passes through the centre of the town each day.Cllr Walker said a number of traffic surveys have been carried out over the years to determine the need for an upgraded crossing and is pleased that one is finally going to be delivered and will be paid for by the Department for Infrastructure.ldquoThe importance of this puffin crossing cannot be highlighted enough, he continued. ldquoThe new crossing will see the provision of Killyleaghrsquos first set of traffic lights which in itself is signicant. The traffic lights will ensure drivers come to a complete halt while people are crossing.Cllr Walker said a number of people using the existing pedestrian crossing were hit by cars, while there were ldquocountless near misses.ldquoWhen people press the button on the new puffin crossing, traffic will stop immediately to allow them to cross safely. My thanks go to roads officials for finally agreeing that an upgraded crossing is necessary, he continued.ldquoThe biggest concern many in Killyleagh have is the speed of vehicles approaching Catherine Street from the Comber direction. The new puffin crossing will address this issue at what is a particularly busy main street which is notoriously dficult to cross, even with the presence of the current crossing.Cllr Walker said people need to be able to bring traffic to a halt so they can cross in safety. He is also delighted with the planned environmental improvement scheme and has no doubt it will have a positive impact on the town centre.He added: ldquoA number of similar schemes carried out in other towns and villages across the district have had a signicant impact, helping restore pride and encouraging businesses and residents to spruce up their respective premises.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman confirmed the council was developing proposals to bring forward seven environmental improvement schemes across the district, one of which is proposed for Killyleagh.ldquoIt is anticipated that this will include upgrade works to pathways, street lighting and street furniture, he explained.ldquoImplementation of the works is however subject to planning approval and the council being successful in an application for funding to the Rural Development Programme.

But he conceded that theof -hour AE services may be dficult.Mr McGoran was invited to address the Down Community Health Committee and said it was important that the South Eastern Trust was having a conversation with campaigners who are keen to continue discussions with officials to ensure the retention of existing services and the delivery of enhanced provision moving forward.Over previous years, relations between both organisations was particularly fraught at times and while they did not always see eye to eye, Mr McGoran hopes they can now move forward together.He said he had ldquonothing but respect for the Down community because local people cared about their health and social care services, committing time and energy to make sure the area gets the best provision it can.ldquoThis is not always obvious everywhere in Northern Ireland, Mr McGoran continued. ldquoYou have been at this for a long time and I have no doubt that without your campaigning work we would not have some of the things we have in this organisation today. I am also not sure that we would have the Downe Hospital.ldquoYour contribution and those who went before you has been fundamental in keeping this area in the spotlight, fighting ultimately for your services. I take my hat off to you. The Downe is here to stay and we have a fantastic facility and there are no staff better. In fact, we have incredible staff who work right across the organisation.Mr McGoran said that while administrators and campaigners may not have always agreed in the past about how the health trust did things, he suggested they all had the same aim mdashwanting the best health and social care that could be delivered, sometimes within challenging resources.Looking to the future, the health chief referred to an ongoing review of emergency care which has resulted in the group overseeing the exercise visiting the Downe and meeting with senior health officials.ldquoI do envisage that there is going to be further change for emergency medicine but when I was asked the question what did I think about the future of the service at the Downe, Ulster and Lagan Valley hospitals in  yearsrsquo time, I could not really answer that, explained Mr McGoran.ldquoI was prepared to say what it would be like in five yearsrsquo time, but could not look beyond that. A five year vision is really something that you can get a hold of and we made it clear to those in charge of the review that the emergency care model we have in place at the Downe will be here in five yearsrsquo time.Mr McGoran said the health trust was on record with the Department of Health during the early stages of the current engagement that it still sees the current model at the Downe comprising the emergency department, out of hours GP service and weekend nurse-led minor injuries unit remaining in place.ldquoWe will still have acute beds in the Downe and it will deal with medically unwell patients. All of the current infrastructure we have will remain in place and our vision is to expect these to remain in place for the next five years, he confirmed.Mr McGoran said the one caveat was that it remained to be seen what the Department of Health will do with the information it has been provided with in relation to the future of emergency care, suggesting serious conversations about the way forward have only just begun.He added: ldquoThere is work ongoing and at some point there may be a consultation exercise. I do not know where all this is going to go and it is a bit early to speculate.Community Health Committee chairman Eamonn McGrady welcomed the health officialrsquos ldquoconstructive and honest engagement with campaigners.He said: ldquoWe need to go forward in a partnership, but that does not mean that we will always agree. Our community supports the Downe Hospital and also the centres of excellence in the bigger hospitals that our delivering our health needs.ldquoBut we need as much care as possible provided as locally as possible, safely and well adequately resourced in a brilliant building.Mr McGrady added: ldquoI hope that in five yearsrsquo time we will be looking at a very major extension at the Downe and a major increase in capacity.

Council because of the murders at Warrenpoint and Mullaghmore was rejected the SDLP and Alliance members.The motion to adjourn was defeated by ten votes to six and immediately the Unionists walked out mdash not in protest but as a gesture of sympathy to those bereaved by the murders.The motion was introduced by Saintfield councillor, Mr William Finlay, who said he looked back with horror at the murders, the victims including  soldiers at Warrenpoint, Lord Mountbatten, his grandson, Nicholas , the Dowager Lady Brabourne, and a  year-old boy, Paul Maxwell.Acting chairman, Mr Paddy OrsquoDonoghuesaid he would be impartial in the matter and was quite sure they all shared the revulsion, horror and disgust and would like to show their sympathy with those were bereaved ldquoin such a dreadful way.He pointed out that there had been two committee meetings of the council since the murders occurred, but since Mr Finlayrsquos motion was a procedural matter councillors must decide without any debate whether or not they wanted to adjourn the meeting.He added: ldquoHowever, whether or not the council decides to adjourn should not be interpreted as to whether or not councillors approve of the vile deeds which have been perpetrated.After the vote, in which the SDLP and Alliance members voted against the Unionists, Mr Finlay said he was sorry about the decision which the majority had made.NEWCASTLE mdash The fireworks display organised as the climax of the Newcastle summer season did not go down with a bang, but instead fizzled out.Torrential rain minutes before the fireworks bonanza was due to begin washed the show out and it now seems likely that the display will be held at Halloween at Downpatrick racecourse instead.Drumgath Accordion Band and Ballykeel Pipe Band were about to march into the arena to put on a marching exhibition when the rain came down.More than pound had been spent on the fireworks, but the rockets, roman candles, catherine wheels, shells, mortars and numerous other favourites were saved from the rain. Disappointed spectators had their money refunded.The fireworks bonanza, sponsored by Down District Council, was to have marked the end of the Percy French Festival.However, the stage will now switch to Downpatrick in October where a successful display was staged last year.ARDGLASS mdash Suki, the cat escaped a horrible death at Ardglass harbour recently, has found a new home in Lisburn.The story about how Suki survived an attempt to have her drowned aroused so much interest that the person who found her, Mrs Joan Owens, was inundated with phone calls to give the cat a home.Mrs Owens, of Ardgtreenan Crescent, Belfast, accepted the first of more than  calls and the cat left for its new home in Dundrod Walk, Lisburn, earlier this week.ldquoSomeone had tried to get rid of the cat, Mrs Owens explained. ldquoSuki was tied in a paper bag and thrown off the side of the harbour, but instead of hitting the waves she landed in our cabin cruiser, which was anchored.ldquoWhen we were taking our boat out of the water for repairs to the hull we came across a torn bag on the deck. Then we heard noises from a cabin mdash and found Suki mothering three new kittens.ldquoUnfortunately, we had to have the three kittens put down and Suki neutered. And then when our two tom cats took a dislike to Suki we were forced to appeal for a home for her.Mrs Owens added: ldquoThe response was overwhelming and the first of many callers took Suki away. My husband, Jim, and I will be ing to our caravan at Ardtole, near Ardglass, this weekend. We hope we donrsquot find any more animals in distress!DOWNPATRICK mdash Downpatrickrsquos new maternity hospital, which is due to replace the Hardy Greer House unit early in the New Year, will not become fully operational until staffing dficulties can be resolved.It is expected that an advertising campaign is to be mounted shortly for all grades of staff required in the bright, new up-to-date hospital.The -bed unit in the grounds of the Downshire Hospital will require up to % more midwery staff than the -bed Hardy Greer House on the Strangford Road, which seems to be permanently under-staffed and struggling along.The new unit will also accommodate an out-patient centre which will mean the transfer of ante-natal and post-natal work which is currently conducted at Downe Hospital.The expected completion date for the new building is November. It is already a couple of months behind schedule because of a host of supply dficulties, the cement strike among them.Once it is handed over it will have to be equipped and sterilised before it can be commissioned. That could take a couple of months.BALLYNAHINCH mdash The September Flower Show organised by the Presbyterian Womenrsquos Association connected to st Ballynahinch Presbyterian Church proved to be a huge success.The Huston Hall was crammed full of baking, handiwork, flowers and vegetables. The judges had a dficult task in deciding who won what.The standard was again very high in the eight sections with encouraging entries in the bread, cake, jam, handiwork, flowers and vegetable classes. After the judging the ious articles were sold at bargain prices, raising almost pound for church funds.KILLYLEAGH mdash Killyleagh artist Leo Casement is making a big name for himself in France. Leo set off for Europe last year after staging a successful one-man exhibition in Downpatrick Library.Now many of his paintings are finding their way into French homes and the name Leo Casement is appearing in French newspapers.Leo had originally indicated that he might be ing home at the end of this month, but he has put his travelling boots on again and is in Amsterdam at the moment.PORTAFERRY mdash Euro MP John Taylor has joined the fight of Portaferry residents, who are angry about the new sewage works scheme which they say will be pumping untreated sewage into Strangford Lough.Mr Taylor is to table a question at this monthrsquos meeting of the European Parliament, askingthe scheme is receiving financial backing from the EEC.Mr Taylor is also demanding to knowthe plant would qualy for help from the EEC regional aid fund,it was modied to include the treatment of sewage.The Euro MP, who was the site engineer in charge of the storm drainage scheme in Portaferry in the late s and who says he has a good knowledge of the problem encountered by residents, intends bluntly askingthe EEC encourages the disposal of raw effluent into the lough.KEARNEY mdash A yacht which was taking part in a race from Bangor to Portpatrick in Scotland struck rocks at Kearney Point on the Ards Peninsula during thick fog at the weekend.Donaghadee Leboat answered the Mayday call and towed the boat and the eight people on board to safety.Yachtsmen competing in the race, organisedby Royal Ulster Yacht Club, said that conditions were probably the worst experienced for the event.The crews found it most dficult with the thick sea mist cutting visibility down to  yards at times as rain lashed down.

This was foreseen in the design of St Johnrsquos Point lighthouse where there is excellent lantern sidewall and cowling ventilation in a tower  feet above the ground in this remote location. There is little hazard from the liquid mercury since it is not readily absorbed dermally.Campaigners have suggested that it would be interesting to see CILrsquos lighthouse keeper health monitoring records for mercury covering the past  years and more when the lighthouse was manned and used the present system. They also said it would be interestingto see the training records for keepers in safe mercury handling during all these years. ldquoPresumably, these would have been managed by independent bodies of experts since the Commissioners probably didnrsquot previously have and donrsquot today have any toxicological experts on your permanent payroll, says the campaigners letter.Another area of concern highlighted is the poor state of the lighthouse, including adjoining housing which a delegation from the Commissionerrsquos office recently visited.Campaigners point to the ldquolamentable state of the walls of the lighthouse station and the grounds, suggesting that they present a picture of ldquowoeful neglect and asking how CIL can expect the public to be impressed with a lack of basic asset maintenance.The letter highlights that the current Fresnel lens system turns  hours a day and is clearly visible from the road outside the lighthouse station.Campaigners say this in itself is a visual attraction during daylight hours ldquosince the magnicent large lens system is big enough to be seen turning on itrsquos mercury bearing and is even more magnicent at night.The letter continues: ldquoWe believe that CIL will miss a tremendous opportunity to preserve this lighthouse and its sweeping beamyou persist with your alternative bearing plans. The whole lighthouse station could become part of a wider tourist attraction in the area. Future generations will thank you for retaining the current historic beam system, still going smoothly after  years and showing no signs of obsolescence. You have not made an economic case for change of lens system at St Johnrsquos Point as far as we know and it is dficult to see how you can.ldquoWhat happens at the lighthouse remains the focus of keen and widespread local and political interest in this area and we will ensure this continues to be a high-profile local issue.The letter adds: ldquoLecale Lightkeepers are willing to fully support CIL and others in any preservation programme that involves retaining the sweeping beam. However, we reject the idea that the use of mercury in this lens bearing application represents a health hazard that cannot be managed by a sensible, low-cost maintenance programme involving chiefly adequate ventilation.

However, the most serious casualty of this crisis could yet be the Union between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It’s practically impossible to tell what will happen next, but none of the likely outcomes will give unionists much confidence about their future. There are strong arguments that ‘no deal’ could damage our place in the Union, but the biggest threat is still the EU’s ‘backstop’, which sets out concrete plans to tie Northern Ireland more closely to the Republic of Ireland and loosen our links with the rest of the UK.There are enough contradictions and hypocrisies from both sides of the debate in Westminster to keep satirists going for decades, but the irony this week was richer than chocolate fudge cake. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button Many of the MPs who accused Boris Johnson of perpetrating a ‘constitutional outrage’ or an ‘anti-democratic coup’ when he prorogued parliament the week before, defied precedent to take control of the House of Commons’ timetable, then airily dismissed the PM’s call for an election.By taking this approach, they’ve removed any incentive for the EU to compromise on the backstop, just as discussions got underway on alternatives. Their attempts to ensure that ‘no deal’ is impossible may have sabotaged the best opportunity for some time to reach an acceptable agreement.These antics will dismay anyone who genuinely values Northern Ireland’s place in the United Kingdom. In Wednesday’s News Letter, Lord Empey asked “what unionist could stand over goods from GB being treated as though they are from a ‘third country’ once they cross the Irish Sea ’ He’s absolutely right, but there are even deeper problems with the backstop than technical matters about checks on goods, eventhose details are critically important.Theresa May’s Brexit deal included a UK-wide dimension, but Northern Ireland was bound to remain in the EU customs union and parts of the single market, while Great Britain left. There is potential in the backstop for the mainland to move away from Brussels’ rules, while we have no such option. Unionists are being asked to accept the risk of being treated dferently from the rest of the UK, gradually separated from its economic, social and political le and placed under the jurisdiction of decision-makers over whom they have no control. In addition, for businesses, politicians and lobbyists, Dublin would inevitably become our interlocutor with Brussels, so there would be an ever greater all-Ireland dimension to our public square.Peterborough man set fire to step-daughters car to teach her a lessonRichard Scullion murder: Killer told he faces le imprisonment Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The idea that the backstop, while not ideal for unionists, is ‘better than the alternatives’ isn’t credible. The threats associated with ‘no deal’ are theoretical. If mishandled, it may lead to a ‘border poll’, it may persuade some voters to back an all-Ireland republic, it may even encourage terrorism. In contrast, the effects of the backstop are set out in a legally binding text from which we would be unable to escape. You can understand why nationalists, whose political energies, since the Belfast Agreement, have been dedicated to eroding British sovereignty in Northern Ireland by stealth and erasing dferences between the two jurisdictions on this island, are delighted with the backstop. For the eurocrats and many remainers, even some who were formerly quite unionist, it is simply an inescapable consequence of Brexit. ‘You started it, you sort it out,’ they say, oblivious to the concept that the UK has a right to determine the future of its whole territory, without having its authority undermined. There are conflicting versions of the prospects of Boris’s attempts to renegotiate the Northern Ireland protocol. The EU and the Dublin government claim the UK has offered no viable alternatives. Rumours from London suggest there was some progress toward agreeing a single regime for plant and animal health. This sounds a little like replacing a full border in the Irish Sea with a partial border in the Irish Sea, but it hints that compromise is possible, despite claims to the contrary.Michel Barnier was expected to visit Northern Ireland again next week but has cancelled his trip. So far, he and his allies have been allowed to imply that support for the backstop in practically unanimous. Unionists have spoken out against it, but their response has been muted in comparison.Back in November , a month before Britain agreed a ‘joint report’ with Brussels that was subsequently used to justy the backstop, I wrote that an Irish Sea border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would be the biggest reversal for unionism since the Anglo-Irish Agreement . I argued that ‘unionist parties should not rest until every potential ... voter was aware of the magnitude,” of this proposal.As the backstop gained momentum, the most substantive political arguments against it came from Lords Trimble and Bew, who published excellent reports through the think-tank Policy Exchange, and latterly the prime minister himself, who critiqued it in uncompromising fashion in a letter to Donald Tusk. A tiny number of commentators and columnists have made the case too. Events at Westminster this week make getting rid of the backstop even more dficult. Long ago, unionists should have spoken out about this threat far more clearly and loudly.• Owen Polley in : Unionists should not rest until potential Alliance voters see scale of its plan to weaken Union©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"opinion","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Ltd#s Standard Terms and ConditionsWould you like to receive any of the following newsletters from Belfast News Letter, via email Daily news, news features and service updates\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \" addCustomTextToCreateAccountTemplateNewslettersWould you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"  \". s .  \". ss+s+  \". s  \".after+text+ .+text+ .before+text+ .after+text+]]]]]]]]]]]]]] initInArticleOnlySiteText, initArticleSiteText, isInArticleOnlyTemplateReady. s isArticleTemplateReady. s addCustomTextToSiteTemplate addSiteName.html  Opinion   Jobs Cars Homes  Directory  Announcements  Advertise My Business Subscribe#jp #login-widget #login-flip.flip RegisterLoginEdit Account\"Sign Out\" --\"    --       News Opinion Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health Offbeat People Read This News Traffic and Travel Crime Weather Politics Business Education Health People Read This Sport Football Rugby Union Motorcycling More Sport Sport Opinion Whats On Arts  Entertainment Things To Do Nightle Lestyle Retro Cars Homes Must Read           Opinion      So sinful and wicked and corrupt has our nation become that we deserve ine wrathGiven the utter mess that our country is in, as seen in the dysality at Westminster during the past months, what other conclusion can any reasonable Christian arrive at but that our country is under ine judgement.

Having asked on Twitter when the report was due and having received a reply from someone who said that it was being checked by lawyers, the senior republican said: “So, I’ve heard, but for how long can they procrastinate without being seen to wilfully delay its publication to suit the DUP’s election blushes ”Mr Morrison was fairly explicit about his unsurprising interest in the report being published soon, hopeful that it will damage the DUP before a snap General Election.But republicans almost certainly have a second, and more important, desire to see the report. If they are prepared to restore Stormont – as was the case last year until Arlene Foster’s inability to sell the proposed deal to her party blew the plan apart – it would be a huge risk to do sothe inquiry was to report weeks later andit was to criticise Mrs Foster..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button There would be pressure on Sinn Fein to either force Mrs Foster from office or again collapse the entire Stormont edice, based on the precedent of Martin McGuinness in January .The government, desperate to get Stormont back, is also believed to be keen to see the inquiry report soon.The fact that inquiry chairman Sir Patrick Coghlin has taken his time and continued to investigate elements of cash for ash despite the obvious desire of so many powerful people for a swt resolution is in many ways an indication of his robust belief in his complete independence. But, almost a year since inquiry hearings finished and with not only no report but no date for the report’s publication, what is the delay In an age when some people’s trust in authority has been strained to the point where they are more prepared to accept unfounded conspiratorial claims than boring evidence-based explanations, what seems like the slow pace of the inquiry and the lack of a substantive public explanation has perhaps inevitably led to some people articulating their own lurid theories.When asked about the delay, a spokesman for the inquiry would only say: “The chairman is still working on his report. We cannot give a date for publication.”That follows Sir Patrick’s consistent decision not to give even indicative dates for key elements of the inquiry process. Perhaps mindful of how other inquiries – most notably Lord Saville’s inquiry into Bloody Sunday – ran hopelessly beyond their anticipated timeframe, the former Court of Appeal judge has shrewdly simply said that the report will be published when it is ready.If anything, Sir Patrick is the sort of forthright judge who may simply publish his report immediately it is ready – which could itself create unintended problems. If, for instance, the report was completed at the point where the UK was to leave the EU without a deal and it was simply published immediately regardless of wider events, it is almost inevitable that Sir Patrick’s findings would not receive the public scrutiny which they deserve. But although the report is now largely written, it is not yet complete. In the months after the conclusion of public evidence sessions last October, the inquiry continued to investigate elements of the affair, one of which was exceptionally complex.Having written , words for a book on the scandal , I have considerable empathy for the task of the inquiry. This scandal is fiendishly complex andSir Patrick had been minded to expansively interpret the mandate given to him by Máirtín Ó Muilleoir who set up the inquiry, it could have gone on for a decade. The fact that Mr Ó Muilleoir thought the inquiry could report within six months is indicative not of tardiness by the inquiry but of naivety by Mr Ó Muilleoir.Owen Polley: Unionists should have spoken out far more loudly against backstop Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Central to theof time which the inquiry has taken has been the fact that much of the evidence has been hidden from view because it was kept off departmental systems – or not written down at all. That has required painstaking work to find and comb through private emails, text messages and other unofficial communication, mostly involving DUP and Sinn Féin figures, some of whom were not even known to have been involved in RHI.For instance, in early , as with all witnesses, the inquiry had written to Arlene Foster’s long-standing special adviserAndrew Crawford to serve on him the first of several formal notices issued under Section  of the Inquiries Act, compelling him to produce all documentation relevant to the inquiry’s work. But the inquiry became suspicious about some of Dr Crawford’s responses to its requests.In September  the inquiry wrote a stern letter toDr Crawford after it had found an email from him to his friend Mark Anderson just before the scandal had erupted in December .The letter from inquiry solicitor Patrick Butler said that it seemed that the email was relevant to the inquiry’s work and added: “At the moment, it appears to the inquiry that there has been a prima facie breach of the requirements of [the order for disclosure].”Dr Crawford told the inquiry that he had “no recollection” of the undisclosed email and said “it is apparent to me that this email must have been deleted as it did not appear when I performed a search”.That was the second time that the inquiry had to write to Dr Crawford. Four months earlier it had similarly written to the DUP man’s solicitor “expressing concern about compliance with section  notices requiring the provision of documentation”, in particular text messages.Dr Crawford had responded to that by saying that he would only have used his departmental BlackBerry device for text messages about RHI, and it was now in the custody of the department.However, the inquiry then discovered that he had used a personal mobile phone to conduct text communications about RHI. In response, Dr Crawford told the inquiry that some messages may have been deleted but he had found  messages “of which I had no recollection” and belatedly submitted them.Not all witnesses aroused the suspicions of the inquiry in that way, but the episode demonstrates two wider points – the forensic nature of the inquiry’s work and its willingness to be robust with witnesses.Sir Patrick’s early decision to allow video of every moment of the inquiry’s hearings to be broadcast and to publish tens of thousands of pages of evidence was shrewd and it is now his bulwark against the sort of conspiratorial claims which perhaps inevitably attach themselves to anything of this nature.Because of the inquiry’s open nature, the public was able to see how DUP witnesses were treated – not only when they appeared to be questioned – but in written correspondence which shows how the inquiry team probed and pressurised DUP figures in the same way as those from the Civil Service, Sinn Féin and multiple other organisations.Two months ago the inquiry began writing to those who will be criticised in the report and has now done so for the vast majority of those who will be censured. The process allows iniduals the chance to object or to point out factual errors, but the objections do not have to be accepted. Having done so over the holiday season, some witnesses have asked for more time, further delaying proceedings.Sir Patrick is said to have been at his desk almost every day over the summer. His report may be a few weeks away, but far from that being due to a desire to cover anything up, the evidence points to it being due to the scale of its task and the meticulous nature of its work.try

Image: BBC SpotlightAlthough it has long been known that Mr McGuinness was an IRA commander, he refused to discuss his actions in the organisation and insisted that he had never killed anyone.The images will be broadcast next Tuesday in the first part of one of BBC Northern Ireland’s most ambitious projects, a two-year re-examination of the Troubles which will run over seven programmes. .ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button The first programme in the series also includes a former colonel saying that he was shown evidence by the RUC that Ian Paisley, the future First Minister, had supplied the money for explosives which caused one of the first explosions of the Troubles.The rare footage of an IRA car bomb being assembled was filmed in Londonderry in the early years of the Troubles.During the programme, former IRA bomber Shane Paul O’Doherty commentated on the pictures, saying: “There’s a huge charge there. A very dangerous alarm clock timer that could blow them all to hell.”When asked who he recognised, he said: “Well, there’s Martin....Martin McGuinness.” Mr O’Doherty said he was certain that it was the future deputy First Minister, saying “nobody walks like him, with a stoop in his back”.The car containing the bomb could be identied by its number plate. The BBC programme includes footage of the bomb exploding  minutes later in the centre of Mr McGuinness’s home city, Londonderry.The day after the bombing, Northern Ireland Prime Minister Brian Faulkner was brought to London to be told that security powers would be removed from Stormont and taken on by Westminster, leading to the collapse of Stormont.The Spotlight programme also includes footage of Mr McGuinness showing guns to young children and handing them bullets while seated in a car.Commentating on the film pictures, Mr O’Doherty said: “It’s Martin McGuinness. Very young, tall, handling weapons – a rle and a revolver – rolling up to a load of kids who are staring in the windows, craning in the windows and showing them bullets.“It’s horric, really, because here was McGuinness showing eight, nine and -year-olds guns and bullets that were exciting. People had a feeling that you were on television, you know, you were superstars.”Police had evidence Ian Paisley paid for Troubles bombing, says ex-colonel Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"The programme does not explain the background to the footage. However, Spotlight reporter Darragh MacIntyre said that it would be made clear in a future film in the series.He said that it had been shot by an American documentary maker and was never broadcast.Mr McIntyre, the reporter who in  exposed the then DUP MP Iris Robinson’s affair and financial dealings with property developers, said that the  footage “speaks to a time when within Free Derry and where in the north there was a sense that the IRA had it won, that they were the original guerrilla fighters and within a matter of months would see their way to a new united Ireland...so they were quite free - not just Martin McGuinness - when they were filming with this documentary team”.In , Mr McGuinness told the journalist Eamonn Mallie that he was “very proud that I was a part of the IRA in Derry” but declined to say whether he had ever killed anyone.Last month, former IRA member Kieran Conway said that as the IRA’s chief of staff at the time of the attack which killed Lord Mountbatten and others, including two children, Mr McGuinness had to “take responsibility” for what had happened that day.Another former IRA man, Anthony McIntyre, said of that attack: “If they knew about the children, and were quite prepared to go ahead and to sacrice their lives in order to get Mountbatten, then it’s a war crime”.However, Sinn Féin MLA and former IRA man Raymond McCartney denounced such criticism of Mr McGuinness, saying that he was “held in the highest of esteem across Ireland and internationally”.The Foyle MLA said: “It is reprehensible that anyone would make unfounded allegations against a man who is no longer here to defend himself.”Spotlight on The Troubles – a Secret History involve two -minute programmes and five hour-long episodes. The series has been overseen by editor Jeremy Adams, deputy editor Gwyneth Jones and producer Chris Thornton. It involves three senior Spotlight reporters – Darragh MacIntyre, Jenner O’Leary and Mandy McAuley.The first programme will be broadcast on BBC One NI on Tuesday at .pm and will also be shown on BBC Four across the UK at the same time.try catch  TrendingNI man killed in road crash is namedTransfer Deadline Day RECAP: Rangers confirm pound.m Ryan Kent signing from Liverpool, Celtic sign three,

Of those,  have been empty for more than two years.Landlords will be given incentives to bring long term empty properties into use as the council says they attract crime and anti-social behaviour, drive down values and become ldquodetrimental to the lives of residents.Measures are set out in a draft strategy which the councilrsquos cabinet, on July , agreed to publish for public consultation.While the council wants landlords to accept help to get homes in use, the strategy says theauthority will take actionnecessary.Vale council deputy leader Cllr Lis Burnett told the meeting she was ldquostunned more than  homes in the Vale have been empty for more than two years.ldquoItrsquos absolutely staggering, she said. ldquoA strategy on a way we can tackle it is very welcome. Empty properties are detrimental to the lives of local residents.ldquoThey are often a magnet for crime and continue to blight neighbourhoods. They can also be a risk to emergency services.Some  Vale properties have been empty for more than  years, but most long-term empty properties are vacant for six months to two years. In April , the St Augustinersquos ward in Penarth had the most long-term empty homes, with  empty for more than six months and  for more than two years.Penarthrsquos Plymouth ward had more than  empty for more than six months, and more than  empty for more than two years.The proposed strategy calls on the council to maintain and improve its empty homes data, provide financial incentives to landlords, prioritise empty homes for enforcement action such as enforced sales and compulsory purchase orders, and to raise awareness of the issue of empty homes.The strategy says: ldquoA voluntary way forward to renovation and re-occupation is always the preferred option, and officers make all available endeavours to encourage and persuade such progress.ldquoHowever, in instances where owners cannot be traced or where exhaustive attempts to encourage and promote progress from known owners prove unproductive, orthere is an imminent risk to health and safety, there is little option but to proceed with a statutory solution,The draft empty homes strategy will be put to public consultation after the councilrsquos August recess. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ms Parker and Mr Glover met several years ago when he trained her at their local gym. They then ended up unexpectedly working together later in le when Mr Glover changed jobs.Mr Glover said: ldquoIt was very tough for Julie before the transplant as she suffered with a genetic lung disease and her lungs slowly stopped working over a few years.\"It got to the point where she required an oxygen tank to be strapped to her back so that she could breathe. She never gave up and still worked and tried to do as much as she could and always kept a smile on her face.Ms Parker has a rare condition called Alpha--antitrypsin deficiency which means she lacks a protective enzyme inhibitor which makes her more vulnerable to smoke, dust and other toxic materials and increases the risk of lung disease. Because of the deficiency, Ms Parker was required to have a double lung transplant. Shortly after the transplant Ms Parker went to lunch with Mr Glover and he was amazed at how well she looked.He said: ldquoBecause I was seeing her every day, I knew her health was declining as a result of the lung disease. But I donrsquot think I was so aware of the extent until I saw her after the operation, and how healthy she looked.This isnrsquot the first challenge Mr Glover has taken on.In the past he has carried lbs up and down the highest mountain in Southern Britain, completed car dead lts and successfully performed  pull ups.The pair now plan to walk Pen-Y-Fan, the highest mountain in South Wales, together to raise money in the future once Ms Parker is well enough.Mr Glover set out to raise pound, and has now raised pound.Officially, Mr Glover had only  days to train for this challenge, enlisting friends to help him by sitting in the car and steering as he tows.ldquoI was getting up at :am to run around car parks towing the car with a harness before work,\" he said. \"I love setting myself challenges but donrsquot tend to do what everyone  does. So I will look for something a bit far out or invent my own and usually try and document them on video.All the proceeds from the day will go towards the charityrsquos Harefield Transplant Appeal, to raise funds for organ care systems to allow more patients to receive le-saving transplants.If yoursquod like to support Mr Glover in his marathon challenge his Justgiving page is: https:www.justgiving fundraising muscleworld article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Two-year-old Matilda Philpott who has Stickler Syndrome was joined by her two brothers, Oliva and Alfie, four-year-old Alice Haswell who has Goldenhar Syndrome camped out with her sister Scarlet, and -year-old Daisy Stacey who has Vacterl Association attended with her sister Molly.The weekend saw the families take part in a range of activities from archery, crafts and pop rockets to laser shooting, fire lighting, bush craft and raft making.The camp was the first time the referred children have been on a Scout Camp, something leaders have been hoping to achieve since the start of the group.Ruth Weltch, Group Scout Leader said: ldquoThe opportunity to regularly set up camp in the great outdoors is one of the main reasons young people enjoy Scouting so much and we wanted to give our children, who would not normally have the opportunity, the chance to take part in a weekend of outdoor activities and to sleep under canvas with their families.ldquoWe have been overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of help offered by leaders, not just from Cardf and Vale Scouts but from other scouting areas in Wales.This reflects the scope of the hospice itself which is open to all children with le limiting illnesses throughout Wales.ldquoWe have been able to give these children the opportunity to take part in activities not usually accessible to them and that we take for granted. It was an absolute joy to see them and their families take part in the weekendrsquos activities, seeing them smile and forget about their worries for a while was heart-warming.Lynne Phelps, from Ty Hafan, said: ldquoThe hard work, time and effort put in by the Scout Group since its inception has been truly amazing. The group has brought so much happiness to the hospice and given the children referred to us an opportunity to take part in activities with their families that they wouldnrsquot have had access toit wasnrsquot for Scouts.ldquoThe group has had a really positive impact not just on the children in our care, but also their families and our staff. We really canrsquot thank the Ty Hafan Scout Group enough.The Ty Hafan Scout Group was set up on the Scouting Centenary in  for any child referred to the hospice along with their siblings, parents and family, to spend time together having fun and making memories.A growing need for sibling involvement was soon recognised and so the group began to run regular sibling camps.The sibling camps have given the young people who have brothers and sisters in the care of the hospice the opportunity to attend events such as Scarefest and the Jurassic International Jamboree, as well as the chance to spend quality family time with their loved ones.ScoutsCymru gives over , young people in Wales the opportunity to enjoy fun and adventure while developing the skills they need to succeed, now and in the future.Open to all young people in Wales regardless of faith, gender, sexual orientation, race or social background, the movement encourages its members to do more, learn more and be more. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

Yet it is also one of the worldrsquos poorest countries, with % of its . million people living on less than two US dollars a day.Environmental groups and Transparency International have long highlighted the illegal logging of Madagascarrsquos rosewood forests and other endangered tree species as evidence of the rampant corruption that has made multimillionaires out of a few ldquorosewood barons who have plundered the islandrsquos northeastern forests.ldquoYour lovely island of Madagascar is rich in plant and animal bioersity, yet this treasure is especially threatened by excessive deforestation, from which some profit, Francis said. He cited forest fires, poaching and the ldquounrestricted cutting down of valuable woodlands as particular threats.More so than any pope before him, Francis has made environmental concerns a pillar of his papacy, linking global warming to the persistent exploitation of the worldrsquos poor by the wealthy. He has issued an entire encyclical on the need to care for Godrsquos creation and next month will preside over a meeting of bishops from the Amazon, where an outbreak of rainforest fires have once again focused international attention on the need to preserve what he calls the ldquolungs of the planet.Francis has also frequently called attention to the devastation wrought on the poor by corruption, often calling public officials to account on his foreign trips.Transparency International, which ranks Madagascar among the most corrupt countries, has accused local public officials of complicity or negligence in the illegal logging, mining of gold and sapphires and the poaching of tortoises, turtles and exportation of lemurs.In his speech, Francis urged Mr Rajoelina, who came to power on a campaign to fight corruption, to make good on his pledges.ldquoI would encourage you to fight with strength and determination against all endemic forms of corruption and speculation that increase social disparity, and to confront the situations of great instability and exclusion that always create conditions of inhumane poverty, he said.Francis, the worldrsquos first pope from the global south, acknowledged that some of the islandrsquos poor have no choice but to cut down forests to find soil or extract minerals in illegal ways that damage the environment.ldquoSo it is important to create jobs and activities that generate income, while protecting the environment and helping people to emerge from poverty, he said..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Pope denounces exploitation of Madagascar us unique resources article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--Promoted Stories       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

out how much it costs  ","story":"Do you want to complain about a neighbour#s high hedge  It#s going to cost you five times more in the Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Council area.That’s £ - five times more than any other area in NI, says AllianceCllr Eóin Tennyson.Cllr Tennysonsays the Council must make it easier for people to deal with high hedges.He said: “As it stands, where mediation fails in dealing with concerns around high hedges – which can often be a real nuisance and source of frustration and stress for people affected – raising an official complaint in the ABC area costs up to five times more than other areas in NI.“Often people dealing with high hedge disputes have no choice but to make an official complaint, which is why it is dficult to comprehend why ABC Council insists on charging applicants £ – adding financial strain to an already stressful situation.“While the fee is ed to the applicantthe complaint is upheld, this is still a large outlay which can be prohibitive for residents seeking resolution to a problem that has often been lingering for some time.“The fee is set by Councils, so while in other areas like Derry and Strabane Council it costs £ to pursue a complaint, I must question why the fee is so excessive for people to access the same service in the ABC area.“That’s why we are not only calling for a review of the costs of high hedge complaints in ABC Council, but have urged officers to advance the development of a mediation toolkit or resource to help resolve a greater number of disputes at an earlier stage.”A Council spokesperson said: “The matter of high hedges was raised at this week’s Environmental Services Committee. It was agreed that a report, which would include how the fee was set within the framework of the council’s fee setting policy and the investigation process, would be brought to next month’s Environmental Services Committee.”Princess Charlotte arrives for first day of school - accompanied by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID

We speak to founder Daniel Crawford and his team about the journey so far A spark in the mind of Daniel Crawford as he studied for his masters degree in Glasgow just a few years ago has grown into a business at the sharp end of technology. axialD is tasked with turning the complicated and laborious process of converting D medical scans into D models – and producing them for use by surgeons and medical professionals. It’s an ever-growing business, spun out of Ulster University, which is expanding its reach across the UK, Ireland and now into the US where it’s targeting a burgeoning fresh marketplace. The company has been involved with Catalyst since , been directly involved with a host of its programmes, and is participating in the EU INTERREG funded North West Centre for Advanced Manufacturing , managed by the Special European Union Programmes Body . Catalyst is Northern Ireland’s leading technology hub, home to  companies and around , staff. Daniel has a strong team around him – growing to  staff based in Belfast city centre, including Niall Haslam, chief technology officer, Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships and Cathy Coomber as operations manager. While studying medical visualisation and human anatomy in Glasgow, Daniel was exposed to the raft of imaging available – including CT, MRI and ultrasound, and began examining how the crucial data could be better used. The biomedical physics undergraduate grew the idea into his thesis – looking at converting D data sets and converting them into fully D printable files. “That allows us to turn images into D models to allow surgeons or registrars, to understand digital pathologies, before going in to theatre,” he said. “But we discovered it wasn’t just good for that and surgeons also wanted to get their hands on the D models.” That gave Daniel greater scope for developing the concept. In one early case, a surgeon was able to use one of the D prints to identy small fractures in a patient who had suffered a motorcycle crash, that weren’t initially apparent using more traditional methods. The company was thrust into Catalyst’s Springboard programme in  – a  week scheme which allowed a would-be entrepreneur, fresh out of university, access to business training and development, which included working with PathXL’s Stuart Harvey. From there, it was into the Halo programme – bringing axialD together with angel investors in order to get the start-up off the ground. It landed £, through Techstart and private investors, which allowed the company to get the ball rolling. Through Catalyst, Daniel also got the opportunity to visit MIT and the entrepreneurial development programme, Way to Scale, bringing axialD to Massachusetts and the Boston area – the global heart of the health technology sector. Niall Haslam is axialD’s chief technical officer. He said a Belfast and Boston partnership has helped strengthen the links between the cities, bringing firms from Northern Ireland to the US for both networking and scoping out the potential for setting up shop across the Atlantic. “The Way to Scale program brings entrepreneurs together. It’s a great networking opportunity,” Niall says. axialD is now a partner in the EU INTERREG-funded NW CAM, which brings together a network of research institutes, universities and enterprises to carry out research in advanced manufacturing. It is working with Ulster University on a number of projects, including looking at developing custom designed jigs for hospitals to produce D models. Cathy Coomber has been with axialD for three years. “What we have done in that time is looking at standardising the processes,” she says. “Biomedical engineers from Ulster University and those across the UK are producing data, manually segmenting thousands of medical images in order to help them develop an algorithm. “That allows us to massively improve our standardised process and reduce the time involved in producing those files.” That could mean reducing the time down from up to five hours, to as little as an hour. “When the company started, Daniel was able to get those early users excited in Glasgow, and then setting up in Belfast there were key surgeons which helped set the pace,” Katie McKinley, head of new business and strategic partnerships said. The company has since been involved with NHS frameworks as a means to help remove as many bottlenecks as possible. This involves developing and marketing the products to the NHS and HSC in the Republic – helping them to learn about the product, the process and what area of specialism it can be used in. “In the last  months with the development of the algorithms, we are moving in to the US,” Katie said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the US.” And the axialD team is also growing fast. “We have  staff at the moment but are looking to expand in  months,” Daniel said. “That includes new staff in the US to help grow and manage that market as we further expand our software team back home.” The success of axialD mirrors the overall success of Catalyst, since its inception  years ago. It’s an independent not-for-profit organisation across its four sites – including its largest base at the Titanic Quarter in Belfast, alongside its Londonderry hub, Ballymena, along with the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub at Danske Bank in Belfast city centre.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/jm_1.jpg","title":"how do you retain staff and keep them enjoying their job","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by Ulster Business With such intense competition for talent, the challenge for employers isn’t just finding prospective candidates, it’s also keeping them, writes John Moore, managing director of Hays NI Astonishingly, almost half of professionals surveyed in the Hays What Workers Want Report said that they left at least one new job within the first  months because it didn’t match expectations formed during the application process. A signicant number of our employees at Hays have been with us for , ,  and even  years, and we pride ourselves on growing our own talent and promoting from within. Although there are times when employees leave due to circumstances employers can’t control, organisations can create the right conditions to retain their staff for as long as possible. We believe there are three key areas. A sense of purpose Across ages, cultures and sectors, professionals need to get up in the morning knowing that they can make a dference. No matter how big or small, recognising a clear and meaningful purpose in your role is a huge driver for staff. Communication is key for employers. By prioritising employee progression, offering regular feedback and communicating the wider objectives of the business, employers can ensure their staff come to work each day with a strong purpose. Variety each day While not every task can be exciting, and some parts of a job will inevitably be more stimulating than others,the mundane becomes the usual, employees will think about moving on. Injecting iety into each week and staying interested at work partly falls on employees themselves, who can proactively seize opportunities. But a good employer should also push their staff and encourage them to work outside of their comfort zones. This ensures professionals can keep growing and developing within an organisation rather than move where. A strong network The people we work with have a huge bearing on our happiness levels at work. You simply can’t stay in a role long-termyou don’t enjoy working with those around you, so the importance and impact of these relationships are not to be underrated. Employers can help their staff develop a network of inspiring and admirable colleagues from their first day by making sure they receive proper introductions and support contacts. Workers who have these strong bonds feel a greater sense of belonging which keeps them wanting to work in their organisation. With these three points in mind, it’s important to consider how someone’s organisation and role makes them feel, rather than just how impactful their salary or bonus might be. After all, this is what can’t easily be replicated across organisations and can keep an employee with an organisation throughout their career.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"new  bedroom boutique hotel planned for belfast","story":"Posted on Wednesday September  by John Mulgrew A listed Belfast building could become a new hotel and restaurant as part of wider plans for a £m revamp of the city centre. Tribeca Belfast, formerly Royal Exchange, will see UK developer Castlebrooke redevelop much of the north side of the city centre. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. As part of the revised plans it wants to turn the listed former Assembly Rooms building at the corner of North Street and Waring Street into a new -bedroom hotel, with a restaurant and bars. That would involve knocking down part of the newer extension to the building, including the rear part of the former Northern Bank and the adjacent - North Street to “accommodate the new extension to form the proposed boutique hotel”. “The proposals for the existing building are similar in scope to that which was included as part of the extant approval. It is proposed to conservatively repair the existing historic fabric of the former Northern Bank,” a design statement says. “A key feature of the proposed extension is that the interface with the rearelevation of the existing listed bank building will be improved by setting back the footprint of the proposed extension so that the north west corner of the original building is readable.” The scheme includes the re-use and adaptation of the existing building as well as an extension on the footprint of the existing s extension on North Street. The extension will be set over five floors, with a rooftop bar, while upper floors are set back with metal cladding to the facades to “reduce the overall massing of the building and reflect the roofing materials or upper story treatment of surrounding buildings”. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. This summer the developer ran a fresh public consultation amid revised plans for the scheme, which included signicantly reducing a huge -storey building to around , retaining additional facades and dropping plans for an underground car park.

Before starting as a trainee solicitor in a City of London firm, I initially worked as a paralegal for three months in a law firm in Perth, enjoying the lestyle and dferent culture of le in Australia, and then spent a further three months travelling in Australia, New Zealand and Asia. After ing to London, I qualied as a solicitor and then spent eight years working in the real estate department of a London law firm. With two young children, we decided to move back to Northern Ireland in  when I joined Cleaver Fulton Rankin as an assistant solicitor. I have been here ever since and was made a director in . What have you found the most challenging during your years of business, so far  As we will all be aware, the real estate market can be a bit of a rollercoaster. Having been involved in some fantastic deals here in Northern Ireland, largely courtesy of the peace idend, this all came crashing to a halt in . For real estate lawyers in particular, this presented a fresh challenge in terms of expanding client base and ensuring that our teams were kept busy. For a number of years I spent more time advising clients on restructuring, acting for administrators or receivers in selling off assets and working on refinancing transactions. This proved to be a huge contrast to the positive and very visible growth in the economy seen in the previous years. Thankfully, the real estate sector again currently seems to be enjoying good growth with high rates offor investors. However, it has to be said that the lack of political leadership here does still give cause for concern. How would you describe your management style  The most important resource that we have is our young people, so I hopefully lead by example and seek to encourage them. In my view the carrot is always better than the stick. What would you changeyou could go back and do it all again  I have spent over  years now practising law, butI could go back to university again, rather than doing a law degree, I would have studied history. It would have meant an extra year spent in training, but I think it may have kept my interest slightly more than lectures on tort and equity. Have you done it all on your own  No, absolutely not. One of the main reasons for coming back to Northern Ireland was, with a young family, we had the benefit here of family support. My parents in particular, played a key role in helping with child care at a time when I was trying to establish my career. I never underestimate the dficulties facing working parents with young children who deserve all the credit and support that they can get. A strong support network is also very important in the office and I am lucky to have the benefit of some great lawyers around me to whom I can turn to for help when needed. How would you like your business to be remembered  As a leading commercial law firm in Northern Ireland that is independent and innovative provides high quality legal advice to its clients conducts business in a socially responsible and ethical matter has a strong commercial awareness and specialist legal professionals. What piece of advice would you give to a -year-old you  Believe in yourself, be flexible and above all when opportunities present themselves to you, grab them.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
