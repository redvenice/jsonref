Work is not even being discussed with him. The only priority is him getting better.’A rep for Ant has been contacted for comment.If you\u0027ve got a story, video or pictures get in touch with the  Entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page - we\u0027d love to hear from you.MORE: Lisa Armstrong likes motivational tweet by Kanye West as Ant McPartlin leaves rehabMORE: Ant McPartlin leaves rehab ‘looking brighter’ as he’s spotted walking his dog after month of treatment"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/sec_9714653.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"kylie jenner flaunts massive diamond ring splashing boyfriends theme park birthday","story":"She flaunted the ring on her wedding finger sparking engagement rumours with her fans (Picture: BACKGRID)Only the Kar-Jenner clan can get away with pairing huge diamond rings with gym gear, and that’s exactly what Kylie did when she was spotted shopping in Los Angeles in a pair of sports leggings and an over-sized hoodie.The beauty mogul is known for always being on fleek, and even looks her best in her comfys, as she glammed them up with eye-catching rings.It looks like she had taken some time off from her mummy duties and was cooling herself off with an iced drink after a serious shopping spree.Holding her plastic cup up to her face, the star showed off her latest accessories that she’d paired with a rather large diamond watch.Engagement rumours were reignited by her fans (Picture: REX)Previously that day, the 20-year-old had revealed her jewels on her Instagram story, and flaunted her matching nails in the video.Fans couldn’t help but notice that one of her rings was wrapped around her wedding finger, which instantly reignited the rumours she is engaged to Travis Scott.Maybe she’s just probably giving him a couple of hints though… Like, what more does the girl have to do?However, Kylie wearing a ring on that particular finger is nothing new, as she was seen sporting one in her birth announcement video.In a couple of shots she gave a glimpse of her hand, which looked to be bedecked with an engagement ring, but neither one of the new parents have confirmed (or denied) speculation.This weekend marks Travis’ 26th birthday and Kylie decided to rent out the entire Six Flags theme park so that her boyfriend and their pals could enjoy the rides (without any queuing!)As well as the pair taking on countless of stomach churning rides, the fashionista had also prepared a birthday cake for her beau that featured them on a roller coaster holding onto an icing version of Stormi.Kylie has rented out a theme park for her boyfriend’s birthday  (Picture: InstagramKylie Jenner)She said as she zoomed in to the figurines: ‘Stormi, that is insane.

You may see a recreational regime here in the next five years as well.’Max Zavet: ‘We see the UK as a huge opportunity to expand in’ (Picture: Jen Mills)He spent several days in London to make contacts in the hope of expanding his business once the laws have changed.‘It could start with export, but eventually the UK will probably want a domestic-grown product,’ he said.Emblem, which produces and sells dried flower as well as cannabis oils, is one of 14 companies who presented at the Cannabis Invest conference at the May Fair Hotel.The exclusive London hotel is not necessarily where you’d expect to find businessmen and high net worth investors discussing the THC content of ‘premium flower’.Cannabis Invest: Not your typical stoners (Picture: Jen Mills)Those attending were almost exclusively in suits and cufflinks, with only one sequinned jacket in sight.Some present admitted they had never even tried cannabis, but were there because they saw it as an exciting investment.It shows how far the drug has come in being seen as acceptable, with canapés and glass bottles of San Pellegrino offered to guests – rather than a large order of Pizza Hut.Emblem operates legally in CanadaMany of those presenting were Canadian, which makes sense as the country will make recreational use fully legal by September this year. Brits in attendance were more likely to be listening than leading the sessions.Max believes UK industry as a whole will lose out because businesses will be playing catch-up once it is made legal (although one of the largest cannabis companies in the world, GW Pharmaceuticals, is based in Britain).‘The UK is on the forefront of most industries, but I think the culture is maybe a little too conservative, and is afraid of a new substance to harm children and harm society,’ he said.‘That’s even though people are consuming it regularly anyway.’The conference at the May Fair Hotel (Picture: Jen Mills)It’s obviously simpler for cannabis-based companies to operate if the drug is legal, because investors won’t be afraid it’s an illegal operation so it will be easier to raise capital.This has put US companies at a disadvantage, even in states where it is legal, because banks are federally regulated and at a governmental level cannabis is still outlawed.The Home Office insists it has no plans to relax the laws in Britain, describing cannabis as a ‘harmful drug’.It has been linked to schizophrenia and depression, with the Royal College of Psychiatrists warning of the ‘risk of serious consequences for people, such as the development of an enduring psychotic illness, particularly in those who are genetically vulnerable.’However, despite this many are optimistic the laws will soon change.Travis Wong, who used to be an investment banker in London, also attended the conference and hopes to move into the UK market.‘In the future we would love to look into Europe and London,’ he told .‘In a lot of markets there’s a two-step process. They always start with allowing medical access, having a regulated market for patients who want THC and CBD to help with pain management.‘As soon as people start realising the world isn’t blowing up and it’s not a gateway drug and there’s not people high on cannabis all the time, the second phase is to go recreational.’‘From what I recall, the UK has a relatively high level of recreational usage.‘Public opinion will shift very quickly.‘Everyone can see it being a global shift in public opinion.’Cannabis in its raw form is not recognised in the UK as having any medicinal benefit.It is subject to strict controls, which means it cannot be prescribed or supplied to the public, and can only be used for research under a Home Office licence.Despite this, the UK is one of the largest producers and exporters of legal cannabis to other countries. GW Pharmaceuticals has a licence to grow it for medical use to create its brands Sativex and Epidiolex, used to treat MS and epilepsy.Many places around the world have legalised medical cannabis (Picture: Getty Images)A Home Office spokesman told  the government has no plans to legalise cannabis, medicinally or otherwise.They said: ‘Cannabis is a controlled Class B drug, as there is clear scientific and medical evidence that it is a harmful drug, which can damage people’s mental and physical health, as well as harming iniduals and communities. The government is ‘absolutely committed’ to reducing drug use, they added.Uruguay was the first country to fully legalise cannabis in 2013. In Canada, cannabis is expected to become legal for recreational use nationwide in August or September this year.Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont, Washington and Washington DC have legalised cannabis for recreational use, and dozens of states allow it for medical use.Many other countries allow it for medical use, including Israel, Italy, Denmark and Finland.Thousands of people gathered in London’s Hyde park on April 20, AKA 420 Day (Picture: Rex)Germany, Italy and Australia have recently relaxed their laws and are seen as exciting markets within the industry.‘I think the UK is probably going to take its regulation guidance from Canada, like Australia has,’ Max said.‘Yes the the UK is late, but there could be a robust and viable domestic industry. It could be a springboard to the rest of Europe.’MORE: This bloke’s been photographing his marijuana plants for over 30 yearsMORE: More than 5,000 weed smokers flock to Hyde Park for 420"},{"url":null,"title":"When Ramadan 2018 Muslims fast does date change year","story":"Who is Janelle Monae? \u0026#8216Pansexual\u0026#8217 singer and actor revealed after Rolling Stone interview SNL\u0026#8217s Colin Jost and Michael Che to host the Emmys 2018Legoland to give free entry to anyone called Louis after Royal baby namingMarvel films get Unnecessary Censorship during Jimmy Kimmel\u0027s Avengers: Infinity War weekKanye West to launch DONDA Social to help City of ChicagoStephen Colbert says Melania Trump deserves $130K shopping spree for her birthdayWho is Maya Jama?

And they were wealthy enough to employ six servants, socialise with the great and good of Leeds, and involve themselves in the politics of the day.

Together, the tentacles of their influence reached across the city.But the family was also struck by tragedy.Arthur’s wife Harriot, who was a cousin of Beatrix Potter’s mother Helen, died in childbirth in 1888, at the age of 35, before her famous cousin published her first children’s book The Tale of Peter Rabbit, leaving her husband a widower with three children Arthur, two, Elinor, one, and baby Elizabeth.

Within 11 months he was dead. A year later his father Arthur succumbed to grief.It was Hugo Lupton, son of Arthur’s younger brother Hugh and cousin of Kate’s great-grandmother Olive, who was responsible for linking the Luptons to Arthur Ransome.An old Wellingtonian and Trinity College alumnus, who won a Military Cross for his service in France, he married the author’s sister Joyce in 1920 and had four children Francis, in 1921, Arthur, in 1924, Cecily, in 1927, and Geoffrey, in 1930, ensuring the name Arthur went down through the generations.

Her paternal grandfather and uncle were both known as Charlie, although they were both christened Stephen Charles.The elder Charlie Goldsmith – Kate’s great-grandfather – was born at home in Acton, Middlesex, in 1886, and brought up in Southall. When he left home he lived in Uxbridge, where he worked as a mechanic and met his future wife Edith.A tiny woman, under 5 ft tall and weighing 7 stone, she was disfigured by a huge scar on her torso, which she had got during a narrow escape from death when she was a toddler.‘Grandad used to light his cigar in his big oil stove in the hall of the big house where they lived,’ his daughter Alice Tomlinson, the only one of his children still alive at 106 told me.‘He would roll a piece of paper up and put it in the stove and light his cigar. of course, when he went out, my mum copied. She had a go doing the same thing and nearly burned herself to death.’Charlie and Edith got married at Uxbridge Register office in 1909. She was four months pregnant with their eldest child, whom they named after his father.When Charlie Jnr was five years old, his father signed up, serving in France with the Royal Fusiliers, initially in the trenches and afterwards in the cookhouse. He was one of Kitchener’s ‘shilling men’.Luckily, he survived the war but returned home with emphysema. The father-of-six died in 1938, when his oldest son Charlie was 28 years old, and his youngest son, Kate’s grandfather Ronald was just six years old. His widow Edith was forced to move into a condemned flat and go to work at the local factory.Less than a century later, their great-granddaughter is living in Kensington Palace.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/27/20/4B77441D00000578-0-image-m-21_1524856582755.jpg","title":"Is royal baby look like","story":"    How a forensic artist predicted Prince Louis of Cambridge will look in years to comeThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have finally revealed the name of their newborn son, and this is how he could look in years to come.A forensic artist, who is based in Washington D.C, studied recent photographs of Prince William, Kate and their two eldest children.Joe Mullins then put together an image of what he predicts Prince Louis will look like in the future.According to Mr Mullins\u0027 predictions the youngster will have blue eyes, dark blonde hair and full cheeks.He has previously released images of what he predicted Prince George and Princess Charlotte would look like as they grew up.At the time Mr Mullins\u0027 pictures suggested that the children would both have dark hair and blue eyes.  Royalists and bookmakers alike have waited patiently since Monday to find out the name of the new arrival and fifth in line to the throne.     Joe Mullins has previously released images of what he predicted Prince George and Princess Charlotte would look like as they grew upThe name serves as a poignant tribute to Prince Charles\u0027 beloved great-uncle, mentor and \u0027honorary grandfather\u0027, Lord Mountbatten, who was killed in 1979 when the IRA placed a bomb in his fishing boat.   More than 100,000 bets were placed across the UK betting industry on the baby name, with both Albert and Arthur leading the way as the bookmakers\u0027 favourite.Legoland to give free entry to anyone called Louis after...Share this articleBut William and Kate have plumped for a moniker used for centuries across the Channel by the French, who have had 18 kings called Louis.    Following the baby\u0027s arrival, Prince Harry shifts down the line of succession to sixth place. The Duke of York, who was born second in line, has moved to seventh and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie to eighth and ninth.             According to Mr Mullins\u0027 predictions the youngster will have blue eyes, dark blonde hair and full cheeksAndrew falling out of the top six means he will no longer have to ask the Queen for permission to marry - unlike Charles, William, George, Charlotte and Harry.The first six people in the line of succession must have the Queen\u0027s consent before they can marry on May 19, as set out by the Succession to the Crown Act 2013.The act\u0027s introduction also saw sex removed as a determining factor in the line of succession.It has also been claimed that the royal baby has been born a commoner.Royal historian Marlene Koenig told Town and Country: \u0027It sounds complicated, but in the UK, the only people who are not commoners are the Sovereign and peers of the realm, Duke, Marquess, Earl, Viscount, and Baron.\u0027  It was always thought that William and Kate would go on to have three children.Kate is one of three and had a happy home life with her sister, Pippa Matthews, and brother, James Middleton, and is close to both of her siblings.But William may need to adjust to caring for a newborn once again.Kate joked in the months leading up to her due date that her husband was \u0027in denial\u0027 about having a third.By having more than two children, William and Kate are following in the footsteps of the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh, who went on to have four children - although there was a gap of 10 years between their second child, Anne, and third, Andrew. Is this what royal baby could look like?

He also sustained a broken upper and low jaw, broken arms and internal injuries.

His father left farming to become a dental technician, and  the family subsequently moved to Santa Monica, California.When Dean was just nine-years-old, his mother died of cancer. Unable to look after his son alone, his father sent him to live with his aunt and uncle on a farm in Fairmount, Indiana, where he was raised in a Quaker background.

He dropped out in January 1951 to pursue an acting career full-time and moved to New York City.Three years later, he caught the attention of director Elia Kazan, while portraying a gay houseboy in the play, The Immoralist.   With John Steinbeck’s approval, Kazan cast Dean in a screen adaptation of Steinbeck’s novel, East of Eden, launching him into stardom. A lover of speed, he reportedly used part of his advance for East of Eden to buy a red convertible and a motorcycle. He later purchased a white Porsche Super Speedster, which he used to compete in road races.The contract for his next film, Giant, banned him from racing, but upon finishing the film, he traded in the Speedster for the more powerful Porsche 550 Spyder, which he nicknamed \u0027Little Bastard\u0027.           Giant, which starred Dean alongside Elizabeth Taylor, was the young actor\u0027s second filmOn the very same day as his fatal crash, a police officer fined Dean for going 65 mph in a 55 mph zone.

Workshops will be run to give parents ‘simple, straightforward strategies’ which they can take home and use with pre-school children.Mr Hinds said last night: ‘We know there is a gap in child development that can be visible at age five. The easiest way to measure it is the “word gap”.‘Where you are, in development terms, at age five and at the start of school, obviously makes a significant difference to your ability to get the most out of infant school and then junior school education.’The OUP report found that when children arrive unable to understand basic phrases, they find it much harder to follow commands, make friends and learn how to read. In the long term, it can lead to low confidence, underachievement and poor behaviour.      Music lessons boosts a child’s brainpower as their memory...Is this Britain\u0027s most hipster school? Children at new...Share this articleMr Hinds said he wanted to provide more support to parents to help them feel comfortable reading to their children and interacting with them so they can develop their social skills. He added that he and wife Jacqui, a teacher, had enjoyed reading books with their three children. ‘Reading to children obviously makes a huge difference,’ he said. ‘Many, many parents spend an awful lot of time doing that.‘The important thing is to be reading, and to be giving feedback, and sitting together, and all of those things that parents dedicate so much time to.’Mr Hinds – who became Education Secretary in January, taking over from Justine Greening – said: ‘Schools do a great job on accelerating development. But it is still the case that with the differences that are discernible even at age five or sometimes even before, it is all too depressingly predictable what some of the later differences in attainment will be at 16 or 18.‘The earliest years are where there is the greatest leverage for improving social mobility and improving children’s opportunity to fulfil their potential.’          Experts say disadvantaged children are disproportionately affected by the growing problem (file photo)However, he said some parents – especially those juggling many different responsibilities or jobs – may be finding it hard to dedicate enough time to helping their children develop skills.He said: ‘It’s always hard for parents and, yes, there are extra pressures in the modern world. It is difficult. Parents know that, and that’s why it’s so important when you can find ways… for professionals to give hints and tips to make it easier – I think that’s something that parents can find very valuable.’Today Mr Hinds is launching a £5 million pilot scheme in the North of England to help parents teach their children vocabulary at home through reading and singing nursery rhymes. It will be run by the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) and will provide workshops in nurseries, community centres and homes. The projects found to be most effective could later be rolled out across the country.In addition, £8.5 million has been made available to councils across the country for language and literacy development projects for disadvantaged children.EEF chief executive Sir Kevan Collins said: ‘By testing different ways of tackling issues like the early years “word gap”, this new fund will give us much-needed information about how we can give parents the tools they need to give their child the very best start in life.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/18/09/05D76DB9000003E8-0-image-a-27_1524038970727.jpg","title":"Murray swaps tennis strokes brush strokes","story":"    The two-time Wimbledon winner has picked up a brush while recovering from injuryThe father of two – whose wife Kim Sears paints pet portraits – is due to make a comeback soon after hip surgery in January.

I tried to see if I could see the scuff of the ball and the heel of his shoe in the paint.It could even be seen as a self-portrait in an abstract way because it represents him, the tennis player.I could almost see him with racquet in one hand and his tennis ball covered in paint in the other, whacking a ball against the canvas. But we’ve got to be a little bit tongue-in-cheek. I wouldn’t imagine that he’s saying, ‘I’m an artist’. But perhaps his wife Kim Sears, who is a fantastic dog portraitist, has had a great influence on him.If Pollock had picked up a tennis racquet we wouldn’t have said he’s going to win Wimbledon tomorrow.

VERY protective rhino charges a herd...Share this articleFairfield Farm, in south Devon, is home to a herd of Guernsey cows. Run by Chris and Louise Carpenter, it makes Auntie Moo’s Golden Guernsey Ice Cream. The couple’s website says: ‘We are passionate about what we do and strive to create the most delicious ice cream and Guernsey beef.’At the farm, Viva found what the industry calls a ‘downer’ cow – a cow may ‘go down’ due to temporary nerve paralysis caused by calving difficulties or fatigue. Viva director Juliet Gellatley said: ‘On a wet, filthy concrete floor we came across a cow who was so ill she couldn’t move, not even lift her head.           Images from Fairfield Farm in south Devon, which showed some calves in small hutches - each one surrounded by a metal fence          One brown and white calf at the farm lies on the floor with large sores on its bodyHer body was wasting away and revealed large sores... We called the RSPCA and a local vet who... agreed with us that this poor creature was suffering and used his authority to put her out of her misery.’The vet, Howard Liebermann, said: ‘She was really dull and unable to rise and certainly she’s not on great bedding. There was quite a lot of bruising around and suffering.’Footage also showed calves in small hutches, each one surrounded by a metal fence. Farmers can take newborn calves from their mothers to these hutches for the first eight weeks of their lives. But Viva said ear-tag data suggested these calves were 16 weeks old and too big for the hutches, breaching welfare rules.A few miles away in south Devon is Halswell Farm, part of the Arla dairy organisation. It is the UK’s second largest dairy firm supplying milk to supermarkets and owns popular brands such as Cravendale and Anchor butter.At Halswell, Viva found an old, apparently emaciated cow with an injured back leg that was barely able to walk. Miss Gellatley added: ‘There were also countless examples of shockingly oversized and distorted udders.’ Viva has complained about both farms to the watchdog for farm animal welfare, the Animal \u0026amp Plant Health Agency. But the Carpenter family’s solicitors, Clarke Willmott, said a vet had examined its cows on April 19.It said ‘no animal welfare issues were identified’. And it described the claims as ‘vague’ and ‘inaccurate’, denying cows were emaciated.Arla issued a statement on behalf of itself and Halswell Farm, which is part of the Red Tractor scheme, which means it is independently inspected. It said: ‘Over 2,400 farmers are part of the farmer-owned Arla Foods. This footage is not representative of their farming methods or their approach to animal welfare.’ It added: ‘This farm was visited by an independent vet and Red Tractor and there were no immediate welfare concerns from either independent party.’Michael Oakes, of the National Farmers Union, said: ‘The reality is animals, just like humans, can occasionally receive injuries or be treated for different conditions.

It cannot simply be a take it or leave it choice as the Prime Minister has suggested.‘This amendment, which has cross-party support, would provide a safety net in the Brexit process. \u0027It would remove the possibility of a “No” vote leading to a no-deal. It would bring back control to Parliament.’          Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the Tory backbench European Research Group, warned last week that peers risked voting themselves into extinction by attempting to thwart BrexitLord Callanan, the Brexit Minister in the Lords, said: ‘This flawed amendment seeks to tie our hands by inserting false deadlines and shifting the power to negotiate from Government to Parliament. \u0027It asks for meaningless votes on the deal before the deal is done.‘Those who want to overturn the referendum call this the “no Brexit” amendment. \u0027The Conservatives are taking the scrutinising role of Parliament seriously, to improve an essential piece of legislation.

The deal would create a new titan with a bigger market share than Tesco, but it will be closely scrutinised by the Competition and Markets AuthorityThe fact they are considering the tie-up shows the massive changes that have swept the UK grocery business in the past few years.German discounters Aldi and Lidl are growing at a ferocious pace, keeping prices far below what British rivals can offer and wooing the middle class with an increasingly high-end range of food.Any efforts by the merged group to cut their costs is sure to draw a robust response from the Germans.And unlike Sainsbury’s, which is listed on the stock market and must make profits or suffer a fall in its share price, they can afford to lose money for an extended period of time if it helps them win the battle.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said it is vital that the CMA takes action.The former business secretary said: ‘The competition inquiry has to focus on the customers, that is their job.’Labour’s business spokesman, Rebecca Long-Bailey, said: ‘This merger risks squeezing what little competition there is in the groceries market even further and moves alarmingly close to the creation of a supermarket monopoly.’ The deal will be a crucial first test for former Tory MP Andrew Tyrie, the ex-head of the Treasury select committee, who is taking over as CMA chairman later this year.Retail analyst Richard Hyman said: ‘This is an enormous deal and there are huge ramifications. The strengthening of buying power is key but no one in this market is going to come close to matching Aldi on price.

This could be done in several ways, including by buying a large number of Sainsbury’s shares or keeping a holding in Asda and running it as a joint venture.The deal will also give Sainsbury’s and Asda an opportunity to boost the non-food products they offer. Asda has a popular clothing range, George, which serves 800,000 customers a week online alone.Sainsbury’s bought high street chain Argos for £1.4billion in 2016 and has since shut dozens of its stores, replacing them with around 200 Argos outlets inside its supermarkets.Sainsbury’s Tu range of clothes is now available from Argos stores as well.There will inevitably be speculation that Argos shops will now open inside Asda.Mr Hyman added that the Sainsbury’s buying team will be able to boost Asda’s ranges, which are seen by many analysts as tired.Full details of the deal are being revealed in a stock market announcement this morning."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/30/01/4BB150CA00000578-5672455-image-m-34_1525047617415.jpg","title":"Tesla autopilot saves driver collision semi truck","story":"    Jeremy Visnesky was driving through North Carolina on I-95 when a semi driver \u0027decided to nod off or play with his phone or something\u0027 and drifted into the Model X\u0027s lane while passing          The Tesla\u0027s Autopilot system appears to detect the intrusion, triggering a quick evasive swerve toward the other edge of its lane to dodge the truckBut on this occasion, the Tesla\u0027s high-powered Autopilot computer intervened which saw the car also move to the right, out of the way of danger. It all happened so quickly there was barely enough time to even slam the horn, but the Tesla computer\u0027s intervention surely saved the car from being scraped by the truck - or something even worse. Driver Jeremy Visnesky posted the video online and wrote: \u0027I-95 south driving through North Carolina and a semi decided to nod off or play with his phone or something.

Indeed, in what appeared to be an effort to crack a joke, self-deprecating Kim Jong-un told the South’s Mr Moon that he was sorry that the timing of the early morning missile test had led to him being woken up at an anti-social hour.This sudden change in mood music raises an intriguing question: could this young despot might be positioning himself as his region’s version of Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Communist leader whose overtures to the West helped bring about the end of the Cold War?Of course, reading tea-leaves from Pyongyang is often a mug’s game, given that little is known regarding even very basic details of life inside the secretive far-Left dictatorship. The country is largely closed to foreign reporters and visitors, aside from those who visit on closely chaperoned tours, and foreign diplomats have little access to reliable intelligence.There is no free press, and the country’s version of the internet, the kwangmyong, which is largely used by academics and civil servants, reportedly permits access to a mere 28 websites.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tells Kim Jong Un that he...Dennis Rodman claims he\u0027s responsible for easing tension...Share this articleYet what little we do know about Kim Jong-un suggests that his life has given him far more of an understanding of Western values than either his immediate predecessor and father, Kim Jong-il, or his grandfather Kim Il-Sung, who ruled the country with an iron fist from 1948 until his death in 1994.Crucial in this context is the fact that, aged 15, Jong-un was sent to an exclusive international college near Berne in Switzerland, before moving to the nearby Liebefeld-Steinholzli state school.Living there under a pseudonym, Un Pak, he was described to classmates as the son of a diplomat.Though apparently displaying little academic prowess, he developed a lifelong passion for Disney films and basketball, becoming a supporter of the pre-eminent U.S. team of the era, the Chicago Bulls.The team’s former star player Dennis Rodman has in recent years conducted several high-profile visits to Pyongyang.Nowadays a reality TV personality, with multiple tattoos and piercings, Rodman was almost certainly paid for the privilege.          \u0027U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last night said there was now real opportunity for a nuclear deal\u0027However there was also some truth in the suggestion that, as he put it, the visits helped to ‘break the ice’ between the nations. The Washington Post newspaper went so far last year as to speculate that Trump had given a 2017 visit his blessing, as a way to open a channel of communication between the countries.Aside from basketball, the young Kim Jong-un is said to have developed a passion for ‘rosti’ – the calorie-laden Swiss national potato dish in the style of a fritter, which contributed to his subsequent obesity — and spent plenty of time on his host nation’s ski slopes.Perhaps that explains why he has not only recently ordered the construction of Masik Pass — a new multi-million-pound ski resort — but was also anxious to send a large delegation to this year’s Winter Olympics, which were held in the South. A large orchestra, and squad of cheerleaders, turned out to support the North Korean team, while several diplomats met their counterparts from over the border, helping build momentum for last week’s summit.          \u0027Kim Jong-un’s wife Ri Sol-Ju is believed to have provided informal elocution lessons\u0027Time in the West also gave Kim Jong-un a far more cultured manner than his father, who was almost never heard speaking publicly (TV tended to voiceover images of his addresses), and whose absurdly-shrill real voice was only revealed when tape recordings were leaked of his calls to a kidnapped South Korean actress he was obsessed with.As a result, Kim Jong-un’s address on Friday, at which he described the two Koreas as ‘one nation’ who would in future ‘share in prosperity’ was confidently delivered.His wife Ri Sol-Ju is believed to have provided informal elocution lessons.Another key factor behind Kim Jong-Un’s sudden conversion to the pursuit of peace is likely to be straightforward pragmatism.Indeed, there are those who believe that, rather from being hot headed and impulsive, he is actually a calculating premier. To thisend, it’s worth noting that when he took office in 2011, at the tender age of 29, Kim Jong-un promised to bring his people prosperity and give their nation status as a nuclear power.Years of sanctions have since crippled North Korea’s economy, with its entire annual GDP of $40 billion coming in at under 2 per cent that of the South. Though it has been partly propped up by China, that support is thought to have evaporated after recent missile tests, with Beijing anxious to avoid economic refugees heading over its border.Abandoning nuclear ambitions will therefore give Kim Jong-un a sporting chance of keeping at least one of his promises.Indeed reports from Friday’s state dinner with the South suggest that — having put away a few glasses of champagne — he somewhat unexpectedly confessed that he was ‘embarrassed’ by his nation’s ‘poor infrastructure’ and determined to do something about it.That could just be the drink talking (there is some suggestion that he looked ‘bleary eyed’ during the meal) but it seems apparent even a mild thaw in relations will at this stage serve the interest of almost every player in the region, and also the U.S. (since Mr Trump can present it as a diplomatic triumph).In the longer term, of course, the big question is whether Kim Jong-un will actually keep his promises of nuclear disarmament.A decade ago, for example, foreign journalists were invited to watch his regime destroying a nuclear reactor cooling tower, in an effort to stave off sanctions. Yet it later turned out that, behind the scenes, they were already building a second facility.This time, cynics wonder if something similar is afoot. Indeed some analysts believe that the Punggye-ri underground test site, which he has so graciously pledged to publicly destroy, is in fact already useless because previous tests have caused structural damage.Mr Kim of course insists otherwise, using Friday’s State banquet to inform the South that the facility contains at least two tunnels which are currently in ‘good condition’. And so the ‘Rocket Man’ continues to rebrand himself as a man of peace — while the world prays he’s telling the truth. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/29/01/4BA991E900000578-5668707-image-a-9_1524960733254.jpg","title":"Supermarkets Asda Sainsburys talks merger","story":"    The tie-up is seen as a response to the relentless rise of German discounters Aldi and Lidl, which have been chipping away at the big supermarkets over the past few years, as well as online operations such as Ocado.Lidl and Aldi now have a combined market share of 12.6 per cent – more than fourth-largest grocer Morrisons.

Workshops will be run to give parents ‘simple, straightforward strategies’ which they can take home and use with pre-school children.Mr Hinds said last night: ‘We know there is a gap in child development that can be visible at age five. The easiest way to measure it is the “word gap”.‘Where you are, in development terms, at age five and at the start of school, obviously makes a significant difference to your ability to get the most out of infant school and then junior school education.’The OUP report found that when children arrive unable to understand basic phrases, they find it much harder to follow commands, make friends and learn how to read. In the long term, it can lead to low confidence, underachievement and poor behaviour.      Music lessons boosts a child’s brainpower as their memory...Is this Britain\u0027s most hipster school? Children at new...Share this articleMr Hinds said he wanted to provide more support to parents to help them feel comfortable reading to their children and interacting with them so they can develop their social skills. He added that he and wife Jacqui, a teacher, had enjoyed reading books with their three children. ‘Reading to children obviously makes a huge difference,’ he said. ‘Many, many parents spend an awful lot of time doing that.‘The important thing is to be reading, and to be giving feedback, and sitting together, and all of those things that parents dedicate so much time to.’Mr Hinds – who became Education Secretary in January, taking over from Justine Greening – said: ‘Schools do a great job on accelerating development. But it is still the case that with the differences that are discernible even at age five or sometimes even before, it is all too depressingly predictable what some of the later differences in attainment will be at 16 or 18.‘The earliest years are where there is the greatest leverage for improving social mobility and improving children’s opportunity to fulfil their potential.’          Experts say disadvantaged children are disproportionately affected by the growing problem (file photo)However, he said some parents – especially those juggling many different responsibilities or jobs – may be finding it hard to dedicate enough time to helping their children develop skills.He said: ‘It’s always hard for parents and, yes, there are extra pressures in the modern world. It is difficult. Parents know that, and that’s why it’s so important when you can find ways… for professionals to give hints and tips to make it easier – I think that’s something that parents can find very valuable.’Today Mr Hinds is launching a £5 million pilot scheme in the North of England to help parents teach their children vocabulary at home through reading and singing nursery rhymes. It will be run by the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF) and will provide workshops in nurseries, community centres and homes. The projects found to be most effective could later be rolled out across the country.In addition, £8.5 million has been made available to councils across the country for language and literacy development projects for disadvantaged children.EEF chief executive Sir Kevan Collins said: ‘By testing different ways of tackling issues like the early years “word gap”, this new fund will give us much-needed information about how we can give parents the tools they need to give their child the very best start in life.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/29/22/4BAEFF2200000578-0-image-m-93_1525036256421.jpg","title":"Founder 82 private school legal action against parent","story":"    A mother accused founder and bursar Brenda Brown (circled) of violently prodding her child with a walking stick and verbally abusing herThey allege she defamed them with malicious online lies and accuse her and her supporters of trying to ‘extort’ £130,000 from the school.In April 2015, Princess Beatrice visited the school where she talked of her own dyslexia battles, and shook hands with the owners while praising the school’s work.

There was quite a lot of bruising around and suffering.’Footage also showed calves in small hutches, each one surrounded by a metal fence. Farmers can take newborn calves from their mothers to these hutches for the first eight weeks of their lives. But Viva said ear-tag data suggested these calves were 16 weeks old and too big for the hutches, breaching welfare rules.A few miles away in south Devon is Halswell Farm, part of the Arla dairy organisation. It is the UK’s second largest dairy firm supplying milk to supermarkets and owns popular brands such as Cravendale and Anchor butter.At Halswell, Viva found an old, apparently emaciated cow with an injured back leg that was barely able to walk. Miss Gellatley added: ‘There were also countless examples of shockingly oversized and distorted udders.’ Viva has complained about both farms to the watchdog for farm animal welfare, the Animal \u0026amp Plant Health Agency. But the Carpenter family’s solicitors, Clarke Willmott, said a vet had examined its cows on April 19.It said ‘no animal welfare issues were identified’. And it described the claims as ‘vague’ and ‘inaccurate’, denying cows were emaciated.Arla issued a statement on behalf of itself and Halswell Farm, which is part of the Red Tractor scheme, which means it is independently inspected. It said: ‘Over 2,400 farmers are part of the farmer-owned Arla Foods. This footage is not representative of their farming methods or their approach to animal welfare.’ It added: ‘This farm was visited by an independent vet and Red Tractor and there were no immediate welfare concerns from either independent party.’Michael Oakes, of the National Farmers Union, said: ‘The reality is animals, just like humans, can occasionally receive injuries or be treated for different conditions.

It cannot simply be a take it or leave it choice as the Prime Minister has suggested.‘This amendment, which has cross-party support, would provide a safety net in the Brexit process. \u0027It would remove the possibility of a “No” vote leading to a no-deal. It would bring back control to Parliament.’          Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the Tory backbench European Research Group, warned last week that peers risked voting themselves into extinction by attempting to thwart BrexitLord Callanan, the Brexit Minister in the Lords, said: ‘This flawed amendment seeks to tie our hands by inserting false deadlines and shifting the power to negotiate from Government to Parliament. \u0027It asks for meaningless votes on the deal before the deal is done.‘Those who want to overturn the referendum call this the “no Brexit” amendment. \u0027The Conservatives are taking the scrutinising role of Parliament seriously, to improve an essential piece of legislation. Labour are using it to frustrate Brexit.’Remain-backing peers have so far inflicted six defeats on the EU Withdrawal Bill, which proposes powers for ministers to change regulations with limited parliamentary scrutiny.Ministers argue the powers are needed to ensure that thousands of EU regulations are transferred on to the UK’s statute book before Brexit. But peers are using amendments to the Bill in a bid to soften the Government’s negotiating stance, including inflicting a defeat earlier this month on the issue of leaving the customs union.Jacob Rees-Mogg, chairman of the Tory backbench European Research Group, warned last week that peers risked voting themselves into extinction by attempting to thwart Brexit.He said the defeats on the legislation preparing for Brexit were a case of the ‘peers against the people’ and that they ‘have to decide whether they love ermine or the EU more’.‘They are trying to stop the largest ever public vote in our history,’ he said. ‘We are in a position of peers against the people.‘It is deeply unattractive and I think it is the weakest position for the House of Lords to be in.‘There is a problem with the House of Lords in that it is very condescending towards the democratic vote. \u0027They seem to think that they know better than 17.4million people.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/29/00/4BA835A000000578-0-image-a-7_1524957451359.jpg","title":"Hundreds stores close Sainsburys Asda plot merger","story":"    Sainsbury\u0027s and Asda could be forced to sell hundreds of stores if they are to win approval for their merger from the competition watchdogThe regulator could order the two chains to sell hundreds of stores before it approves the merger.And the CMA is likely to come under pressure to block the deal altogether to prevent consumers losing choice and to protect farmers, who rely on fair prices from the supermarkets to survive.The chains are thought to want to avoid store closures because they serve very different customers, with Sainsbury’s focusing on the middle class while Asda targets customers chasing a bargain and has a greater presence in the North.\u0027Keep the shops well lit\u0027: Last words of the man who founded...Asda stores set to become Sainsbury\u0027s if huge £15BILLION...Share this articleBoth brands are thought likely to continue to be used, even keeping their own head offices, but they are expected to combine their food buying teams and use new-found muscle to drive down prices.Their tie-up is the biggest change in food retailing since Morrisons swallowed Safeway 14 years ago.It will turn the Big Four grocers into the Big Three and will make the new group the largest of them all with a combined market share of 31.4 per cent versus Tesco’s 27.6 per cent.Combined, Asda and Sainsbury’s will have around 2,000 stores, almost 350,000 staff and annual sales of nearly £50billion.          The deal would create a new titan with a bigger market share than Tesco, but it will be closely scrutinised by the Competition and Markets AuthorityThe fact they are considering the tie-up shows the massive changes that have swept the UK grocery business in the past few years.German discounters Aldi and Lidl are growing at a ferocious pace, keeping prices far below what British rivals can offer and wooing the middle class with an increasingly high-end range of food.Any efforts by the merged group to cut their costs is sure to draw a robust response from the Germans.And unlike Sainsbury’s, which is listed on the stock market and must make profits or suffer a fall in its share price, they can afford to lose money for an extended period of time if it helps them win the battle.Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said it is vital that the CMA takes action.The former business secretary said: ‘The competition inquiry has to focus on the customers, that is their job.’Labour’s business spokesman, Rebecca Long-Bailey, said: ‘This merger risks squeezing what little competition there is in the groceries market even further and moves alarmingly close to the creation of a supermarket monopoly.’ The deal will be a crucial first test for former Tory MP Andrew Tyrie, the ex-head of the Treasury select committee, who is taking over as CMA chairman later this year.Retail analyst Richard Hyman said: ‘This is an enormous deal and there are huge ramifications. The strengthening of buying power is key but no one in this market is going to come close to matching Aldi on price.          The chains serve very different customers, with Sainsbury’s focusing on the middle class while Asda targets customers chasing a bargain and has a greater presence in the North‘Aldi is family-owned and in it for the long term – if it needs to not make money for a few years, then it will.’Tesco is also likely to respond vigorously to the takeover.Its chief executive, Dave Lewis, is on the brink of completing a major turnaround push at the company and is sure to take aggressive action to stop that being undermined by the rise of the new empire.Last night it was unclear exactly what form the tie-up will take, with Asda’s owner, US retail giant Walmart, expected to retain a significant stake in the new organisation. This could be done in several ways, including by buying a large number of Sainsbury’s shares or keeping a holding in Asda and running it as a joint venture.The deal will also give Sainsbury’s and Asda an opportunity to boost the non-food products they offer. Asda has a popular clothing range, George, which serves 800,000 customers a week online alone.Sainsbury’s bought high street chain Argos for £1.4billion in 2016 and has since shut dozens of its stores, replacing them with around 200 Argos outlets inside its supermarkets.Sainsbury’s Tu range of clothes is now available from Argos stores as well.There will inevitably be speculation that Argos shops will now open inside Asda.Mr Hyman added that the Sainsbury’s buying team will be able to boost Asda’s ranges, which are seen by many analysts as tired.Full details of the deal are being revealed in a stock market announcement this morning."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/04/30/01/4BB150CA00000578-5672455-image-m-34_1525047617415.jpg","title":"Tesla autopilot saves driver collision semi truck","story":"    Jeremy Visnesky was driving through North Carolina on I-95 when a semi driver \u0027decided to nod off or play with his phone or something\u0027 and drifted into the Model X\u0027s lane while passing          The Tesla\u0027s Autopilot system appears to detect the intrusion, triggering a quick evasive swerve toward the other edge of its lane to dodge the truckBut on this occasion, the Tesla\u0027s high-powered Autopilot computer intervened which saw the car also move to the right, out of the way of danger. It all happened so quickly there was barely enough time to even slam the horn, but the Tesla computer\u0027s intervention surely saved the car from being scraped by the truck - or something even worse. Driver Jeremy Visnesky posted the video online and wrote: \u0027I-95 south driving through North Carolina and a semi decided to nod off or play with his phone or something.

Indeed, in what appeared to be an effort to crack a joke, self-deprecating Kim Jong-un told the South’s Mr Moon that he was sorry that the timing of the early morning missile test had led to him being woken up at an anti-social hour.This sudden change in mood music raises an intriguing question: could this young despot might be positioning himself as his region’s version of Mikhail Gorbachev, the Soviet Communist leader whose overtures to the West helped bring about the end of the Cold War?Of course, reading tea-leaves from Pyongyang is often a mug’s game, given that little is known regarding even very basic details of life inside the secretive far-Left dictatorship. The country is largely closed to foreign reporters and visitors, aside from those who visit on closely chaperoned tours, and foreign diplomats have little access to reliable intelligence.There is no free press, and the country’s version of the internet, the kwangmyong, which is largely used by academics and civil servants, reportedly permits access to a mere 28 websites.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tells Kim Jong Un that he...Dennis Rodman claims he\u0027s responsible for easing tension...Share this articleYet what little we do know about Kim Jong-un suggests that his life has given him far more of an understanding of Western values than either his immediate predecessor and father, Kim Jong-il, or his grandfather Kim Il-Sung, who ruled the country with an iron fist from 1948 until his death in 1994.Crucial in this context is the fact that, aged 15, Jong-un was sent to an exclusive international college near Berne in Switzerland, before moving to the nearby Liebefeld-Steinholzli state school.Living there under a pseudonym, Un Pak, he was described to classmates as the son of a diplomat.Though apparently displaying little academic prowess, he developed a lifelong passion for Disney films and basketball, becoming a supporter of the pre-eminent U.S. team of the era, the Chicago Bulls.The team’s former star player Dennis Rodman has in recent years conducted several high-profile visits to Pyongyang.Nowadays a reality TV personality, with multiple tattoos and piercings, Rodman was almost certainly paid for the privilege.          \u0027U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last night said there was now real opportunity for a nuclear deal\u0027However there was also some truth in the suggestion that, as he put it, the visits helped to ‘break the ice’ between the nations. The Washington Post newspaper went so far last year as to speculate that Trump had given a 2017 visit his blessing, as a way to open a channel of communication between the countries.Aside from basketball, the young Kim Jong-un is said to have developed a passion for ‘rosti’ – the calorie-laden Swiss national potato dish in the style of a fritter, which contributed to his subsequent obesity — and spent plenty of time on his host nation’s ski slopes.Perhaps that explains why he has not only recently ordered the construction of Masik Pass — a new multi-million-pound ski resort — but was also anxious to send a large delegation to this year’s Winter Olympics, which were held in the South. A large orchestra, and squad of cheerleaders, turned out to support the North Korean team, while several diplomats met their counterparts from over the border, helping build momentum for last week’s summit.          \u0027Kim Jong-un’s wife Ri Sol-Ju is believed to have provided informal elocution lessons\u0027Time in the West also gave Kim Jong-un a far more cultured manner than his father, who was almost never heard speaking publicly (TV tended to voiceover images of his addresses), and whose absurdly-shrill real voice was only revealed when tape recordings were leaked of his calls to a kidnapped South Korean actress he was obsessed with.As a result, Kim Jong-un’s address on Friday, at which he described the two Koreas as ‘one nation’ who would in future ‘share in prosperity’ was confidently delivered.His wife Ri Sol-Ju is believed to have provided informal elocution lessons.Another key factor behind Kim Jong-Un’s sudden conversion to the pursuit of peace is likely to be straightforward pragmatism.Indeed, there are those who believe that, rather from being hot headed and impulsive, he is actually a calculating premier. To thisend, it’s worth noting that when he took office in 2011, at the tender age of 29, Kim Jong-un promised to bring his people prosperity and give their nation status as a nuclear power.Years of sanctions have since crippled North Korea’s economy, with its entire annual GDP of $40 billion coming in at under 2 per cent that of the South. Though it has been partly propped up by China, that support is thought to have evaporated after recent missile tests, with Beijing anxious to avoid economic refugees heading over its border.Abandoning nuclear ambitions will therefore give Kim Jong-un a sporting chance of keeping at least one of his promises.Indeed reports from Friday’s state dinner with the South suggest that — having put away a few glasses of champagne — he somewhat unexpectedly confessed that he was ‘embarrassed’ by his nation’s ‘poor infrastructure’ and determined to do something about it.That could just be the drink talking (there is some suggestion that he looked ‘bleary eyed’ during the meal) but it seems apparent even a mild thaw in relations will at this stage serve the interest of almost every player in the region, and also the U.S. (since Mr Trump can present it as a diplomatic triumph).In the longer term, of course, the big question is whether Kim Jong-un will actually keep his promises of nuclear disarmament.A decade ago, for example, foreign journalists were invited to watch his regime destroying a nuclear reactor cooling tower, in an effort to stave off sanctions. Yet it later turned out that, behind the scenes, they were already building a second facility.This time, cynics wonder if something similar is afoot. Indeed some analysts believe that the Punggye-ri underground test site, which he has so graciously pledged to publicly destroy, is in fact already useless because previous tests have caused structural damage.Mr Kim of course insists otherwise, using Friday’s State banquet to inform the South that the facility contains at least two tunnels which are currently in ‘good condition’. And so the ‘Rocket Man’ continues to rebrand himself as a man of peace — while the world prays he’s telling the truth. "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aa575d6bb00721058a9a6af7e4c46b8455d02fc6/0_1490_6149_3690/master/6149.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0bd3fcea1adec0e7eedf42a4f64f0e75","title":"big picture jonas bendiksen sleeping baby home","story":"Last year, a group of photographers from the Magnum agency were invited to reflect on the idea of “home”, each using the same medium-format camera. One of them, Jonas Bendiksen, a Norwegian photographer, has won international awards for his pictures of people just about as far away from home as can be – from isolated communities in newly independent states of the former Soviet Union to a book of photographs of urban slums around the world.Turning his camera toward the intimate, Bendiksen used the opportunity to track the arrival of his new baby daughter, Billie, through his wife Anna’s pregnancy to the birth. In publishing the pictures in Magnum’s book Bendiksen, who has a photojournalist’s distrust of the familiar, is apologetic about them. “These are some of the most important pictures I’ll ever take,” he notes. “But not because they are necessarily very interesting for others to see.” You have the sense he needn’t have worried.The picture on this page was the last of the home photographs Bendiksen took, showing Billie adrift on a table top amid the familiar plastic detritus of a children’s party. The deep infant sleep carries with it not only an ever-present trace of parental anxiety – what if Billie should roll? – but also an edge of lovely private comedy: what kind of world, of half-drunk dregs and abandoned shades and empty chairs has this child fallen into? In this week when baby photographs have been front-page news, it also goes to prove what newspaper picture editors have long known – that no other subject moves so effortlessly from the particular to the universal.Home, a collaboration between Fujifilm and Magnum Photos, runs from 18-27 May 2018 at the Vinyl Factory, London W1.

I check my watch: it’s five to two. “It’s not going to work today,” he sighs. “But this isn’t really work, this is just blah blah blah, it’s easy. The hard thing is writing things in the studio and thinking of stuff that’s interesting.”An afternoon nap might sound indulgent, but it is hard to fault 49-year-old Shrigley’s work ethic. An excellent new book is imminent: Fully Coherent Plan for a New and Better Society features 254 new illustrations, all drawn in his distinctive thick black pen on stark white paper, the naivety of the image offset by the scabrous, surreal or darkly comic text. He’s also the guest director of the 2018 Brighton festival (he moved to Brighton three years ago with his wife, Kim, and miniature schnauzer Inka, after 27 years in Glasgow). Shrigley has been involved in selecting performers for the festival – which features everything from art to comedy to music to a lot that is indescribable – and will be making several appearances himself.To that end, below us, in a large room that still has the stained-glass windows and pulpit from its days as a church, the finishing touches are being applied to Shrigley’s installation Life Model II. The work, which revisits a piece he made when he was nominated for the Turner prize in 2013, is an imposing 9ft nude woman with a severe fringe and long eyelashes that blink every so often. Surrounding the model are easels, paper and drawing materials, and visitors are invited to make a “life” drawing. These will then be tacked to the gallery walls and, in Shrigley’s mind, become artwork just as interesting as his original sculpture, if not more so.The show hasn’t yet opened when we meet, so on the walls are some examples from the last time Life Model II was shown, in Vienna, which will act as a “giddy-up” to the people of Brighton. “So they are drawings by Austrians,” says Shrigley, as though this fact might explain a lot.Life Model II is a just part of Shrigley’s contribution to the festival. What’s really disrupting his sleep right now is a new work called Problem in Brighton, which is billed as “an alt-rock pantomime” starring Pauline Knowles and Gavin Mitchell. In some ways it’s a companion piece to Shrigley’s 2011 “opera”, Pass the Spoon, but the truth is that even the artist is unsure what it will look and sound like.“I’ve always wanted to direct a performance on stage,” says Shrigley. “I did the opera thing a few years ago, but I didn’t direct that, I just wrote the words. But the word ‘pantomime’ suggests, ‘oh well, it’s a pantomime, it’s like a rubbish, funny play for children’. Then you say it’s ‘alt-rock’… I didn’t say ‘avant-garde’, because that’s pretentious. Basically I’ve set the bar really low, so I can do whatever I like and make a cacophonous noise.”Doing something totally different clearly appeals to Shrigley. Alongside his best-known work – the books and merch his 2012 solo show, Brain Activity, at London’s Hayward gallery his huge bronze thumb, titled Really Good, which until last month sat on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square – he is also drawn to more esoteric commissions. In 2015, he designed a new mascot for the Scottish football club Partick Thistle he’s called Kingsley and looks like a furious sun. He’s made music videos for Blur and Bonnie Prince Billy, and hosted pop-up tattoo stations, at which he draws directly on to people’s bodies and, if they like the result, they can have it inked permanently.Now, for the Observer, Shrigley is submitting himself to interrogation by our readers. At 6ft 5in, he’s not hard to spot – does he generally have pleasant interactions with the public? “They give me the fear, if I’m honest,” says Shrigley. “In Glasgow it used to be, ‘You’re that guy, aren’t ye?’ And I’d be like, ‘Aye, I am.’ Then he’d say, ‘I thought you were, right, I think you’re that guy. All the best to ye.’”Shrigley laughs, “The thing is, who was he talking about? Was he talking about me? We’ll never know.”Hans-Ulrich Obrist, artistic director of the Serpentine Galleries Don’t listen to people like me. Or Hans-Ulrich. There’s that famous statement: every generation invents rock’n’roll, or whatever it is, for itself. And every generation invents its art anew. So, don’t find excuses not to do it. I’m sure a lot of young people have more excuses than I did when I was in my early 20s: I was lucky, there were no fees to pay then. But yeah, if you want to do it, get on with it.Yinka Shonibare, artistTommy Cooper was funny. The thing about Tommy Cooper is that he walked on to the stage and people laughed. That’s magic, isn’t it? If you can just look at people and they start laughing. I’m not really a nostalgic person, but when I watch things from the 1970s, when I was a little kid, The Two Ronnies and Dad’s Army are still funny. I couldn’t really say that about a lot of other things that have happened in the interim.I like standup, but I don’t go to it often. When it’s good, you always think: “Why don’t I do this more often?” Just laughing for a whole hour, it’s so therapeutic. But then you see something that isn’t that funny and you’re like, “Shall we go to the bar?” and you realise why you don’t do it so often. It’s very subjective as well. My wife and I went to see Stewart Lee and then we went to see an American guy whose name I can’t remember. She really liked the American guy and didn’t like Stewart Lee. And I was like: “How can you not like Stewart Lee?” And she said, “I think it’s a man thing. He’s just so bloody clever.” And that’s a criticism. That’s part of the reason I like him: because he is so bloody clever. Anyway, subjective, innit?Jess Kidd, authorRight, a bank holiday weekend – because it’s bound to be raining, isn’t it? So you’re indoors with this bloody ghost. I’m actually reading Jess Kidd’s book at the moment, which is all about ghosts. Anyway, who would it be? It would have to be Duchamp, because he could perhaps teach me to play chess – he was one of the best chess players in France. People have taught me to play chess before but it’s never stuck, so I’d like to go over it with him. And I could sit there in the park playing and tell people: “Well, Marcel Duchamp taught me to play…” Actually no: “The ghost of Marcel Duchamp taught me to play chess.” That would be cool.It would probably take longer than a weekend. Obviously there’d be a lot of questions I’d want to ask him: Duchamp is a kind of god, or a touchstone. And if Duchamp wasn’t available then Andy Warhol, but Duchamp would be my first choice.Sir Nicholas Serota, chair of Arts Council EnglandWell, I live in Brighton, so that’s really handy. And part of the reason they need a guest director as a marketing figurehead is because it is so disparate in terms of the things that are on. It’s very difficult to pull them all together into one unified blurb, other than: it’s here and there’s lots of really good things on. My programming was basically sending a list by email to somebody and, fortunately for me, a lot of the things came to be. So Deerhoof and Ezra Furman and Bridget Christie among others: Deerhoof are one of my favourite bands, Ezra Furman I’ve never seen before and Bridget Christie, I missed her show as well. So it was a way of filling in the gaps and not having to go to London and get the vomit express back at the end of the evening.Emma Jane Unsworth, authorWho! Who! Who! I let the dog out at 6am, and I don’t know why she wakes up at 6am but it’s always me that has to take her out. And it’s only when we’re in Brighton. We spend part of our time in Devon and she gets up at 8am when we’re in Devon. I think it’s the seagulls that wake her up here. Anyway, I’ve taken to wearing shorts in bed, so I don’t have to take my pyjamas off, I just go out in shorts and a coat and wander like a zombie around the block. She does what she has to do and then we go back to bed for another two hours.Evie Wyld, novelistI don’t like frogs and toads very much.

I wish them well, toads, I wish them long, healthy lives, but if you said, “Would you like me to put a toad on your bare chest right now?” I’d say: “Absolutely not.”Ezra Furman, musicianI think they’re both. For some people they can be quite annoying, if you look at them too much. I’m aware of that. As an artist, you have to do what you’ve gotta do. There is some cathartic thing about making art: if you don’t get it out, it’ll fester inside and damage you somehow. I do feel a bit like that. So it’s healthy for me to make art whether it’s healthy for other people to look at it, I don’t know.Amanda Palmer, singerI guess so, but sometimes I misunderstand lyrics. There’s a famous old blues song called He’s a Mighty Good Leader Beck did a version of it on one of his early albums. I really liked it, but I always thought the lyric was, “Is the monarch a leader?” and it was only fairly recently that the Beck album was reissued on vinyl and I realised, Oooh… yeah: is the monarch a leader? And a picture of the royal family: are they a leader? Or is it just a token office?I’ve made a couple of pop promos in my life. I’d do it for Beck but not for anybody else. Now Mark E Smith is dead, Beck is probably the only one I’d do it for. But not this year, I’m too busy.Matt Haig, novelist (who lives in Brighton)I love it. It was hard to leave Glasgow and Brighton was probably the one other place I’ve always felt really at home. It’s my kind of people in Brighton, it’s by the sea, and the weather’s better than Glasgow.But it depends where you live as well. I’ve never actually met Matt but we have a friend in common, so doubtless I will soon. I think he lives in Hove, while I’m in Kemptown. The bad thing about Kemptown is that it’s full of dogshit and lunatics. And I suspect Hove isn’t. I’m not talking about homeless people, I’m just talking about genuinely mad people, barking at the moon, who live in houses and who are mad. To wit, the day after we moved in, I’d parked the car on the pavement and I was unloading it. Some guy was walking down the street and he was wearing a pair of shorts, flip-flops, a cowboy hat and a pair of sunglasses, and he had “Get High” written in lipstick on his chest. This was about 8.30am and he was smoking a joint and he said: “You can’t park like that, mate. I’m just telling ya.”Now, I like that, but I’d like to be like the people who come from a different part of town just to visit, to look at Mr Get High.Ed Vaizey, Conservative MP for WantageOh yeah, I know your mum. My mum lives with maybe two and they are both ceramic pieces, because she threw away all the rest. She and my dad between them discarded all of my work, probably shortly after I left home for art school. I’d say they’ve come to appreciate it a bit more over time. There was a watershed moment where there was some documentary about me on TV and overnight they went from knowing nothing to everything about what I did for a living. That’s not to say my parents haven’t been supportive, because they have they just didn’t really have any interest in art.Also, to be fair to them, I’m slightly less bothered about them throwing the artwork away than I was about them throwing away all my football programmes. I had the programme to the 1979 European Cup final, Nottingham Forest’s moment of glory. Don’t know where that is. Gone.Peter Jenkinson, co-founder of Culture+ConflictWell, it can’t always tell you which artworks are mine and which works just look like mine, for example. On Google image search there are works that are erroneously attributed to me, and then people invite you to participate in something that they’re curating and they say: “We love your work! Could we reproduce this image on the brochure?” And it’s not one of your images. Then you have to say: “You don’t like my work as much as you think you do.” So Google image search – problem.Dan Guthrie, Stroud, GloucsThe difficult thing about answering any question about what is or isn’t art is that even before you’ve finished making the statement as to what art is or what art isn’t, you think of an exception, a contradiction to what you’ve just said. You realise you’re wrong even before you’ve finished saying it.But, just for the sake of argument: stuff that’s in hotel rooms. Authorless, inkjet prints on canvas, you have to say that isn’t really art. It just looks like art but it isn’t art.Ally Ferguson, GlasgowIt’s very difficult to say. When I was looking for somewhere to study, I found Glasgow really exciting and different and mysterious. It was everything the suburbs of Leicester, where I grew up, weren’t. It probably took about 12 years for that to wear off and then suddenly I realised I was sort of a Glaswegian. This was my home. I can’t really remember my childhood in the East Midlands that well, but Glasgow is still very vivid. I lived there from when I was 19 to when I was 47 – teenage to middle age – and it was only three years ago that I left – it’s the biggest part of my life.Emma Richardson, BedfordGlad you enjoyed it. I guess when you make something that you invite somebody to draw, it’s going to look like what you’ve made. But their drawings can also be a critique of the work, perhaps, and it’s an acknowledgement that everybody sees an artwork differently – on a metaphorical level as well as a literal level. What I like about it is that it’s a nice inclusive work. I tend to hate all the big sculptures I’ve made after a while. But I like this one because I don’t look at it any more, I look at the people’s drawings, so it’s like going to a different exhibition every time. I just ignore the big person.Matt Wilson, MadridLeighton BuzzardYeah, the most difficult thing is to know whether it’s any good. That tends to change depending on what mood you’re in. Knowing whether it’s finished? Well, with a drawing, it has to be because all of the paper is covered. Then it’s definitely finished.William Tallan, AyrshireNo. We are not getting relegated, first of all. At the time of writing, we’ve got to play Ross County and we’ve got to play Hamilton. Win both of those games, we could feasibly be out of the shit we’re in. So first of all let’s think positive. Second of all, no. I’m not going to update Kingsley. Kingsley will be as he is and he will be there next season if we have to achieve promotion again.Selma Montford , honorary secretary of the Brighton Society 1973-2016I don’t think it’s clever, for the record. And it’s my handwriting, right, so what you’re objecting to is my handwriting. It’s like you’re basically objecting to me and there’s nothing I can do about that. I accept that. That’s why I don’t correspond by social media. It’s transmit only, I’m afraid, with social media. Because otherwise you’re just opening yourself – it’s a conduit to everyone in the world, some of whom are going to be really nasty to you.Sion Williams, Ruthin, north WalesYes, I do have a Moleskine notebook, as you might imagine, as every other note-taker does. I was in Glasgow one day, before we left, in the Botanic Gardens near where we lived, and I was making a little drawing, sitting on a bench. I overheard two guys walking past and they went: “Police.” How far from the truth can you be?Stefano Turato, EdinburghSelf-delusion probably. I’ve come to realise that self-delusion is quite important if you want to be an artist: “Oh, that doesn’t tally with my view of myself” – just ignore it. That’s the way my brain works. If you want to do something, you’ve got to ignore things that are unhelpful and that’s what I do.Mike Abbott, Limoges, FranceIt is my finger, yes. I think it’s my left hand because I’ve got a wonky nail on my left hand where my school friends trod on my finger when I was 10. Does it reference Lord Kitchener? In a sense the image functions in the same way as that famous recruitment poster but it isn’t a direct reference to that image.I don’t really make photographs any more – I stopped after the changeover to digital. Though that might be a digital picture actually, but I mostly stopped making photographic art in the early 2000s. I just stopped being interested in physical paper photographs. You start taking pictures on your phone and now there’s Instagram and that somehow seems to be enough: to make digital images and stick them on there.Luke, CopenhagenYeah, it’s a bad idea it’s been done. We’ve all got to be unique. Get “Finger” tattooed on your toe, that’s my advice. As far as I know that hasn’t been done and I’ll happily provide the text.Fully Coherent Plan for a New and Better Society is out on Thursday (Canongate, £14.99).

The pair have a combined workforce of 360,000 people and the merged company would leapfrog Tesco to become the UK’s biggest private sector employer. Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the proposed merger could create “even more concentrated local monopolies” and challenged Andrew Tyrie, the incoming boss of the Competition and Markets Authority regulator, to reverse a history of “spineless” inquiries by conducting a robust investigation.“This is an early test for Andrew Tyrie and an important one,” Cable said. “The CMA really needs to show some teeth after previously being soft in its remedies in the audit, banking and energy sectors.”Last year, the CMA waved through Tesco’s £3.7bn takeover of cash-and-carry group Booker despite warning by rivals it could drive them out of businessAndrew Simms, the co-director of the New Weather Institute thinktank and the author of Tescopoly, said: “This is profoundly not in the public interest. It’s going to have negative consequences for consumers and all the along the grocery supply chain.”Sainsbury’s will publish a statement fleshing out the terms of the agreement on Monday morning at 7am. The shares-based deal is expected to create a combined company worth £15bn including debt, led by current Sainsbury’s boss Mike Coupe. It is envisaged that his opposite number at Asda, Roger Burnley, will report to Coupe.The proposed new retail giant will have 2,800 stores and annual sales of more than £50bn. The plan is to retain both retail brands because they have different heartlands and attract different sorts of shoppers.One senior industry source said that Walmart had been trying to sell the struggling Asda chain for some time. The deal brokered with Sainsbury was, he said, evidence the US retailer was “flying the white flag” after failing to conquer the UK market during the near two decades it has owned the Leeds-based grocer.Talks between the two businesses have been going on for more than a year, with the deal based on pooling buying power to offer lower prices at the checkout – rather than closing stores or cutting jobs. The Qatar Investment Authority, the sovereign wealth fund that is currently Sainsbury’s biggest shareholder, is said to be supportive of the plan.It is thought the CMA has already been in advanced discussions with Sainsbury’s and Asda as the regulator’s guidance states that “businesses are strongly encouraged to approach the CMA to discuss their merger ... on a confidential basis” before formally notifying the regulator."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9bd82a38dab76df735aa7854864378a3f69c302b/68_0_3433_2061/master/3433.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7dcb8fbf4b70bbfc18d99e1322b6e8e","title":"guardian redesign tabloid readers response paul chadwick","story":"Thousands of readers have given feedback on our redesign, and our editor-in-chief is open to further changes in responseIn the three months since the  redesigned and reshaped to tabloid size, readers have sent about 2,400 pieces of feedback. Broadly, the response has been positive. Most readers accepted the change as partly a necessary cost-saving measure in the face of difficult market conditions for newspapers. Expressions of loyalty towards the  were a tonic. “Don’t worry, dedicated supporters will keep your GREAT PAPER going,” wrote a devotee.At the beginning, 15 January, reflex responses – pro and con – had comparable intensity. But they soon gave way to a flow of thoughtful and detailed emails and letters. Some who welcomed the smaller size also focused on how the redesign had perhaps moved, or for space reasons dropped, aspects of the paper which they enjoyed. Specific puzzles or weather details or listings were missed, but the overall response to the layout and pacing of the paper was approving. Some early resisters warmed to the changes, others said they had adapted.I put the main themes of readers’ responses to the designers and to the editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner. She is open to considering changes, within constraints of space and cost.Wrote one reader: “The main body of your excellent newspaper in my hands has developed migratory tendencies.” Readers commented on how they disassemble the paper and share parts of it for simultaneous reading among members of their household, or take only one section with them on the bus or train.The habits of many are matched by the stapled G2 and the well-received Journal section that can be removed whole from the centre of the main paper. Some lament that sport is no longer separate. A frequent request was for the main paper to be stapled, but the production process and the deadlines of the operation do not permit it.I am told the initial boost that novelty and promotion gave to newsstand sales has eased back now, but subscriptions since the change have grown strongly.A highly visible innovation was the introduction of patches of yellow. Adverse response was significant, and usage is being cut back. Viner says the technique will be used judiciously and “the randomness will stop”.Although various readers perceived the body type as smaller, the ink less intense and the paper itself perhaps different, I am assured that the font size of the body type is fractionally larger and the ink and paper are the same.The change of masthead drew attention, partly because some readers thought it didn’t draw enough attention to itself on newsstands among its competitors.

So the directors of a new documentary about her short and scandalous life faced a difficult task.Was Mansfield, one of the first actresses to be marketed as a “blonde bombshell”, also a violin-playing intellectual with superb comic timing who spoke five languages? Or was the star who came to be known as the “working man’s Marilyn Monroe” actually a devil worshipper who was decapitated in a car crash as the result of a curse?For the makers of Mansfield 6667, these questions were only part of the story. Instead, the American film-makers P David Ebersole and Todd Hughes have created an unorthodox account of the world of Hollywood gossip and illusion. Top-billed contributors to the documentary, out in cinemas last month, include Tippi Hedren, Alfred Hitchcock’s muse, Kenneth Anger, the author of the bible of tacky ephemera Hollywood Babylon, and the film director John Waters, a master of offbeat kitsch.The release of Mansfield 6667 in Britain marks the 50th anniversary of the star’s death at 34. Focused on the last two years of her life, the film was made after Ebersole and Hughes failed to find producers for their fictionalised screenplay The Devil Made Her Do It, about Mansfield’s reputed dalliance with the San Francisco-based satanic guru Anthony LaVey.Unconventional elements of their finished documentary include interpretive dance sequences and a series of animated recreations of some key Mansfield myths. There are also clips of the star in the hit films The Girl Can’t Help It and Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter? as proof of her sure sense of comic timing.Born Vera Jayne Palmer in Pennsylvania in 1933, she was initially hired by Warner Brothers in 1955 and then by 20th Century Fox, where she was seen as a potential successor to the troublesome Monroe.In her short life she also made a string of centrefold appearances as “playmate of the month” in Playboy magazine and had three husbands and five children. Her youngest child from her second marriage to the 1955 Mr Universe winner, Mickey Hargitay, is the actress Mariska Hargitay, a regular on the television show Law \u0026amp Order: Special Victims Unit.One fact about Mansfield never in doubt was her trademark proclivity for revealing her ample bosom. Those not familiar with her acting may know her name simply because of a notorious photograph of her taken in 1957 at a party Paramount Studios gave for the rising Italian star Sophia Loren. Although Loren was officially belle of that ball, it was her bemused reaction to Mansfield’s low-cut gown that became Hollywood folklore.Mansfield’s film career hit the buffers in the mid-1960s and she was forced to resort to working in nightclubs. She continued to make promotional special appearances, however, and travelled out to cheer the troops in Vietnam. It was at this stage, while also dating a married lawyer, Sam Brody, that she began to see LaVey, the self-styled head of the Church of Satan who had painted his home black and wore a dark cape. When a jealous Brody challenged LaVey over Mansfield’s affections, the legend says a fatal curse was brought down upon his head.During 1966 and 1967, Mansfield and Brody survived seven car crashes before an eighth eventually killed them both. The actress had been travelling from Biloxi, Mississippi, to New Orleans to appear on television when her car hit a trailer head-on. The accident gave birth to a persistent rumour that Mansfield’s head, or at least her blond wig, had been flung from the car. If it was not LaVey’s curse that killed her, it may have been the fault of a truck that had sprayed a thick fog of insect repellent across the road."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1985b09c24f3fcd76e8d805f4a1220fcfacdc1a0/0_72_3608_2165/master/3608.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5a1fb8c19b2db5284449f8cab83901f6","title":"times up tribeca film festival","story":"Celebrities including Lupita Nyong’o and Julianne Moore discussed the work of the group that was formed to counter sexual harassmentActivists, media-makers and celebrities including Lupita Nyong’o and Julianne Moore convened at the Tribeca film festival on Saturday, to discuss the work of Time’s Up, the group formed to counter systemic sexual harassment in the entertainment business and US workplaces.“I am still trying to catch my breath that this moment is here and that is what we’re talking about,” said the actor Mariska Hargitay. In a series of panels, moderators pushed their guests to suggest things anyone watching could immediately do. Amani Al-Khatahtbeh, founder of MuslimGirl, encouraged people to share articles on social media that tell the story of marginalized people. Nina Shaw, founding partner at the law firm Del Shaw Moonves Tanaka Finkelstein and Lezcano, said women should push men to call out sexist behavior in other men. Jetmire Gjini, a hotel room attendant in New York, advocated for workplace unions. “When women are part of a strong union like men,” Gjini said, “they have the power to stand up and protect themselves without fear of retaliation”.Time’s Up announced its own new initiative, +13x, which encourages women to help other women at their workplace. Desiree Gruber, chief executive of the multi-media company Full Picture and executive producer of Project Runway, explained that “+1” stood for bringing another woman to any work meeting or event and “3x” stood for at least three other meaningful connections that woman could be helped to make. “Even if you are at the beginning of your career, there is something you could demystify for someone else in this office,” she said. Time’s Up also celebrated its own success with a panel on its Legal Defense Fund, which provides resources to people fighting sexual harassment in the workplace. The fund is managed with the help of the National Women’s Law Center (NWLC) and has raised more than $21m.Another trend the NWLC has spotted, she said, was that the men and women who approach it are often seeking legal help because they are being retaliated against with lawsuits or threatened legal action for reporting, or even just mentioning, sexual harassment. “The retaliation people face is real,” Graves said.As attorney Robbie Kaplan, of Kaplan \u0026amp Company, explained, the fund was meant to create an army of lawyers that would fight to show such behavior would no longer be ignored. Kaplan, who argued before the US supreme court in favor of legalizing same-sex marriage, said the fund was filling a gap.For decades, she said, people who were able to find attorneys to fight sexual harassment cases tended to be either high income or were “embarrassment cases”, making accusations against high-profile and powerful people. “Almost everyone else in the middle were having a very, very hard time finding representation,” Kaplan said. Time’s Up, she said, has heard from women in nearly every industry including food, construction and the military. Kaplan said the action she was seeing was reminiscent of the activism that helped make same-sex marriage legal.“It’s just like gay rights,” Kaplan said. “How did we get them? One person said, ‘I am gay,’ and then another, and another and another. It’s exactly the same here.”The only man on stage was a former NFL player, Wade Davis, who is gay. He works with corporations, sports teams and universities to improve the understanding of sexuality. To do this, he said, he has to educate men about feminist theory. “The root of homophobia is sexism,” he said.Asked what women in the audience could do to help promote feminism, Davis said it was men who needed to step up. “Women don’t have to do anything,” he said. “They’ve done everything. Anything smart I said today I learned from a woman.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1e8a8526bd7db8d7cb9079c21b14e79870744099/277_58_2445_1468/master/2445.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e39bb582c8e9ffe1736d16f6d55a2db5","title":"arsene wenger classy gesture manchester united","story":"• Sir Alex Ferguson presents Arsenal manager with vase• ‘My successor will watch game and come to positive conclusion’Arsène Wenger joked that his warm reception before Arsenal’s 2-1 defeat against Manchester United was because he is no longer a “danger”.Wenger, who finishes 22 years at Arsenal at the end of the season, was managing them for the final time at Old Trafford. To mark the occasion, before kick-off Sir Alex Ferguson presented on United’s behalf a vase to the 68-year-old Frenchman. Asked about his ovation as he walked along the touchline, Wenger said: “When you’re not a danger any more, people love you.“I am thankful to Manchester United because they had a nice gesture. It is the first time I get a trophy before a game. It is very classy from them.”Wenger fielded an inexperienced XI that was Arsenal’s youngest in the fixture since August 2011 and, after losing to an added-time Marouane Fellaini header, believes whoever succeeds him will take over a squad of depth.“The players are destroyed because they gave everything and were caught\u0026nbspin the final minute. There were many question marks if we would be strong enough to fight but the quality\u0026nbspwas good, the spirit was good, many players stood up. We tired a bit in the last 20 minutes and were a bit more under pressure. It was a negative\u0026nbspresult and a positive performance.”Paul Pogba opened the scoring on 16 minutes before Henrikh Mkhitaryan equalised on 51 minutes. Yet though victory puts United in pole position for a second-place finish with 77 points with three games remaining, Romelu Lukaku’s foot injury later in the second half is of concern with the FA\u0026nbspCup final on 19\u0026nbspMay.“I hope it is not something that keeps him out of a game that is in three weeks’ time but I don’t know. When a player is injured I’m not immediately going for good or bad news.”Wenger has injury concerns leading up to the Europa League semi-final second leg at Atlético Madrid this week. “Mkhitaryan I took off because he had a little knock on his knee and Ospina has a problem and Iwobi a hamstring problem. Definitely out for Thursday? No.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2e33f1671c2c1ac0061cc4fbd71c911e930ae273/0_117_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4b403ed4bcb047fe6cca03425e1df2e6","title":"chris coleman sackedd manager sunderland","story":"Sunderland lost a manager but gained new owners on Sunday when Ellis Short sacked Chris Coleman before announcing he had cleared the struggling club’s debts and sold it to an international consortium headed by the chairman of non-league Eastleigh.While Coleman paid the price for failing to prevent Sunderland from falling into League One, the outgoing Short wrote off tens of millions of pounds in liabilities, thereby facilitating the takeover spearheaded by Stewart Donald.Once this transfer in ownership has received Football League ratification, Donald will sever his ties with Eastleigh of the National League before he and his group of “football investors” begin the task of rebuilding a club which has suffered successive relegations, entering the third tier for only the second time in its history.Coleman had hoped to have been part of Sunderland’s rebirth and even offered to take a pay cut next season. Instead, the 47-year-old who led Wales to the Euro 2016 semi-finals was informed that the incoming owner wants a new coach.The consensus is that Coleman, who had never spoken to Short since swapping Wales for Wearside last November, and was apparently unaware of the impending takeover, has been treated shoddily. Yet if his honesty and enthusiasm impressed, it seems Donald and friends were unconvinced by Coleman’s collection of only five wins as Sunderland were condemned to finishing bottom of the Championship.His dismissal leaves the club seeking a 12th permanent appointment in 10 years. Early contenders include Mick McCarthy, most recently of Ipswich and a former Sunderland manager, and the former Reading coach Jaap Stam.Although the debts are understood to have been reduced considerably since the publication of the last set of accounts – which showed that Sunderland owed £69m to Short and £68m to Security Bank Capital – Short’s decision to wipe out those arrears still represents a significant, and generous, gesture which should go at least some way to repairing his severely tarnished reputation in the north-east.It is thought that eliminating the debt could cost him in excess of £100m, thereby lifting his total spending on Sunderland to around £250m. The club’s latest accounts are scheduled to be released this week. The Florida-domiciled American billionaire financier has made some calamitous decisions and wasted millions of pounds on signing sub-standard players during a decade in control. “It’s no secret that I’ve been trying to sell Sunderland,” Short said on Sunday. “But I’ve waited until the right group came along that have the experience, finances and plan to take this great club back where it deserves to be.”An initially hands-on owner who used to happily interact with fans, he became increasingly disillusioned as a series of poor managerial and boardroom appointments and unwise off field ventures – most notably the ill-fated Invest in Africa project – conspired to set the team on an inexorably downward spiral.“Overall, my chairmanship has not gone the way I would have wished the many high points of a decade in the Premier League have been overshadowed by the low points of the last two terrible seasons,” Short said. “I was therefore determined to ensure that I leave Sunderland in the best possible hands and in the best possible state to turn the corner. To achieve this, higher offers from less qualified buyers were rejected, and I’ve paid off all debts owed by the club to leave it financially strong and debt free for the first time since years before I owned it.“I will be a Sunderland fan for life and hope to return as a fan to watch them climb back to where they belong.”Apart from his role with Eastleigh – which he put up for sale on Sunday – Donald has also been involved, albeit in a much lower-profile capacity, with Oxford United’s recent revival. It is unclear what price his consortium are paying for Sunderland or how a deal kept secret until its shock announcement on Sunday lunchtime is structured.“All of us involved in this bid believe that Sunderland represents an extraordinary opportunity,” said Donald, who invested around £10m in Eastleigh and is expected to join fellow consortium members in the Stadium of Light’s directors box for the final Championship game against Wolves on Sunday. “All of us have been involved in building or rebuilding football clubs to reach their potential. We believe we have the necessary skill-set to overcome the many challenges facing us at this great club. For a club with one of the best fan bases, stadium and academies in the UK to find itself in League One is unacceptable.”A 43-year-old millionaire businessmen, he grew up in Oxfordshire and owns Bridle Insurance, a broker specialising in the civil engineering and construction industries.“We have a carefully thought-through plan to restructure Sunderland, make it sustainable and, with the help of the fans, restore its sense of pride and reconnect it with the local community,” the Oxford United-supporting Donald said. “We’re rolling our sleeves up to do what needs to be done to ready this club to start competing again.”It is likely that Martin Bain, Sunderland’s chief executive, will also leave, possibly along with a handful of other senior executives. Kit Symons, Coleman’s assistant, has already departed and other members of the backroom staff could follow.Charlotte Coleman, the departing manager’s wife tweeted that she and her husband were “gutted to be leaving Sunderland”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14b67b7f37002ad92645897652d575711eeddb83/141_111_3816_2289/master/3816.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=adf6d95a3cf933ea9bf18ddb22db88e3","title":"deportivo la coruna barcelona la liga match report","story":"Barcelona were crowned La Liga champions for the 25th time after beating Deportivo La Coruña 4-2 with the help of a hat-trick from Lionel Messi but while their coach Ernesto Valverde praised their consistency he acknowledged they have “lacked brilliance” at times.Barça needed only a draw to clinch the title and complete an eighth domestic double after winning the King’s Cup last week and they marched into a 2-0 lead with goals from their record signing, Philippe Coutinho, and top scorer, Messi, in the first half. The result also relegated Deportivo.Valverde said on marca: “When you chase it all season you say finally ‘the league is very long’. It is not decided only in a match. From the beginning we have been in the lead. In the end we were the best. The hard part is winning and winning.”The former Athletic Bilbao coach added: “I have not invented anything, in the end these players have already won titles and leagues with other coaches. It’s more of them than the coach.“We have been a competitive, compact team and we have overcome many difficulties, and in moments I know it has lacked brilliance.”Depor were forced to push forward knowing only victory would be enough to keep their survival hopes alive and they paid the price as Messi added two late goals to complete the 46th hat-trick of his career.The on-pitch celebrations were muted, perhaps out of respect for their dejected opponents, but Barça, who remain unbeaten in the league, could not be denied a seventh title in 10 seasons and Messi’s first goal was the pick of the bunch.Ousmane Dembélé, the first player Barça bought after selling Neymar last summer, drove forward before playing in Luis Suárez, who clipped a cross with the outside of his foot that Messi met with a sidefooted volley.Lucas Pérez pulled one back five minutes before half-time and the Turkish midfielder Emre Colak levelled for the Galicians from Celso Borges’ cross in the 64th minute. They then came close to finding a winner and becoming the first team to beat Barça in the league this season.But Messi had other ideas, restoring Barça’s lead from close range in the 82nd minute before completing his treble with his 32nd league goal of the season.That proved the ideal moment for the introduction of Andrés Iniesta at the end of a week where he emotionally announced he would be leaving the club after 22 years with them. Valverde’s side have 86 points from 34 games, 11 clear of second-placed Atlético Madrid, who have three games to play."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed007c825126a2ad0f6b39b5c69d50bf0d0d5993/0_119_3917_2350/master/3917.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a8446c178b49031bc6ba91f66a69d3da","title":"manchester united arsenal premier league match report","story":"The problem with football, as Arsène Wenger is rapidly finding out, is that there is never any guarantee of a happy ending. Wenger had been clapped to his seat but the hospitality did not extend to the pitch. His team had conceded a 91st-minute winner and, however rich the tributes might be for the departing manager, Arsenal have now lost six successive away fixtures in the league for the first time since Billy Wright was their manager in 1966.Wenger left Old Trafford with a silver vase, presented by Sir Alex Ferguson, and the lingering memory of this game will be the applause that followed the Frenchman along the touchline before the start. By the end, however, Old Trafford had reverted to type. “We want you to stay” was the cry, directed towards Wenger, after the stoppage-time header from Marouane Fellaini that meant Arsenal’s manager will remember his final visit to this stadium with little affection.That goal means Arsenal are still the only team in England’s top four isions to have lost every league game on the road since the turn of the year. It is an ignominious record and typical, perhaps, of the club’s decline if it is generally accepted that the teams with the better away results are usually the ones with the stronger personality. Arsenal, for example, rarely lost on the road in Wenger’s peak years.Those days can feel a long time ago when it is Alex Iwobi in central midfield, rather than Patrick Vieira, and Calum Chambers operating in the space Tony Adams used to occupy. Yet it would be difficult to be too harsh when Wenger’s team selection was guided by the fact that the team have the second leg of their Europa League semi-final coming up against Atlético Madrid on Thursday.Mesut Özil, Aaron Ramsey, Alexandre Lacazette and Jack Wilshere were among the players given a day off. All the same, Arsenal held their own for long spells and, at times, threatened a winner of their own following Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s equalising goal against his former club.In total, Wenger made eight changes from the team that drew against Atlético last Thursday. This was the youngest Arsenal team, with an average age of 24 years and 67 days, since the infamous 8-2 defeat here in August 2011 and to put it into perspective, there were three teenagers on the bench – Eddie Nketiah, Jordi Osei-Tutu and Joe Willock – whose shirt numbers were in the 60s. Of Arsenal’s entire match-day squad, Mkhitaryan was only player with a number between one and 11.Wenger’s record against Mourinho – now two victories from 19 attempts – is fairly lamentable even with his strongest group of players. Here, though, he was trying to beat his old rival with the kind of inexperienced team he would usually put out in the Carabao Cup. Konstantinos Mavropanos, a 21-year-old Greek defender, became the 200th player of the Wenger era to be given a debut. Arsenal’s midfield included Reiss Nelson and Ainsley Maitland-Niles and, with so many changes for the visitors, it must have been troubling for Mourinho that his team could not exert more control. Wenger summed it up accurately as “a positive performance but negative result”.Alexis Sánchez certainly found it heavy going at times against his former club, whereas Maitland-Niles, in particular, seemed determined to show that Arsenal have more strength in depth than many people might realise. Sánchez was, however, prominently involved in the opening goal for United, in the 16th minute, when Romelu Lukaku’s cross picked him out at the far post. Sánchez’s header was going in until Héctor Bellerín thrust out a leg to ert the ball against a post. The rebound fell kindly for Paul Pogba and he hooked the ball into an exposed net.All that had originated from Nelson, Arsenal’s youngest player losing the ball to Jesse Lingard close to the halfway line. It was a lesson for the 18-year-old that, at this level, those kind of mistakes tend to be punished. Yet the teenager did well overall and the build-up to Arsenal’s equaliser was a reminder that even players of considerable experience can be guilty of costly lapses.For this one it was a combination of errors, with Nemanja Matic and Ander Herrera leaving a pass from Antonio Valencia to one another and as soon as Granit Xhaka sprung the counter-attack, United were vulnerable. Mkhitaryan had sprinted upfield in support and his low shot from just outside the penalty area picked out a gap between Victor Lindelof’s legs to find its way into David de Gea’s net.By that stage, United had lost Lukaku to a foot injury and it was not until the final exchanges that the home side started to pin back their opponents. Fellaini hit a post with one header and when the substitute Marcus Rashford bundled in the rebound the goal was ruled out by a late offside flag. Unfortunately for Wenger, the next time Fellaini won a header in the penalty area there was no intervention.That goal should confirm United’s second-placed finish, five points clear of Liverpool in third with a game in hand. Arsenal, on the other hand, have lost 10 away fixtures for the first time since the 1989-90 season and, with 57 points from 35 games, are guaranteed to finish with the worst total of Wenger’s 22-year reign, the previous low being 67 in 2005-06. He talked afterwards of his gratitude for the “classy” gift from United and the crowd’s applause. But he must have preferred the days when the crowd in Manchester had cause to fear his teams. “It shows that once you’re not a danger any more, people love you.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b6a05308baf6ec50cd179192b654f254d0b99de/1024_158_2388_1432/master/2388.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2d2ab6cef1ddc607b2fb555062c7a69d","title":"pep guardiola manchester city can be best team in history","story":"• City just two points shy of Chelsea’s record tally with three to play• ‘It is incredible. We have something special in terms of confidence’Pep Guardiola has urged his Manchester City side to establish themselves as “the best team in history” after the champions moved to within two points of Chelsea’s record tally for a season in the top flight.City’s 4-1 thrashing of West Ham took them to 93 points with three games still to play, and to within one goal of the 103 Carlo Ancelotti’s Chelsea rattled up in 2010.Guardiola has invited his players to target the records as extra motivation over the campaign’s last few weeks and hopes to eclipse the points haul achieved by José Mourinho’s side in 2005 in next Sunday’s game against Huddersfield.“It is incredible. The numbers are a consequence of what we have done. We will try and surpass the number of goals and points but the guys have to play well and fight a lot.“We have something special in terms of confidence and we needed some targets to set in front of us. But these players like to play football. They are professionals.“They want to play and the guys on the bench want to play. They enjoy training and playing, like amateurs. They want to play for something, too. So, once we won the Premier League, the target became the numbers. It’s good to see something to fight for, to achieve something.”Guardiola reiterated his desire to add “maybe one, maybe two, no more than that” to his squad over the summer before a title defence and reminded his players they can still improve as iniduals and a collective. “Football is not a finished business: be more clinical,” he added.“The last five or 10 minutes of the first half here were not good. At 4-1 we weren’t hungry enough to score another one. There were inidual mistakes, our full-backs not controlling the players inside, so there are many aspects we can improve. If it was perfect, I would not be here next season. I would be done. The level of consistency was high this season, yes, but we are still a young team. Our strikers have an average age of 22.“For 20 guys in our squad, this will be the first time they’ve won the Premier League. That’s why it’s good. Recent history shows Premier League teams have not been able to defend their title. That is our challenge.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad098396d20783c168a7242de07d2175f8f7da70/58_1074_2899_1739/master/2899.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=576e47d7496dfd6f32ffa641036a4cbc","title":"jamie oliver criticism affect me childhood obesity","story":"From school dinners to sugar, the chef’s campaigns provoke strong reactions – but he won’t give up. Why? ‘It just feels like the right thing to do’‘If you analyse what I’m saying,” says Jamie Oliver, “there’s nothing clever and there’s nothing really that controversial it’s fucking really basic common sense.”We meet on the morning that a letter he coordinated has been released, addressed to the prime minister and signed by Jeremy Corbyn, Nicola Sturgeon and other party leaders. It calls on the government to ban junk food advertising before 9pm and unhealthy buy-one-get-one-free offers, among other things. Oliver is proud of it. He looks relaxed, sitting on one of the sofas in his industrial, vintage-styled head office – although he knows the attacks will come. Later, he will be accused on Twitter of being the “fun police” a column in the Sun will call it a nanny-state initiative that penalises poor people.He talks in long, rambling sentences, bristling with energy. His transformation from cheeky-chappy Essex boy chef to single-issue crusader, facts and figures to hand, about to appear in front of a select committee, is complete. You would think he would have enough going on – he closed several of his restaurants recently and restructured his business – but Oliver remains laser-focused on the issue of childhood obesity.So far, Oliver seems to be coming at obesity principally as a diet problem, rather than a social one, although it may be too much to ask even someone as energetic and ambitious as him to fix society. Obesity disproportionately affects children in deprived areas. If there is one criticism of Oliver that seems to stand up, it is that he does not entirely understand what it is like to live in relentless, grinding poverty: to be unable to afford fresh vegetables (healthy food is three times more expensive, per calorie, than unhealthy food – Oliver has suggested that the government should subsidise healthy food) to be too tired to cook from scratch every night to take the financial risk on a lentil recipe that your kids may refuse to eat.At one point, when we are talking about whether people – working parents, people who have to work several jobs – can be persuaded to turn their backs on the ease of convenience food, he acknowledges that “humans crave convenience, that’s what we’re programmed to do. But convenience food doesn’t have to be shit. The freezer is the future.” But what if you live in a small flat, with a tiny fridge and just an ice box? “Of course, but you can buy it on the defrost – that will be two or three days in the fridge still. You don’t have to have it all racked up in the freezer. But costs are down, welfare is up, waste down. Convenience food doesn’t have to be shite.” But it probably will not be cheap.Maybe it does not help when he keeps talking about “them” and “us”, as if people on low incomes or benefits are a separate species. But he is not having it. “Yeah, because I don’t have to worry about feeding my kids today and they do. It’s not hard to get someone to say: ‘Jamie Oliver is a wanker.’ I think the concept of having an opinion and caring in Britain is a really funny one, you know: ‘How dare you.’” It is true that he is in an impossible position – as a chef reportedly worth £150m, he is regularly accused of hypocrisy (years on, those lucrative supermarket adverts are used as a stick with which to beat him) and for lecturing the rest of us, but the alternative would be to do nothing. “When I stand up there and start talking, you may or may not like what I say,” he says. “But if you’ve ever seen the people representing the advertising industry or the food industry, I know you would trust me with your kids more than them.”Why does he do it? There must be times when an easier life – with his wife, Jools, their five children and their lovely £9m home in Hampstead, north London, and his TV cookery shows – seem more appealing. “The important stuff I’ve done I’ve rarely enjoyed,” he says. “I get a beating quite regularly.” So, why carry on? “It just feels like the right thing to do,” he says slowly, enunciating every word.Oliver became political early on. It was only three years after his explosive 1999 debut as the Naked Chef that he was training unemployed young people to staff his restaurant Fifteen – filmed, of course, for a TV series (few can match Oliver’s media skills). His campaign to improve school dinners culminated in the series Jamie’s School Dinners in 2005, while his 2008 series Ministry of Food followed his initiative to teach cookery skills in Rotherham (that project closed last year after Rotherham council stopped funding it, but there are others around the country).In 2015, Oliver turned his attention to sugar with his documentary Jamie’s Sugar Rush. The month it aired, he says darkly, “stuff changed. Like burglaries, computer systems, break-ins at the office, home.” Before I can ask if he thinks Big Sugar was trying to intimidate him, he continues: “I don’t know, but there’s a string of events since the month that started.” Still, the sugar tax was introduced, under David Cameron’s government (Oliver has been scathing of Theresa May’s childhood obesity strategy).People have often tried to work out what drives Oliver, but I suspect it is as simple as the satisfaction of seeing results (just like the process of starting with raw ingredients and producing a Sunday roast). “As time has gone on and we’ve got some stuff done, you realise that getting stuff done isn’t that common,” he says. Someone called him a socialist recently and he had to look up the definition. He does not think he is one he prefers the idea of running a commercial business with a social ethos.That is not to say everyone agrees he is succeeding. A report in the Times last month portrayed his chief executive Paul Hunt, who is married to Oliver’s sister, as a bully, quoting a former employee who said “morale is at rock bottom”. “It’s complete bollocks,” Oliver says. “You can walk round the business. Like I said to the editor when they ran the story, come in and talk to everyone. If you’re talking about some bad leavers, of course you’re going to find some people who have something to whine about.”It has been a tough year for Oliver – tougher still for some of his staff. He describes the closure of one of his two Barbecoa steak restaurants and 12 of the 37 UK branches of his chain Jamie’s Italian as “awful. Worst time in my life.” It is the job losses, he says. “We’ve still got 2,000 people, but we’ve had to close 12 restaurants, which is about 800 people.”It can be easy to forget that, amid all the campaigning and the chain-restaurant managing, Oliver is still a wildly popular and successful chef. His most recent book, 5 Ingredients, was one of his biggest-selling and he has another out in the summer. He still writes two recipes every day (about a third are healthy, the rest less so this is often pointed out as though it is evidence of Oliver’s hypocrisy).Anyway, he has to go – Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, that other anti-obesity campaigner and chef, is on the phone. Oliver says his business is committed to the target of halving childhood obesity by 2030. “That is what you’re going to hear me say for the next 12 years,” he says. You have to admire his single-mindedness. “Don’t get me wrong,” he adds, “I’m fucking looking forward to retiring.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b0d04a3b979cddf26ea42ca225794e1ea4af0ad1/0_0_2992_1795/master/2992.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c07ef003b7576201ee8e0ae739d7259","title":"akala review shepherds bush empire london black people hip hop poet","story":"Shepherd’s Bush Empire, LondonAs he unpicks the marginalisation of black people, the rapper and cultural commentator seems to draw ever more strength from his own messagesRapper, musician and cultural commentator Akala is becoming one of the UK’s foremost critical thinkers, having recently spoken on everything from Grenfell and Corbyn to the entire  of human history in his televised epic poem The Ruins of Empires. This all-encompassing scrutiny is clear from the get-go of his sold-out show, with an introductory video in which he criticises western television for its propagation of negative images of black people over the course of history. Backed by his DJ and a live drummer, Akala carries the air of a civil rights orator. His energetic presentation and lyrically dense raps float with poise, are ingested by his cult following and reflected back in the form of constant mobbing.Particular fervour is whipped up as he moves through call-to-arms thriller Sun Tzu, with the help of featured guest Asheber, and the crowd’s growing appreciation for his tongue-twisting prowess crafts a raucous atmosphere. Each of the night’s peaks, from singalong anthems Roll Wid Us and XXL to curtain call Find No Enemy, are constantly topped, and these leaps do not falter as the show continues. It’s as if he finds infinite strength in rejecting gang violence, examining historical injustice towards black people, and exploring the doctrines of black leaders such as Malcolm X and Marcus Garvey. His calm demeanour is a tonic to the lyrical onslaughts, and comforting, given the tough nature of his subject matter.Akala’s mission to educate becomes increasingly obvious, and comic-book style visuals and impromptu on-stage soliloquies inject vividness into his songs about finding one’s path after being led astray. There is a genuine feeling that he is trying to make sense of the world’s injustices as he speaks, which numbs the crowd into a thought-provoking silence. He saves the night’s most powerful sequence for Visions, a detailed account of black history, from pre-civilisation to the present day, that bounces off the exceptional pounding drums that soundtrack the entire evening. He draws a line in the sand between himself and his braggadocio rap contemporaries, with anecdotes relating to discovering his own limitations, and urges the crowd to do the same. His fervent hand-waving is proof that his belief in his own work continues to burn like an Olympic flame."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0ae038e8c2c4b36908a25371c5654c626e38ed80/0_1953_5547_3327/master/5547.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56060177d1dbd221307c3fcc7443ad43","title":"bob dylan whiskey heavens door","story":"For a man whose Bootleg Series now runs to 13 albums, distilling his own Tennessee liquor seems like a logical next stepBob Dylan will next month launch a range of whiskeys, hoping to capitalize on growing demand for all things celebrity-tagged.The 76-year-old singer and Nobel laureate has joined with liquor entrepreneur Marc Bushala to turn a deconsecrated church in Tennessee into a distillery. Their Heaven’s Door Spirits – a Tennessee straight bourbon, a double barrel whiskey and a straight rye – will first be available in Tennessee, Florida, California, Illinois, New York and Texas. A wider rollout will follow.Dylan’s new project was announced on Saturday. “You don’t always find inspiration,” he mused in a press release. “Sometimes it finds you. We wanted to create a collection of American whiskeys that would each tell a story.” Bushala, 52, told his story to the . The project began, he said, when he noticed Dylan, whose Bootleg Series now runs to 13 albums, had filed a trademark application for “bootleg whiskey”. Bushala contacted the enigmatic singer and made his pitch.Knowing that Dylan is a whiskey aficionado, Bushala decided to approach the project from a whiskey-centric point of view. “That appealed to Bob,” he said. “This is not a vanity project for him. It’s a passion project.”When it came to a name, the two men “wanted a standalone name for whiskey that could also be a nod and a wink to Dylan”.Dylan’s songs are not short of whiskey references, among them Copper Kettle (The Pale Moonlight) (“Daddy he made whiskey, my grandaddy he did too  We ain’t paid no whiskey tax since 1792”) Blind Willie McTell (“He’s dressed up like a squire  Bootlegged whiskey in his hand”) Gotta Serve Somebody )“Might like to drink whiskey  Might like to drink milk”) and Moonshiner (“I’ve spent all my money  On whiskey and beer”).The two men got down to 10 favourites, then agreed to go with a reference to Knockin’ on Heaven’s Door, a hit from the 1973 album Pat Garrett \u0026amp Billy the Kid which in fact does not refer to whiskey. “Everyone felt strongly that Heaven’s Door was just a perfect name,” Bushala said, “especially given the imagery we’re using on the bottles” – wrought ironwork from Dylan’s own metalwork foundry in Los Angeles.Someone as “eclectic and erse as Bob”, Bushala said, should put out “an evolving collection or portfolio” of whiskeys. To achieve that, he said, he raised $35m from investors.Dylan’s idea for his own whiskey came from a more down-to-earth source: his earliest incarnation as a Woody Guthrie-esque, riding-the-rails wandering minstrel.In a statement to the New York Times, the singer said: “I’ve been traveling for decades and I’ve been able to try some of the best spirits that the world of whiskey has to offer. This is great whiskey.”Bushala said: “There have been spirits and whiskey in his music for as long as he’s been making it, going on 60 years, and in the kind of rural Americana that plays into it. So for sure in his mind, there were elements he was after. But it wasn’t directly articulated.“He was after a mood or a feeling. He wasn’t after saying, ‘This should taste more smokey or have more corn or rye, or adjust the proof.’” Presented with one distillation, Bushala said, Dylan said simply the drink should feel “more like a wood structure”. “We were nodding like we understood,” Bushala said. “But we didn’t really.”Nor, perhaps to the horror of Dylan purists, is this the singer’s first foray into the world of commerce. The singer is a periodic pitchman, endorsing Chobani, Chrysler and even Victoria’s Secret.“He didn’t sell out,” Bushala said. “This is his brand, and it’s his idea. We just helped him do what he wanted to do. Bob does not want to be face man of the brand and he does not want the packaging to scream ‘Dylan’.”Dylan’s signature is therefore on the reverse side of the label, Bushala said, making it visible only when the bottle is empty. “He was willing to do that but he’s not going to appearances or bottle signings. He didn’t even pick up his Nobel prize so he’s not going to go out touting this. And that’s great because it’s authentic for Dylan and authentic for the brand.” With some irony, perhaps, the rules that will govern the success or otherwise of Dylan’s project will, like his whiskey and his music, hark back to America’s past. Liquor distribution in the US is still based on a post-prohibition model, each market tightly controlled by licensed state distributors. Those markets have to be broken into much as folk musicians or promoters once toured local radio stations, seeking precious airplay.“There are parallels,” Bushala said. “You’re going from account to accounts and hand-selling. You’re going round, knocking on the doors.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16603970b80c30b2f4e96436f601df35b101f08c/2387_172_6068_3641/master/6068.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7a8dd5196f3548653a2ebb24424de662","title":"gary barlow review blackpool opera house take that","story":"Blackpool Opera HouseThere’s an almost music-hall atmosphere as this gig from the singer’s smaller-stage tour delivers a crowd-pleasing portfolio of Take That hits among solo numbers Where Take That’s stadium and arena tours have become visual extravaganzas, featuring mechanical elephants and giant robots, the band’s singer-songwriter’s theatre tour takes him back, if not for good, to intimate gigs heavy on traditional stagecraft and audience interaction. “Gary!

Here, he delves into songs from his musicals, Finding Neverland and Calendar Girls, unveils a curious sideline as tour statistician (“and this song was released on the 11th October 1993”), tactfully avoids his brief but controversial 2014 period as a poster boy for tax avoidance and settles into a comfier role as all-round end-of-the-pier light entertainer. When someone in the crowd holds up a sign reading: “Mummy and me came from Malta. Can I have a hug?” he strides into the stalls to give them one. Someone else with a placard reading: “I’ll never forget sitting on your organ,” is theatrically scolded: “That’s disgusting!” He serenades an audience member called Martina with A Million Love Songs while she sits at the end of his piano and films it on her phone. There’s a dollop of pantomime as he removes his jacket: people start cheering “Stop it!” and bombard him with mock boos when he puts more clothing on. Otherwise, he knows that people want plenty of Take That nostalgia and doesn’t let them down. New song Relive Those Years tells the band’s story from early days to 2005 reformation with jazz, confessionals and witty self-deprecation. “My appetite for singing slowly dies,” he sings of his post-split wilderness period, rubbing his now trimmer stomach for the punchline, “replaced by an appetite for pies”. Meanwhile, TT smashes are gleefully reinvented – as big-band brass (Everything Changes), cod jazz funk (Sure), seaside disco stomper (Dan Hartman cover Relight My Fire) – or accompanied by comically bad dancing (Pray). Although he turns in a shift as sincere balladeer, this show is less about gravitas than 90 minutes of old-fashioned, almost music-hall showbiz. Still, it’s hard not to be swept along as a crowd choir turn Back for Good, Patience, Never Forget and the rest into Last-Night-of-the-Proms-type epics. Barlow reminds the audience that party towns and theatres like this are where he started and, in a sense, he has never left. “Goodnight,” he promises. “I’ll see you on the ghost train.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45f896341f734b86eda3d16f5baccadd08b55c6d/0_0_4071_2714/master/4071.jpg?w=1010\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49cd184f1b7e0230364ac136cfb3a46d 1010w","title":"amber rudd letter to pm reveals ambitious but deliverable removals target","story":"Exclusive: denials she was aware of deportation targets at odds with January 2017 letter now published in fullThe private letter from Amber Rudd to Downing Street in which she sets an “ambitious but deliverable” target for an increase in the enforced deportation of immigrants has been published by the  in full for the first time.Rudd has claimed she did not set, see or approve any targets for removals. The former immigration minister Brandon Lewis suggested on Sunday this proposed increase was an ambition rather than a target.But Home Office sources have told the  that it is “shame-faced nonsense” to claim the department had not been set specific targets in this area, or that these have not been regularly discussed at the highest levels.The latest furore was sparked on Friday when the  published details from a separate confidential memo that was sent to Rudd in June last year.Prepared by Hugh Ind, the director general of Immigration Enforcement in the Home Office, it picked up on the new policy outlined by Rudd in her letter to Theresa May.While Rudd has denied seeing the six-page briefing note, the  can now reveal that it was also sent to at least eight of the Home Office’s most senior officials, including:• Marc Owen, senior director of national and international operations in Immigration Enforcement.• Mark Thomson, the director general of the Passport Office.• Tony Eastaugh, UK director of operations at Immigration Enforcement.• Gareth Hills, director of performance and risk at the Home Office.• Stephen Kershaw, a senior director in Immigration Enforcement.• Andrew Wren, director of performance, assurance and governance at the Home Office.The home secretary has issued five apologies in the last week – four of them over her department\u0027s handling of the Windrush crisis and immigration targets.Rudd delivered an unprecedented apology to parliament and acknowledged that her department had “lost sight of iniduals” and become “too concerned with policy”.Rudd apologised for failing to grasp the scale of the problem. She told the home affairs select committee: “I bitterly, deeply regret that I didn’t see it as more than inidual cases gone wrong that needed addressing. I didn’t see it as a systemic issue until very recently.”On Thursday morning, Rudd was forced to admit officials did have targets for removals, having previously denied their existence.“The immigration arm of the Home Office has been using local targets for internal performance management. These were not published targets against which performance was assessed, but if they were used inappropriately then I am clear that this will have to change.On Thursday afternoon, Rudd was forced to issue a hasty clarification after appearing to leave the door open to the UK staying in a customs union with the EU.“I should have been clearer – of course when we leave the EU we will be leaving the customs union.In a series of late-night tweets, Rudd apologised for not being aware of documents, leaked to the , which set out immigration removal targets.\u0026nbsp‘I wasn’t aware of specific removal targets. I accept I should have been and I’m sorry that I wasn’t. I didn’t see the leaked document, although it was copied to my office as many documents are.The disclosure will heap further pressure on Rudd, who has said she will address MPs on Monday to answer the “legitimate questions” that have been raised over the past week.On Friday night, nine hours after the  first told the Home Office about the leaked memo, Rudd tweeted: “I wasn’t aware of removal targets. I accept I should have been and I am sorry that I wasn’t.”The response appears at odds with the letter she sent to the prime minister in January last year.But it also suggests that none of the other senior officials and special advisers copied into the subsequent briefing note ever discussed with her the targets which the Immigration Enforcement agency was attempting to reach on her instruction.Home Office sources have told the  that Immigration Enforcement has been working all year to reach the target of 12,800 enforced returns in 2017-18.They have been bracing themselves to acknowledge to ministers that the agency has failed to do so. To meet the goal, it needed to deport 250 people a week, but it has only been able to remove about 225 a week.“At the Home Office we work in a target culture,” said a source. “The civil service is completely target based. That’s all we do. It is shame-faced nonsense for Amber Rudd to say otherwise.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5563f68e8bfcdc29bf74aba848979f00e684761c/21_0_615_369/master/615.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=79de17426590a332212e1c34319aa183","title":"davis under pressure to disown criticism of civil service chief on brexit","story":"Minister seeks to defuse row after backlash to claims he wanted Oliver Robbins sidelinedBrexit secretary David Davis has sought to defuse tensions with No 10 by playing down reports that he might resign unless Theresa May sidelines Whitehall’s top civil servant working on Britain’s exit from the EU.After unexpected interventions from the cabinet secretary Jeremy Heywood and May’s close aide Gavin Barwell defending Oliver Robbins, an aide to Davis said on Sunday evening that no such threats had been made. The aide added that Davis considered Robbins to be “a fantastic civil servant”.Davis’s intervention comes in a crucial week for May who faces a tense Brexit inner cabinet meeting on Wednesday when she is expected to discuss a plan, backed by Robbins, to create a customs partnership with the EU. Another option on the table is the so-called “max fac” – or maximum facilitation – solution, using technology to minimise the need for border checks.According to the Sunday Times, Davis told the prime minister to ignore Robbins in favour of her ministers.Robbins, tipped as a future cabinet secretary, was moved from Davis’s Brexit department into No 10 last year as May sought to take greater control over the process.A former minister claimed that Tory backbenchers could be willing to oust May if she does not stop listening to her adviser on the customs partnership plan.EU members (plus Turkey, Andorra, Monaco and San Marino) trade without customs duties, taxes or tariffs between themselves, and charge the same tariffs on imports from outside the EU. Customs union members cannot negotiate their own trade deals outside the EU, which is why leaving it – while hopefully negotiating a bespoke arrangement – has been one of the government’s Brexit goals.\u0026nbspSee our full Brexit phrasebook.“The prime minister would be extraordinarily unwise to take Robbins’s advice on this,” they told the newspaper. “There will be a very swift and very violent reaction. It will put the prime minister in personal peril.” Attacks on Robbins provoked an angry response from civil servants on Sunday morning. Dave Penman, the head of the FDA union, said: “Is there a more despicable form of political cowardice than to allow anonymous briefings in your name to effectively call for a civil servant to be sacked?“Civil servants advise, ministers decide. Politicians of all stripes know this. If David Davis leaves these comments from a ‘close ally’ out there unchallenged, it ultimately suggests that he supports them but isn’t brave enough to say so publicly.”Heywood also took the unusual step of tweeting about criticisms of Robbins. After May’s close aide Gavin Barwell retweeted a statement from the chief whip, Julian Smith, saying “Attacking ind civil servants is deeply unfair”, Heywood wrote:Under Robbins’ plan, the UK would collect import tariffs on behalf of Brussels, while being free to set its own duties for goods bound for the UK. Pro-Brexit Conservatives have described the plan as unworkable and say it will allow Brussels to dictate UK trade policy.An aide to Davis said the Sunday Times story was wrong, and added the Brexit secretary had praised Robbins in an interview with the newspaper on Monday but his words had not been published. According to the aide, Davis said in the interview: “Olly is a fantastic civil servant ... He’s the sherpa, he’s the PM’s sherpa and what do sherpas do? They get you to base camp so you can make the assault on the summit. It’s fine.”Senior Tory backbencher Bernard Jenkin said on Sunday that a customs partnership plan would mean the UK acting as a “tax collector” for the EU and would fail the prime minister’s key tests for a deal with Brussels. “It doesn’t pass any of the key tests that the prime minister has outlined in her statements,” he told BBC1’s Sunday Politics programme. “It doesn’t give us full regulatory autonomy so we wouldn’t be able to do free trade deals with other countries,” he added. The Brexiter business group Leave Means Leave has called for Robbins to be sacked and “replaced by someone from outside the civil service who will take a tough line with Brussels”.Richard Tice and John Longworth of the Brexit-backing business group wrote: “At each stage, Robbins has presided over a bungled negotiating position on behalf of the UK, giving leverage to the EU and acquiescing to their every whim in a way no business person would do.”In a further development, Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, has told the UK the time has come for it to “resolve the contradictions” in its Irish border policy.Writing in Ireland’s Sunday Independent newspaper ahead of a visit to the country on Monday, he said there will need to be “substantial progress” on the border issue by the next major meeting of EU leaders, who are due to assess progress on the border issue at a summit in June."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7d4118ace8f192102934222e2e6902e55205e73/566_15_2697_1619/master/2697.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9d3bcec3473d0e524ae851c00dfbd896","title":"the favourites to take over from amber rudd as home secretary","story":"Giving Michael Gove the job would cap a striking comeback but the timing favours Sajid JavidWho are the contenders to be the next home secretary? Downing Street has said a new appointment will not be announced until later on Monday but these are the ministers and MPs who are in contention to replace Amber Rudd.Javid is the favourite for the job and is already being tipped by Tory MPs. The timing could not be better from his perspective he was on the front of the Sunday  talking about his personal anger over the treatment of the Windrush migrants, saying: “I thought that could be my mum ... my dad ... my uncle ... it could be me.” Having backed remain, Javid would keep the balance in the top jobs, though he has made it clear since the referendum he is sceptical of softer Brexit options such as remaining in the customs union.Gove has courted the spotlight since his return to the cabinet table, with a series of eye-catching environmental policies, including a well-publicised war on plastics. However, the key test will be whether his personal relationship with May has mended, since the two clashed during the coalition government in a furious briefing war over her performance at the Home Office when she was home secretary. Were he to get the job, it is likely to re-ignite tensions over the anti-immigration messages of the Vote Leave campaign.Hunt made it clear at the last cabinet reshuffle that he did not want to leave the Department of Health. When May attempted to move him to Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, he convinced her to keep him in post. However, the Home Office is certainly a bigger draw and it could be the promotion to tempt him, perhaps even paving the way for an eventual run at the top job.Lidington is only just settling in at the Cabinet Office, replacing May’s old friend Damian Green who was sacked for making misleading statements about pornography found on his office computer. In Rudd, May has lost another ally that she trusted and confidants are now getting fewer by the day in the cabinet, so Lidington could get the role if May believes the priority should be a safe pair of hands. James Brokenshire, the former Home Office minister and Northern Ireland secretary who left the cabinet due to ill health, also fits that bill.Bradley worked under May at the Home Office, giving her direct experience of the complexities of the department. The former culture secretary was moved to Northern Ireland in the latest reshuffle, currently one of the most difficult jobs in government due to Brexit tensions over the Irish border and the collapse of devolved government in Belfast. Appointing Bradley would also mean keeping the 5050 balance of men and women in the four great offices of state.They are unlikely appointments, but both are capable and experienced former cabinet ministers. To appoint either of them would strip the pro-remain rebels in parliament of a key voice. Both, however, may find the compromise too much, and there is mutual animosity between May and Morgan after a fallout last year over a pair of leather trousers worn by May."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1fda58f19564d3b0c82d889f657448d36f188eef/0_37_3053_1833/master/3053.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2595f350b758ca92d4d2ff3e24745597","title":"lebron pours in 45 to carry cleveland cavaliers past indiana pacers in game 7","story":"LeBron James scored 45 points and got some needed help in Game 7 to stay unbeaten in the opening round of the NBA playoffs, leading the Cleveland Cavaliers to a 105-101 win over the Indiana Pacers, who pushed the game’s best player to the limit.James improved to 13-0 in the first round and kept Cleveland’s strange season alive – for the time being. It took everything James and the Cavs had to hold off the Pacers, who were swept by Cleveland a year ago and came in confident after a 34-point win in Game 6.The Cavs will open the conference semifinals on Tuesday at top-seeded Toronto.James played 43 minutes, leaving late in the third quarter and heading straight to the locker room to be treated for cramps. The 33-year-old was going to leave it all on the floor in what some Cleveland fans feared could have been his last game with the franchise.Tristan Thompson made a rare start for the Cavs – Cleveland coach Tyronn Lue used his 34th different starting lineup this season – and added 15 points and 10 rebounds. Kevin Love made four three-pointers, and George Hill returned after missing three games with back spasms to score 11 in 19 second-half minutes.Victor Oladipo scored 30 and Darren Collison had 23 for the Pacers, who were still within four points in the final minute before a cutting James scored on a bullet pass from Kyle Korver with 30 seconds left.Oladipo hit a three at the horn and was immediately embraced by James, who had never played a Game 7 in the first round and wasn’t about to let Indiana end his run toward an eighth straight finals.It was the first Game 7 in Quicken Loans Arena history, and Cleveland fans were on edge from the start.A loss would not only have ended the Cavs’ season earlier than expected and their reign as three-time conference champions, but would have pushed James closer to free agency. He’s expected to opt out of his contract in July to test the market, and there’s already a line of teams stretching from Philadelphia to Los Angeles looking to sign the three-time champion.After the Cavs were rocked in Game 6 at Indianapolis, Lue knew he needed to shake things up.So he switched his starting lineup for the fourth time in the series, going with James, Korver, Thompson, Love and JR Smith. Thompson had played just 24 minutes in the first six games of the series and made his first start since 28 March.It was the first time Lue used the starting lineup all season, and in the season’s biggest game, he went with the players he trusts most – James, Love, Smith and Thompson are the only holdovers from the three Finals teams.Thompson made an immediate impact, scoring six points and seven rebounds, and behind James’ 26 points, the Cavs built an 11-point halftime lead.James Harden proved once again that Utah’s vaunted defense was no match for him.Harden scored 41 points and the Houston Rockets raced out to a huge lead and sailed to a 110-96 win over the Jazz in Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals on Sunday.Houston was up by 25 at halftime behind 34 points combined from Harden and Chris Paul. The Jazz, who didn’t wrap up their first-round series with Oklahoma City until late Friday night, looked sluggish and struggled to keep pace with the top-seeded Rockets, who hadn’t played since eliminating Minnesota on Wednesday.The Jazz tied for second in the NBA in the regular season by allowing just 99.8 points, but failed to stop Harden in any of their meetings. Harden, who also had seven assists and eight rebounds, picked up where he left off in the regular season against the Jazz when he averaged 34.3 points, led by a 56-point performance in a 137-110 win in November.“Their defense is really good – their defense is super,” Houston coach Mike D’Antoni said. “But James is James.”Utah coach Quin Snyder seemed at a loss as to how to limit the MVP front-runner, who had the sixth 40-point playoff game of his career.“He’s a special player,” he said. “It’s hard to give credit to all the things that he does. He just impacts the game in so many mays. You have to try to make it harder for him.”It was Houston’s fourth straight win by 10 or more points this postseason, and the Rockets have won their five games against the Jazz by an average of 16.8 points.“We’re different,” Harden said. “We’ve seen so many different defenses throughout this year that have prepared us for this moment.”The Jazz got 21 points each from rookie Donovan Mitchell and Jae Crowder while playing without starting point guard Ricky Rubio, who sat with a strained left hamstring. It was a significant blow after he averaged 14 points, 7.3 rebounds and seven assists in the first round.The Jazz refused to blame their tough game on the fact that they didn’t have much of a break between the first and second round.“It’s a quick turnaround obviously and there’s some fatigue,” Mitchell said. “But that wasn’t the reason for the performance.”The Rockets had 10 three-pointers by halftime, led by three apiece from Harden and PJ Tucker. They finished with 17, including seven from Harden, which tied his career-high for a playoff game.The Rockets were up by 18 entering the fourth after Paul hit a three-pointer at the end of the third. Utah scored the first seven points of the fourth quarter to get within 86-75, but Harden made three free throws over the next minute to end the run.Rudy Gobert, who had 11 points and nine rebounds, had a dunk after that, but a 3-pointer by Harden extended Houston’s lead to 92-77 with about eight and a half minutes left.Mitchell was shaken up when Eric Gordon stepped on his ankle as he drove to the basket with about five and a half minutes remaining. He stayed on the court for a second holding his ankle before hopping up and walking gingerly to the bench. But remained on the bench for just a few seconds before returning and said after the game that he was OK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8fc75899cbe64170d23a20947d81aecc3f955ccd/17_42_2521_1512/master/2521.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e330361f2033d6a28e48db8a0ce5249f","title":"lewis hamilton wins azerbaijan grand prix red bulls collide","story":"• Raikkonen second Pérez third Sebastian Vettel fourth• Red Bulls of Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo collideFrom formulaic through to a denouement that simply could not have been scripted, the streets of Baku were once again the stage for a compelling, dramatic performance. Where cool heads were called for at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix there was not a little abandon and in its wake fortune too played its part to deliver an unlikely result in a season already notable for refusing to stick to a predictable plot.Lewis Hamilton took the win but it is unlikely to be a favoured memory. He inherited first place with two laps to go from his Mercedes team-mate Valtteri Bottas, who had looked nailed on for the victory until a puncture caused by debris ended his charge, leaving the Finn disconsolate.Behind Hamilton his championship rival, Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel, for some time in control of the race, saw his hopes disappear after a late safety car when he sacrificed calm consideration for an overambitious lunge that reduced him to fourth place.This most unlikely turnaround at the front was reflected in an equally unexpected reversal of the championship standings. Trailing Vettel by nine points before Baku, Hamilton leaves four points to the good, the first time he has topped the table this season.Hamilton, who had not been on the pace all weekend and never looked like threatening for the lead, was honest about his good fortune. “It was mixed emotions,” he said. “Grateful for the opportunity to win but on the other side I did not drive the way I feel like I normally drive, so that hurts a little bit in my heart.”A likely win at the first round in Melbourne was denied Hamilton after a late safety car and he may feel that some justice has been served. But perhaps there will be more satisfaction that his chance of a win here last year was ultimately denied after Vettel barged him. “I was coming out of the last corner in disbelief,” he said. “It was very emotional. In previous years here I have been in the lead and then something went against me. I said maybe third time lucky and it was that scenario today.”Bottas’s ill-fortune and Hamilton’s good favour was the final part of a thrilling last act. Behind them the Red Bulls had been offering a fine narrative of their own, with Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen going wheel to wheel throughout. It was nail-biting stuff but the team had let them race, a decision they came to regret when the Australian went for a pass into the braking zone of turn one. Verstappen had already moved once and then shifted back to the inside where Ricciardo had committed. A terminal collision ensued. The stewards concluded that both were responsible, Verstappen for changing lines twice and Ricciardo for making his move too late. Both were given reprimands.Disappointment was writ large on the faces of the drivers, but that was as nothing to the condemnation from the team principal, Christian Horner. “We are not apportioning blame, they are both to blame,” he said. “They have been reminded that they are part of a team, they are highly paid iniduals and have to act with the team’s interests at heart, not just their own. That message was delivered very clearly.”The safety car the incident caused proved crucial. It allowed Mercedes to pit Bottas, who had stayed out long on his tyres and inherited the lead, to emerge still in front of Vettel.A further lack of focus saw Romain Grosjean put his Haas into the wall on lap 43 while weaving, and that kept the safety car out longer than expected. Five laps later at the restart Bottas had control, but Vettel did not. He charged up the inside into one, far too hot, locked up, went wide and lost places to Hamilton and Kimi Räikkönen, who was second, and then to Force India’s Sergio Pérez who took third, his team’s first podium of the year.It was not the percentage manoeuvre of a championship contender but the German insisted he had no regrets. “I am happy I tried the move. I am not happy it didn’t work. You have to try.” That’s a view he may come to consider again if the season goes to the wire.A lap later Bottas had to face his own slings and arrows, grinding to a halt amid disintegrating rubber. “It was just unfortunate. Unlucky. Ten pints of beer and maybe I will be fine,” said the visibly disappointed Finn. “I will get through it, you always have to get through, it is part of racing but at the moment it is painful.”Hamilton felt for Bottas but knows that he and his team have real work ahead. Their issue with bringing the tyres up to temperature looked no closer to being solved in Baku and he acknowledged that they had to address it.For the moment, however, he leaves with a lead, favoured by fortune but also more than aware that he kept his head and seized the reward. It was cause for the four-times world champion to remember the lesson he had learned in karting. “I never give up,” he said. “It has been a while since I have been reminded of that lesson my dad taught me years ago. I kept pushing and things turned out the way they did and that was a realisation of how true that mindset is.”Carlos Sainz in the Renault finished in fifth, while Charles Leclerc completed an exemplary afternoon and the rookie’s best drive thus far in F1 to take sixth for Sauber. The two McLarens of Fernando Alonso and Stoffel Vandoorne were seventh and ninth, with Lance Stroll eighth in the Williams and the Toro Rosso of Brendon Hartley 10th."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/20643928e4ff007d0a42bdad85e77c7acc5ee5cb/0_1044_3162_1897/master/3162.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=62b1075fa1dc053fbd0ab2e2e6d2bfe5","title":"masterpieces review finborough london sarah daniels 1983","story":"Finborough, LondonMen openly tell rape jokes in Sarah Daniels’ 1983 play, which has renewed impact in the era of #MeToo, even if this revival could be sharperWhen Trump was caught on tape joking about his lewd attitude towards women, he defended himself by saying it was just “locker room talk”. But talk matters, as is demonstrated in Sarah Daniels’ 1983 play Masterpieces, which was derided by many male critics on its premiere, and now gets a timely revival.In an early scene, set at a dinner party, the men delight in telling sexist jokes about rape in front of the women. But Daniels’ ground-breaking play makes the link between misogynistic jokes and misogynistic actions. Set in pre-internet times when porn came between pages, it also suggests that porn that depicts sexual violence against women leads to real violence against women and harassment.This consciousness-raising story may lack the complexities of 21st-century gender politics, but doesn’t lack impact. Rowena (Olivia Darnley giving the production’s only memorable performance) is a social worker who thinks herself happily married and little of the fact that when her job keeps her out late at night she feels afraid of being alone on the streets.When a client is abused and she starts to investigate the pornography that her husband and his friends think is normal, she becomes angry and takes action. “How they must hate us,” she says on seeing one image.Daniels’s play, rightly kept in period by director Melissa Dunne, sometimes shows its age. But it also reminds us, in the era of #MeToo, that perhaps progress in the way men talk, think about and treat women has been less dramatic than we might think. The men in Masterpieces wear their misogyny like a badge of pride: today, it is more likely to be covert.The play is a fascinating example of radical non-linear storytelling, and it’s only a pity that it doesn’t get a sharper, stronger production than Dunne manages here. A small cast playing multiple roles makes demands that are clumsily handled and a lack of pace, fluidity and clarity do Daniels’ provoking drama no favours.

I’m used to internet memes reminding me things are depressingly older than I remember. We’re closer to the year 2036 than we are to Jennifer Lopez’s Grammy dress! Rupert Grint is turning 30! The sandwich you enjoyed this morning? You actually ate that on a Pict settlement in the Dark Ages! You’re going to die very soon LOL!Even in my youth, I recall Chucklevision’s premise being flimsy. Two naive painter and decorators, who seemed to be 100, but were probably no older than Rupert Grint is now, displaying a formulaic incompetence at their job. (Sadly, as an adult, I can relate.)What can this pair of mustachioed buffoons possibly offer a new Channel 5 audience, raised on Towie and Tinder and terrorism? We no longer live in innocent times. No one chuckles any more. Tinchy Stryder summed up Paul and Barry’s chances back in 2014, singing “Fuck all that me to you to me to you stuff” on his diss track, To Me To You (Bruv). And that was a voluntary collaboration with the pair, for charity.I’m worried they’ll be eaten alive. Or succumb to dispiriting, channel-mandated storylines about leaking client nudes by accident, winding up on a reality dating show, or being caught up in riots, and throwing their ladder into the window of a Footlocker. Hang on, what am I talking about? These storylines sound amazing. I’ve changed my mind. Roll on the Chuckle Brothers reboot!It’s been officially confirmed that children have greater energy levels, metabolic capacity and recovery rates than endurance athletes. The next step is obvious. A no-holds-barred Olympics, in which six-year-olds compete against sports professionals, who are encouraged to take all the steroids and stem cells they can handle, to level the field. Imagine the potential of cross-country tag, or a violent-reprisals version of Simon says, or test-match length ring a ring o’ roses, played to the point of collapse. Show me one exhausted parent who doesn’t think this is at least worth a try."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81d98505a16e683fcac471844753e4979a680334/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=59dfaf84a5eabc970998e0700a6a56bd","title":"stationery that looks good enough to eat in pictures","story":"When he turned seven, Neal Whittington’s uncle gave him a £7 WH Smith voucher: this started a lifelong obsession with stationery.

McDonnell was joined by the Liberal Democrat leader, Vince Cable, who said there should be an inquiry into why En+ was allowed to float in a deal that earned banks, lawyers, auditors and PR firms £25m in fees.Cable said it was “very odd that we will follow Trump into military action, but won’t join in imposing tough sanctions on oligarchs”. On the En+ listing, he said: “There should be a review of this flotation. When Russian oligarchs are using the London markets to raise money we must take a strict line on scrutiny.”Six banks shared an estimated half of the £25m with the largest share taken by the lead bookrunner, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Citigroup, Credit Suisse, JP Morgan and Russian banks Sberbank and VTB Capital would have shared the rest. The remainder was to be shared by lawyers including Linklaters and White \u0026amp Case with smaller auditors KPMG and financial PR specialists Finsbury.En+ is a holding company for Deripaska’s metal and energy interests. He built his business empire during Russia’s so-called aluminium wars following the post-Soviet privatisations of the 1990s. It floated in London last November, raising $1bn which was used to pay back borrowings owed to VTB, a bank prevented by sanctions from raising capital in the EU and the US.The City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), approved the flotation, but a fortnight ago Deripaska was one of 38 Russian business leaders the US Treasury targeted because of “malign activity” on the part of Vladimir Putin’s government.En+’s share price tumbled as a result, and the stock is now priced at $6, less than half the $14 flotation price. A string of independent directors have resigned although the company’s chairman, the former Conservative minister Lord Barker of Battle, remains the firm’s figurehead. Finsbury no longer advises En+, saying its mandate only extended to the listing.The US Treasury cited Russia’s support for Syria’s president, Bashar al-Assad, malicious cyber activities, the occupation of Crimea and support for violence in eastern Ukraine as its reasoning for putting the sanctions in place. They were already in preparation when the UK accused Putin’s government of being behind the poisoning of the Skripals in Salisbury.An FCA spokesperson said the regulator had responded to the Trump administration’s action by delisting a class of En+ shares aimed at US citizens, but that it had no plans to take any further action because the British government had not asked it to.Deripaska is one of Russia’s best connected international businessmen. Paul Manafort, the former head of Donald Trump’s election campaign who is fighting fraud and tax charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller, worked for Deripaska for many years.Criticising the British failure to follow the US example, McDonnell said: “The City of London cannot risk to be seen as a light touch when it comes to imposing effective sanctions on Russia and clamping down on foreign oligarchs linked to the regime. In this case, it looks like once again we have been playing catch-up with regulators in other countries.”EN+ did not respond to a request for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da8a2b6483c373a8c35387af7848693464225378/0_84_3916_2350/master/3916.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=80f9a107c7498a889d8d718fd1df54b0","title":"north korea denuclearization john bolton mike pompeo","story":"North Korea will have to show concrete and tangible evidence it has made a strategic decision to give up nuclear weapons before any move is made to ease pressure on the regime, Donald Trump’s national security adviser, John Bolton, said on Sunday.With a summit between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un potentially as close as three weeks away, Bolton warned that no progress would be made without verifiable evidence of Pyongyang’s commitment to complete and “irreversible” denuclearization. “What we want to see from them is evidence that it’s real and not just rhetoric,” he told CBS’ Face the Nation.The famously hawkish Bolton took a notably less hardline approach than was reflected in his many disparaging remarks towards North Korea before he was brought into the White House earlier this month. In one typical comment on Fox News he made what he called a joke: “How do you know the North Korean regime is lying – answer, their lips are moving.”Now Bolton is striking a more nuanced position. In an interview with Fox News Sunday, he stressed that the US had made no commitment to remove its military presence from the Korean peninsula and said: “There’s nobody in the Trump administration who’s starry-eyed about what’s happening here.”He went on to say that if North Korea were willing to allow full and complete disclosure of its nuclear weapons programme coupled with international verification, “things could move quickly”.Hopes of a breakthrough in dismantling North Korea’s nuclear weapons at a Trump-Kim summit have risen in the wake of fast-moving events. Details emerging from the office of South Korean president Moon Jae-in following his historic face-to-face encounter with Kim suggest the North Korean leader offered to allow foreign inspectors and journalists to witness nuclear decommissioning ahead of the Trump summit.The Trump administration is remaining noncommittal about such dramatic posturing from Kim, as the US tries to walk a hazardous path that both pursues a breakthrough and remains aware of broken promises made in the past. In his first interview as secretary of state, former CIA director Mike Pompeo characterized the current flurry of diplomatic activity as a “real opportunity for something that would be transformative for the world if we could achieve it”.Pompeo spoke to ABC’s This Week from Saudi Arabia, giving generally stilted answers and bringing the interview to an abrupt close after facing questions on US strategy. He declined to reveal intelligence on North Korean nuclear capabilities and said repeatedly: “This administration has its eyes wide open.”He added: “We know the history, we know the risks. We’re going to negotiate in a different way than before, we’re going to require steps that demonstrate denuclearization is going to be achieved. We’re not going to take promises or words, we are going to look for actions and deeds.”Earlier this year, Pompeo had a secret meeting with Kim in Pyongyang, lasting more than an hour. He told ABC it had been a “good conversation. We talked about serious matters, on the hardest issues that face our two countries.”Bolton went into further details about subjects that Trump will want to raise should the summit with Kim go ahead at a time and location still to be determined. North Korean ballistic missile programs, biological and chemical weapons programs, and the “abduction of innocent Japanese and South Korean citizens over the years” would all be on the list, Bolton said.Despite the reticence on the part of both Pompeo and Bolton to go into details about the precise US gameplan, top administration figures were outspoken on one point: all praise for current extraordinary events should be bestowed on Trump.The most passionate proponent of that idea is Trump himself. At a rally in Michigan on Saturday night he told the crowd: “I had one of the fake news groups this morning saying: ‘What do you think President Trump had to do with it?’ I’ll tell you what. Like, how about everything?”In response, there were chants of “Nobel! Nobel!”, in reference to the Nobel peace prize.Bolton made the same point on Sunday to CBS, albeit in more measured terms: “I think it’s clear we’re here where we are today because of the pressure that the Trump administration has put on North Korea. Economic pressure, political, military pressure. I think this is widely recognized.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c7367799adc822bdfd24c4f8625cef7eff67e830/0_80_1200_720/master/1200.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=35d69f76f4e11be8bdd1e38e50a78438","title":"my financial future can i have my brunch and eat it too","story":"The options appear to be: never socialise and stay in to save for a house, or live a normal, modern urban life and spiral into debt. But is there a third way?Sitting firmly in the middle of the millennial generation (those born 1981-2000) and I’m told I could easily afford to buy my first home in London if I just give up: coffee, my gym membership, an annual weekend away, takeaway food, and a mobile upgrade, or one night out a week, for five years – or avocados.Sure, London living is afforded by renting the equivalent of a dodgy hostel dorm, nights out revolving around two-for-one deals, and “side-hustles”, which is a glorified term for my three jobs. So, should I accept that I can’t have my brunch and eat it too? Living paycheck to paycheck isn’t the dream and maybe neither is owning a home, but there must be a way I could at least consider the option.I’m certainly not alone, but maybe we’re placing too much value on “Yolo” – apparently a typical habit of young people today – so I’ve asked Paul Bridgwater, head of commercial and proposition at financial services provider OneFamily, and millennial lifestyle and personal finance expert Lisa Rowan from The Penny Hoarder what they think – and luckily neither suggested a five-year period where I give up all that I hold dear.Is it really that hard to save in a big city or am I being led astray?Rowan suggests that, unfortunately, it’s not all in my head. “Affordable, low-amenity units are being replaced with luxury buildings that are simply out of reach for many people, especially young people in the early stages of their careers,” she says. “This competitive housing environment means more workers in their 20s and 30s are enduring long commutes from the suburbs or are living with several roommates in order to make the most of their budgets.” But, Bridgwater says, while it can feel unattainable without the help from “the bank of mum and dad” we do have the benefit of living in a connected, digital age that can help us achieve our financial goals.I really value my social life – do I have to give up a chunk of it for five years?No, says Rowan, but there are some hacks to help make sure you don’t spend most of your monthly wages during the excitement of payday. In short, be at least a bit prepared. “Knowing the type of activity upfront can help you determine whether an event is a social and financial priority for you – then, it’s easier to make compromises. You may skip on the 12-person birthday dinner at a fancy restaurant, but you can still meet the group for drinks or dessert afterward. You can still go on a bar crawl with your friends, but perhaps eat a hearty meal before you leave the house,” she says.Bridgwater agrees, and says it’s safe to assume that most of your friends are in the same boat, so be straight up with them. “Money is a bit of a taboo subject for any age group, especially in the UK. On a practical level, earnings, savings and debts are not really discussed and perhaps they should be,” he says. “Like anything else in life, by talking and sharing issues, interesting solutions will come to light.”OK, so maybe I should be budgeting. What are some handy guidelines?Bridgwater says that budgeting isn’t the same for everyone, but taking away the temptation to spend is often the easiest way to save. “Create different accounts for your big expenses (housing, bills and savings) and then set up a standing order into these accounts one to two days after your wages go in from your main account. You’ll then know the money you have left in your main account is money you can spend,” he says.So, can I think about saving for a big purchase and still keep seeing my friends?Yes, says Rowan: “You can have your instant and delayed gratification at the same time.” A product like OneFamily’s stocks and shares Lifetime Isa is a good start when considering your options. With a Lifetime Isa, for every £4 put in, the government adds £1 – so save up to £4,000 a year and get £1,000 as a bonus (available after 12 months). Lifetime Isas are available either based on cash investments, which can be preferable for first-time house purchases in the short-term or stocks and shares investments, which might be preferable if you are aiming to buy your first home in five or more years, as they offer potentially better returns over the longer term, but be aware that capital is at risk.For information on the OneFamily stocks and shares Lifetime Isa, visit OneFamily.

But Pricewatch reckons that a good consumer needs to follow many more commandments to make sure they get the most out of life. By our count there are 24, in fact.We are all creatures of habit. We tend to shop in the same supermarkets and buy clothes in the same places and stick with the same phone, gas, television and broadband providers, come what may.This is understandable but not clever. Make a point of doing your “big shop” in a different supermarket every now and then. Just to shake things up. And if you have not experienced the delights of the German discounters in a while – and less than 30 per cent of Irish consumers shop in either Aldi or Lidl regularly – then give them a whirl.The quality has improved dramatically in recent years and they will save you money. They will also dramatically reduce the time you spend shopping because they are small and have less than 20 per cent of the stock a really big supermarket operated by their rivals has, so you will be able to zip around. And probably buy some class of weird jack hammer to boot.We throw away as much as a third of the food we buy and appear happy to bin hundreds, if not thousands, of euro each year. Stop doing that by making sure you only buy what you need. Make lists and stick to them.Not long ago we heard a terrible story of a person who ended up paying health insurance on the double for a whole year because they thought they had cancelled with one provider and signed up with another only to find out way down the line that the cancellation had not gone through as they thought.When the company they had tried to leave asked them what date they had made the original cancellation call and who they had spoken to they had no idea. No records mean it is always going to be harder to get redress if things go wrong. So if you are interacting with a company and the outcome matters, take a note of the date and time and the people you were speaking to on your phone.If you are making a complaint write a quick timeline of your grievances and include dates and times of phone calls or other conversations. Write down who you spoke to and what was said.People who shop on impulse rarely make the best decisions. Always ask yourself two questions: do you really need this thing? And is this thing really good value for money?And then go away and think about it for a while.Randomly received text messages and Facebook posts promising you free iPads are always nonsense. Expensive creams will not give you the gift of eternal youth, that expensive diet or homeopathic treatment aimed at taking years off you will not work.And the sub-Saharan princess with a case full of diamonds for you is actually a sweaty man in a wife-beater and Y-fronts who will give you nothing more than endless heartache. And if you ever get an unsolicited email from your bank, from Revenue or anyone else asking for your bank details – or even just your name and email address – it is a scam, no matter how convincing the mail looks.Cooking is cheaper and better for your physical and mental well-being than relying on processed food.Cyclists are healthier than drivers. That is a fact. A couple of years ago the Lancet published a report which showed cyclists to be slimmer and likely to live longer than their car-driving counterparts.Looking at biological data from more than 150,000 people and studying the health of half a million others aged between 40 and 69, scientists definitively concluded that getting on your bike was better for you. Another Danish study showed that regular cyclists live for more than five years longer than non-cyclists. And it will also save you thousands of euro in commuting costs while allowing you to feel super-smug.Generally speaking such diets are expensive and worthless – this is particularly true of detox diets which are just nonsense. Don’t trust anyone who tries to sell anything that claims to be detoxifying unless it is a human organ. And you’re probably better off not trusting someone trying to sell you a liver or a kidney either.For all its faults and for all the recent controversies of recent years, we should still be grateful that Ireland has a good supply of good-quality drinking water which comes from our taps free of charge (yes, yes, yes we know we pay for it through general taxation but you know what we mean).It takes three litres of regular water to manufacture a single litre of bottled water, and that plastic bottle will take at least 500 years to break down, at least until those enzymes that have evolved to eat plastic multiply. And let’s just hope they don’t evolve any further and start eating us.If you happen to be among the 70 per cent of Irish people with private health insurance who has not changed provider for a few years do before your next renewal date.It will save you hundreds of euro each year – and you may even save thousands if you happen to be on a really expensive policy. And if you are canny you should be able to make the savings without losing any real benefits.Remember when switching, providers can’t ask intrusive questions about your health. The only thing they can really ask if if you have health insurance already and, if so, for how long and with which insurer and what level of cover you have.As with health insurance providers, gas and electricity companies profit from our lethargy and ignorance. By switching from one charging you the standard rate to one offering a discounted rate you could easily save more than €200 over the next 12 months.As many as 85 per cent of Irish people pay a higher tariff for both electricity and gas than they need to. And unlike Cornflakes or broadband, there is no difference in the quality of the gas or electricity between the dearest and the cheapest.Every now and then set yourself a challenge to spend nothing for just one day. Then see if you can make it three days. Spending can be a habit and it can be broken.And speaking of spending money, never do your grocery shopping while hungry or your online shopping when you are drunk. Don’t routinely carry your credit cards with you. And avoid the temptation to shop on payday. Anyone who goes into Penneys on the day they get paid is bound to leave with an armful of clothes they are almost certainly going to regret buying.Big companies profit from our unwillingness to even open – never mind actually read and try to understand – the bills and statements they send us either virtually or physically. So make a resolution to pay attention to them. You never know when you are being gouged and by whom.Companies have made it a policy to make resolving problems as difficult as possible. The hope is that difficult customers – and by that we mean anyone looking for help or redress – will just go away. If you have a grievance with a company, persist. Don’t just give up if it seems like too much hassle. That’s just playing into their hands.You don’t want to be the person shouting in a shop because it refuses to sell you the flatscreen telly that was incorrectly priced at 1 cent. Retailers are not obliged to sell you a product just because it has a particular price tag on it.And you do not have the automatic right to a refund or a replacement if a product turns out to be faulty or flawed in some way. A provider can instead offer to repair it. Oh and if you pay a deposit for something and then change your mind, do not automatically assume a provider will give you your money back. They might. But they might not. It depends on the terms and conditions.Working as a shop assistant or in a call centre can be incredibly difficult and not very well paid. If you have a grievance, there is little or no point in shouting at the lowest-paid staff member, the very person who has no power to effect change. Always be polite – and always make sure you are addressing your complaints to the right people.Without generalising overly Americans and Germans are great at complaining while Irish people are rubbish. We hate “making a fuss”. Not even Pricewatch is immune and unless a waiter actually spits in our soup before tipping it into our lap we are likely to say everything is grand even if it tastes like cold vomit. But complaining is good and good businesses want to hear our concerns so they can have a chance to address them.Yes Amazon or Asos or the Honk Kong-based electronic’s retailer Dan’s Dodgy Deals might be cheap but what is the ultimate cost? If we all shop online all the time then local retailers will disappear and we will all be the poorer for that.There is no point in mourning the passing of Clerys or Guineys or wherever if the last time you spent any money there was back when Johnny Logan was asking what another year was.Unless you have friends in Senegal or the Democratic Republic of Congo don’t return a missed call from those places. In fact, if you have a missed call from any exotic looking number don’t call back. It’s almost always a scam.We know that sometimes they are longer than the Bible so a handy way to scan them is to copy the whole thing into a Word document and use Ctrl-F to look for key words you think might be relevant.It is easy to complain in a very public way using Facebook, Twitter, Instagram or whatever social media platform you are fond of using yourself. But remember to be polite.These platforms are populated with enough trolls already. And when it comes to sharing personal details on such platforms such as the above, mind yourself and limit the amount of information you put into the public domain.Is there an ombudsman or regulator who can help you out? There is a Financial Services Ombudsman, a Pensions Ombudsman, the Central Bank, a taxi regulator and ComReg, for starters. But remember they can rarely be your starting point, and you will have to exhaust the complaints procedure for that sector and deal with the company before they will entertain you.If you have been let down by a shop or service provider than contact Pricewatch – we might be able to help you out. But please remember we do get a lot of queries and complaints and can’t deal with them all."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3477012.1524866216!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"cervicalcheck chief did not want some women told of false results","story":"Tánaiste Simon Coveney has apologised to Vicky Phelan and her family, the 43-year-old mother of two was incorrectly given the all-clear from a smear test taken in 2011.\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVicky Phelan from Annacotty, Co Limerick, was not told about an incorrect 2011 smear test until September 2017, despite a 2014 audit by CervicalCheck showing that the test was wrong. Photograph: Collins CourtsThe clinical director of the national cervical cancer screening programme advised a Limerick gynaecologist to file some audited test results rather than to tell women in certain cases that all-clear smear tests they had received years earlier were wrong.Dr Gráinne Flannelly, clinical director of CervicalCheck, told gynaecologist Dr Kevin Hickey in an email in July 2017 that several women in the mid-west region should not be told about the false negative tests discovered in an audit after he wrote to her to confirm that she felt some women with cervical cancer should not be informed about them.The private correspondence was submitted in the High Court case taken by Vicky Phelan, a 43-year-old mother of two with terminal cancer from Annacotty, Co Limerick who was not told about an incorrect 2011 smear test until September 2017, despite a 2014 audit by CervicalCheck showing that the test was wrong.The records emerged after Dr Flannelly publicly acknowledged that she could not say for sure that all of the 206 women who missed early treatment for cervical cancer had been made aware of the situation.Dr Hickey wrote to Dr Flannelly on June 20th, 2017 referring to a list of patients with cervical cancer noting that in three highlighted cases the women should be told about the false smear test results after a 2014 review.“There were other ladies where the review process has altered the original smear report and it looks from your notes that you have felt that these should be filed in the patients’ notes and that no review is necessary,” Dr Hickey wrote to her at the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street in Dublin.“I just wanted to confirm that you are happy with this whole process centrally from the Cervical Screening Unit given that it looks that some of the review smears were different from the original.”Dr Flannelly replied on July 7th, 2017 in an email with the subject line “clarification”.“Yes – a balance needs to be struck in deciding who needs a formal communication of the outcome of the audit. The possibility of resultant harm is crucial,” she wrote.In cases where women have not had cancer or who have “local and fertility-sparing surgery”, Dr Hickey should “simply file” the audited test results in the patients’ medical notes, Dr Flannelly wrote.“The concept of delay is important,” she said. “I based my judgment on the medical information available to me and using the same criteria I use in my own practice when dealing with these cases. Only three of the women merited a closeout meeting using these criteria,” Dr Flannelly wrote.On August 8th, 2017, after being told by Dr Hickey that he had taken it upon himself to inform all the affected women, Dr Flannelly wrote to him again, noting his decision and saying that this “underscores the value of the local clinician reviewing the clinical context”.“The advice I gave was based on the limited information available to me and was given as an honest assessment of what seemed to be the best way to proceed with these cases,” she said.“It is right and fitting that your own clinical judgment should take precedence.” Yesterday, Minister for Health Simon Harris appointed a senior team of experts to examine the cases of the 206 women who missed early treatment for cervical cancer and to assess how many were not made aware of the delay in diagnosis.The appointments followed Mr Harris’s failure to declare confidence in the leadership of the programme. A HSE spokeswoman said Prof Flannelly would be “continuing in her role” and was “directly involved” in the process to provide assurance around the communications with the 206 women whose cases were under review.Asked about doctors using their “judgment” on whether to inform patients of wrong test results, the spokeswoman said the “practice was deemed to be appropriate and is in line with the practice in the UK for the communication of cancer audit reviews”."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator wants significant progress on problem of Irish Border by JunePricewatch\u0026rsquos top tips to help you become a smarter shopper and get the most out of lifeBloody Sunday Trust awarded \u0026euro500,000 to consider if model can be applied across NorthSkilled European negotiator who insists on backstop Border provision set to visit IrelandProposed law \u0026lsquoregressive, incompatible with human dignity and morally unacceptable\u0026rsquoRefugee support groups call for Repeal of the Eighth to protect rights of migrant womenCompulsory retirement ages may be discrimination unless \u0026lsquoobjectively justified\u0026rsquoSeveral women were not told of the delay in their cancer diagnosisOfficer treated in hospital for injuries to hand, head and body after Ballyogan assaultNiche market \u0026lsquoseasonal\u0026rsquo as number of deer farms drops from 500 to \u0026lsquoa small number\u0026rsquoCollision occurred around 6pm on SaturdayHSE: examination will be completed on Monday and women will be notifiedDuo attacked by group of vigilantes before being found in Mullaghbawn area of countyNational Spring Clean: \u0026lsquoIt\u0026rsquos something we have to face in Irish society, we\u0026rsquore quite a dirty nation\u0026rsquoCity\u0026rsquos Abbey Quarter selected for campus focused on crafts, heritage and agri-foodAtheist Ireland compares regulator stance on repeal mural at Project to Iona campaignsExclusive Nord Anglia International School Dublin sets September date opening targetHardeep Singh running unaccredited Isles International University with Dublin address"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3478324.1525027479!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"most costly school in state at 24 000 a year to enrol 180 pupils","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tChildren attending the Nord Anglia International School in a drum workshop. About €14m has been invested in the school to date. Photograph: Dara MacDónaillThe  Ireland most expensive school is expecting up to 180 pupils when its doors open next September.The Nord Anglia International School Dublin, which will charge day pupils up to €24,000 a year, declined to say how many pupils it has signed up already. Speaking at an open day on Sunday, founding principal Paul Crute said student enrolment was positive and he expected to enrol about 20 pupils in each year, which would deliver a pupil-teacher ratio of about nine to one. About €14 million has been invested in the school so far.“This group of students is made up of Irish students moving to our international curriculum, students of international executives, and students of expats some living and some relocating back to Ireland,” he said.According to the school website, pupils are being accepted for nine “year groups” from about three years to 14 years in the autumn. With 20 pupils in each year this would deliver an enrolment of 180, each paying from €5,900 per term to €8,000 per term depending on tuition and extras. Many of the families attending the open day were from Asia, but a spokesman said this was not necessarily representative of interest so far.Previews of what life will be like for those enrolled in the school in south Co Dublin were given to parents and prospective pupils on Sunday.The event featured a music and dancing session with teachers flown in from The Juilliard School for performing arts in New York.Nord Anglia which is to open in Leopardstown in September has a “strategic association” with the Juilliard School which allows pupils to develop their creative and dramatic skills “on the world stage” said Mr Crute. A previous “learning lab” introduction for prospective parents featured a session with Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Pupils in Dublin will be offered the opportunity to get involved in the “adopt a slum” programme in New Delhi, India, said Mr Crute. Mr Crute said the school would not teach the Irish curriculum, but will opt instead for the International Baccalaureate. The Irish language will be offered. Mr Crute said the school would attract the children of diplomats and those of foreign executives. He said many of the latter group work for global firms which will pay the school fees bill. “We have strategic partnerships with many global companies,” he added. When fully open the school will accept pupils aged from three to 18 years. But in September the school will offer places only to those up to about 14 years to allow children to progress through the International Baccalaureate format. Sports will include basketball, volleyball, martial arts, tennis, fencing and dance. “We are not a rugby school,” said Mr Crute before joking that Ireland “doesn’t need another private, rugby school”."},{"url":null,"title":"cork looks set to go to the wire in referendum on eight amendment","story":"  April 28, 2018Both sides in abortion referendum believe they have the edge.

Photograph: Dimitar DilkoffAFPGetty ImagesWhen Michel Barnier visits Derry on Wednesday as part of his tour of Ireland, the city will just have celebrated the launch of a new four-year project funded by the EU’s Peace IV programme.It is an apt reminder that the EU’s chief brexit negotiator has been here before. As commissioner for regional policy from 1999 to 2004, in the immediate aftermath of the signing of the Belfast Agreement, Barnier was responsible for the EU Peace programmes in Northern Ireland, crucial underpinnings of the agreement. He signed off on hundreds of millions of euro of EU support for both the Derry region and the North.Barnier has often spoken emotionally of how important that work was to him and how it informs his engagement with and commitment to Irish issues in the Brexit talks.He and his team also talk of the Belfast Agreement as a European agreement – safeguarding its provisions through the Brexit talks is as much about ensuring that the UK honours its undertakings to the EU as to the citizens of the North.He has been completely unambiguous in his warnings to the UK that agreement on a backstop Border provision is a precondition for the much broader Withdrawal Agreement and its provisions on transition. And soon.A sprightly and fit 67, Barnier, who has been described as austere, has been engaged in politics at national level and then Brussels for 40 years, and shows no sign of tiring. He is proud of his rural upbringing in the mountainous Savoie region and revels in hiking there. He was elected to represent it at 27, then the youngest politician in the National Assembly.He has served as EU commissioner twice – as regional commissioner, and from 2010 to 2014 as internal market commissioner – before being drafted in as a “safe pair of hands” by commission president Jean-Claude Juncker to head the task force on Brexit.He now aspires, it is reported, to succeed Juncker as president next year. If, that is, he can get the support of France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, although the latter is no supporter of the Gaullist tradition in French politics to which Barnier belongs.He might have more chance to get a nomination as the European People’s Party candidate from party colleague Leo Varadkar.His skill in leading the Brexit process has been in marshalling the many constituencies to which he reports , some almost daily, to maintain a remarkable unanimity over his evolving mandate. That need to communicate with so many parties has facilitated a mantra of “transparency” about the talks process – with so many in the loop, they might as well engage regularly and in detail with the press. (Except, it should be noted on the Irish strand).The task force is involved in a constant detailed dialogue with Irish diplomats, and reports on an almost weekly basis to the Brexit group of member states, and it to ambassadors. He reports to the commission and meets the European Parliament’s team under his old friend Guy Verhofstadt almost as regularly.

However, how this is achieved has yet to be worked out.Mr Barnier will use his two-day programme to visit Derry, Newry and Dungannon but he will not meet with either political leaders in the North.The focus of the visit is on meeting business stakeholders and cross-border groups to assess the impact of Brexit, Mr Barnier’s spokesman said.Speaking yesterday, Mr Coveney said the Irish Government and the EU were united on the view that significant progress must be made on the Border by June.He believed an agreement should be reached by the end of October and included in the withdrawal deal.Mr Coveney stressed the Irish Government could not allow the negotiations to be delayed because it was politically difficult or sensitive in Britain.Negotiations move to phase II after agreement reached on protecting the rights of citizens in both UK \u0026amp EU, Northern Ireland and the financial settlement of the orce-the-  each Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3478378.1525030849!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"over 2 000 contact cervicalcheck helpline","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tVicky Phelan from  Co Limerick who last week settled her High Court action for €2.5m against a US laboratory over a 2011 smear test.

Some 614 contacts were made before 1.30pm on Sunday.A spokesman for the HSE said the process of calling each inidual back has begun and may take between 10 to 30 minutes depending on the nature of the call.Minister for Health Simon Harris had sent in a senior team to CervicalCheck over the weekend to assess the files of the 206 women affected by this controversy.They were asked to examine each case and investigate if each of the women involved were informed of the delayed diagnosis.The information has to be verified from 13 sites across the country, a process the HSE has said had proved challenging.The information will be given to Dr Colm Henry, a national director with the HSE, who will inform director general Tony O’Brien of the results. Once the review has been completed, all of those women that have not already been contacted will be informed of the outcome. The HSE spokesman said: “These women will be contacted over the course of Monday and offered an appointment during the week to discuss the findings of the audit as concerns them. “This is likely to be a complex task due to the numbers involved and the availability of those being contacted, some of whom are outside of the jurisdiction either temporarily or permanently.”The Minister for Health had told CervicalCheck to facilitate further smear tests for women whose GPs feel it is necessary. Mr Harris has also committed to covering the cost of these retests.The controversy has continued to develop over the weekend and the head of the CervicalCheck programme, Dr Gráinne Flannelly, stood down on Saturday.Ms Flannelly resignation came after concerns were raised following a court case taken by Limerick woman Vicky Phelan, who was not told about an incorrect 2011 smear test until September 2017, despite a 2014 audit by CervicalCheck showing that the test was wrong.Ms Phelan (43), a mother of two, has since been diagnosed with terminal cancer and the court case heard she may have only months to live.

Photograph: Patrick KovarikAFPGettyPresident Emmanuel Macron likes to convince people. In manner and method, he is unlike his predecessors. Nicolas Sarkozy cajoled and bullied. François Hollande just gave up. Macron fixes interlocutors with his intense blue stare and builds a Cartesian argument. If that doesn’t work, he starts over, patiently, but with determination.The past week has tested the young president’s powers of persuasion. Early in the hours of April 14th, Macron used his constitutional power as commander in chief for the first time, joining the US and Britain in launching cruise missiles against three chemical weapons installations in Syria. The goal, Macron said later, was to convince Bashar al Assad and Vladimir Putin that the international community was more than a “nice” and “weak” body they could push around.In a further exercise in persuasion, Macron volunteered for a combative, 2½ hour live television interview on Sunday night, during which he made the surprising claim that, “Ten days ago, President Trump said the US would pull out of Syria. We convinced him it was necessary to stay for the duration.”The White House later issued a statement saying Trump’s view had not changed, and the French president made an embarrassing climbdown on Monday, claiming he “never said” the US or France would remain militarily engaged in Syria for the long term.Perhaps Macron, whose nickname is “Jupiter”, is threatened by hubris, the sin of pride that afflicted Greek gods.The rest of the week was one long attempt to convince Europeans and the French of the rightness of his positions. Macron – who has become the de facto leader of Europe – received the heads of the three Baltic states who have teamed up with five other northern EU countries, including the Netherlands and Ireland, to thwart his efforts to further integrate the euro zone.Then, before a more sympathetic audience at the EU parliament in Strasbourg, Macron pleaded with proponents of liberal democracy to wake up and oppose the populist authoritarians who deny European values. Macron then travelled to Berlin in yet another effort to enlist German chancellor Angela Merkel’s support for his European reform agenda.On Monday, Macron will go to Washington for a three-day state visit, the first of Trump’s presidential term. Although the two men have clashed on climate change, the Iran nuclear accord, trade protectionism and the rise of Eurosceptical populism, Trump appears to have been charmed by the young president, who says Franco-American co-operation is crucial in the fight against terrorism.As the first anniversary of Macron’s election approaches on May 7th, and a half century after the May 1968 revolution, a different kind of spring is flowering in France. For the first time in decades, the country is reversing its post second World War decline, and the persuasive Macron is turning France into the world’s greatest soft power.There is, of course, discontent. It wouldn’t be France if there wasn’t. This week Macron also confronted striking railway workers in the Vosges, telling them to “stop taking people hostage.” The country is struggling through a rolling strike over the reform of the SNCF railway company.And despite Macron’s best efforts to reassure them, many in France suspect their young president is out to destroy the familiar but dysfunctional “French social model”. In their eyes, Macron is pushing France into the chasm of savage, race-to-the bottom capitalism.So what do they make of him in his home town? The  travelled there to find out.Macron was born in Amiens, the capital of Picardy, 40 years ago and lived here until just before his 17th birthday. From age 11 to 16, he studied at the Jesuit school La Providence.Built in the graceless concrete style of the 1950s, “La Pro” is an elementary, secondary and technical school for 2,000 pupils, spread over several acres. Aside from occasional crucifixes, calendars of Pope Francis and portraits of St Ignatius of Loyola, the religious footprint is light. The teachers are lay people. The priest visits only once a week now.Not a single plaque or photograph records that the president and first lady of France passed through these corridors. Yet this is where Macron asked to be baptised at the age of 12, and where, at 15, he fell in love with his future wife, a French and drama teacher called Brigitte Trogneux Auzière.Macron has always been drawn to older people. His maternal grandmother, Germaine “Manette” Nogues, died in his arms five years ago, at the age of 97. The Protestant humanist philosopher Paul Ricoeur was a spiritual father to him the progressive socialist millionaire Henry Hermand his political mentor. “He’s attracted by knowledge, by people who have experience,” his neurologist father, Jean-Michel (67), says over lunch in Amiens.At La Pro and subsequently at Henri IV, France’s leading lycée and prep school in Paris, Macron often stayed after class to talk to teachers.Marc Defernand (78) taught Macron history and geography here, and was principal of Macron’s section. “He was more mature than other students,” says Defernand. “He always asked a lot of questions. Sometimes he would pick up a conversation we’d started eight days earlier, exactly where we’d left off.”In the autumn of 2016, Defernand queued in a local bookshop to ask Macron to sign his autobiographical manifesto, Révolution. The retired educator is moved, recalling what happened. “He grabbed me by the hand and said, ‘Monsieur Defernand! It’s so good to see you!’” Macron inscribed the book: “To Marc, this ‘Revolution’, which owes more to him than he knows. In friendship, Emmanuel.”We visit the 700-seat theatre where Emmanuel Macron and Brigitte Trogneux Auzière adapted a play by Eduardo De Filippo together.“He was dynamite,” Defernand says. “I told him that if he continued, he would be the Gérard Philippe of the 21st century. It was difficult for others to act in the same play with him. In the same way, it’s difficult for his cabinet ministers now.”Defernand wasn’t aware of the relationship at the time, though he knew Macron went often to Auzière’s house. “I assumed there was a flirt between him and her daughter Laurence,” he says.The scandal of a married teacher with three children having an affair with a student nearly 25 years her junior has been transformed into romantic legend. Everyone would rather forget the trauma.“Jesuits never pried into people’s private lives. There was no morality investigation,” Defernand says. “There were unmarried teachers living together at the time. I was more worried about students taking drugs.”The fact that Brigitte continued to teach at La Pro for years after her lover’s departure, and then transferred to Lycée St Louis de Gonzague when they began to live together later in Paris, is further evidence of tolerance, Defernand says.A tragic love story, known to most French people, occurred a quarter-century earlier and helped pave the way for Macron and Auzière.Schoolteacher Gabrielle Russier (32) had an affair with a lycée student half her age, Christian Rossi, in Marseille. The youth’s parents filed a complaint against the teacher and had their son placed in a mental hospital. Russier was given a suspended prison sentence and took her own life. The story became the subject of books, films and songs. Asked about it at a press conference, former president Georges Pompidou famously quoted a poem by Paul Eluard that was sympathetic to women accused of having slept with German soldiers during the war.The historian Jean-François Sirinelli\u0026nbspcompares the Russier and Macron stories in his book Les Révolutions françaises, to show how much France evolved in a single generation. “Gabrielle Russier takes her own life in 1969. Emmanuel Macron and his teacher start an affair in the 1990s, and in May 2017, Brigitte Macron becomes first lady of France.”Macron’s parents learned of the affair by chance. “My wife was much more upset than I was,” Prof Macron says. “It may sound macho, but I thought he’d get over it. He didn’t . . . I thought it was a little early. It wasn’t the way I envisioned life, but it wasn’t my life. I raised my children to be free and independent.”The Macrons didn’t consider filing charges against Brigitte Auzière, but they asked to meet her. “I was requisitioned to impose authority,” Prof Macron laughs. “I told her, ‘He’s a minor. I want him to complete his studies. After that, he’s free to do what he wants.’”The president’s parents have been hurt by press reports that they sent their son to Paris to get him away from Auzière. “He was going to go to Henri IV anyway. It was planned,” Prof Macron says, nonetheless admitting that perhaps Emmanuel “went a little early”.At La Pro, I ask a class of 14-15 year-olds, Macron’s age when he met Brigitte, if they could fall in love with a teacher. The teenagers laugh and say yes. “If it happened to someone our age, it would shock me,” says a student called Grégoire. “But now that he’s an adult, it doesn’t bother me.”The students say it’s “cool” that Macron is president. “He was elected because there was Marine Le Pen,” pipes in Ayoub, of north African origin. Perhaps parroting their parents’ opinions, the youths object to rising taxes and praise the appointment of cabinet ministers who are not professional politicians. For the future, they predict flying cars and tell me France will never know full employment.On a scale of one to 10, they give the young president an approval rating of seven. “He has to prove himself,” one explains. Like France, Macron’s successors at La Pro are waiting to see.The Amienois may seem blasé about their president, but his father attributes this attitude to the “taciturn, reserved” character of Picard people. The region particularly suffered in both world wars, has a miserable climate and has been decimated by de-industralisation.His son is an atypical Picard, “an extrovert” infused with the sun of the southwest on the side of his mother, Françoise Nogues-Macron.History and bloodlines led me to Macron père, to find out more about the family’s English ancestry. In February, Macron spent an evening with the Presidential Press Association. As the representative for foreign journalists, I was part of the welcoming party. I gave him a sepia postcard of English soldiers in Amiens in 1918. \u0026nbspMacron studied the photograph closely. “You know, they found me an English great grandfather,” he said with a laugh, staring at the postcard. “He was called George Robertson.” The president scrutinised the English faces for a long moment. He was looking for a face that resembled his own.Towards the end of last year’s presidential campaign, Brigitte Macron mentioned to British journalists that her husband had a great grandfather called “Mr Robertson from Bristol”. The London Times, Mirror and Daily Mail researched the story and told the Macrons more than they had ever known about “Mr Robertson”.George William Robertson was born in Bristol in December 1887, and is believed to have fought in the Battle of the Somme. Distant relatives in England have preserved his war medals.Robertson married Macron’s great grandmother, Suzanne Leblond, in the town of Abbeville, 40km from Amiens, in 1919. They had three daughters. The middle daughter, Jacqueline, born in 1922, was Emmanuel Macron’s paternal grandmother.“He disappeared from one day to the next,” Prof Macron told me. “No one in the family ever heard from him. Suzanne raised three daughters alone. She kept a very modest grocery shop in Abbeville. My parents sent me to live with her and my aunts for two years as a child.”The failed marriage to an Englishman “was never, never talked about. The family kept no trace of him. I never saw a picture,” Prof Macron continues. George Robertson married again, settled in east London and kept a grocery shop, like his ex-wife, Suzanne. A step-daughter told the Mirror that he liked to sing Roses of Picardy, which he had learned in the trenches.Had a butcher from Bristol not fought in the Somme, married a Frenchwoman and fathered her children, Emmanuel Macron would not exist, would not be president of France today.Macron’s intellectual precociousness and his relationship with Brigitte meant he “skipped his adolescence”, his father says. In the autumn of 1993, three months short of his 17th birthday, the future president moved to a garret near the Lycée Henri IV in Paris. \u0026nbspHe continued his relationship with Brigitte. “When I went to see him in his chambre de bonne, sometimes he called through the door for me to come back later,” Prof Macron laughs. “I knew she was there with him.”Christian Monjou taught Macron American and British civilisation for three years at Henri IV. Though he did not know about the romance, Monjou noticed that Macron raced off to Amiens the moment classes ended on Saturday. “It was a case of\u0026nbsp ‘the ided self’,” Monjou says in an interview in his book-lined study.Macron obtained his baccalauréat with honours, but twice failed the entrance exam for the École Normale Supérieure, which trains French academics. It was the only failure of his life. Had it not been for the distraction of romance with Brigitte, Monjou says, Macron would have succeeded in the exam and become an academic.Against all odds, Brigitte Macron eventually orced and moved to Paris to live with Emmanuel. They married in 2007. “Without her, I would not be me,” Macron said during the campaign.Macron went on to earn a doctorate in philosophy, then reoriented his life towards politics with degrees from Sciences Po and the École Nationale d’Administration (ENA). “He used failure as a launching pad,” says Monjou. “That is typical of a leader.”“Have you brought your helmet and bulletproof vest?” the taxi driver who takes me to the Whirlpool clothes dryer factory in north Amiens asks. It’s a joke, of course, but the “Whirlpools” are notoriously hostile. A year ago, Marine Le Pen promised their factory would not close if she became president. Macron ignored advice and plunged into the crowd of angry strikers, saying, “If you listen to the security guys, you’re dead.”The factory will move to Poland at the end of May. Most of the 290 workers have been promised retraining or jobs building “intelligent” refrigerators by the factory’s new owner. But they’re still angry. On the day I visit, management proposed a clothes dryer in lieu of a severance bonus.“Macron, Macron. He’s not a god. We’re losing jobs. We don’t give a damn about Macron,” François Gorlia, the in-house union leader, tells me on the phone when he refuses to come to the gate to talk to me.“He’s a right-wing guy. Everything for the rich. Nothing for the poor,” Sibylle (39), an assembly line worker says as she arrives for the 1pm shift. She’ll benefit from Macron’s investment in training for the jobless, but she isn’t convinced. “Training is fine and dandy, but there are no jobs.”After lunch in a simple bistro, Macron’s father Jean-Michel guides me through a maze of streets under construction, to the music conservatory where his son studied piano for nine years. When he failed the conservatory exam after his first year, Macron’s mother told his biographer Anne Fulda, the boy insisted on having the same examiner the second year, an early sign of his determination to convince. He played well, Prof Macron recalls, mastering Bach’s devilishly difficult Goldberg Variations.Prof Macron gives me the address of the modest, two-storey brick bungalow where Emmanuel and his two siblings grew up, and where the neurologist still lives with his second wife. “It’s not Neuilly,” Macron père says laughing, referring to the Beverly Hills-like Paris suburb where Nicolas Sarkozy came from. Though they are both doctors, Macron’s parents earned low, public sector salaries. “They weren’t neurosurgeons with private jets,” comments a presidential adviser.The Trogneux chocolate shop, near the cathedral in central Amiens, is where Brigitte Macron’s family have made chocolates and macaroons for five generations. They also own the local Renault dealership.Black-and-white photographs of successive generations of the Trogneux chocolate dynasty hang inside the shop. There is no photograph or mention of Brigitte Trogneux Auzière Macron. Jean-Alexandre Trogneux (57), the first lady’s nephew and godson, agrees to be photographed, but refuses to talk about the presidential couple. “We’ve made it a golden rule,” he says. “We don’t talk about them and they don’t talk about us.”Fabien Dorémus (32) heads the political book section of a shop in central Amiens. Macron’s Révolution sold more than 400 copies there, an “enormous” number, Dorémus says. He had no desire to read it, and dismisses the book – and Macron – as “all slogans and clichés”. A former journalist whose local online newspaper failed for lack of funding, Dorémus is close to the far left party France Unbowed.\u0026nbspSince Macron’s election, Dorémus says, “I’m not optimistic for workers, pensioners and people who need public services. I am very optimistic for the rich.”The bookseller mentions various left-wing grievances against Macron, arising from a handful of disparaging remarks since 2014: Macron referred to slaughterhouse workers who were losing their jobs as “illiterate” Macron told a heckler wearing an anti-Macron T-shirt, “The best way to buy a suit is to get a job” Macron called protesters against his labour reforms “slackers” and accused strikers of wanting to foutre le bordel, or wreak havoc.It’s hardly “let them eat cake”. But the president has been hanged and burned in effigy by protesters. “You have to put yourself in the place of the people who get told they are slackers and freeloaders,” Dorémus says. “He’s contemptuous of the lower classes. People started hating him because they feel disrespected.”Another criticism, made by Macron’s former teachers, is that his speeches are often so long and intellectual that they can be difficult to follow.And attempts to control the president’s image can be counterproductive. The novelist Emmanuel Carrère was given exclusive access to the president and first lady. In two interviews with Macron, there was “one really strong, beautiful sentence”, Carrère wrote in the . “And this really strong, really beautiful sentence was off the record. In its place I was given permission to use a perfectly dull, perfectly formatted variant.”In the course of a day in President Macron’s home town, there is not a single photograph of him to be seen.Brigitte Fouré, the city’s mayor, tells me the poverty rate is two percentage points higher than the national average, and 80 per cent of inhabitants qualify for social housing. Amiens is ided between disadvantaged north and middle-class south. It was ruled by a communist mayor for 18 years in the 1970s and 1980s.Macron spent less than 17 years in Amiens, Fouré notes. He “went up” to Paris nearly a quarter of a century ago. “People here don’t know him. A lot of people are proud that the president is from Amiens, but that’s it. There has never been a real relationship between him and the city. There is no emotional tie.”On a beautiful spring day, the Élysée Palace feels light years away from dreary Picardy. The top-floor office of a close presidential adviser has a view over the gardens and the Eiffel Tower in the distance.Macron’s entourage is comprised mostly of fervently devoted young men with backgrounds similar to his own. No one at the Élysée, other than the president, can be quoted by name. “Our rule is that no one gets inidual credit for anything,” the adviser explains.The adviser reportedly thought up the slogan used by Macron when Trump pulled out of the Paris accord on climate change, “Make our planet great again!” But he refuses to confirm this. “We work collectively. Everything we do belongs to the president.”The adviser counts a resurgence of French pride as Macron’s greatest achievement so far. “It’s been a long time since the French have been proud to be French, in the eyes of the world,” he says. Though it contradicts my experience in Amiens, the statement rings true. Most people in the professional milieus of Paris adore Macron and are proud of his presidency.A few doors from the president’s office, the adviser lists Macron’s “important victories”: the revision of the labour code and the taxation of capital investments the overhaul of the country’s education system changes to the EU’s posted workers directive ending the giant squat at Notre-Dames-des-Landes and dismantling the nuclear reactor at Fessenheim. The last two issues had festered for decades. “They seemed impossible for any preceding majority,” the adviser says.Macron is doing as much for the disadvantaged as for the rich, the adviser insists. “We have increased basic payments to the poor, the disabled and the elderly. We’re decreasing social charges on lower salaries. The pendulum has swung much more towards the least advantaged than the most privileged.”So why isn’t that message getting through? Why do polls indicate that a majority consider Macron the “president of the rich”?For one reason, the adviser says. “He was an investment banker. What’s more, at Rothschild the most symbolic bank in the world. For many people, that proves his competence. The thing that makes him hated by some is the reason why he is respected by others.”Because Macron worked for four years as an investment banker, “everything he does that is perceived as right-wing or for the rich is blown out of proportion”, the adviser says.“And everything he does for the underprivileged, that would be seen as left-wing, is discounted. It’s a problem of perception.”Opinion polls can be read two ways. An Ifop-Fiducial poll published on April 10th gave Macron a 55 per cent approval rating, high for France, 11 months into a presidency. But a BFM poll published four days later showed that 44 per cent of voters are “disappointed”.Nine years of piano and the rigour of France’s best schools have honed Macron’s powers of concentration. On April 17th, he took questions from MEPs in Strasbourg for three hours, without notes, without so much as jotting down a question – a regular performance for Macron.“He is someone with a great capacity of attention and concentration,” says Monjou. “People who’ve met him often tell me they were struck by the intensity with which he looks at them, as if, for the time they are with him, they are all that matters.”“When you talk to him, it is as if he is downloading your brain,” says a former cabinet minister who sometimes advises Macron.Geraldine Byrne-Nason, now Ireland’s Ambassador to the United Nations, is doubtless the Irish official who knows Macron best. She became friends with the future president when both were “sherpas”, responsible for briefing and accompanying Irish and French leaders to EU summits, between 2012 until 2014. Byrne-Nason represented the taoiseach’s office, Macron the Élysée Palace.“We spent hours and hours in corridors through the night while the heads of state and government were locked in meetings,” Byrne-Nason recalls. “Emmanuel would be one of my first points of repair. If you’re going to be there for seven hours, you want someone interesting to talk to.”Byrne-Nason calls Macron “an insider-outsider” who has mastered the system but is able to regard it with detachment. “He has a healthy disrespect for bureaucracy, and Brussels is the home of process and procedure,” she says. “In that regard, we were kindred spirits. There was a slight impatience with the weight of slow-turning wheels.”Macron was particularly understanding of Irish difficulties during the bailout, Byrne-Nason says. She believes he was responsible for support offered by then president François Hollande.Byrne-Nason sent glowing reports about Macron’s potential to Dublin, long before he became a presidential candidate. Last September, she listened to what she calls his “extraordinary speech in favour of international co-operation and law” at the UN General Assembly. “It was poetic. It was powerful. It lit up the place.” Ireland could have signed off on every word, Byrne-Nason says, calling Macron “a superstar president who generates both respect and influence here amongst the 193 countries of the UN”.If Macron were Irish, he might be a hybrid of President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar: part poetic intellectual, rooted in left-wing Christianity and fascinated by ideas part dynamic young liberal, determined to make the economy flourish.When Christian Monjou was Macron’s teacher at Henri IV, he says Macron talked a lot about the Fabians, the centre-left British intellectuals who founded the London School of Economics. The Fabians believed in “the inevitability of gradualness, the idea that everything that is gradual you won’t be able to go back on,” Monjou says. “It is totally anti-French, with our tradition of revolution, not evolution.“French political life is saturated in ideology,” Monjou continues. “With Macron, there is something you might call empirical or pragmatic. It’s familiar to an Anglo-Saxon, but it stands out in France. I suspect this slightly Anglo-Saxon approach may come from listening to me for three years.”Macron’s adviser stresses he is more than a mere pragmatist who would be content to solve one problem after another. “The two legs of Emmanuel Macron are action and reflection,” he says. “He always does both.”Macron’s en même temps mantra seeks to reconcile irreconcilabables, such as liberalism and social protection. The challenge is most obvious in his self-described “humane but realistic” immigration policy. Measures such as the Collomb circular, which authorises police to search emergency shelters for illegal migrants, have alienated some of Macron’s closest allies.In 1997, Macron’s spiritual father Paul Ricoeur delivered a lecture titled Foreigner Myself. Ricoeur cited Leviticus, about “the stranger that dwelleth with you”, and the Gospel of Matthew, which says: “I was a stranger and you took me in.” Opponents of Macron’s tough immigration policy say he has betrayed Ricoeur’s ideals. The criticism must sting, but Macron believes that unless he calms fears of unlimited migration, extreme right-wing populists will continue to gain ground, in France and across Europe.The necessity of ending the “society of status” in which family background, education and profession determine all aspects of one’s life, “gives coherence to everything we are doing”, says the presidential adviser.Philippe Aghion, who teaches economics at Harvard, the London School of Economics and the Collège de France, has greatly influenced the president’s economic thinking.Contrary to Thomas Piketty, the French author of the best-selling Capital in the 21st Century, Aghion and Macron believe that increasing social mobility, not high taxation, is the most effective way of reducing income inequality.Aghion wants to wean France off its post-second World War reliance on the Keynesian welfare state, in which government spending stimulates demand. He is inspired by John Maynard Keynes’s exact contemporary, the Austrian-born economist and Harvard professor Joseph Schumpeter, who believed that innovation and technical progress are the basis of a prosperous economy.Aghion’s theories underlie Macron’s reform of the French labour code last year, and the ongoing reform of professional training. It is, Aghion admitted in an interview, a liberal economic policy. But, he insists, it is also a social policy.Schumpeter believed in creative destruction, “which means you constantly have new jobs replacing old jobs, new firms replacing old firms”, Aghion says. It’s a hard sell to a French public that craves security and is adverse to change.Aghion advocates Danish-style “flexicurity” that combines labour market flexibility with unemployment benefits and retraining for laid-off workers. “In a nutshell: innovation, social protection and social mobility. That’s the triangle you want to achieve,” he says. Listening to him is like hearing Macron speak.Macron’s parents were left-leaning agnostics who did not baptise their children. At the age of 12, probably under the influence of his surroundings at La Pro, Macron asked to make his First Communion. A black-and-white photograph provided by one of his teachers, Gérard Banc, shows the future president making his profession of faith.Macron’s intellectual affiliation has been with the Christian left, with Ricoeur and Esprit magazine, for which he wrote a half-dozen articles, and whose board he sat on. French media interpreted gestures at Macron’s campaign rallies as signs of mysticism, for example when he asked his followers to “show benevolence”, or ended rallies Christ-like, with outstretched arms. On the night of his election, he concluded his speech in front of IM Pei’s glass pyramid at the Louvre with the words, “I will serve you with love”.During his evening with the Presidential Press Association, I asked Macron if, 28 years after his baptism, he still has faith. Personal belief is a taboo subject in secular France. Embarrassed laughter rippled across the room, but he addressed my question.“I believe in something we don’t see, yes,” Macron said. “I have faith in the generic sense of the term. If one doesn’t believe in one’s lucky star, in good fortune, in one’s country, one doesn’t do what I’m doing. I believe in a form of transcendency.”Following Macron’s April 9th speech to French bishops, leftists and Freemasons accused him of attacking la laicité, which has been France’s official policy of state-enforced secularism since 1905.“We share the confused feeling that the link between church and state has been damaged, and that it is as important to you as it is to me to repair it,” Macron said.\u0026nbsp The purpose of laicité was “certainly not to deny spirituality” he argued. \u0026nbsp“For biographical, personal and intellectual reasons, I have the highest opinion of Catholics.”There is something Jesuitical, indeed monklike, about Macron. Unlike his predecessors, he shows no need to eat, sleep or chase women. Asked what has been the “greatest trial” of being in office, the French president said he has “measured the weight and the solitude and the end of innocence” that come with power.“I do not think it is a trial,” Macron continued. “The French have authorised me to do what I committed to do. One thing is certain. There is no respite, which may explain why I sometimes look pale. I do not feel authorised to enjoy any form of leisure. I take time to reflect. I read and write. But in the times we live in, there is no room for respite. That may be the trial of power, though I don’t live it as such. There is undeniably a form of asceticism.”Macron sees his rise to power as the result of a troubled epoch. “I don’t forget where I come from and why I am here today,” he said. “I am the fruit of a form of brutality in history, of a break-in, because France was unhappy and uneasy. If I forget that for one moment, it will be the beginning of the trial.”"},{"url":null,"title":"telegraph launches next phase words chosen brand campaign","story":"The  has launched the second phase of the Words Chosen Well brand campaign which aims to showcase its award-winning quality journalism and raise brand awareness.The campaign started with a new television advert debuted during the commercial break of Channel 4’s Gogglebox on Friday 20th April. Created by adam\u0026ampeveDDB  in collaboration with The ’s in-house marketing and creative teams, it builds on the success of last year’s campaign with a bigger and bolder creative that utilises important cultural references and leans on some of the most emotive and impactful events of our times, highlighting iconic moments when words have been considered and chosen well.The ’s new campaign seeks to demonstrate the influence and importance of the spoken and written word, and the role that quality journalism plays in providing news, insight and analysis.

In practice, this means the infection is resistant to all commonly used antibiotics.The figures have emerged as Lord O\u0027Neill, the former Goldman Sachs banker who led a government-commissioned review into superbugs, accuses senior ministers of a lack of leadership on the issue. Lord O’Neill, former commercial secretary to the Treasury, said the Prime Minister, Theresa May, had allowed the issue to fade and that actions promised had not been taken.Lord O\u0026#39Neill has urged senior ministers to do more to tackle the threat of superbugs“It is disappointing to see that the UK government’s global and national efforts to fight AMR seem to have faded, he saidWriting exclusively for the  Lord O’Neill said that the UK was once seen as a leader in the field but that May had allowed the issue to slide.“The government should put this part of \u0027global Britain\u0027 back at the top of its priorities,” he writes. “There has been a lot of talk, but no action.Lord O’Neill’s review warned that if left unchecked antibiotic resistance would kill 10 million people and the world economy could lose up to $100 trillion by 2050.Antibiotic resistance | The true cost in Britain and around the worldOfficial figures suggest antimicrobial resistance claims the lives of 5,000 people a year in the UK, though experts have argued the real figure is at least double that. Getting global figures on the problem is difficult but reliable estimates suggest 700,000 are already dying each year – one person a minute.Lord O’Neill also attacked the major pharmaceutical companies for doing little to counter the problem, despite signing up to the Davos Declaration in 2015, where they pledged to combat the threat.He wrote: “Since then, no major pharmaceutical company has taken any fresh action.”Lord O’Neill said that since investigating the issue the number of reports of antibiotic resistance was rising faster and “in more places than we ever dreamt of.”.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}There has been a lot of talk, but no action.Lord O\u0026#x27NeillIn addition to the ‘super gonorrhoea’ case the PHE figures, obtained under a Freedom of Information request, show 29 people suffered from pan-drug-resistant-infections from Pseudomonas bacteria.Pseudomonas is a bug often found in soil or water (hospital sinks are tested for it) that usually affects people with a weaker immune system such as cancer patients, newborn babies, people with diabetes or patients with severe burns.Up to 11 per cent of Pseudomonas bacteria are now resistant to ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic commonly used in combination with others.A further six patients suffered pan-drug-resistant Klebsiella infections. New antibiotics to treat multi-drug-resistant Klebsiella infections were introduced last year in light of rising resistance, said Professor Peter Hawkey, a public health and bacteriology expert at the University of Birmingham. But they don’t work against every strain, he said.Antibiotic resistance | Global consumption fuels spread of superbugsProf Hawkey added that the cases show antimicrobial resistance is not a hypothetical or future threat but a real one currently affecting patients in British hospitals.These are organisms which are resistant to most antibiotics and then you’re in a tricky place, he said. The threat is very real. These figures are a wake up call,” he said.The pan-resistant infections recorded by PHE were from gram negative bacteria: rod-shaped bugs with thinner cell walls than their gram positive counterparts.Gram negative bacteria, some of which live in the human gut, are fast becoming resistant to antibiotics and are known as an emerging global threat. The government aims to halve the number of healthcare-associated gram-negative bloodstream infections by 2021.Prof Hawkey said pan-drug-resistant-infections are much more common in other areas of the world with lax surveillance and poor infection control, and these will spread to Britain.He said: With huge movement in populations people are coming back to the UK with these bugs in their guts. If you get it and you’re given the wrong antibiotic, you will die.Dr Susan Hopkins, deputy director for AMR and healthcare acquired infections at Public Health England, said: “While there is only a small number of bacteria identified that were resistant to a number of treatments in recent years, they serve as an example of the threat antibiotic resistance poses to public health.Madlen Davies is a reporter with the Bureau of Investigative JournalismProtect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Imran Khan unveils populist plan as he launches Pakistan election campaignAmber Rudd resigns as Home Secretary in the wake of the Windrush scandal - latest newsAmber Rudd: How the Home Secretary\u0026#39s rising star was brought back to earthGiving vulnerable children a boarding school place can dramatically improve their future, Government study findsRestaurant ceiling falls in on customers leaving six people injuredFlat Earth conspiracy theorists gather to discuss \u0026#39proof\u0026#39 at first UK conventionUniversities are lowering grade requirements for disadvantaged youngsters amid ersity driveSwedish crown princess Victoria \u0026#39groped\u0026#39 by French photographer at Nobel academyCapri could follow example of Venice as lagoon city installs barriers to manage mass tourismEmmanuel Macron turns to Iran to propose widening nuclear deal as Trump waversComment: After decades of strife, the French are finally falling out of love with strikesMillions of trees mapped by drone in Network Rail felling programmeLondon Marathon impostor revealed as homeless builder nicknamed \u0026#39Jogging Tramp\u0026#39Tiger mosquitoes capable of carrying Zika spread across half of France Power cut warning for Britain as south east and London brace for torrential rain, floods and galesFrench tycoon Vincent Bolloré blames Africa corruption charges on prejudiceOn this day in 1429: Joan of Arc wins her first military victory as she outwits the English besiegers of OrléansNicola Sturgeon accused of scaremongering over Brexit powers dealMike Tindall finally gets his nose straightened out after breaking it at least eight times during careerHalf of TSB online banking customers still locked out of accountsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":null,"title":"nature highlights national geographic travel photographer year","story":"A leaping leopard and a crowd of crocodiles are among the stunning photos released from the Nature section of the 2018 National Geographic Travel Photographer of the Year contest.

There will be no more recruitment for especially domestic helpers. No more, Mr Duterte told reporters in the southern city of Davao.There was no immediate response from Kuwait, where around 262,000 Filipinos are employed - nearly 60 percent of them as domestic workers, according to the Philippines\u0027 foreign department.Last week the Philippines apologised over the rescue videos but Kuwaiti officials announced they were expelling Manila\u0027s ambassador and recalling their own envoy from the Southeast Asian nation.In quotes | Rodrigo Duterte, President of the PhilippinesKuwait also detained four Filipinos hired by the Philippine embassy and issued arrest warrants against three diplomatic personnel, Manila said.Mr Duterte on Sunday described the treatment of workers in Kuwait as a calamity. He said he would bring home Filipina maids who suffered abuse as he appealed to workers who wanted to stay in the oil-rich state.I would like to address to their patriotism: come home. No matter how poor we are, we will survive. The economy is doing good and we are short of our workers, he said.About 10 million Filipinos work abroad, seeking high-paying jobs they are unable to find at home, and their remittances are a major pillar of the Philippine economy.The Philippine government has for decades hailed overseas workers as modern heroes but advocacy groups have highlighted the social cost of migration, tearing families apart and making Filipinos vulnerable to abuse.Mr Duterte lashed out at Kuwait in February, alleging Arab employers routinely rape Filipina workers, force them to work 21 hours a day and feed them scraps.However after the latest row, Mr Duterte used a conciliatory tone as he addressed the diplomatic ruckus on Saturday.Apparently it seems as if they have anger against Filipinos ... I do not want to send (workers) because apparently you do not like Filipinos, he said in a speech before Filipinos in Singapore.Just do not hurt them. I plead that they\u0027d be given a treatment deserving of a human being, he said in the same event.Please review our commenting policyAmber Rudd resigns as Home Secretary in the wake of the Windrush scandal - latest newsAmber Rudd: How the Home Secretary\u0026#39s rising star was brought back to earthGiving vulnerable children a boarding school place can dramatically improve their future, Government study findsRestaurant ceiling falls in on customers leaving six people injuredFlat Earth conspiracy theorists gather to discuss \u0026#39proof\u0026#39 at first UK conventionUniversities are lowering grade requirements for disadvantaged youngsters amid ersity driveSwedish crown princess Victoria \u0026#39groped\u0026#39 by French photographer at Nobel academyCapri could follow example of Venice as lagoon city installs barriers to manage mass tourismEmmanuel Macron turns to Iran to propose widening nuclear deal as Trump waversComment: After decades of strife, the French are finally falling out of love with strikesMillions of trees mapped by drone in Network Rail felling programmeLondon Marathon impostor revealed as homeless builder nicknamed \u0026#39Jogging Tramp\u0026#39Tiger mosquitoes capable of carrying Zika spread across half of France Power cut warning for Britain as south east and London brace for torrential rain, floods and galesFrench tycoon Vincent Bolloré blames Africa corruption charges on prejudiceOn this day in 1429: Joan of Arc wins her first military victory as she outwits the English besiegers of OrléansNicola Sturgeon accused of scaremongering over Brexit powers dealMike Tindall finally gets his nose straightened out after breaking it at least eight times during careerHalf of TSB online banking customers still locked out of accountsWhat will Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u0026#39s titles be after their wedding?We urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/04/29/TELEMMGLPICT000161769325_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqvxY1SBh3Zy94n8Z2-u3DXpo3vSb9RvelYMC6seL5330.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"flat earth conspiracy theorists gather discuss proof first uk","story":"Organiser Gary John at the Convention The Ancient Greeks first argued the earth was round more than 2,000 years ago while Ferdinand Magellan proved it with the first successful circumnavigation in the 16th century. Yet 500 years on, a growing number of conspiracy theorists are convinced that every single mainstream scientist since then has got it wrong.

He is flanked by fellow ex-internationals Neil Back (left) and Will Greenwood (right)He said he might have to get the procedure done, and added: I guess it\u0027s something similar to a pug.The problem is that if I get it done, will people say I\u0027ve had it just because I\u0027m doing TV stuff now? Because it\u0027s definitely not.Tindall first broke his nose aged five when he collided in a dodgem car and headbutted the steering wheel.Earlier this year, The Queen has welcomed news that she is to become a great-grandmother again, as Zara and Mike Tindall confirmed they were expecting a baby.Mr and Mrs Tindall, who are already parents to three-year-old Mia, have announced they are expecting another child a year after enduring a miscarriage.The Queen, a spokesman said, said she was “very pleased” to hear the news, of that will be her seventh great-grandchild.She already has two great-grandsons, Prince George and Prince Louis, and four great-granddaughter: Princess Charlotte, Savannah and Isla Phillips and Mia Tindall.The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are expecting their third child in April, with the Tindall’s baby believed to be due in the summer.Confirmation of Mrs Tindall’s pregnancy was celebrated yesterday, just over a year after a spokesman announced the miscarriage of a child due in 2017.Their newest addition is likely to be born in the same Cotswolds NHS hospital as their first daughter Mia.Unlike the newest Royal baby, the new arrival will not be given a title with the parents keen for their children to have a normal upbringing.The children will be born into a family of true sporting pedigree with an Olympian as a mother and an international captain as a father. Zara Phillips won gold in the World Championships in the inidual eventing at the 2006 tournament in Aachen and gained a silver medal in the team eventing at London 2012. Her husband played 75 timed for England and notched up more than 350 games for Bath and Gloucester in a decorated career. Amber Rudd resigns as Home Secretary in the wake of the Windrush scandal -

We can expect an update on cost saving measures and the expansion of Argos into its stores.“The crowded marketplace with the rise of Lidl and Aldi makes for a very difficult environment for the group, which has been reflected in the share price performance for many years.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Possibly complicating matters was the fact that Denzel Washington was sitting next to him at the table.“When someone says you’re like your idol,” Jordan said, “It’s like: ‘Really? You see that in me?’ I’d only done that one movie. But then I started using it as motivation,” he said. “I wanted to pop up on Denzel’s radar. He’s the OG. If I could get recognition from him, I know I’m going down the right path, you know?”Denzel: We’re only getting further apart in this technological ageFinally, Washington broke in with a booming laugh: “And here we are, Mike! Looks like it’s working out already,” he said.In truth, it would be hard for an actor to choose a better role model than Washington. In a career ning more than 40 years and 50 films – and kicked off by the hit TV drama St Elsewhere – Washington, 63, has been nominated for nine Academy Awards. He won twice: for best actor as a terrifying rogue cop in Training Day and for best supporting actor as a Union soldier in an African-American army unit in Glory. And he was nominated for best actor Oscars in both of the past two years.Jordan (left, with Kevin Durand) in the 2013’s ‘Fruitvale Station’ (Weinstein Company)In the past decade, Washington has ruled the stage, too. He won a Tony Award for best actor in the revival of August Wilson’s Fences in 2010, later directing and starring in an Oscar-nominated film version. He led the acclaimed revival of A Raisin in the Sun in 2014. And today (26 April), he will open again on Broadway in a revival of Eugene O’Neill’s play The Iceman Cometh, a searing and (at four hours long) monumental drama about the lies we tell ourselves to get through life.Like Washington, Jordan, 31, got his big break on television: on HBO’s The Wire, when he was just 15. After his heartbreaking performance in Fruitvale Station, about the last day in the life of a transit-police shooting victim, he starred in the popular Rocky reboot Creed. And this year, he played the villain, Erik Killmonger, in the Marvel juggernaut Black Panther, winning perhaps the best reviews of anyone in the extremely well-reviewed cast.Next month, he stars in Fahrenheit 451 on HBO, a dystopian film based on the novel by Ray Bradbury. Jordan plays a “fireman,” part of a state-sanctioned brigade that hunts down readers and burns books. His company, Outlier Society Productions, is one of the film’s producers and also among the first to adopt inclusion riders, requiring ersity among cast and crew, as called for by Frances McDormand from the stage of this year’s Academy Awards.Over a cocktail hour at the Lambs Club in Manhattan (a Diet Coke for Washington, a sauvignon blanc for Jordan), the actors traded notes about creating characters and the socially minded work that really matters to them. These are excerpts from the conversation.Galanes: If Mike reminds people of a young Denzel, who did young Denzel remind people of?Washington: I never saw it that way. I never even thought about movie stars. My goal was to be on Broadway, to earn $650 a week. My hero was James Earl Jones. And I came to acting green. I was taking pre-law courses, then journalism courses. Then I took an acting class and got bit by the bug. So I came down to Lincoln Centre and saw plays and stage actors.Galanes: But all those things you did – law, journalism, acting – they’re all about getting to the bottom of a story, right?Washington: I like that part: building a character. You start with the material that gives you clues. If you’re playing a boxer, you want to throw out punches. If you’re playing a conductor, you want to get on a train.Galanes: And the script?Washington: Sure, but you don’t know who the character is just by reading the script. I don’t read a script and go, “Now, I get it!” That’s just the beginning. The first thread you pull.Jordan: The script tells you what’s going up on screen. But the biggest part, the fun part, is figuring out what happened to that character before page one of the script. What kind of food does he like? Did he get into fights going to school? That back story determines the choices you make within the confines of the script. And going through that process with the director is a big part of the collaboration. Now I’ve got notebooks and notebooks of back stories. Some directors may want you to add something or change your version. That’s when you try to find common ground.Washington won an Oscar for his role as rogue cop Alonzo in 2001’s ‘Training Day’ (Warner Bros)Galanes: Is that why you’ve both worked with directors repeatedly? Mike with Ryan Coogler Denzel with Spike Lee and Antoine Fuqua. Your common ground?Washington (laughing): Maybe they’re the ones who called. What you’re saying is part of it, but I don’t think it’s just one way.Jordan: Those are the roles I was lucky enough to get. Ryan and I have worked together three times, and I have a really close relationship with him. But I said no to lots of other things with other people in between. They weren’t right. Personally, I think you’re defined by what you say no to.Washington: I say yes to everything!Galanes: Why do I doubt that? Managing a career as big as yours must take a lot of work.Washington: Not now. Maybe early on. Now, I just do what I want to do. And you don’t want to walk down the same road twice. I’m sure after doing Iceman Cometh, I won’t be looking to do another play.Washington: Yeah, not for a while.Galanes: You’re too young to remember this, Mike. But early in his career, Denzel was so beloved for playing good guys – in Glory and Cry Freedom – that we all freaked out when he started playing villains: in Training Day, American Gangster. And he was even better at bad guys! Was that about walking down different roads?Playing Killmonger (right) in ‘Black Panther’ brought rave reviews for Jordan (MarvelDisney)Jordan: So much trickles down from the director. That’s why I try to choose the ones who make the best environments to work in, so we can maybe make something as good as Training Day. You don’t want to go into a project with somebody who won’t be helpful to your process – or vice versa.Galanes: I read this funny thing about you, Mike: you started choosing projects where you wouldn’t die in the end?Jordan: It started with my mom, who’s super emotional. When I shot my death scene in The Wire, she was on set. And the PAs kept coming to me and saying: ‘You may want to check on your mom.’ I go see her, and she’s sitting there bawling. I’m just a kid. I’m going, ‘Come on, Ma. You’re embarrassing me.’ And after Fruitvale Station, I was like, ‘Man, this is really affecting her.’ But there was another thing, too. Look at Denzel’s career. I want people to see me win. I want audiences to see me ending up on top – not dying. I want to be the leading man.Washington: Man, I got underwear older than that.Jordan: That was the real thought process: How do I become a leading man? I know phenomenal actors who can’t open movies overseas. How do you become the guy who can carry a film?Washington: So, you study the game?Galanes Is that why you went down the superhero route?Galanes You probably made up for it with Black Panther. Why no superheroes for you, Denzel?Galanes: Superheroes have changed. When Denzel might have played one, they were dull. The villains were interesting: Jack Nicholson and Heath Ledger. Like you in Black Panther, Mike.Washington: When I was a teenager, Shaft and Super Fly, those were our superheroes. I remember watching Super Fly with my boy Carl, and when we got back to the projects, he carved the character’s name – Priest – on the elevator door. And Richard Roundtree in those long leather coats in Shaft.Galanes: Both of your new projects are dark. Iceman Cometh is brutal. And in Fahrenheit 451, competing ideas are so scary that people decide to burn all the books and kill the readers. Why choose them now?27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 27 films to look out for in the first half of 2018 Galanes: It’s powerful to watch a black man in your role.Jordan: But it wasn’t all there on the page. I needed to make sure that he was willing to collaborate, to change some things to help me, as a black man, feel more comfortable in that role. And my company’s co-producing it alongside HBO was important to me too. This is my first time working with the director and the network, giving my opinion and hoping that it’s taken seriously.Washington (laughing): Getting your big boy voice.Galanes Like coming back to the stage, Denzel?Washington: Yeah. Then we boiled it down to Iceman and King Lear. And he said: ‘Let’s do Lear five years from now.’ I said: “OK, we’ll do that next – God willing.”Washington: Eugene O’Neill. That simple. The chance to interpret his brilliant material. You know, my first role on stage, when I was a student at Fordham, was in The Emperor Jones. I’ve always loved O’Neill. And here I am, 40 years later, coming back to him in Iceman.Galanes: Your character, Hickey, seems like the life of the party at first, but what a tortured soul he turns out to be. What drew you to him?Washington: His desire to see people happy. Even when he knows he can’t make that happen, that desire is still there in him.Galanes: It’s a mountain of a play – four hours long. Is it hard to maintain that intensity every night?‘Fahrenheit 451’ sees Jordan plays a ‘fireman’, part of a state-sanctioned brigade that hunts down readers and burns books (HBO)Washington: Listen, this is what I love: acting on stage. And I don’t have to do anything else. Just be in this play. So, don’t feel sorry for me compared to most workers in America.Galanes: Is theatre on your radar, Mike?Jordan: Down the line. But right now, I want to take care of my family financially and grow my production company. That’s the big thing I want to do: set my family up.Jordan: As a kid, you don’t see your circumstances. I didn’t. It’s not until you look back and think, ‘Man, we were poor!’ My parents really hid that from me. They kept me safe.Washington: It wasn’t that tough. I was having a good time. A lot of my boys went to prison.Jordan: That’s why I want to take care of my family now. Then let me go and work on my craft, do something to fulfil me on the inside. That’s what I think theatre is going to be for me – when I’m older. What do you love about it, Denzel?Washington: The energy from the audience is immediate. And you get to develop a full life. See, in film, you might shoot the end first, then the middle. But on stage, it’s the full score of the character’s life. And you always get another night.Washington: In film, you don’t get another night to shoot a scene. You can try to fix it in other scenes. But film is a director’s medium. Theatre is for actors. We’re directed, but once the curtain goes up, it belongs to us. And every night’s as different as the audience. Some nights, they cheer the whole way through others, they don’t cheer at all.Galanes: Let me shift gears. We’re living through a time right now where men in power who’ve done ugly things –Washington: No. We’re not ‘living through a time right now’. It’s always been this way, from the beginning of time. Pick one: from Caesar to Caligula. Now, it’s just on the news cycle every 15 seconds.Jordan: And opinion is now fact – because anyone with a Twitter handle can say it.Washington: It doesn’t even have to be true it just has to be first.Galanes: Hang on, I’m asking something different: Based on your years as a powerful figure, why do you think some guys turn to ugly behaviour, and others don’t?Washington: Nobody’s perfect, man.

Do you know all the people who’ve been praying for your raggedy butt?’ You don’t get there by yourself.Jordan: That’s crazy! I was just thinking: I’m going to church in the morning – because I know the people there have always prayed for me. Their blessings have protected me from terrible situations. That’s how I think about keeping it simple: remembering where it started – that village, that tribe that kept you safe.Galanes: And it was 38 years between Sidney Poitier’s Oscar for best actor and yours.Galanes: How about opportunities for people of colour?Washington: That’s why I’m here! That’s why I’m still in the race. And I’m passing the baton. What a lot of people don’t know is: when you pass the baton, you keep running behind the other runner, you don’t just stop.

The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship“We are going after the money,” Boris Johnson promised after being questioned on the absence of specific measures to impose sanctions and financial penalties on the UK assets of Russian oligarchs closely aligned to President Putin. But when pressed by MPs on why decisive action was not being taken, the foreign secretary replied: “This is not a country where we in the government can say ‘Oi! We think this so-and-so deserves to have his or her collar felt’. This is not how it works.” While Theresa May may yet impose sanctions against Putin-supporting billionaires in response to the attempted murder of the Russian spy Sergei Skripal, her government’s track record has been marred by procrastination and prevarication.   Privately, the prime minister regards the exploitation of London as a haven for dirty Russian money as a serious problem. She once listened in stunned silence as a senior MI6 officer briefed her on the activities of Russian organised crime and certain oligarchs in the UK. And in 2016 she authorised the National Security Council to review why and how wealthy Russians buy property in London. But she has been nervous about taking action. For the past three years she has dithered on implementing a legally-enforceable register that will force all foreign companies that own UK property to disclose the identity of their owners.Russia claims Skripals poisoned using toxin possessed by UK and USRussia has been spying on the Skripals for at least five years- UKRussia stock market crashes after US imposes sanctions on oligarchsFreezing property assets is the key to inflicting pain on the Russian state and its compliant plutocrats. Since 2004, £190m of UK property has been subject to criminal investigation as suspected proceeds of corruption. The London property market has been skewed by laundered money, as The Independent revealed exclusively in 2014. Prices are being artificially driven up by wealthy, influential, foreign men who want to hide their assets in the UK.Multi-million pound payments are accepted without their origin being questioned. Oligarchs hide ownership behind anonymous shell companies registered in secretive jurisdictions while a London address offers a veneer of legitimacy and prestige that helps launder reputations as well as cash. Transparency International estimates that Russians account for £729m of the £4.4bn acquired in UK property via what it regards as “suspicious wealth”.There is no suggestion that all London property bought by Russian oligarchs is derived from illegal or criminal sources. For some Russian plutocrats buying luxury property in London is a symbol that they have been accepted by the British establishment. This is illustrated by the eleven bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square that Oleg Deripaska, regarded as one of Putin’s favourite oligarchs, snapped up for £17m through an offshore company registered in the British Virgin Islands in 2003 and now worth £45m.Oleg Deripaska’s 11-bedroom Regency house on Belgrave Square is seen as a symbol of acceptance by the British establishment (Alamy)Built in the 1820s, it was formerly the home of Sir Henry “Chips” Channon, society host, Conservative MP and notoriously indiscreet diarist. It was designed for entertaining royalty and diplomats with its grand staircase, Madame Récamier sofas and flamboyant decor. When Harold Nicolson arrived at the house for dinner, he exclaimed: “Oh my God, how rich and powerful Lord Channon has become.” The equally grand and historic mansion Beechwood House, set in 11 acres of land in Highgate, north London, was bought by the powerful oligarch Alisher Usmanov in 2008 for £48m from the Emir of Qatar. Usmanov is a major shareholder in Arsenal football club and has amassed a £14bn fortune from metals and commodities and has long been regarded as a pro-Putin figure. And his fellow football-loving oligarch Roman Abramovich owns houses on Kensington Palace Gardens and Chester Square, Belgravia, and apartments on Eaton Square and Manresa Road, Chelsea.  One Hyde Park, one of the wealthiest residencies in the world, was famously bought up by Russian oligarchs (Alamy)It is not just prestigious houses that attract Russian billionaires. The UK is also a top destination for wealthy Russians to spend their money on art collections, expensive cars and private schools for their children. In return for their cash, the UK often grants them visas and, in some cases, citizenship.  Since 2008 iniduals have been able to obtain “golden visas” if they invest as little as £2m in a UK business. And for £5m, they gain the right to become a UK resident on a temporary basis and then, after five years, a British citizen. By 2014, almost 700 rich Russians had paid for entry using this method, with Roman Rotenberg, son of Putin’s former judo partner Boris Rotenberg, being the most prominent example. He owns a mews house on Cadogan Lane in Belgravia.The government is taking some action to stop London becoming what David Cameron described as a haven to hide “dodgy foreign cash”. The National Crime Agency (NCA) is investigating a list of wealthy iniduals, not just oligarchs, to assess if they have used the UK to launder their fortunes.An estimated 149 iniduals are restricted on their travel and ability to conduct business in the UK. And the Unexplained Wealth Orders is now law, whereby the NCA can demand that the oligarch explain the origin of his wealth. But the problem with this order, according to a Russian businessman, is that the inidual in question could too easily lie about his source of wealth and instead produce a document that shows his fortune was based on, for example, share idends. Roman Rotenberg gained entry to the UK using the ‘golden visas’ method (Getty)Boris Johnson protests that the government cannot act directly against the pro-Putin brigade because it cannot interfere in criminal investigations. But it could make specific changes to the law, notably an amendment to the Sanctions and Money Laundering Bill, which would give Magnitsky-type powers to freeze the UK assets of relevant iniduals, including intelligence agents or other officials who have abused human rights.  The government could also implement the register of inidual owners of foreign and offshore companies that own UK property. But that bill has been delayed until 2021 and campaigners smell a cover-up after the government announced that one reason for the delay is that the Business Department has commissioned research on the impact of the register on investment decisions. “This is a crucial moment for the UK’s future trading relationship with the rest of the world, and we must proceed with as good an understanding as possible of the potential impacts on legitimate inward investment,” said foreign office minister Lord Ahmad. Skripal attack aftermath – in picturesSkripal attack aftermath – in picturesInvestigators in protective clothing remove a van from an address in Winterslow near Salisbury in Wiltshire, as police and members of the armed forces continue to investigate the suspected nerve agent attack on Russian double agent Sergei SkripaA police officer on duty near the protective tent which covers the bench where a man and woman were apparently poisoned with what was later identified as a nerve agent, in SalisburyMilitary in protective clothing prior to removing vehicles from a car park in SalisburyPersonnel in protective coveralls and breathing equipment cover an ambulance with a tarpaulin at the Salisbury District HospitalHome Secretary Amber Rudd visits the scene of the nerve agent attack in SalibsuryMembers of the emergency services in hazard suits fix the tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were foundOfficials in protective suits check their equipment before repositioning a forensics tent A poice officer stands guard outside a branch of the Italian chain restaurant ZizziDetective Sergeant Nick Bailey, who assisted the Russian ex-spy targeted with a nerve agent, was also hospitalisedSergei Skripal days before he was exposed to a mystery substance that has left him fighting for lifeSergei Skripal speaks to his lawyer from behind bars seen on a screen of a monitor outside a courtroom in Moscow.Yulia Skripal, who is thought to have been poisoned along with her father, Sergei SkripalProgress to legislation has thus been painfully slow. An insight into why political rhetoric has not resulted in legislative action can be gleaned by the recent flotation on the London stock exchange of the Russian energy company En+, then owned by Deripaska and chaired by former Conservative energy minister Lord Barker. For it revealed a fundamental dispute between MI6 and the financial regulators on how to make oligarchs who park their assets in London more accountable and transparent.MI6 and the prime minister’s national security advisor, Sir Mark Sedwill, were furious with the Stock Exchange and Financial Conduct Authority for failing to consult them and conduct the required due diligence of En+. Their main concern was about whether Rusal, a subsidiary of En+, had been manufacturing aluminium powder used by Russian arms firms for military purposes. Rusal adamantly denied it – yet its own website previously indicated that the defence industry was among the users of the type of aluminium powder it manufactured.Sir Mark Sedwill was furious when the required due diligence of En+ was not carried out ahead of its flotation on the London stock exchange (Getty)The En+ group could be a candidate for new sanctions as the Russian state-owned VTB Bank is a major shareholder with a 4.35 per cent holding, while Deripaska is known for being close to the Russian President. Leaked US diplomatic cables described Deripaska as “among the two to three oligarchs Putin turns to on a regular basis” and is “a more-or-less permanent fixture on Putin’s trips abroad”.Indeed, when the US imposed sanctions on seven oligarchs and the 12 companies they own or control last week, shares tumbled. Deripaska was among those affected, as was Rotenberg.  Still, Britiain cannot follow suit. And the anger of National Security officials and MI6 En+\u0027s flotation last year stemmed precisely from their belief that it typified the complacent approach to Russian money in London, which the infamous oligarch Boris Berezovsky once told me was “70 per cent dirty”. The inability to impose sanctions is similarly emblematic.The London Stock Exchange has long been a vehicle for Russian companies and oligarchs to raise money in shares and bonds – an estimated $200bn (£140bn) since 2004. Last summer, Russia’s largest gold producer Polyus, controlled by Suleyman Kerimov, a Russian senator awarded the Order of Merit by Putin, raised $879m. There are now 57 predominantly-Russian companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, more than anywhere else outside Moscow.   The wealthiest Russian oligarchs who call London homeA little-noticed loophole to avoid sanctions is that Russian sovereign debt is permitted to be sold in London. “We are allowing Russian sovereign debt to be sold in the UK and that debt is being used to reimburse Russians to bring back their money onshore in Moscow terms,” said the Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. “As that gold is moving towards Moscow, we are quite extraordinarily enabling those bond and debt auctions...This is one of those areas where sanctions on businesses are being compensated by the Russian state.”Just hours after Theresa May’s retaliation against the poisoning of Sergei Skripal, Gazprom issued a $750m eurobond in London and the following day the Russian government joined in by issuing a $4bn bond in the capital. Within hours, the Russian Embassy issued a revealing tweet: “Business as usual?”Could the nerve-agent attack in Salisbury be the unwitting catalyst for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London? (Getty)But the irony is that it is the attempted assassination of a Russian spy and double agent living in Salisbury and the murder of Russian businessman Nikolai Glushkov in Surrey that could be the unwitting catalysts for finally cleaning up dirty Russian money in London.Mark Hollingsworth is the author of “Londongrad – From Russia with Cash’’ or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

We can expect an update on cost saving measures and the expansion of Argos into its stores.“The crowded marketplace with the rise of Lidl and Aldi makes for a very difficult environment for the group, which has been reflected in the share price performance for many years.”or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Potentially, millions of customers could be affected by uncertainty and disruption.“It simply isn’t good enough to expose customers to IT failures, including delays in paying bills and an inability to access their own money.”A spokesperson for the Financial Conduct Authority said on Tuesday that the watchdog was “aware of the issue and liaising with the firm”. A spokesperson for the Information Commissioner’s Office said: “We are aware of a potential data breach in relation to the TSB and are making enquiries.”Mr Pester said on Tuesday that he was “truly sorry” about the problems caused. “We’re still seeing issues with access to our digital services,” he added. “One of the steps we need to take to resolve this is to take our mobile app and online banking down for a few hours.“We did this at around 10.30 this morning and we hope to be back up later this afternoon.”The problems stemmed from a switch to a new online banking system. TSB had rented the technology behind its app and online banking from Lloyds Banking Group since the two companies split.

She said the target was “ambitious but deliverable”.Windrush generation: threat of deportation from UKWindrush generation: threat of deportation from UKThe ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 arriving at Tilbury Docks from Jamaica, with 482 Jamaicans on board, emigrating to Britain.Jamaican immigrants being welcomed by RAF officials from the Colonial Office after the ex-troopship \u0027Empire Windrush\u0027 landed them at Tilbury.

But the decision set off a nightmare that saw him lose his job, detained twice and almost deported to Jamaica. Jamaica-born Anthony Bryan poses outside his home in Edmonton, north London. Now 60 and a grandfather, Bryan thought the issue could be resolved swiftly, as he legally moved to Britain with his family as part of the Windrush generation of Caribbean migrants after World War II. In 1948, the ship Windrush brought the first group of migrants from the West Indies to help rebuild post-war Britain, and many others followed from around the Commonwealth. A 1971 law gave them indefinite leave to remain, but many never formalised their status, often because they were children who came over on their parents\u0027 passports and then never applied for their own.

She is very honest and principled person.” Ms Rudd, alongside chancellor Philip Hammond, had been one of the most prominent members of the Cabinet backing a softer Brexit that entails close relations with the EU after Britain’s withdrawal.But with her now vacating a great office of state, Ms May must decide whether to replace her with another ‘remain-minded’ inidual.Environment secretary Michael Gove, a leading Brexiteer, and communities secretary Sajid Javid, a close ally of George Osborne, have both been talked of as potential replacements.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

It has also helped draw attention to a number of other virtual currencies looming in its shadow, most notably ethereum.Ethereum was created in 2013 by a 19-year-old Russian programmer and launched in 2015. For the first two years its price remained below $10. Then, in 2017, it exploded. In the space of 12 months, one unit of the cyptocurrency – called an ether – surged in value to be worth around $1,400 at its peak in January 2018.While its price has since fallen back down to around $700, many still see it as the most promising of all cryptocurrency platforms, and therefore the one that holds the most potential for future price gains. Some even believe it could one day surpass bitcoin.“Ethereum has the possibility to overtake the market capitalisation, and thus value, of bitcoin,”  Hubert Olszewski, director of business development at Blockchain Board of Derivatives, tells The Independent. “This is because from the get-go it was a more versatile tool.” A smartphone displaying the current price chart for ethereum on April 25, 2018 in London, England. Cryptocurrency markets began to recover this month following a massive crash during the first quarter of 2018, seeing more than $550 billion wiped from the total market capitalisation. (Getty Images)When bitcoin became the world’s first decentralised digital currency upon its release in 2009, the world was reeling from the worst financial crisis in decades. So-called crypto-anarchists and others who were disillusioned by the recession hailed bitcoin for its ability to facilitate payments without the need for a bank. Essentially, they thought, it held the potential to revolutionise the global financial system.Since bitcoin’s inception, more than 1,500 other cryptocurrencies have appeared in its wake. Each one has attempted to offer something that bitcoin can’t, with the argument being that bitcoin’s core technology contains a number a fundamental flaws that are being exposed as its network grows. Here’s why bitcoin might be on the verge of another price explosionSome, like litecoin and bitcoin cash, have improved transaction times and lowered transaction costs. Ethereum’s aim, by contrast, is far more ambitious than simply improving upon bitcoin’s credentials as a payment system and store of value.“Bitcoin is a virtual currency, but also a store of value similar to gold. It’s limited to this function by its own design,” says Alessandra Sollberger, an early investor in bitcoin who has since ersified her cryptocurrency portfolio to include ethereum.“That’s different with ethereum. Beyond being a virtual currency, it’s been designed as a software platform that enables applications such as smart contracts – which are self-executing, secure contracts – to be built and to run without the need of a third party.”Bitcoin: Is the virtual currency the new gold standard?Bitcoin: Is the virtual currency the new gold standard?Bitcoin exists without a central bank able to manipulate its valueEthereum is therefore designed to not just decentralise traditional banks – as bitcoin sets out to do – but decentralise the entire internet. It does this by expanding upon bitcoin’s core technology called the blockchain, which is the online public ledger that permanently records the transactions made across the network.Using ethereum’s more versatile and advanced blockchain technology, anyone is able to create their own decentralised applications.“This opens up a vast potential of business use-case particularly as we move towards a much more connected and autonomous future,” says Erhan Korhaliller, founder of the blockchain specialist PR agency EAK Digital. “Ethereum has the potential to proliferate to all levels of business interaction.”By completely cutting out third parties, ethereum could one day transform the way we transfer everything, from online data to the property deeds of a house. In doing so, it has earned the nickname “World Computer”.“The ethereum platform has the potential to facilitate major innovation in applications, helping to usher a future in which self-driving cars, for example, can accept crypto in order to become self-sustainable,” says Gaurang Torvekar,co-founder and CEO of Indorse, a professional network powered by ethereum.“In the years ahead, there might even be a way in which we can use our smartphones for research that can cure cancer, and in turn get paid for it. With a growing number of companies across the globe working on groundbreaking applications using the ethereum blockchain, the future of innovation is bright, with endless possibilities on the horizon.”The Independent\u0027s bitcoin group on Facebook is the best place to follow the latest discussions and developments in cryptocurrency.

People say put libraries in and health centres, but the Government does not have the money to fill the gaps that would be left by independent shops.                Two centuries of trading closes it\u0027s doors to be solely onlineALAMY 1,500 traditional \u0027bricks and mortar\u0027 stores closed across Britain in 2017The study on the state of the high street by the Local Data Company and Bira found that Yorkshire and the Humber, and Greater London, have suffered the greatest decline in independent shops in the past year.In Yorkshire and the Humber 460 stores closed, with 374 shutting in Greater London. However, the West Midlands managed to buck this trend, with 230 new stores opening.Telford has the lowest percentage of independent retailers, with Yate in Gloucestershire, Bracknell in Berks, Cowley in Oxfordshire and Salford in Greater Manchester the next worst.High street businesses visited by customers - like barbers, beauty salons and coffee shops - fared the best.As the Prezzo announces restaurant closures across the country.

Bloomberg via Getty Images1 of 14Prezzo, the restaurant chain, is shutting 92 branches across the UKNewsagents, women\u0027s clothes shops and estate agents struggled the most.Mr Hawkins continued: These figures come as no surprise. Uncertainty over Brexit, changing shopping habits, a harsh winter and real incomes falling all explain these figures.The consumer is king and if they want to buy online then that is their call, you can\u0027t do anything about it. But you can\u0027t leave the cost base with the old high street and expect it to survive with a new entrant, the internet.It\u0027s not fair to leave the high street to pick up the rates bill when they are only picking up 75 per cent of the trade that used to be there, due to what has gone online. We say to the Government, let the consumer be king but reduce the rates bill for those left in bricks and mortar on the high street.There should also be an equivalent version of business rates for warehousing, particularly if that warehousing is used for retail fulfilment.The last rates increase in April has been the last straw for a lot of struggling retailers, because of the massive increases. The Government says it has put rates relief measures in place to help those struggling, but it has not.It has exempted shops below \u0026pound12,000 rateable value when it used to be \u0026pound6,000, but there aren\u0027t many of our members with rateable value shops of \u0026pound12,000.Those are really tiny shops - the average independent is trading with a rateable value of about \u0026pound24,000. STOCKYorkshire and the Humber, and Greater London, have suffered the greatest decline in 2017He also highlighted the minimum wage and pensions auto-enrolment.While the Government prefers everyone to earn a certain amount, they have asked employers to pick up a bigger wage bill, he said. They have also made them pick up the cost of autoenrolment into pension schemes. The trade association, which represents 150,000 independent UK retailers, has submitted a proposal to the Government with simple measures to help its members. A cut in business rates is top of the list.Mr Hawkins said: If we had a \u0026pound12,000 allowance rather than a \u0026pound12,000 cliff edge, these shops on \u0026pound24,000 would see their rates halved. And if they were tighter on charitable relief and harder on internet warehouses there would be ways of making it revenue neutral.He said the three Ps - parking, property taxes and planning permission - were vitally important. He said: Parking is number one because it is perceived to be free out of town, even though it\u0027s often not.Newsagents, women\u0027s clothes shops and estate agents struggled the mostProperty taxes, being rates and rents, have also hit the high street.And finally planning permission, because it is too tempting for local planners to say \u0027yes, we\u0027ll allow a major development because it creates 10,000 jobs\u0027, without realising they are losing 11,000 jobs in the high street.A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: This Government is determined to see our high streets thriving - now, and in the future.

There\u0026rsquos actually a very concentrated sale of alcohol over these relatively short periods in the weekend evenings.\u0026ldquoIt suggests people are not planning out their drinking. Maybe shorter hours would discourage Scots from impulsive and potentially harmful drinking. The Scandinavian countries have some of the lowest rates of alcohol harm and liver disease in the world.Alcohol is not sold in grocery stores. There are separate alcohol shops which are actually run by the government.Ewan MacDonald-Russell, of the Scottish Retail Consortium, said additional restrictions on retailers would be inappropriate because the impact of minimum pricing was not yet known.The Scottish Government said that it welcomed the recommendations, which it was considering in the context of its alcohol framework plans.In another development, Scottish shoppers have been stocking up on alcohol before prices are ramped up to 30 per cent from midnight on Monday, April 30.NCA bottle of New Zealand Cabernet Sauvignon for just \u0026pound2.50Asda slashed the cost of a bottle of New Zealand Cabernet Sauvignon to just \u0026pound2.50 \u0026ndash half the price it will cost under Holyrood\u0026rsquos new minimum price for alcohol effective tomorrow.Supermarkets are also poised to ditch their own-brand spirits, rather than impose the sweeping rises.

She is a very honest and principled person.However Labour MPs were not so sympathetic, with Labour\u0026rsquos deputy leader Tom Watson saying: I see Amber Rudd is carrying the can for the person originally responsible for this scandal \u0026ndash Theresa May.Michael Gove described Ms Rudd as a \u0027huge asset\u0027 and said he hoped to see her back in the CabinetDiane Abbott added: \u0026ldquoThis was inevitable, the only surprise is that it took so long.\u0026ldquoThe architect of this crisis, Theresa May, must now step forward to give a full and honest account of how this inexcusable situation happened on her watch.And David Lammy noted: \u0026ldquoAmber Rudd resigned because she didn\u0027t know what was going on in her own department and she had clearly lost the confidence of her own civil servants.\u0026ldquoThe real issue is the hostile environment policy that caused this crisis in the first place.

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They have provided support and provided a home for a child in need.It is therefore right that Government supports them in doing so. That is why today I am extending the existing support for children and families in these circumstances.Universal Credit is currently being rolled out across the country."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000402052678.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"james forsyth local elections","story":"The thinking was disastrous local election results would shock Tory MPs into realising they cannot go on like that and that they needed a new leader.But even Mrs May’s most ardent critics have now accepted that next week’s local elections are unlikely to trigger her downfall.Why? Because expectations are so low for the Tories, they are almost bound to surpass them.Mrs May’s own position is also stronger than it was in January thanks to her handling of the Salisbury attack.At the start of the local election campaign, the talk was of how the Tories were facing a wipe-out in London, how they would do well to end up holding on to even one council.But senior figures involved in the campaign now admit they should do much better than that.Conservative Campaign Headquarters’ biggest worry in London is simply being outgunned on the day.They fear Labour’s return to being a mass membership party under Jeremy Corbyn will enable them to get nearly all their voters out, while the Tories will struggle to get more than 40 per cent of their supporters to the polls.There is, though, still cautious optimism that the Tories will hold at least one of their two flagship London boroughs, Wandsworth and Westminster.Then they could claim the results were respectable for a government in mid-term.This is especially true as results outside London are expected to be quite good for the party.One former Cabinet minister loyal to Theresa May tells me: “Things outside London really aren’t bad.”The Tories are particularly hopeful of making gains in the West Midlands.It will be tempting for the Tories to declare the local elections are further proof the capital and the rest of country are diverging politically, and so their decline in London doesn’t matter much as it will be made up for elsewhere.But this would be a catastrophic mistake.Labour’s rise in London is quite remarkable.They have gone from 37 per cent of the vote in 2010 to 55 per cent in 2017.There are several reasons why the capital is turning red but one of the biggest is the decline in home ownership.Home ownership in London peaked in the 1990s and has been falling since.Homeowners became a minority in London in 2011, the first time that has been the case since Margaret Thatcher’s Right To Buy revolution in the early 1980s.On current trends, 60 per cent of Londoners will be renters in seven years’ time.It is no coincidence that this rise in renting has coincided with Labour’s surge in the capital.For one of the things that makes you most likely to vote Tory is owning your own home.Labour’s surprise success at the last election was largely down to a big increase in turnout among renters who swung heavily to Labour.Labour London offers a preview of what happens to the Tories when homeowners become a minority.If the Tories want to win elections they need to get more homes built — and fast.CABINET Brexiteers are getting increasingly frustrated.They feel that key decisions are not being taken in Cabinet, or even the Cabinet Committee tasked with managing the negotiation, but elsewhere.One senior Brexiteer complains to me that Olly Robbins, the Prime Minister’s chief Europe adviser, is, “Running around telling everyone we have to back down on pretty much everything”.This grumpiness has been exacerbated by this week’s meeting of the Brexit inner Cabinet not discussing the big issue of the moment, customs.One member of it tells me: “When people left, they all felt a greater level of frustration.”There is a sense No10 is not respecting the political process.This all ups the ante ahead of the Brexit inner Cabinet’s meeting next week.This will discuss Theresa May’s plan for a hybrid customs model which would see the UK leave the customs union but collect tariffs on the EU’s behalf.Brexiteer ministers regard this as complicated and as having no chance of being accepted by Brussels. They think persisting with it just wastes valuable time.One tells me Mrs May has been told this hybrid plan is unworkable on eight occasions but doesn’t show any signs of abandoning the idea.Part of the problem is that Mrs May remains deeply worried about whether she has the votes in the Commons to leave the customs union.No10 is extremely concerned about the customs union amendment to the trade bill, which is expected to come to a vote in June.Its hope is the hybrid model is close enough to a customs union to see off a rebellion on this issue but if the model is unworkable, as pretty much everyone thinks, it doesn’t solve anything.Mrs May would be better off making the argument that Brexit won’t mean Brexit if Britain doesn’t regain the ability to run its own trade policy and that she couldn’t continue as Prime Minister in these circumstances.CHRIS GRAYLING wants to make it a criminal offence to cheat on auto emissions tests.This law change, which will be part of Grayling’s road to zero plan to cut exhaust emissions and improve air quality, will enable the Government to prosecute car manufacturers who try to diddle the system.The law won’t apply retrospectively.But the Department for Transport hope it will help prevent a repeat of the Volkswagen scandal.OUR political class needs to remember we are NOT Americans.The question about Donald Trump isn’t whether we would have voted for him or if we think he is the right person to be President of the United States.But how we should deal with the country he leads – which is our most important security ally.No country expelled more Russian diplomats following the Salisbury attack than the United States.Mrs May should make clear that she is delighted, not embarrassed, to welcome Donald Trump to Britain on his “working visit”.Why, because a strong relationship with the United States is in this country’s national interest.French President Emmanuel Macron, on his state visit to Washington this week, didn’t hold back in either cosying up to the president, quite literally at times, or in making clear where he disagreed with him.This is a far more sensible approach than acting all embarrassed about observing the necessary diplomatic niceties.Without Trump, yesterday’s moment of history would not have happened. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It aims to force a binding Parliamentary vote on the draft deal while talks are still ongoing.Crucially, if the deal is rejected, MPs and peers would then have power to instruct ministers what action to take – even if it means stopping Brexit.Last night, angry Brexiteers accused peers of sneaky and dishonest tactics to frustrate our departure from the EU.Brexit Minister Lord Callanan said: “Labour’s flawed amendment seeks to tie our hands by inserting false deadlines and shifting the power to negotiate from government to Parliament.“It asks for meaningless votes on the deal before the deal is done. Those who want to overturn the referendum call this the ‘no Brexit’ amendment.“The Conservatives are taking the scrutinising role of Parliament seriously, to improve an essential piece of legislation. Labour are using it to frustrate Brexit.”Tomorrow’s vote will present a fresh headache for Theresa May who is facing a showdown with her Cabinet over her plans for a post-Brexit customs deal.Minsters have told the PM her offer to collect EU import tariffs on behalf of Brussels is unworkable.1.

It’s patronising rubbish.It’s no surprise that this latest rebellion is being led by the Lib Dems, a party whose anti-Brexit platform was so popular at the last election that they managed to win 12 seats — just under 2 per cent of the Commons.Hardly shocking then that they’re no fans of democracy.What they’re doing is downright dangerous, and not just because a trolling guide produced by one Remoaning pressure group ominously promises “direct action”.The risk is that they put up enough barriers to our departure that the Government ends up compromising on membership of the customs union.That would be a knife in the heart of Global Britain and mean that Brussels bureaucrats would still be setting the rules.That simply cannot happen.The Prime Minister must stand firm.THE tragic death of Alfie Evans has touched the nation.There are real questions to be asked about who has the final say on treatment for terminally-ill children.But for now those debates should be put to one side.Our hearts go out to his parents who have fought so hard to give their son a chance.We also want to offer a tribute to the NHS staff who did all they could for him.And who will do the same, again and again, for hundreds of kids in the future.MO Salah is one of those sportsmen that you just want to succeed.But he’s proved himself much more than just a footballer.He’s broken down walls between different communities and has given back to those in his home town who weren’t blessed with such a cultured left foot.

She was reported to be building a war chest in the event of the PM being ousted. For Ms Rudd this humiliation is a nightmare.But the simple truth is that she has been toppled because she was simply not up to the job.Misleading parliament over routine targets for deporting illegal immigrants is the least of it.Ms Rudd was already marked with the Black Spot.Her real blunders were the failure to act far quicker on both the Windrush victims and the knife massacre in London.The Home Office is the infamous “political graveyard” which chews ministers up and spits them out.Theresa May is the rarity who not only survived but used it as a springboard.Now the famously cautious PM needs to carry out emergency repairs with flair and imagination. She needs a new Home Secretary today.The right man for the job is Environment supremo Michael Gove.He has rebuilt his reputation, almost destroyed by his assassination of leadership rival Boris Johnson.He is the most articulate heavyweight minister in Cabinet and has proved that he can handle big responsibilities with both flair and courage.But Amber Rudd’s department has smashed the delicate Cabinet balance between Brexiteers and Remainers.It exposes deep divisions within Tory ranks over the roubled negotiations currently under way with Brussels.A handful of Remainers are threatening to defy the government in a critical vote over remaining in the EU customs union.Meanwhile Brexiteers who have remained silent are plotting a leadership coup if Mrs May gives in.The departure of Ms Rudd could explode all of this into open warfare.Will Mrs May risk putting potential rival Michael Gove in one of the really Great Offices of State?Jezza’s empty promise to crack down on anti-Semitism followed Commons applause for tearful Labour MPs as they read out vicious Jew-phobic abuse from JC4PM supporters.The answer to Mrs Merton is that Labour, with a 22 per cent poll lead, expects big things in London on Thursday, perhaps including scalps in Tory crown jewel boroughs Westminster and Wandsworth.JC doesn’t want a row over Jew-baiting to spoil a good night for Labour.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

My ministers have made over 30 appearances to answer questions and debate the issues. And we will be giving Parliament a vote on the final deal when we have concluded our negotiations with the EU.When all is said and done, I’m a Parliamentarian before a Minister, and a democrat before a Conservative.But there is a clear distinction between the important work of revising legislation and attempting to overturn the referendum result to keep the UK inside the European Union, in direct opposition to the British people.The amendment Labour have proposed today in the House of Lords is at risk of doing just that.There are three crucial reasons why the Government could never accept it.Firstly, the amendment tries to secure a vote for Parliament before the negotiations have concluded. This is, quite frankly, nonsensical — because nothing in this negotiation is agreed until everything is agreed.Second, it demands specific votes by artificial deadlines which, if not met, would give Parliament the power to micromanage the Government on how to carry out these negotiations.This would give the EU Commission a clear incentive to delay the negotiations or present unacceptable propositions until the deadline has passed and the Government is stripped of its ability to negotiate freely.This fundamental change to the balance of our constitution would be both unprecedented and unworkable.And in our negotiations with the EU to date, the progress we have made has in part been down to the flexibility that both sides have shown.Imagine if every quick decision, proposal or response the Prime Minister and I have to take instead had to be timetabled, debated and voted on by over a thousand MPs and peers?Finally, the amendment proposes giving Parliament the power to direct the Government on anything relating to the negotiations – including extending the negotiation process and keeping the UK in the EU indefinitely.Sure, the peers proposing it may claim it is about keeping power in Parliament or ensuring their votes are ‘meaningful’.But those who want to overturn the result of the Referendum have been calling for a ‘no Brexit option’ for months, and this amendment would grant it to them.This is not what the British people want, and it is not something that we can accept. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I also did not lose fragments as the day went on.Dr Denholm Aspy, of the University of Adelaides School of Psychology, Australia, said:The average person spends around six years of their lives dreaming.If we are able to become lucid and control our dreams, we can then use our dreaming time more productively.Lucid dreaming, where you know that you are dreaming while the dream is still happening, has many potential benefits.For example, it may be possible to use lucid dreaming for overcoming nightmares, treating phobias, creative problem solving, refining motor skills and even helping with rehabilitation from physical trauma.Vitamin B6 known as pyridoxine occurs naturally in various foods, including whole grain cereals, legumes, fruits such as banana and avocado, vegetables such as spinach and potato, milk, cheese, eggs, red meat, liver, and fish.Vitamin B6 helps the body to use and store energy from protein and carbohydrates in food and form haemoglobin - the substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen around the body.The NHS said the daily amount of vitamin B6 adults aged 19 to 64 years need is about 1.4mg for men and 1.2mg for women which can be got from a normal diet.But it warns taking more than 200mg a day for a long time can lead to a loss of feeling in the arms and legs known as peripheral neuropathy.People should not take the supplement over 10mg unless advised to by a doctor.

I was at rock bottom. There were times when I thought I wouldn’t get through it.I was exhausted, fearing I would end up in jail – all for doing the right thing by the person I loved most in the world, so that she did not have to die an undignified and agonising death.”Helen was diagnosed with a lung disorder in 2004 called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency that forced her to leave her job as a college lecturer.In 2015 she made the decision to contact Dignitas and carried out all the research and payments herself.James, who was in a relationship with Helen for 33 years, said she was in a helpless situation and was in pain and suffering every day.He added: She said, ‘I’m not frightened of dying, but I am frightened about the way I die’.She had my support at every stage but said if I was uncomfortable with going she would consider going alone.We knew there could be a legal issue but there was no way I was ever going to let [her] be waved off at the door.”When the couple boarded the train to Switzerland, Helens lung capacity was at 15 per cent and she had oxygen tanks and nebulisers keeping her alive.After spending their final hours together in a hotel, the pair made their way to the clinic in Zurich where Helen was giving life ending drugs to help her pass away incredibly peacefully.But in a devastating twist of fate, the couples home in West Bromwich in the West Midlands was ransacked by thieves while Helen was ending her life in November 2016.The callous raiders stole Helen’s computer containing cherished photos and wrapped the stolen items in “the last bed sheet she slept in”.Neighbours raised the alarm and told police the couple had gone to Switzerland for Helen so she could end her life.James was then quizzed by cops within hours of arriving back in the UK without his long-term partner.He said: “Initially they were fine... The detectives said I had nothing to worry about. I told them I had a letter written by Helen outlining her decision and we had copies of all of her medical notes and letters between her GP and consultant. They just said they would be in touch.”But two months later, he was interviewed under caution and was investigated for six months until the charges were dropped in June 2017 after cops got hold of Helens medical records.James is now campaigning alongside charity Dignity in Dying to overturn the UK’s ban on assisted dying and has been in contact with Julie Smith, 48, whose husband Paul died in September 2016.The 57-year-old had been diagnosed with cancer but died in agony as his GP said he could not provide medical records for him to send to Dignitas on “ethical and legal grounds”.The disease, also known as AATD or A1AD, is a rare inherited condition that can cause liver and lung problems.Around 25,000 people in the UK have the genetic condition though most remain healthy so few have been diagnosed.Sufferers are much more vulnerable to the effects of inhaling smoke or other toxic materials like dust, fumes or chemicals.The condition increases the risk of lung disease including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It costs around £10,000 for a person to go to Dignitas to end their life with the sentence for assisting a suicide up to 14 years in jail.A West Midlands Police spokesman said: “The investigation was delayed because, despite West Midlands police requests for medical records, they were not made [available] until June last year.“That month, it was decided that it did not meet the evidential threshold for prosecution and the investigation was discontinued.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000277727470.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"baby boomers struggling pay rent maybe even more than young people","story":"Most of the baby boomer generation own homes but 1.13million rent from private landlords.The findings show that half a million baby boomers who rent privately may have had to take drastic decisions in the past year to cover their rent.A fifth of those battling to afford bills also cut down on food or heating, and one in ten have used credit.Of those who need vital changes made to their homes, such as adding handrails, stair lifts, ramps or wider doorways for wheelchairs, around two-fifths (42 per cent) have fallen over in their own home and a similar proportion at 43 per cent leave home less often then they want to.Nearly three-fifths (59 per cent) have needed these changes for over a year, the survey found.David Orr, chief executive of the National Housing Federation,  said: We often hear that young people bear the brunt of the housing crisis but todays report reveals a shocking number of hidden baby boomers who are struggling just as much if not more.There is a huge amount of inequality amongst this age group and unfortunately the wealthier majority have hidden the reality of hundreds of thousands of people who have never been able to afford a house. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But because of what youve been through together, your love for one another will be strengthened.Little Alfie, aged 23-months, passed away in the arms of his mum and dad in the early hours of Saturday after surviving almost five days without life support.For Charlies parents Chris and Connie seeing the pain on the faces of Tom and Kate as they went through a similar experience of legal battles and bedside vigils, the couple decided to speak out.Earlier this week Chris and Connie backed calls from Alfies parents for a change to the law to give families more power over hospital care.They have now launched the campaign Charlies Law and on Sunday put out a call to action for people to write to their MP asking for support.Chris and Connie, from Bedfont, Middlesex, have also set up a foundation in their sons memory called Charlie Gard Foundation dedicated to fighting mitochondrial disease by raising awareness and funding research of the illness.In their interview, Connie said: We feel the pain of Alfies parents. Chris and I know how devastated and empty they will be feeling as their desperate fight to save Alfie has ended.Seeing them go through the agonies we have done has been incredibly hard.Their case has come so soon after ours and seeing them stood outside the same courts, pain etched on their faces, has been heartbreaking.It has resurrected very painful memories about our own journey. Sometimes it has been too painful to watch.I dont think any parent can fail to have been moved by the way Tom and Kate fought for Alfie. After all they are loving parents who would do anything to save their childs life.And now Alfies case has made us even more determined to fight for new laws to give parents more say in what happens to their child so that other parents might be spared the agony.Baby Charlie died aged 11 months old last July just a week before his first birthday after a long fight against a disease called mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome.His fight for life touched the world as Connie and Chris fought against a decision by doctors at Great Ormond Street Hospital who applied for permission to have Charlies ventilator switched off.They wanted to take him to the US for pioneering treatment and took their fight all the way through the court system of the UK and Europe.Alfie was admitted to Alder Hey Childrens Hospital in Liverpool in December 2016 aged seven months. It was believed he had a mitochondrial disorder, similar to Charlie, and parents Tom, 21, and Kate, 20, experienced a similar court-battle as they fought to take their son to a hospital in Rome.Both couples lost their legal cases to take their poorly children out of the country for treatment elsewhere.Charlies Law calls for independent mediation to be offered to all parents in a similar situation to prevent cases against doctors going to court.Dad Chris said: People thought Charlies case was unique but the fact Alfies case followed so swiftly shows it is not.In fact these cases are not that rare, which is why the law in this area needs to be addressed.They have offered to meet with Tom and Kate when they feel up to it."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nintchdbpict000402475535-e1525044266341.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"amber rudd pm hopes dashed","story":"She was first elected as the Conservative MP for Hastings and Rye in 2010, having lived in the East Sussex constituency since 2007.Her career saw her hold ministerial positions in the Treasury and the Department of Energy and Climate Change before becoming Energy Secretary in 2015.In the run-up to the 2016 Brexit vote Ms Rudd, 54, campaigned for Britain to stay in the EU.And when Theresa May became Prime Minister after David Cameron quit following the result of the referendum, Ms Rudd succeeded her as Home Secretary.
