Pictured: Phaedra with her ex husband Apollo Nida and their two sons together Ayden and Dylan         Parks claims she\u0027s \u0027happy\u0027 and \u0027excited\u0027 after finally hooking the guy of her dreams after a year long search of the \u0027man pond\u0027. But while Parks is coy about sharing the identity of her new hunk, DailyMailTV can reveal she\u0027s in fact dating handsome actor Medina Islam (pictured together) who is ten years her juniorSo what\u0027s next for the multi-talented Parks? \u0027Well, I have a new television project on the horizon,\u0027 she reveals.\u0027I can\u0027t mention it yet, but I\u0027m coming back to the small screen. It\u0027s a very popular show and you get to see me in a totally different light.\u0027With a possible new TV show on a horizon, keeping a schedule for Parks is somewhat of a feat in itself. Not only is she a busy mom-of-two, she is a partner in a hectic law firm in Atlanta, a celebrity and contracted model for Wilhelmina Models, and she also runs her own foundation for disadvantaged children and is heavily involved in community activism.But on top of that - and most unusually - Parks is a qualified mortician, embalmer and funeral director as well as a certified cremator, tending to people\u0027s dead relatives.\u0027I\u0027m keeping the dead beautiful and preserved for Jesus,\u0027 she explains.Not only is she a busy mom-of-two, she is a partner in a hectic law firm in Atlanta, a celebrity and contracted model for Wilhelmina Models, and she also runs her own foundation for disadvantaged children and is heavily involved in community activism.          Parks (second from left) hints in part-two of an exclusive interview with DailyMailTV, airing on Friday, that she has considered returning to The Real Housewives of Atlanta\u0027My life is very busy, I\u0027m fully booked, everybody knows I\u0027m a mortician and summer is the slow season.\u0027I\u0027m partnered with one of the largest funeral homes in Atlanta so I do a lot of bodies there.\u0027I also go to New Orleans and do some bodies there, you know, whoever calls me, I\u0027m a genius at it. I love it. It\u0027s my ministry. And so if you call me, I will come because that\u0027s my specialty.\u0027I love making people look life-like and giving people the proper sendoff.\u0027Parks reveals she was inspired to become a mortician after one of her friends was killed in New Orleans and began volunteering at a funeral home before going to school to get qualified.These days she gets special requests from people who know her from television to care for their loved ones in death and she claims to have buried a number of celebrities herself.She says she wears an elegant black dress, a hat and veil and black lace gloves with the fingers cut out so she can handle the bodies.   "},{"url":null,"title":"Family join search teacher vanished holiday Turkey","story":"Share this article        His nephew, London Fire Brigade firefighter Gavin Thomas (pictured), 35, and his wife Georgina, have now flown to Turkey to search for him \u0027The initial thought is he may have fallen and he\u0027s injured somewhere, unable to raise the alarm, that\u0027s our primary thought,\u0027 he said.\u0027But obviously you can\u0027t rule out something untoward going on.

The results of the more recent European elections in May were no fluke. Huge numbers of voters deserted the Labour Party for the Lib Dems and the Greens, and the most recent polling results confirm that the shift is likely to be more permanent than many expected.          Boris Johnson – the most likely winner of the Conservative leadership race – has not ruled out proroguing Parliament, which would mean setting aside the operation of the Commons and bypassing elected MPs in order to drive through a No Deal BrexitA YouGov poll on July 4 showed that together, the Conservatives and the Brexit Party stood at 47 per cent of the vote – as much as the three Left-of-centre parties put together. The same poll saw Labour hit a new low with an unprecedented 18 per cent, which puts them behind the Tories, the Brexit Party and the Lib Dems.True, Labour have done slightly better in the latest ‘poll of polls’ – based on the average of five different pollsters since July 2 – which puts them at 25 per cent. But the Conservative and Brexit parties together still stand at 45 per cent.So, with Mr Corbyn’s ratings at a staggering -55, the worst in living memory for the main Opposition leader, it would take an earthquake to shake a Johnson-Farage pact.The logic is clear – a pact is now the very thing needed from Labour, the Lib Dems and the Greens too. The poll of polls shows that together, Labour, the Lib Dems and the Greens stand at a combined 49 per cent.Throughout my political life, I have been against such political alliances and vehemently opposed coalitions. I have long resisted the idea of pre-election ‘stitch-ups’ because the electorate deserves a choice. But this time, I accept that the only way of providing a real choice is for the three Left-of-centre parties to reach an informal arrangement that avoids what is otherwise inevitable – a spectacular coup for Mr Johnson.Hard as it will be for some to swallow, discussions should be held as to how this can be best achieved. Before anyone brands me ‘traitor’, I am not talking about Labour voters in Labour-held seats being called upon to vote Lib Dem or Green.But we do need a hard-headed and realistic appraisal of where deals can be done and a common platform agreed, based on giving the electorate another chance to consider – having looked into the abyss – whether they really do wish to leave the EU. The logic is the same on both sides of the Brexit ide – the established parties are finding it hard to meet the needs and views of the electorate. Whatever we think of grand coalitions, it seems that, for now at least, their time has come.For the Left-of-centre parties, the alternative is to knowingly walk into a trap that puts hard-line Brexiteers in the driving seat – and, as Mr Johnson has said, into his Cabinet. With them would come a range of economic measures that I believe would reinforce the inequality and antagonism bedevilling our public life. For the Conservatives, too, the logic of an alliance is inescapable.History teaches us that those facing difficult challenges are rarely thanked, but in time, a willingness to act is seen as preferable to sleepwalking into disaster.

While not exactly sybaritic, it did have an unforgettable sense of spatial and social drama. Replete with a four-tier ing platform and a 15ft deep end – “Scotland’s deepest deep end” – the pool was usually a frantic free for all, bodies churning in water, some hurtling perilously off the ing boards.Ingrained in my memory, it resembled the pool in north London painted in 1971 by Leon Kossoff, the figurative artist who died earlier this month: packed with swimmers plashing and cavorting, you can practically smell the chlorine. Kossoff’s vision of cacophonous communality contrasts with David Hockney’s lushly ambrosial Californian pools of the same period, with their narcissistic lone bathers, aptly epitomising the difference between swimming in the public and private spheres.Whether for survival, sport or recreation, humans have always found a reason to swim. Healthful and sociable, swimming is an unmitigated inidual and collective good, kind to bodies of all ages, shapes and dispositions. It is also the most sensuous form of physical exercise. Paul Valéry, the French poet and philosopher, described it as “fornication avec l’onde”.Summer brings out pleasure-seeking bathers, frolicking in the cooling embrace of lidos, ponds and sea baths. Last year’s intense heatwave saw siege conditions at London’s Brockwell Lido, one of the capital’s more popular open air pools. And so, with immaculate timing, the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA), in partnership with the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, this month opens Into the Blue, a display telling the story of British bathing habits. From Roman baths to Zaha Hadid’s London Aquatics Centre, the swimming pool comes to life through the architectural drawings, photographs and models in the RIBA’s collections.Andrea Palladio’s conjectured reconstruction of the Baths of Caracalla, the second largest of ancient Rome’s thermae, roots formal bathing culture in classical antiquity, though its origins go back much further. Equipped with hot, cold and tepid baths, together with gymnasiums and libraries, Caracalla was a hedonistic temple calculated to cultivate body and mind. Bronze mirrors directed sunlight into the natatio or swimming pool, capable of holding 1,600 people.Roman baths provided the model for the bath houses that emerged in Britain from the 17th century onwards. Over time, these evolved into the modern, more sportif pool. De Arte Natandi, published in English in 1658 as The Compleat Swimmer, provided early instruction on technique, with woodcuts illustrating variants of breaststroke and backstroke. However, as an activity with salacious propensities – scantily clad or naked people in proximity to each other – swimming was disdained and discouraged, especially by the church.Cleanliness was always next to godliness. The Baths and Wash-houses Act of 1846, which established a network of public buildings in British towns and cities, was primarily impelled by a Victorian crusade against dirt. Associated with ignorance and immorality, dirt was also seen as an impediment to an efficient workforce. Swimming was a secondary preoccupation but it gradually gained ground, accommodated in increasingly elaborate Victorian baths.One high point was the Charing Cross floating bath of 1875 moored on the Thames at Hungerford Bridge. Engravings of the time show moustachioed bathers in chastely voluminous trunks (inevitably, it was men only), gliding around a water-filled barge enclosed by a greenhouse-like structure. Its backers hoped it would be the first in a series of floating baths along the Thames, but it eventually closed in 1884. London still awaits a modern floating lido, unlike Paris, which has the Piscine Joséphine Baker on the Seine.Throughout the Victorian era, social stratification was rigidly enforced, with first- and second-class baths catering for their respective constituencies. Women were generally relegated to laundry duties and rarely had the opportunity to learn to swim. The catastrophic sinking of the pleasure cruiser Princess Alice in the Thames in 1878 pointed up this stark, existential inequality. More than 600 people drowned, most of them female passengers, who would have been non-swimmers, dragged under by their heavy clothing.Underscored by social and economic change, the development of the swimming pool was bound up with urbanisation, progressive reform and the emergence of popular recreation. The rise of mixed bathing and the sexualisation of public culture added a further libidinous frisson. By the time the former war artist Fortunino Matania designed a poster for Southport lido in 1925, depicting long-limbed bathers enjoying sunlit seaside delights, Victorian prudery and drudgery were a distant memory. Ice-cream coloured lidos peppered the English coast, among them Saltdean and Plymouth’s Tinside. A drawing showing the interior of Wembley’s Empire Pool, which opened in 1934 and hosted the 1948 Olympics, evokes a similarly gilded and carefree milieu, featuring spectators in tuxedos and gowns.The exigencies of postwar reconstruction brought the pool back down to earth. Municipal provision and a spirit of egalitarianism flourished, with nearly 200 public baths being built between 1960 and 70. Dollan baths in East Kilbride is typical of the time, its humpback profile inspired by Japanese modernist Kenzo Tange’s National Gymnasium for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.Today, Britain’s public swimming pools must contend with the corrosive impact of local authority budget cuts and the challenge of maintaining ageing buildings. Bon Accord Baths, my watery alma mater, closed in 2008, and has since languished while Aberdeen city council tries to figure out what to do with it. It’s currently on Historic Environment Scotland’s Buildings at Risk Register, and its future is far from assured. As Raymond Chandler pithily observed in The Long Goodbye “nothing ever looks emptier than an empty swimming pool”.But, as the RIBA display shows, more optimistic narratives also prevail. Jubilee Pool in Penzance has just reopened following a refurbishment that will harness geothermal energy to heat part of its pool, enabling all-year-round use. Intended to attract tourists, while also improving things for residents, the remodelling by Scott Whitby Studio includes an expanded cafe, bar and new community hall. Originally designed by borough engineer Captain Frank Latham, Jubilee Pool is a tour de force of seaside art deco, its gleaming white structure resembling an ocean liner anchored at the extreme end of England.As the largest seawater lido in the country, Jubilee Pool is powerfully emblematic of a belief in modernity and the benefits of public recreation. “There can hardly be any better form of bodily exercise than swimming,” proclaimed the mayor of Penzance at its opening in 1935. Paul Valéry put it another way. “It seems to me that I discover and recognise myself when I return to this universal element,” he wrote. “To plunge into water… this is for me a delight only comparable to love.”● Into the Blue: The Origin and Revival of Pools, Swimming Baths and Lidos, Victoria \u0026amp Albert Museum, London, runs 20 July to 19 April"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8db7d57fef51958ba9f0513ae06d44d31ca683c1/572_468_5859_3516/master/5859.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bf5b2a7025e0bc13d8dce553bfd2d20d","title":"the big picture helen levitt new york geoff dyer","story":"The pioneering photographer Helen Levitt’s photographs captured the casual flow of life with grace and tendernessHelen Levitt was born in New York in 1913 and died there in 2009, at the age of 95. She had a considerable reputation as a photographer but, in the years to come, it seems to me, we will cherish her still more warmly and regard her work even more highly. The black-and-white pictures from the 1930s and 40s – kids playing in the streets, old people keeping a watchful eye on the neighbourhood – have a lyrical grace and a rough-and-tumble tenderness. The kids are having a lot of fun – even if that fun involves someone getting hurt – and it’s fun looking at the pictures. They’re easy on the eye in the way that Anna Karenina is easy to read compared with Ulysses. Henri Cartier-Bresson was a decisive influence but Levitt seemed happy to survey the flow of life casually going about its unruly business rather than pouncing on instants of suddenly perfect visual geometry. Her photographic moments, as a result, contain entire childhoods, whole lifetimes of everyday disappointment and routine happiness: the kind of stuff we associate with narrative fiction rather than photographs.In the 1950s she began shooting in colour – not as a formal experiment but as a natural extension of the urge James Agee had observed in the earlier black-and-white work: “to perceive the aesthetic reality within the existing world”. When almost all of this colour work was stolen by a burglar she started afresh in 1971.This picture is part of a retrospective of Levitt’s work now on show at Arles photography festival. I like fondly to think that Levitt had photographed the lady in the marbled blue dress on the left before, Seven Up!-style, caught in a similar gesture of playful triumph – now that she’s old it might just be backache – when they were both young, in the 1930s. But the other woman, on the right, haven’t I seen her before too, at exactly the age she is now, looking on with that same attitude of rough-hewn, nosy resignation, in black-and-white pictures from before the war? There is, in other words, something timely and eternal about Levitt. So while her city has changed, has become, in many ways, a playground for the young and affluent, this picture also depicts a distinctively 21st-century scenario: Airbnb guests, with all their luggage, wondering when their host is going to show up. Help is, as they say, at hand it’s just that no one knows what form it might take.• Helen Levitt: Observing New York’s Streets is at Espace Van Gogh, Arles photography festival, until 22 September"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9800ab547d361fa5569de0fcc5b34425731073f2/0_1003_7200_4320/master/7200.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d4e4ec8a9b4ea1830bb3b57d867404c4","title":"celebrating rave culture in pictures","story":"From warehouse parties to the acid house explosion, new exhibition Sweet Harmony: Rave Today captures a dancefloor revolution.

There are more books sold in the summer than during any other season: the well-established publishing calendar tends to see hardbacks released in the autumn to be given as gifts at Christmas, then repackaged as paperbacks in late spring. As Donna Harrington-Lueker sets out in her history of the beach read, Books for Idle Hours, the summer publishing rush is at least a century old, and has typically aimed “airy and froth-like” books on “young ladies” (the quote is from an 1888 work on summer books by Arlo Bates). The summer fiction market is changing, though, with more and more “serious”, “literary” novels showing up where once there were only thrillers and crime novels, bonkbusters and romances. So it is that Normal People by Sally Rooney is currently piled high on the tables of WH Smith’s Travel alongside Lee Child, Jodi Picoult and Bernard Cornwell.I’m aware of how contentious and porous discussions of genre can be. Generic labels, though, are the terms that booksellers and publishers think in and for literary novels, the chances of summer success are still relatively slim. Tom Tivnan, managing editor of the Bookseller, points to Nielsen BookScan data that shows that of the top 100 bestselling summer fiction titles in 2018 only seven were literary books. 2017 fared a bit better (12 of the top 100), 2016 had 10 of the top 100. While this may make for sobering reading for “serious” novelists looking to finance the Provençal writing retreat, their lot is significantly better than it used to be.Precise numbers for previous decades are hard to come by, but in the 1990s, for example, it was almost unheard of for a literary novel to cross over into the mainstream. Sebastian Faulks enjoyed just such a commercial success with his second book. “It was very unusual for something to cross over like The Girl at the Lion d’Or did,” Faulks says. “There was a much greater separation between the literary ghetto and the mainstream back then. The average sales of a literary novel in hardback were 1,500 and if you sold 10,000 in paperback, that was considered enormous. Only the very rare novel, like Hotel du Lac by Anita Brookner, would then get out of that literary niche.” The wild success of Faulks’s French trilogy – The Girl at the Lion d’Or (1989), Birdsong (1993), and Charlotte Grey (1998) – were early proof of a fact now widely accepted in publishing: that literary novels would sell by the boatload if they were packaged and promoted correctly.Readerly adventurousness has been driven in part by the proliferation of prizes and partly through the enduring impact of book clubs like Richard and Judy’s in the UK and Oprah’s in the US. It’s this latter phenomenon that Tom Tivnan believes to be of critical importance. “The books selected were not always literary fiction but often were – Brick Lane, Half of a Yellow Sun, Cloud Atlas – and sold in quantities they never would have had they not been selected for the list. This moved the goalposts for consumers – and retailers – in terms of what was a ‘summer read’.”Another factor has been the renaissance of Waterstones and, in particular, the fiction book of the month promotion, which Tivnan says is “more important than prizes” in that the book becomes “a guaranteed bestseller for the month it is promoted by the chain. Almost every literary fiction title in the summer months in the past few years is there because it has been featured as a Waterstones book of the month.”Sharmaine Lovegrove, publisher at Dialogue Books, agrees with Tivnan that serious summer reading is a new phenomenon. “I think the concept of a summer hit within literary fiction is still quite a new one. It only really happens once a book has found its legs as a hardback and had the autumn to pick up awards. When it comes out in paperback it needs to have enough awards, accolades and quotes attached to it that it makes the reader think ‘This is something that I’m going to try’, rather than picking up something more commercial because that’s what a summer read is, and that’s what WH Smith is pushing.” Naomi Alderman’s The Power won the 2017 Baileys prize, sold many hundreds of thousands of copies and is being adapted for TV by Amazon. In an email, I asked her what it was about The Power that she thought propelled it over the parapet.“The Power is one of a type of literary novel that tries to talk about a large subject,” she replied, “one that many people have probably wondered and thought about, in my case: why are men and women’s lives and social positions so different? It’s got some things in common with books that discuss real-world news events like the wonderful Room. Many of us who heard about Josef Fritzl could not stop trying to imagine what it was like to be in that awful basement room – we can never go there and we very much hope that the new identities of the people in the room are never revealed, so the only way to journey is in fiction and Emma Donoghue made the crossing for us.”Jessie Burton’s first novel, The Miniaturist, experienced a similar crossover success in 2014-15. It’s not an obvious summer hit – a cool, eerie tale set in 17th-century Amsterdam. I asked Burton if the book’s extraordinary sales – it was a No 1 bestseller in hardback and paperback – came as a surprise to her.“Of course!” she laughed. “As a debut novelist you’re told again and again, ‘You’ll be lucky if you sell 500 hardbacks.’ Before it was published, I’d struggled to find the right agent for the book – it wasn’t a given, this success. When something like that blows up, your initial reaction is gratitude, astonishment and not a little disorientation. Because you’d never expected it to happen.”Was there a particular moment when the book’s spectacular rise hit home, I asked. She told me of seeing a huge billboard of the novel in Waterloo station and asking a train guard to take a picture of her in front of it. “But actually,” she continues , “it was when Geri Halliwell tweeted a picture of herself on her yacht, saying how much she had loved the book… ludicrous!” Burton’s next novel, The Confession, is out in September and already feels like a nailed-on hit for summer 2020. “It’s the story of Connie and Elise,” she said, “two women who go to California and hire a bungalow in West Hollywood. I wanted to set it among these Hockney swimming pools, where people were exhausted by 6pm because of the heat. It’s a very heat-centric novel.”The definitive summer smash of the past decade, David Nicholls’s 2009 novel, One Day, is a high-concept love story that sold 5m copies and was turned into a 2011 film starring Anne Hathaway. Nicholls’s latest novel, Sweet Sorrow, is cut from the same cloth, and achieves the same powerful nostalgic sweep as its predecessor. I asked Nicholls what he enjoyed most about that glorious summer, when One Day often appeared to be the only book anyone was reading – on poolside loungers, under beach parasols, on the commuter trains of those left behind for the summer. “The high-water mark for me was seeing Audrey reading a copy in an episode of Coronation Street,” he said.What does it feel like to see people reading his book in public, I wondered. “It’s always extremely exciting and gratifying. I’m sometimes tempted to say something – thank you very much – though you have to take on the possibility that they’re absolutely hating it, that they’re about to tut or sigh and give up, or hurl it to the floor. What if they have notes?”“I find this gendering of fiction and nonfiction such a tiresome cliche,” he says. “So many of our big contemporary novelists appeal across the board. In 2019, the idea that men want to read serious nonfiction while women should distract themselves with a frivolous novel makes me want to be sick down myself. It’s something that the book trade could do more about, from the way children’s books are published to the way books are advertised.” As far as this summer goes, it’s been all about Faber \u0026amp Faber to date. Two novels – Normal People and Anna Burns’s Booker-winning Milkman have sold in extraordinary numbers, with both books routinely shifting 10,000 copies a week. Their success partly confirms many of the points made above – a combination of prizes, Waterstones and word of mouth.Alex Bowler, publisher at Faber, admits that such transformative successes can often come as a surprise even to the editors who commissioned them. “You hope that it’s happening because of your publishing act, but more often than not it’s outside that: the alchemical thing where a book connects with a culture and a zeitgeist and means it’s piled high in summer promotions.” What’s important, though, is how the publisher responds to any initial signs of momentum building. “When we sense that opportunity as publishers, when you feel it happening, you seize it and it informs how you publish the paperback.”2010 David Nicholls, One Day (published 2009)  The quintessential summer hit, One Day told the story of Emma and Dexter, dropping into their lives every year on St Swithin’s Day. High concept and beautifully written (like another big summer seller, Kate Atkinson’s Life After Life (2013), One Day was named Galaxy book of the year and adapted by Nicholls into a film starring Anne Hathaway.2011 Emma Donoghue, Room (published 2010) Inspired by the Josef Fritzl case, Room is told in the voice of the five-year-old Jack, trapped with his mother in a basement. S hortlisted for the Orange prize and the Booker, and was turned into a successful film in 2015.2012 Madeleine Miller, The Song of Achilles (published 2011)  Miller worked as a teacher of classics for the 10 years she spent writing this sexually charged retelling of the Iliad. A winner of the Orange prize, the novel was the bestselling debut novel of the year.2013 Rachel Joyce, The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry (published 2012)  Another surprise hit, this quiet, charming novel of an old man’s journey to see a former colleague on her deathbed was also the bestselling debut of the year, and longlisted for the Booker prize. An early incarnation of the “up-lit” (optimistic fiction) genre.2014 Donna Tartt, The Goldfinch (published 2013)  Tartt’s debut, The Secret History, was a crossover 21 years earlier.

It states that both uncertainty around Brexit and the global economic slowdown have led to the highest recession risk since 2007.It raises the alarm over the potential impact on living standards, warning that the five previous recessions have produced an economic shock equating to a £2,500 loss for each household in the UK. They have also increased unemployment by one million.It comes after a series of warnings over the health of the economy amid continuing uncertainty around Britain’s EU membership. Earlier this month the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, warned that there had been a “sea change” in the world’s financial markets, driven by pessimism about the economic outlook.Meanwhile there have been warning signs in the construction industry. The Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply has warned the political paralysis gripping Westminster has left the industry trapped in “quicksand”, with house buying and new orders dropping “like a stone”.There are also concerns that the government and Bank of England have already used many of the tools in their armoury that could curb a future recession. Cutting interest rates to stimulate the economy is hard, as they are already at historically low levels, while quantitative easing (QE), in which more money is pumped into the economy, is likely to have less effect than in the past.The Resolution Foundation also warns that it would be dangerous to assume that the next recession will be the same as the last, when major job losses were avoided. It states that it may not be the case that the big unemployment increases that characterised the 1980s and early 1990s recessions have been consigned to history. “This all means the UK needs a new plan to respond to the next recession and, whether or not a downturn starts in the near future, planning for it certainly should,” it concludes.The recession warning comes in the Resolution Foundation report Failing to Plan  Planning to Fail, the first of a series looking at the impact of recessions on low-and-middle income households. The foundation’s “recession risk” indicator, which uses yields on government bonds to assess the threat from a recession, suggests that Britain’s recession risk has risen to its highest level since 2007.James Smith, its research director, warned against complacency. “Ten years on from the end of the last downturn, the UK’s recession risk is at its highest level since 2007, with growth slowing at home and abroad, and widespread uncertainty around Brexit,” he said. “While recessions differ in terms of the cause and effect, they are all uniformly bad for living standards. The average economic hit from the last five downturns has been equivalent to £2,500 for every household in Britain, and a million people losing their jobs.“Policy-makers can’t prevent recessions from happening, but they can limit their damage with the right policy response. The problem for the incoming government and the Bank of England however is that many of the tools used to fight the last downturn – from big interest rate cuts to £375bn of QE – are either spent or severely blunted. So whether or not a downturn starts in the near future, planning for it certainly should.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/842f23a8266d117dd259590de8659d10e7e0d151/0_0_4994_2996/master/4994.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16f332f17cc7fda3e921cd35d87c8182","title":"divided britain ethnic pay gap","story":"Officials eyeing you with contempt. Police treating you as scum. A sense of being constantly watched and judged by professionals. Living in fear of benefit sanctions. A lack of community facilities. Such is likely to be your experience if you are working class. Such is also likely to be your experience if you are of black or minority ethnic origin.London, the sample may not be statistically valid but subjective experiencesof the interviewees are revealing.For many people on low incomes, whether white or of minority background, encounters with the state – police, local council, social services, jobcentres – are experienced as punitive and disempowering a sense of being policed rather than supported. As one interviewee put it: “You just feel like you’re constantly being watched, and you’re always being judged by what you’re doing or what you’re saying, but I just don’t feel that there’s a lot of support.”For minority groups, this has been compounded by “hostile environment” migration policies that effectively turn doctors, teachers and public officials into border guards and spies. Many feel priced out of the neighbourhoods in which they grew up, observing how a combination of gentrification and austerity has helped shut down community organisations and the social networks that sustained them.White people are far more likely to identify as working class than those from minorities. Partly this may be because minorities are more likely to be in casualised jobs. Many, the report suggests, may also have internalised anti-working class sentiments. “When you say working class,” observed a black interviewee, “you think of people on council estates, drinking that cheap Ace cider.” And then there’s a question the report does not address: the impact of identity categories on self-perception. Minorities have come to be identified, and to identify themselves, in terms of race, ethnicity or “community”. Class categories, these days, are applied primarily to the white population. Class distinctions have become racialised – few now question the use of the term “white working class”. Meanwhile, class isions within minority groups are often ignored.Consider for instance, another report published last week, an Office for National Statistics (ONS) study of the “ethnic pay gap”. It showed that those of Chinese and Indian origin have a higher median hourly pay than white British people. Bangladeshi, Pakistani and black people have lower pay, with Bangladeshi people doing worst.Unfortunately, the ONS study does not look at the issue of class. Hence, for all the debate about the study, the significance of the ethnic pay gap is not easy to pin down. Race and class shape people’s lives in complex, sometimes contradictory, ways. What these reports reveal is that too often we stress the wrong differences and ignore the commonalities that matter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1b5904ade5ff3b6a4e478a198939f5be39ce53c/0_68_5517_3310/master/5517.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f69e68ef5fc05e039ef12797d3a1f92","title":"tartan blankets half a shandy i am happy to embrace later life","story":"As a survey reveals that the over-50s are joining gyms and having sex, the reality is something rather more comfortableThe psychological challenges that arrive with your 50th birthday are rarely addressed in debates about Scotland’s health. To be honest, they’d all been pulsing and fermenting away for a few years before then anyway. Many of us choose to put them in one of those wee mental boxes that psychologists tell their patients to imagine when they want to dodge bad memories and negative vibes. We then mark it with big virtual red capital letters: “NOT TO BE OPENED UNTIL YOU’RE 50.” These little red flags range from twinges in your body’s fundamental areas to framing the appropriate reply when the barber asks you how you want your hair cut.The biggest mental and emotional challenge comes, though, when you realise that it can take up to three days for the effects of a hangover to subside. You find yourself having to think very carefully before you embark on one of the great and uncomplicated pleasures of being human: the afternoon bevvy session. Can I cancel the next day and perhaps the day after that? Can I get Bargain Hunt on catch-up? Is there enough mould-free cheese, breaded ham and white bread to see out a couple of days in the dark?The most poignant passage I ever read on Facebook is about that day when you went out and played with your friends for the last time and didn’t know it. There is a 50-plus equivalent. One day you’ll be getting howling in the daylight and talking big with your chums, not knowing that you would never do this again. That day is fast approaching and may already have passed.According to a recent UK-wide poll, those about to slip anchor into their sixth decade are not beset by such torments of the soul. Instead they seem to be living a life of hedonistic abandon reminiscent of the last days of the Roman empire. The travel firm Tui commissioned the survey, which found that Britain’s fiftysomethings have gym memberships, watch YouTube and shag like goats every few days. They eat out regularly, attend gigs and are devotees of Game of Thrones. When they’re not channelling their inner Caligula they grumble only about “unrepresentative clothing brands”.Just how representative was this survey? Did they speak to anyone in Scotland? Even in our millionaire housing estates they’re not having that much fun. They certainly don’t look like it, although in some privileged neighbourhoods they have perfected a neutral look that conveys insouciant serenity for all occasions, including mid-concupiscence and watching Game of Thrones. Others less charitably inclined suggest that such a look comes with gold card beautician membership.Perhaps, too, this sense of self-possessed tranquillity is what you get when you can afford a personal counsellor or a life coach. Perhaps they get told to put any concerns about food banks, the Brexit apocalypse and polar bears turning vegetarian with the climate crisis into a mental box that doesn’t get opened until they’re 80. By then, many of them will be beyond worrying, as they’ll either be dead or swaddled in a tartan blanket and talking about that Kenny Dalglish goal against Spain again.The rest of us must simply find other ways of coming to an accommodation with advancing codgerdom. It’s said that humans have been fitted with a psychological device that erodes our expectations with each passing decade. This means that, instead of getting depressed at your inability to participate in night-long bacchanals, you’re actually comfortable with this and occasionally glad.Words such as “pyjamas” and “shandy”, which you had once studiously avoided or at least camouflaged, now come naturally. Concepts such as daytime naps and celebrating cup final triumphs with an early night and the Sportscene highlights are no longer alien. That Tui survey suggested we’re going at it hammer and tongs in the bedroom. A more representative poll might find that you don’t need to do both at the same time: you can do hammer one week and tongs the next.Nowhere was there any mention of people doing voluntary work, participating in the community or engaging in politics. It suggested that, if you had a lot of money, you could spend your way into contented old age without concerning yourself with the world around you. It was the fulfilment of HG Wells’s prophecy in The Time Machine in which he envisaged a future when the surface of the planet would be populated by a waxen image of humanity, impervious to suffering or emotion.To combat any feelings of stress about the onset of your 50s, I’d suggest real-life coaches. These health and behaviour specialists would be funded from the community health budget and help people who torture themselves with thoughts that all their peers are preening themselves in gyms, downloading YouTube and fornicating like monkeys. It would help combat the modern-day scourge of workplace stress.Room in your life could be made for sustainable monthly Buckfast sessions. These would be held in the local park or a picturesque graveyard, so that participants are getting a decent walk and God’s good fresh air. Non-smokers in later middle age who suffer from anxiety could be encouraged to take up smoking. This would calm them down and they’d be secure in the knowledge that at such an advanced age they’re highly unlikely to croak from the effects of it. I’d also be encouraging gyms to offer non-active memberships. These would allow people to book in and watch other people exercise without feeling guilty about it. It would be good for the soul."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bc6c8a745fc86765931aa808bb07ed9dffdc0e7/10_317_4276_2565/master/4276.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f2a73bce1485175138d9f514cfb2ccf9","title":"where are the uk politicians with principles they would stand down for","story":"In her swansong appearances at the dispatch box, Theresa May is endeavouring to get in touch with her funny side. She recently tried mocking Jeremy Corbyn by quoting Groucho Marx. “Those are my principles, and if you don’t like them... well, I have others.”I expect most of the public take the Groucho view of politicians. In my experience, though, it is not true to say that their principles are endlessly mutable. Rather, what most politicians have is a hierarchy of convictions of varying degrees of flexibility.At the bottom of this hierarchy are the disposable convictions, things that politicians hold true only until they become inconvenient. Then they will be discarded in the pursuit of electoral gain, suppressed in service of party unity or subjugated to career ambition. Boris Johnson is the quintessential contemporary example of a man with many strong convictions, all weakly held.Then there are the higher principles. The things that a politician really does hold dear and will be prepared to self-sacrifice for. In defence of these convictions, they may rebel against the party whip, quit a frontbench job and jeopardise their prospects by infuriating the leader. One dramatic example of that was Robin Cook quitting Tony Blair’s cabinet over the Iraq war. Another was Michael Heseltine resigning from Margaret Thatcher’s cabinet over the Westland affair. They left government on a point of principle, but they remained within their respective parties.At the apex of the hierarchy is the first-order principle, a belief so important to a politician that he or she will even quit their party to uphold their convictions. Opposing racism is – or certainly ought to be – a first-order principle for any member of the Labour party. If the Labour party is about anything, it surely has to be about opposing racism in all its manifestations. And if it can’t be relied on to do that, then it is no longer the Labour party. Three longstanding Labour peers have just quit because they do not believe that Labour can be counted any more as a non-racist party. Lords Darzi, Triesman and Turnberg had thought that it was worth staying within the party to fight antisemitism, but all have now been compelled to the conclusion that the struggle is so hopeless that it is morally indefensible to remain as members. David Triesman, a former party general secretary, says that Labour has become “very plainly institutionally antisemitic” and cannot be cleansed of this poison for so long as Jeremy Corbyn remains leader.Lord Triesman is not alone in that view, further evidence for which was furnished by the Panorama investigation featuring eight whistleblowers, so distressed by what they had seen that some were driven into depression and one into contemplation of suicide. Their testimony was that they were fatally undermined in their attempts to tackle antisemitism by members of the leader’s entourage, who sought to downplay cases of anti-Jewish racism and dilute sanctions against it. To my mind, the aggressively denialist response to Panorama by the leadership was as revealing as the programme itself. Rather than regret what had come to light, apologise deeply and pledge urgent remedial action, Mr Corbyn’s spinners, spokespeople and sock puppets denounced the BBC while trying to trash the former Labour staffers who were the programme’s principal witnesses. As for the shadow cabinet, the kindest description of most of them is cowardly. The bulk of Labour’s senior team has reacted to the antisemitism scandal with dumb silence, as if gagged with non-disclosure agreements. They have not been available to defend the leader and his inner circle nor have they raised their voices to demand action before Labour’s reputation, and by association their own, is irredeemably stained.An exception has been Tom Watson, the deputy leader, who has said that the “harrowing testimony” in the programme is further evidence that “there is a sickness in our party”. He is making a particular issue of the secretive manner in which Mr Corbyn’s team are handling the investigation into anti-Jewish racism within Labour by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. Mr Watson rightly says that it is outrageous that the national executive committee, the party’s governing body, is not being given sight of Labour’s submission to the EHRC. We can grasp why Mr Corbyn and his inner circle are being furtive about its contents. If it contains admissions that the party has developed a grave problem with antisemitism on his watch, that will be damaging. If the submission is an evasive and obfuscatory piece of work, maintaining that there is really nothing much to be troubled about, that will be even more damaging.The vast majority of Labour MPs are disgusted that their party has become a home for antisemites, appalled by the leadership’s failure to deal with it properly, and frightened to say anything. This latest episode highlights the moral dilemma that is going to face them at the next general election, an event that could be upon them as early as this autumn. If they present themselves as Labour candidates at that election, they will have to go on doorsteps and before television cameras to recommend the installation of Mr Corbyn as prime minister and the promotion of his senior aides to some of the most powerful positions in the land. This will not be a bother for the minority of Labour MPs who think he will make an excellent prime minister, and who also maintain that the country will be safe, prosperous and tolerant in the hands of the Labour leader and his entourage. The moral dilemma is for the many more Labour MPs who believe he is absolutely unfit to be prime minister, for an array of reasons, and who further think that his inner cadre should not be allowed anywhere near the levers of power in Number 10.A mirroring moral dilemma will face Tory MPs in the highly likely event of a Boris Johnson premiership. He has said he is prepared to crash Britain out of the EU on Halloween without a deal, a prospect that a significant cohort of Conservative MPs regard as grotesquely irresponsible. This autumn, these Tory MPs may have to choose between permitting a calamity Brexit or voting with the opposition to stop it, even if that means collapsing their own government. How far can their principles be stretched? In some cases, Tory consciences have a lot of elastic in their knickers. Matt Hancock and Amber Rudd, who have previously been eloquently vocal about what a catastrophe a no-deal Brexit would be, are now sounding like people reconciled to the idea, a conversion that may not be entirely unconnected to the expectation that Mr Johnson will be picking the next cabinet. Others have been more consistent. Ken Clarke, the former chancellor, told the Observer recently that he would rather vote on a confidence motion to terminate his own government than allow a crash-out Brexit. Dominic Grieve, the former attorney general, says the same. If it comes to the crunch, they will put conscience and country first. Other Tories have yet to finish wrestling with their principles. Like their Labour counterparts, they are hoping that they will somehow be spared from having to make a choice, that they will not face a moment of truth in the moral crucible. But that test may well come, and very soon.Both Labour and Conservative MPs are confronted with a career- and character-defining question, and it grows sharper by the week. When do they say to themselves that enough is enough? Where is the point when it becomes indefensible to stay within parties that are so abhorrent to their first-order principles? They will have to talk to their consciences, assuming that they can remember where they left them.• Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2093a8d1ea9a4d1d76a85d136eb3d1c698fd0886/0_350_7740_4644/master/7740.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f455145e495adfec172445b2da1afb84","title":"up on the roof pushing cricket to new heights","story":"A lack of space at one east London school didn’t prevent it from putting cricket at the heart of breaktime and giving children the chance to shineCricket matches have been played in some unorthodox locations: 5,730 metres up Kilimanjaro, underwater in Derbyshire’s River Derwent, and among the penguins of Antarctica.So perhaps pitching up on a school roof doesn’t seem so strange after all. When pupils at Hague primary school in Bethnal Green, east London, said they wanted to play cricket, there was a problem – the playground had very little space and no grass at all.“It was like a Victorian yard,” recalls headteacher, Judy Coles. So the school built a rooftop playground, complete with concertinaing cricket nets.Coach Soyfur Rahman was 11 when he arrived in England from Bangladesh 15 years ago. He spoke hardly any English and found the transition a “great shock” at first. He remembers with a smile the joy of playing on the roof. “I loved it,” he says. “I was always trying to hit the ball past the nets and off the roof.”He wasn’t the only one – he remembers that when England cricketers Michael Vaughan and Alastair Cook visited the school they also tried to hit the ball for six. No wonder the school insisted that a soft ball was used!Cricket helped the 11-year-old to integrate. He had played street cricket in Bangladesh and when he started playing the game at his new school he quickly began to learn English. “I was the only Bengali speaker in the team, so that made me learn English quicker,” says Rahman, who is now 26.“Listening to my teammates I started to pick up words. Thanks to cricket, I learned English quicker than other kids from Bangladesh. It also gave me a lot of confidence.”When the staff noticed that Rahman had a special talent, Coles helped him to get involved with local cricket clubs. He also received coaching from Chance to Shine, the charity that aims to give all children the opportunity to play, learn and develop through cricket.Rahman credits his success to the coaching courses run by the charity. “They really help coaches to get better and show us how to get the best out of the kids,” he says. “Whatever support I needed, Chance to Shine provided. Then Middlesex hired me to deliver what I’d learned.”He says the charity’s support of young people is transformative, and helps to put them on the right path. “Rather than hanging round on the street, they can play cricket and take a different direction in their lives,” he says.NatWest has been supporting cricket for almost 40 years. It works with Chance to Shine to help create opportunities such as Rahman’s, and keep programmes like this free of charge – something Rahman says is vital.“Among the south-Asian community here, money is a problem. And if you play club cricket the usual way you have to pay for membership, bats, pads, helmet, gloves, bags and shoes. That’s a lot of money, and would be a barrier for many people. But with Chance to Shine projects you don’t need to spend anything. It’s free. You can just turn up, have a game and go home.”For Coles, unearthing and supporting a talent like Rahman’s is life-affirming. Cricket has been her passion since childhood, when she sat at the boundary and proudly watched her grandfather play.She describes it as “an absolute pleasure” to watch children playing team games and developing their skills. “You get children who start not knowing one end of the bat from another and then become good players,” she says. “They develop such confidence.”She also gets parents involved, to make it a family affair. “None of us have great talent, but we have enthusiasm – and we want children to have fun,” she says.Coles says Chance to Shine is “really good at getting cricket into schools, particularly in the inner cities” and believes the charity’s team are “fantastic ambassadors for the game”.With the charity’s support, some of her pupils were invited to open up the London Stock Exchange with cricket legend Devon Malcolm. They have also been taken to see Test matches at Lord’s and the Oval.The school has built a strong cricket culture and the pupils are enthused by the sport – the girls are particularly passionate about the game. “You see them getting involved at lunchtime,” says Coles. “I’m really proud of that.”Rahman thinks that this summer will be the one where cricket really captures the mood of the nation. “With the work Chance to Shine is doing, and the World Cup and Ashes taking place, I think there will be more interest in cricket than ever before,” he says. “That is really positive.”For almost four decades, NatWest has supported cricket, with a mission to make the game easier for everyone to play and enjoy.A proud partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the charity Chance to Shine, NatWest champions cricket at all levels – from grassroots support for local clubs and getting more people involved in the game to supporting current and future England stars and helping fans cheer on their teams, however and wherever they choose.With NatWest, cricket is a game that has #NoBoundaries.

When tens of thousands of visitors pour into the Scottish capital in August, more than doubling its population, it will appear to be booming.And to the television producers who arrive on the lookout for fresh talent, it will seem in rude health. After all, top names in entertainment, such as Phoebe Waller-Bridge, Tim Minchin, Sara Pascoe, Romesh Ranganathan and Sarah Millican, all earned their chance to reach a mass audience following hit shows on the fringe. Yet fears are building about the festival’s future as a test-bed and showcase for creative talent. “We’re in dire straits now,” said veteran comedy promoter Mel Brown.Her worry? The recent decision of leading Scottish newspapers and magazines to slash their coverage of the festival in half. Coupled with the dwindling size of the annual contingent of London critics, the threat to the ecology of the festival is real.“The falling away of the number of critics who can afford to come up to the festival has a cumulative effect,” Brown added. “It is hard for us to get the word out about shows during the festival without the help of the star ratings given out. These sell the shows to the crowds when there are so many to choose from when we put them on the posters and leaflets. The word of proper, quality reviewers really matters.”Every year the festival (which is really two festivals, an official, international arts one and a vast fringe of amateur and professional shows) gets bigger. This time there will be around 59,000 performances in its 330 or so fringe venues, making it, taken together, the third biggest ticketed gathering in the world, after the World Cup and the Olympics.For some time the fringe festival has been dominated by cabaret and comedy. It provides a conveyor belt of virtuoso creativity, including daring, genre-busting productions like Jerry Springer: The Opera, to be revived in Manchester in August, and dating back beyond the early appearance of Stephen Fry, who shared the first-ever comedy award in 1981 with Emma Thompson and Hugh Laurie. Fry is back this year in the official festival with his show about Greek gods.“The festival is the place where extraordinary talent is found, year after year,” said theatrical impresario Nica Burns, the director of the festival’s prestigious comedy awards, renamed the Daves last week as a new sponsorship deal with the comedy channel was signed. “So it is absolutely vital these shows get the attention they deserve. One of the main reasons we have run the awards for almost 40 year now is to make sure that we have a network of experts seeing the shows and finding the good stuff.”According to one journalist on the Scotsman, the halving of professional critics and reviewers is simply the result of editorial budget cuts. But the economic basis of the festival is also now endangered by the high cost of accommodation in the city and by a political push to regulate the low pay and exploitative practices widespread among fringe venues.One performer who understands the high stakes at Edinburgh better than most is Timandra Harkness, the writer and radio presenter who is returning to live comedy this summer with a show all about risk. Her show, Take A Risk, playfully highlights five categories of human risk – social, financial, physical, emotional and to future health – and she candidly admits that taking her show to the fringe exposes her to all five.“We are all different, but I am most averse to financial risk, so it is strange I am doing this to myself,” Harkness said, adding that her ultimate reward would be having her show picked out for praise by both the critics and the crowds: “I felt my life was getting too safe really, so I wanted to go back to comedy.”Another performer preparing to step out on an empty stage this year is Izzy Mant, an experienced television comedy producer who already knows the value of critical success in Edinburgh. “The fringe has been a fixture on my calendar for decades because it is the best way to take the temperature of the work people are making: it gives you a panoramic view that helps you judge the work. As a producer, I know if someone can still make you laugh when you have a hangover and it is the sixth show of the day, then they must be good.”Mant said there is now greater coverage of music festivals than of arts festivals, so less work for specialist arts critics. “I don’t understand it,” she said. “Especially as comedy is so popular and Edinburgh is now largely associated with comedy, though there is still brilliant theatre as well.” Mant, whose show is called Polite Club, points out that many of the stars she has worked with in television got their start in Edinburgh. “It is Edinburgh that often does it for them, even if they have been working hard on the circuit,” Mant said. “Someone like Roisin Conaty, who I worked with on Channel 4’s GameFace, made a huge splash there first. And it is my experience of the importance of the festival that has made me choose it as the best place to start my move into writing and performing.”Several national newspapers have shed staff critics in the last few years. Comedy and theatre critic Veronica Lee has watched the shrinking band of professional critics who can afford to attend Edinburgh with regret.“Any cutback on covering the best arts festival in the world is a real shame,” Lee said. “There is no shortage of opinion out there, of course. Lots of people post online or review for free, but for two decades now the number of top-level critics has been falling. It seems people are forgetting how important this festival is: it makes around £90m for the city and feeds the beast of television.“Where would comedy shows be without Edinburgh to develop their new talents each year?”The newcomers critics found on the fringe:Aisling Bea (2012)Winner of the So You Think You’re Funny award, she was nominated the following year as best newcomer. “You won’t see many more assured newcomer sets than this,” the  said.Reginald D Hunter (2002)The festival favourite was spotted for the laid-back storytelling that later took him on to Never Mind The Buzzcocks, QI and Have I Got News For You.The Mighty Boosh (1998) Surreal sketch humour from Julian Barratt and Noel Fielding, with Rich Fulcher, saw them soon established as a comedy brand still fondly remembered by fans around the world. Barratt now acts and Fielding is one of the hosts of The Great British Bake Off on Channel 4.Harry Hill (1992)Winner of the first newcomer award, Hill was soon given his own show on Channel 4.

Welcome to Ottawa – Canada’s bustling capitalMondayOttawa’s most notable building is its majestic gothic parliament and it’s one of the landmarks you can take in when exploring the city on foot. Try Ottawa Walking Tours, Ottawa Free Tours, or your own river- and canal-side wanderings on paths around Parliament Hill. For bygone tales of brawling French and Irish gangs, don’t miss the city history on show at the old stone Bytown Museum. Finish the day at ByWard Market, the hub of the city’s most happening central district and one of Canada’s oldest and biggest public markets. Shop the unique stores along the market streets and cobblestone courtyards. You can sip on a locally brewed craft beer and try a gourmet hotdog at Tavern on the Hill, with a spectacular view of Parliament Hill.TuesdayIf the weather’s fair then don’t wait to head to the Gatineau Hills. The Gatineau Park Visitor Centre will help you choose the right hiking trail and is located in the village of Chelsea, where the Nordik Spa-Nature vies with Le Pub Chelsea as the best place to unravel after a day in the hills. Which is better: a view of Ottawa’s twinkling city lights from a hot tub, or a craft brew in a gregarious country tavern? Best do both to check.With both central Ottawa and its most attractive park under your belt, it’s time to explore everything in between. This is best done by bike and RentABike has a good selection of tours and downloadable routes. Key options follow the city’s waterways: the Rideau canal loop connects attractive neighbourhoods such as Little Italy and The Glebe with waterfalls the longer Ottawa River paths provide grand city views.Before you head out, limber up at the free drop-in Parliament Hill yoga session (summer Wednesdays at noon). You’ll be among hundreds, so no need to worry about smooth moves – though PM Justin Trudeau has been known to pop by and greet participants. Try trendy Hintonburg for a delicious meal at Supply and Demand or Bar Laurel.At least one day in Ottawa should be devoted to its terrific national museums – they’re all free on Thursdays 5-8pm, though three hours is rarely enough. With Canada’s National Museums Passport, you can choose admission to any three museums for just $35.Guarded by a giant Louise Bourgeois spider sculpture, the National Gallery of Canada is memorable for its indigenous art. If you like this, then visit the ethnographic collections of the wide-ranging Canadian Museum of History, whose on-site Children’s Museum is in a class of its own for educational interactive play.There’s more education and play, along with painstakingly made dioramas of wildlife habitats, at the Canadian Museum of Nature. For a change of pace, try the Canadian War Museum, whose coverage of Canadian conflicts and military hardware collection is moving and engaging. There’s also the chance to continue your museum visit after hours – on specific Fridays the Canadian Museum of Nature turns the museum into an adult zone, with music and mingling.You could grab a nightcap at Copper Spirits \u0026amp Sights, the rooftop patio of the Andaz Ottawa Byward Market hotel, and watch the sunset.Enjoy Ottawa’s out-of-town attractions before the weekend crowds arrive. Parc Omega is a Canadian safari park with deer, elk, caribou, bison, bears and wolves – you can even feed many of them. There’s more action to be found at the Great Canadian Bungee, where North America’s highest jump (61 metres) and a giant zip-line are located beside a pleasant little beach and picnic spot (for non-thrillseekers). From June to September, you can also get your thrills white-water rafting – try River Run Rafting or Wilderness Tours Packages for organised trips on the Ottawa River. For a more vintage experience, don flying goggles with Ottawa Biplane Adventures, which offers open-cockpit city tours from its base at the Canadian Museum of Space and Aviation, itself a worthwhile aeronautical outing. Back in town you may round the day off with an After Dark Tour, a walking tour that recounts some seedy and grisly history before dropping you at the free Northern Lights show, a must-see nightly laser-light extravaganza at the parliament from early July to early September.Ottawa’s neighbourhoods bustle most on Saturdays. Breakfast on the Golden Triangle’s Elgin Street, visit the home of the city’s LGBT community on Bank Street, have lunch in Chinatown then head to the hipster frontier of Hintonburg to pick up repurposed souvenirs by local artists and craftspeople at Maker House, such as coat hooks made from an old ice hockey stick. It’s also from here that brewery tour operator Brew Donkey strikes out on fun five-hour weekend tours of local craft beer breweries in an old school bus.Sunday is farmers’ market day in Ottawa and the biggest option is the Ottawa Farmers’ Market in the Glebe, a blue-collar-gone-hip neighbourhood where old-school independent shops and restaurants thrive. Don’t miss Kettleman’s, a longstanding 24-hour place where you can watch and smell bagels being baked. The Glebe’s TD Place is where the Redblacks play Canadian football, Ottawa Fury play football (or rather soccer), and the Ottawa 67’s play ice hockey. Between them, there’s at least one fixture most weeks, often on Sundays.

Others had to borrow money from the DfE’s funding arm, throwing into question their long-term viability.Research by the Price Bailey accountancy firm disclosed to the  reveals that 31 out of 40 UTCs with published accounts owe money to the DfE’s education and skills funding agency (ESFA), including 25 schools owing a total of £8.6m after educating fewer pupils than they received funding for through their general annual grant.As a result, UTCs face an uncertain future, despite many being housed in brand-new buildings, including modern science and engineering facilities intended for the surge of pupils who never arrived.“Eight UTCs have already closed and two further closures are imminent, so unless UTCs can boost pupil numbers and performance, more will follow,” said Gary Miller, the head of education at Price Bailey.Wigan UTC is the latest to announce its closure. Parents were told that the decision to shutter the school had been approved by DfE chiefs in June.“The decision to close Wigan UTC has been taken as the UTC is financially unviable. The UTC has been unable to recruit sufficient students to operate without a growing deficit, which will severely hamper the quality of education it can provide moving forward,” the school told parents.Wigan’s closure follows those of Black Country UTC, in Walsall, which attracted just 158 students out of a planned 480, and Burnley UTC, which was expecting 800 students but enrolled only 113 in the three years it was open. Analysis by Schools Week found that £64m was spent on eight UTCs that have closed.The difficulties experienced by UTCs are part of a wider trend of schools having to return overpayments to the ESFA, usually because of lower than expected pupil numbers. In 2016-17, just three academies in England had to return funds to the DfE, but in 2017-18 that figure rose to 50 academies, including UTCs, with nearly £4m returned, according to a freedom of information response.Price Bailey said it had analysed the accounts of 40 of the 50 UTCs operating last year and found that only nine were operating within their budgets, with 31 recording deficits and one or more outstanding debts to the DfE, including 10 owing nearly £4.7m in general loans to cover running costs and three with working capital loans adding up to nearly £1m.Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, said she was concerned that the financial struggles of UTCs were “being hidden in the government’s opaque academies system, with figures concealed from parents and the public”. She said: “Too much money is being wasted on ministers’ vanity projects, and the education system is being fragmented in the process. Labour will end the academy programme and ensure schools are properly accountable, and invest in an integrated education system through our national education service.”As part of Michael Gove’s free schools revolution, UTCs were meant to provide specialist education in science, maths and technology subjects, and attract university and industry backing. But the decision to admit students only from the age of 14 meant that they struggled to compete with secondary schools taking pupils from the age of 12.“The problem with brand-new schools, particularly specialist UTCs, is that they are not tried and tested, which can make parents and pupils wary. Faced with a choice between a new UTC with little or no track record and the local school, which might have served a community for generations, the latter often wins out,” said Miller.A report by the Education Policy Institute (EPI) found that UTC pupils’ GCSE results were almost a grade lower than similar students at mainstream schools, with the most able students doing even worse. The EPI also found that more than half of UTC students left after taking GCSEs.But while many have struggled, UTC Reading has thrived and is now oversubscribed, having been given an outstanding rating by Ofsted in 2015 and boasting partnerships with Microsoft. Others have been less successful, with five rated as inadequate by Ofsted.A DfE spokesperson said UTCs remained a “key part” of its efforts to improve educational standards. “Funding that is provided to set up new university technical colleges is based on estimates of pupil numbers. Once the school or university technical opens, this funding is then adjusted to reflect actual figures and, where necessary, we work with the institutions to recover funding.“The department continues to support UTCs to be educationally successful and financially viable,” the DfE said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/084640158159be8e861712c42b67d814b295a3ea/0_226_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=df34853399f5b1447d5e6790cfe58f87","title":"wealthy parents stoke school divide","story":"Huge sums are raised by PTAs in affluent areas but headteachers in less well-off districts still struggle for fundsElite state schools in England are collecting millions of pounds in donations from parents while schools with poorer pupils struggle to raise any funds at all, a far-reaching Observer investigation shows.England’s 30 most successful parent-teacher associations (PTAs) raised £3.6m for their schools, the study found, while schools with the highest proportion of pupils from low-income families usually do not have a PTA, and those that do raise very little money from parents.As headteachers across the country battle to cope with insufficient budgets and some schools are forced to close early on Fridays, the stark inequalities in education funding, caused by wealthy parents shielding their children’s state schools from the deep cuts that schools with poorer pupils must endure, are revealed in detail for the first time.Labour’s shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said the Observer’s research revealed the shocking extent to which state schools are now relying on private donations to keep them afloat after nine years of Tory cuts.“Once again, it is the most disadvantaged children who are paying the highest price for austerity, with soaring class sizes, fewer staff and teachers, and less dedicated support for the pupils who need it the most,” she said.Jules White, a headteacher and leader of the Worth Less? school funding campaign, called the six- and seven-figure donations some state schools receive “jaw-dropping”. “What we should be doing in state schools is maximising opportunity for every pupil, not creating a system of haves and have nots,” he said. “But because the overall system is so badly underfunded, affluent parents are trying to help, with unfortunate consequences. Funding disparities between different state schools are being exacerbated, putting some children at an even greater disadvantage.”The 30 highest-earning PTAs identified by the Observer are overwhelmingly in the south-east of England. None were in the north, half were in London, with a further nine elsewhere in the south-east. The majority of the schools they support were rated “outstanding” by Ofsted, with the rest rated “good”. Six raised more than £100,000 a year for their schools.An analysis of academy accounts found even more extreme examples of private donations made directly to schools (rather than via PTAs). Some academies received more than £1m in direct donations from philanthropists, parents and corporate donors.Cardinal Vaughan Memorial school, a Catholic boys’ comprehensive in Holland Park, west London, raised £631,770 in unrestricted donations from parents, alumni and other benefactors. The headteacher, Paul Stubbings, said: “Like all state schools at the moment, we have been placed in an impossible position by government funding: we need to contend not only with cuts, but also rising staff costs, including unfunded pay awards, rising national insurance and pension contributions and, of course, inflation. The choice is stark: we have to cut provision or raise funds. At the Vaughan, we have done the latter to ease the former.”The Observer also looked at the 30 mainstream state schools with the highest proportion of pupils eligible for free school meals in England, where two out of three children are from disadvantaged backgrounds. Most were in the north, while just three were in London. Several were rated “inadequate” or “requires improvement”. Just nine said they had an active PTA – more than two-thirds do not even attempt to raise any funds from local families. Of those with PTAs that responded to requests for information, the average annual amount raised was £1,700.A Department for Education spokesman said: “There is more money going into schools than ever before. We know schools face budgeting challenges, which is why we have introduced a wide range of support to help schools reduce costs.“The secretary of state has made clear that as we approach the next spending review, he will back headteachers to have the resources they need to deliver a world-class education in the years ahead.”• To find the highest-earning PTAs, the Observer performed a number of keyword searches on the Charity Commission website to build a database. Special schools and independent schools were excluded. Free school meals and Ofsted data were added for schools supported by PTAs. The Observer also surveyed 30 mainstream schools with the highest proportion of children on free school meals about any PTA income. PTAs, which are unincorporated charities, are not required to register with the Charity Commission unless they earn over £5,000, and the searches will not capture PTAs with non-standard names.Additional reporting by Oleksandr Shevchenko"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b365c5c6ed55238a31e921e85fa3be2af9e0de8d/8_145_5471_3283/master/5471.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5ad819fe135f96aacafe1ab086479c6","title":"living walls bloom cities tackle air pollution","story":"When Andrea Carnevali’s son started at St Mary’s Catholic primary school in Chiswick he was alarmed to find that pupils were sometimes kept indoors at break times, despite a large playground.The reason was the nearby six-lane A4 road, which has up to 100,000 vehicles thundering past the school each day. As evidence mounted about the impact of poor air quality on children’s health, the headteacher restricted time outside.Carnevali and other parents decided to take action. Within months they had crowdfunded almost £100,000, and last month a 126-metre “living wall” of 12,000 plants was installed as part of a clean-air initiative at the school. They hope the wall – designed to trap exhaust particles, absorb sound and increase bioersity – will transform one of London’s most polluted schools into one of its greenest.St Mary’s living wall is one of many being installed around the country by local authorities and private developers. Tennis fans may have noticed two enormous living walls flanking the giant outdoor screen at this year’s Wimbledon championships.And they are increasingly a feature of hotel and retail developments. A stunning vertical garden graces Elephant \u0026amp Castle underground station in south London, part of a plan to improve air quality at one of the capital’s busiest road intersections.In a variation on a theme, “living lamp-posts” were installed this month as a trial in Ebury Street in Belgravia, central London. They will be monitored for air quality improvement for a year if the pilot is successful, it could be extended to some of the other estimated 494,000 lamp-posts in central London.In Hull, the council is considering a proposal to transform Whitefriargate, a historic thoroughfare now blighted by empty shops, with vertical gardens.“Demand is definitely growing. There’s been a steady rise in interest over the past two years, and a noticeable increase since the beginning of this year,” said Calvin Dalrymple, a living wall consultant with ANS Global, one of the country’s leading suppliers, and the creator of St Mary’s living wall.“It’s being mainly driven by local authorities, but also a greater awareness in the private sector of the need for sustainable architecture.” According to Benz Kotzen of the Green Roofs and Living Walls Centre at the University of Greenwich, “we need every tool to try to improve things, and there just isn’t enough capacity in urban environments to create green infrastructure at ground level.“It’s no longer good enough to have a building facade that just keeps out the weather. In the future, building facades will need to be much more functional – cleaning the air, collecting energy and improving bioersity.”Vertical gardens could also be used to grow food, he said, adding that herbs, strawberries, tomatoes and rocket did particularly well.Living walls range from simple wire structures to support climbing plants to sophisticated modular systems, using soil or hydroponic manmade substrate, and solar-powered irrigation. The cost ranges from £200 to £800 per square metre.The main challenge with maintenance was working at height, said Kotzen. “Growing plants vertically is no more difficult than horizontally, but all gardens need maintaining.”Not everyone is a fan of the trend towards vertical gardens. “They’re not a solution, except for the wealthy,” said Mick Crawley, professor of plant ecology at Imperial College London. “There are much cheaper and more effective ways of improving air quality.” Local authorities struggling to pay for essential services would be better advised to plant trees, he said.London’s first living wall, installed in 2005 by Islington council at a children’s centre at a cost of £100,000, withered and died within four years after the irrigation system failed.“Living walls will die if they’re not designed properly and maintained,” said Dalrymple. “There are four key things to longterm sustainability: correct water management, correct substrate, maintenance and plant selection taking into account shade, wind and elevation.”With between 28,000 and 36,000 deaths in the UK each year attributed by Public Health England to long-term exposure to air pollution, living walls are expected to become more common. But the benefits go beyond improvements to air quality.Lucy Dunhill, who is behind the Hull proposal, said: “Visually, Whitefriargate is very depressing, with boarded-up shopfronts and very bad acoustics. Your eyes are not drawn up, you keep your head down when you walk along Whitefriargate.”Her green walls plan will, she hopes, “become an attraction in itself as well as improving the environment”.Andy Wayro, landscape design manager at the All England Lawn Tennis Club in Wimbledon, said its living walls were aesthetically pleasing, had reduced noise and connected people to nature. “The feedback from players and the general public has been really positive,” he said.At St Mary’s in Chiswick, children have been planting a section of the wall with wild strawberries, thyme, rosemary, sage and lavender, using wooden markers to allow them to monitor growth.“The children adore it, and so do the teachers,” said Carnevali. “Apart from any environmental benefits, they say it makes them happier and calmer.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1d4fc6ef864e59358e7078107d3b00d868719474/0_370_5737_3442/master/5737.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9bb1dcbe15bfb874c7b6298df0003c47","title":"the week in wildlife in pictures","story":"This week: Hungary’s insect of 2019, and bluehead wrasse courtship and sex change"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/836dbf0619874db782bbda279883b84a8733f8ab/0_346_5064_3037/master/5064.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7559b663695fec0aee59b4f0f85a414d","title":"nigel slater lamb kofte meatball edamame bean fritters","story":"Meatballs or bean rissoles, heavy on the herbs and with generous amounts of sauce for dipping, make a well-rounded mealI’m making kofte: minced lamb with freckles of fat to keep it juicy, a scattering of za’atar – the blend of ground thyme and oregano – and tiny specks of sesame. That is all. My kofte usually come with cumin, cinnamon and garlic. This recipe’s seasoning is simpler because of its accompanying lentil sauce with sweet, golden onions, coriander and turmeric.The finely minced lamb is easy to shape into balls. You twist off pieces the size of a golf ball and roll them between your palms as if it was cookie dough. Like any fritter, patty or rissole, these will hold their shape better if you chill them for half an hour before you cook them.I cook mine twice: once in sizzling oil to form a glossy crust (if they don’t spit at you, the flame isn’t high enough), then again in a deep, rust-hued pool of sauce in the oven. There is much sauce – enough to make you reach for a spoon or a crust to clean your plate.Bean rissoles are stickier trickier to roll. Dust your palms with flour to stop the mashed beans sticking. You can use boiled and skinned broad beans or crushed tinned haricot but I like the flavour and texture of edamame, which I buy frozen. Whichever beans you use, they will need seasoning with garlic – and herbs such as coriander and chives or, for haricot, finely chopped thyme.In lieu of a sauce I make a sticky dip, glossy with honey and spiked with ginger and lime juice. The green patties are fried till they have a fragile, golden crust then plunged, hot from the pan, into the dip, as bright and shiny as lip gloss.Most frozen edamame is already cooked, ready to beat to a cloud of green mash with olive oil or butter or to scatter in a salad of iced noodles, mint and coriander leaves and matchsticks of cucumber.You could substitute new broad beans for the edamame, but be prepared to pod and skin a lot of beans in order to get 500g. Frozen beans are fine. Cook them in boiling, lightly salted water, then pop them from their pale, papery skins before mashing, seasoning and rolling them.Serves 4For the dipping sauce:honey 2 tbspsoy sauce 2 tbspmirin 1 tbsprice vinegar 1 tbspgrated ginger 1 tbsplime 1groundnut or vegetable oil for shallow fryingDefrost the edamame. Bring a deep saucepan of lightly salted water to the boil. Add the edamame and cook for 15-20 minutes till tender, then drain in a colander. Remove the parsley leaves from their stalks. Roughly chop the chives. Peel the garlic. Transfer the edamame to a food processor, add the parsley leaves, the coriander leaves and stems, the chives and garlic and reduce to a thick purée.Shape the mixture into 16 equally sized balls weighing roughly 40g each, flattening them slightly as you go. Place them on a tray and refrigerate.Make the dipping sauce. Put the honey, soy sauce, mirin, rice vinegar and grated ginger in a small saucepan. Slowly bring to the boil. Remove from the heat. Halve and squeeze the lime and stir the juice into the dipping sauce and set aside.Warm a thin layer of groundnut or vegetable oil in a pan. Place the fritters in the hot oil and fry gently over a moderate heat, for about 4 or 5 minutes, until the undersides are toasted, then turn and cook the other side.Serve hot, with the dipping sauce.Za’atar is the herb mixture I use most often. The soft, khaki-coloured powder, a mix of ground oregano, thyme and sesame, brings a musky warmth to sautéed chicken and grilled lamb, to roasted squashes and steamed grains. The za’atar I have now was brought back from Lebanon and is still redolent of the oregano and wild thyme growing on the hillsides. The mixes available here are fragrant too, but buy them in sealed packets rather than from open sacks where their magic is prone to disappear.Serves 4Peel and finely chop the onion. Warm 4 tbsp of the oil in an ovenproof shallow pan, add the onions and cook over a low heat for about 20 minutes until they are soft. Peel the garlic, finely crush and stir into the softening onion.Put the lamb into a mixing bowl, add the za’atar and shape into 8 balls. Place the balls on a tray and refrigerate for 30 minutes.Meanwhile, stir the ground cumin, coriander and turmeric into the onions and cook over a low heat for 5 minutes. Pour in the stock, bring to the boil, then stir in the lentils and turn the heat down to a simmer and leave for 20 minutes. Set the oven at 200Cgas mark 6.Warm the remaining oil in a frying pan, add the lamb balls and let them fry till the underside is golden. Roll the balls over and let them sizzle till golden, then lift them out and lower them into the lentil sauce. Bake the lamb and lentils for 25 minutes, then stir in a little fresh coriander and serve."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a96d9d4212a9fe18cbbd11ac12994291b381239b/0_1282_8921_5354/master/8921.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00dfbe122dc1c69b8550adb6c858a70c","title":"interiors vintage second hand furniture recovered furniture","story":"The owners’ love of vintage shopping and revitalising furniture with bold prints gives this house its characterIn theory, I like the idea of living in a sleek minimalist box,” says Ruthie Hudson. “But in reality, I’m too sentimental. I like collecting ‘stuff’, especially things that feel as if they have a back story.” With second-hand furniture, artists’ prints and end-of-line fabrics, her 1930s house in Stamford, Lincolnshire, might be short on echoey white spaces, but it’s got plenty of personality.Ruthie, her husband Michael and their sons Jasper, seven, and Felix, five, live in a house that was originally built as accommodation for a police officer. It hadn’t been lived in for many years, but instead had been used as an overflow storage space for the police station a few doors down. “The rooms were full of recovered stolen bikes,” Ruthie says. “And I don’t mean just one or two – there were about 50, all in different shapes and sizes.”Weeds and plants had taken root in the window frames and the garden was so overgrown they couldn’t see where it ended. That abundance of space out the back was a bonus, as it meant that over the next few years they could extend the original two-up, two-down house, adding a larger kitchen, a garden room and two bedrooms.The newest addition is the garden room, a space that was inspired by a 1969 photograph of David Hockney and Sir Cecil Beaton, taken in Beaton’s conservatory at Reddish House. “Ever since I saw that image of the two men surrounded by plants in a room with an elegant black and white tiled floor I’d thought, ‘I’d love to sit in a space like that,’” Ruthie says.In her version, leafy fronds drape down from shelves, but in lieu of Beaton’s mass of pink geraniums, Ruthie opted for a flowing floral wallpaper. “Some patterns look lovely as a small sample, but when you get them on the wall the repeat can look too orderly. This one feels more natural, as if there’s no beginning and no end.”Ruthie has furnished this room with an old cabinet that she painted dark green and a vintage French table, a baby version of one in the kitchen. “Both tables came from Newark antiques fair, but bought 10 years apart,” says Ruthie. She found the larger one first, at a time when she was buying and selling vintage and mid-century furniture for a living.“When we were furnishing our first house I kept finding really beautiful pieces of old furniture and couldn’t resist buying a few extras, which I put in the garage,” she says. She began doing this when mid-century sideboards were having a moment and Stamford, Peterborough and the surrounding areas proved to be a rich – and cheap – hunting ground. “I shopped at vintage fairs, auctions and charity shops and prices were far better than in other parts of the country,” Ruthie says.Some of her best finds have been at auctions, both in Stamford and at more ramshackle barns out in the countryside. “You tend to get better things when you’re there in person, rather than bidding over the phone or online,” Ruthie says. “And there’s something about the buzz of being there that’s great. Well, once your lots come up. In between, there’s lots of just waiting, often in the cold…”Ruthie progressed from selling to friends to taking pitches at pop-up fairs. “It coincided with people we knew getting their first homes and wanting to furnish them stylishly but without spending loads of money,” she adds.But some items never made it on to her stall. “There were a fair few things that I put in our house to photograph in order to sell them, but liked them so much that I kept them. It wasn’t exactly a ruthless business plan,” she says.A stall in Stamford market has also been a good source of fabrics, which Ruthie has used to re-cover old furniture. “Almost all our chairs, the footstool and a sofa have been given new life with end-of-roll materials I’ve bought there,” she says.Other fabrics came via Ruthie’s first job.

I think ‘trail’ would be more accurate, but it doesn’t sound so of-the-moment. We used to call them cross-bikes or even x-bikes. But, essentially, they are all the same thing. They are road bikes with off-road capabilities. Wheels are bigger, frames are more durable, brakes are beefed up and some have suspension. The upshot of all this is that you get a go-anywhere bike that lets you ride fast on smooth tarmac before heading confidently into terrain that most bikes would soon be rattled to pieces on. Cannondale has come a long way since it first got down to business in 1971 in Connecticut in a loft above an old pickle factory. Its initial product was a bike trailer known as the ‘Bugger’. The first bike, a touring model, wasn’t produced until 1983, but since then it’s gone on to create bikes that have won the world’s greatest races – including the Giro and Vuelta. The new Topstone features a lightweight suspension system that lets you ride harder when the riding gets hard. It’s strong, comfortable and will cope with anything.Give your furry friend the best view in town in this chic denim dog bike basket.

I was 24, and I’d recently started a job as a national correspondent for a big newspaper. The assignment came with professional trappings and freedoms I’d never had before: a stylish office in a downtown skyscraper, a full-time research assistant, a travel budget that never seemed to run dry.It was a man who put me up to calling a house cleaner. I’d made the mistake of mentioning that I had to clean my house. He laughed. “Why are you doing your own cleaning? Hire somebody.”“I don’t do that,” I said. His next words stuck in my brain forever. “Your time is worth money, you know. It’s worth more money than you’re going to pay somebody to clean your house.” Your time is worth money. This is a common platitude, but nobody had ever applied it to me and, hearing it, I was electrified. The jobs I’d worked since adolescence – barista, grocery clerk, farm worker – had taught the opposite lesson: that my time was only worth what I could earn with physical labour. I badly wanted to believe it was true, that my journalistic efforts had been enough to carry me across that invisible borderline separating the hirees from the hirers. And so I called a housekeeping agency and booked a cleaner.The experience was demoralising. Her car shuddered to the curb. Her skinny shoulders slumped. She hardly looked at me. Everything about the sullen, middle-aged woman who lugged her bucket and scrubbing brushes into my living room seemed to speak – no, scream – of a downtrodden existence. She cleaned the house meticulously and then I paid her and she went away, leaving me to pace my shining floors in muddled shame and confusion. That night I went to a party and explained my funk to a writer who was a kind of mentor. Her response was immediate and visceral: I should not feel guilty. It was imperative that I not feel guilty. “I don’t know how your family came to this country, but mine came here and cleaned houses to survive,” she said. “It’s decent work and there’s no reason to feel bad about it.”That was all I needed to hear. From that moment, the two pillars of justification were firmly fixed in my mind: my time was valuable enough that I should spend money to protect it, and there was no stigma around housework – and therefore no harm in getting someone else to do it. I leaned on these two ideas all through my single life and on into marriage, as I moved around the world and hired various people to clean my house while I roamed around writing news stories. I didn’t feel guilty and everything worked fine – right up until the babies came.My husband and I were living in China when, pregnant with my first child, I quit my job to write a book at home. This sounded easy – even idyllic – until I was slapped with the messy, sleep-deprived reality of life with a newborn. The baby was colicky. My husband’s job kept him on the road more often than not. I needed help, but there were no relatives down the road or lifelong friends within reach. There were no day care centres or teenage babysitters. Instead, there were migrant female workers whose full-time salaries were less expensive than day care back in the US. It was a no-brainer.Determined that motherhood wouldn’t put a stop to my work, I hired a young woman called Xiao Li to clean and cook and babysit. What did I know about Xiao Li when she first walked through the door? Practically nothing, and that was fine with me. I knew she had a husband and an apartment somewhere. I knew her daughter had been entrusted to the care of grandparents. In the beginning, I didn’t ask many questions. As an exhausted and overwhelmed new mother, I had problems of my own. Every day I wondered two things: whether I was about to have a nervous breakdown, and whether I had permanently undone my life as a writer. I saw Xiao Li as my best hope for salvation, and so naturally I wanted to believe that she had no problems of her own.Xiao Li took the bus across the city every day, carrying lunch in plastic boxes and hot water in a thermos. At noon she scarfed her food on a straight-backed wooden chair we’d shoved between the counter and the inlaid microwave in our tiny kitchen. Then she’d bend her neck into an improbable twist, rest her cheek on the countertop and fall asleep. The first time, I woke her up and tried to convince her to lie down on the couch or the guest bed. She blinked and blushed, but stayed put. In those early weeks, I didn’t dwell on the unsettling knowledge that a small girl had been left in a village because Xiao Li couldn’t afford childcare. I made no effort to discover whether Xiao Li’s lifestyle – the migration to Beijing, the job in my house – was a grand adventure or a heartbreaking drudgery, or some combination. I had the vague idea that my silence was magnanimous. I told myself that, by not prying, I was sparing her embarrassment. But I think I always knew, on some sublimated level, that I was really sparing myself.As months went by my fondness for Xiao Li grew into a dependence. I trusted her. The baby loved her. Her presence in the house made me feel steady.But her circumstances were always fragile. Her daughter was hospitalised with heart problems and Xiao Li got pregnant, missing countless days of work. Even when she came, she was sick and exhausted. I was forced to stop writing and accept that my circumstances were tangled up with Xiao Li’s life – when she couldn’t work, nor could I.Xiao Li stopped working in deference to her advancing pregnancy. Another woman took her place. Then I got pregnant again. We left China and moved to India. I drafted one book and started another. Life moved, children grew. The women were there, too, not part of our family but participating nonetheless in the rise and fall of domestic life in private rooms. Solving problems and causing them affecting and being affected.There was Mary, who was younger than me but had survived several lifetimes – an orphan raised by nuns a widowed mother who’d never had the chance to live with her children a migrant from the Himalayas who couldn’t trace her exact origins and seemed to know everyone in Delhi. Pooja, one of the best cooks I’ve ever known, who taught us about Hindu mythology and Bollywood cinema and how to treat eye ailments by staring at the colour green.These women brought cleanliness, order and home-cooked meals. They had superstitions and home remedies and nursery rhymes in languages I couldn’t speak. They were marked by a gritty optimism that I hoped would rub off on our kids. Mostly they brought love, which they lavished on our children – love dammed and redirected love they might have spent on their own babies. Love we rented away.They brought sinister burdens, too: typhoid and alcoholism and con artists. “Husbands” turned out to be boyfriends and later revealed wives stashed elsewhere. There were men who raged and beat and exploited who disappeared without a word. Our house was an enclosed landscape of working mothers. The women working for us had traded time with their children in exchange for the money needed to keep them out of poverty. As for my husband and me, we were buying back our time.This was a universal story, and I started to write about the complex lacings that bound us together. That meant reporting on my own household and documenting the truths I’d once tried not to think about. I’d turned my house into a job site where we all arranged and rearranged our time and money to protect ourselves and our children. We failed all the time, but kept fumbling along – a strange choreography repeated in households all over the world, unexamined and poorly understood. It’s relegated to invisibility, therefore ripe for exploitation. It seems to me that wilful ignorance is a defining feature of our time. But when you employ a domestic worker, you bring a slice of inequality into your kitchen.I uncovered hard realities: poverty and shame more extreme than I’d realised the unsolvable heartache of leaving children secrets of mistreatment. There was dignity and joy, and all the other layers of complication and contradiction that weave their way through every biography. I didn’t come up with an indictment against or a justification for hiring domestic workers, nor was I seeking a neat political conclusion. It was the full, messy truth I was after. I wanted to know the stories of my house the outcome of the money I’d paid the nature of the work that made my own possible. To stop and collect the stories – this seemed the very least we could do.

Back then, Radiohead – the band for whom he still acts as frontman – released a song called Lotus Flower from their eighth album, The King of Limbs.That album title, you suspect now, refers not just to a tree, but to Yorke’s own arms and legs. The song’s accompanying video was widely praised, and much remixed, for the fact that Yorke – a slight white Englishman in his 40s – was dancing like no one was watching to some high-concept choreography. It confirmed Yorke as a maker of music for bodies, not just for brains. He seemed, emphatically, like a guy who does yoga.Radiohead made their reputation as a cerebral outfit, first as a rock band, and later as a digitally enhanced avant garde remix of a rock band. Yorke’s voice has been a frequently elliptical one. But tonight in Paris, Yorke the dancer is unchained once again, pacing the stage, making eye contact, frequently enacting his music’s organic metamorphoses with elegant convulsions, or its lyrics with a wave here, a gesture there.He is joined on stage by producer Nigel Godrich on keys, bass, guitar and atmospheres, and visual artist Tarik Barri, who live-mixes abstract projections. There are ink blots in milk, mechanised amoebas, iron filing mountains collapsing, and bars of neon colour that gently suggest In Rainbows, the Radiohead album of 2007. We are in a would-be rave, of sorts, in a spectacular modernist concert hall aptly named after Pierre Boulez, the avant garde French composer who, in the second half of his career, experimented with electronic music.Just two weeks ago, Yorke released his third solo album, Anima (his fourth, if you’re counting 2013’s Amok by Atoms for Peace, a non-Radiohead outing with Flea and Joey Waronker). Anima’s release was accompanied by a three-song Netflix “one-reeler” directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, in which Yorke’s commitment to dance was made even more blatant.Somewhere between an extended music video and a performance piece, the film stars Yorke as a sleepy commuter alongside similarly attired workers. The initial sequence, in which Yorke and the corps try to stop themselves nodding off, is a thing of wonder – choreography brilliantly transposed from real-life movements. Even better, the film’s principal dystopian vision is undercut by more physical comedy and emotional intimacy than you might expect from the often lugubrious Yorke: another sequence finds Yorke and his real-life partner, the Italian actor Dajana Roncione, vertically rolling over one another, touching foreheads.Only when Yorke is dancing, you suspect, can he feel this free. Tonight, during Not the News – one of eight tracks Yorke plays from Anima – Yorke goes through the “slap myself awake” movements to a huge cheer. At other times, he waves distantly, notably during Nose Grows Some from Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes – the 2014 album from which this ongoing fits-and-starts tour takes its name (it began in 2017). Yorke shakes like a leaf, bounds from console to console, looping his own keening. He seems, within the context of his anxious, racked music, very happy.It is not difficult to love Yorke. He is the Old Testament prophet of British music, a man who turned his back on the prospect of conventional ubiquity after Radiohead’s OK Computer, performing a left-field handbrake turn instead. Kid A introduced great swaths of the rock audience to open-ended digital music. Yorke has never looked back, exploring textures and dynamics derived from club culture, alongside glitchy digitals and dubstep bass frequencies over the course of a 15-year parallel solo career.The 2015 breakup of his 23-year relationship to Rachel Owen made Yorke seem more like an ordinary mortal than previously her death in 2018 will have added a deeper resonance to Yorke’s already emotionally intelligent music. In a recent interview, however, Yorke railed against obvious biographical interpretations of his work. Even unanchored from biography, Anima’s standout ballad, Dawn Chorus, is spectacularly moving, with Yorke reckoning with time past. The song itself has been knocking around as an unfinished bootleg for a while it lent its name to the company Radiohead set up in 2015 in the run-up to the release of A Moon Shaped Pool (2016).Tonight, the set list rightly focuses on Anima, which takes its name from the Italian for soul, but also for the Jungian concept of femininity within the masculine more generally, it is concerned with sleep and dream states. “I must be asleep,” sings Yorke on the icy, minimal house-inflected (Ladies \u0026amp Gentlemen, Thank You for Coming).But Yorke is an artist well aware of external realities. In all his incarnations, he has been perpetually alert to misdeeds by the powerful and the impending climate apocalypse. Recently, when blackmailed by a leaker, Radiohead donated the proceeds of hours of OK Computer outtakes to Extinction Rebellion.His solo song Harrowdown Hill, off 2006’s The Eraser, comes early on tonight, in an unsettling funk-adjacent version. It serves as a reminder that the parlous state of politics wasn’t actually that much better back then, when the apparent suicide of the scientist Dr David Kelly (who found that Iraq was not manufacturing weapons of mass destruction) inspired one of Yorke’s clearest songs.But the dream state prevails tonight. If there’s an enduring criticism of Yorke’s flag-bearing for the digital sphere, it is that his music tends to avoid resolution: there are smears over washes, wailing looped over atmospheres, sometimes to little obvious purpose. You’re often hard-pressed to spot the development of a motif, because a number of ideas just sit alongside each other, not really interacting. So whenever something pierces the wishy-washy fug, you want to cheer: Default, by Atoms for Peace, features both earwax-loosening bass and dynamism.Although the set never satisfyingly erupts into out-and-out rave dynamics, one of the peaks finds Yorke and Godrich deploying sub-bass wub-wubs and cascades of digital percussion. The punishing sonics of Traffic, a recent song off Anima, turn into the strobing finale of the same album’s Twist. There are points, too, where you can detect an echo of a house piano, or the palest impression of soul. Unexpectedly, Runwayaway recalls the constituent parts of Donna Summer’s I Feel Love with Godrich’s bubbling amniotic atmospheres redolent of Giorgio Moroder’s famous bassline.A bard for our anxious times, Yorke has talked about his own troublesome internal weather and it seems likely that succour, for him, lies within the body, in movement.On Suspirium, the final song of two encores, from the film score of the same name, one lyric stands out. “This is a waltz,” Yorke sings, “Thinking about our bodies What they mean for our salvation.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/79eb613e06025decb7fa01a38810705b598e2b08/0_637_3994_2395/master/3994.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47b57823b8cc19764ad0f7dcfa4f4e43","title":"banks iii review","story":"Jillian Rose Banks has spent the past six years making fascinating, sedated songs that vacillate between trap-pop and R\u0026ampB. Now, with music’s dominant sound moving in her direction, the Los Angeles-based singer-songwriter’s third and most impressive album yet only lacks the helicopter hit that would lift her to a higher level of stardom.As with all the best sets, it’s coherent but not repetitive, the ghostly Auto-Tune choir, which features on most tracks, sighing and whispering encouragement behind Banks’s increasingly empowered words. There are shades of Bon Iver and Billie Eilish in her layered, subtle sound, but also a rare, steely delicacy all her own. The fairly anodyne Sawzall reminds you that without the protective cloak of clever production, Banks’s voice can get a little chilly. Elsewhere, though, warmth floods the smudgy grooves. There are many moments worth cherishing, among them the hyperventilating harmonies on Stroke that give way first to gentle dubstep then chillwave funk, and the swooning digital sighs of Hawaiian Mazes. Bank’s last album began with the introspective Fuck With Myself it’s fitting that III’s lead single is the liberating, confident Gimme."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ab91bd2558f894d2d4188fcd8cd1410bc4384f03/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c29a29a2ca771a650f53b83ed592de24","title":"stop and search is ineffective so why is it on the rise podcast","story":"The first stop and search Jamal ever experienced was when he was 11 years old.

There was not a spare seat to be found as Eoin Morgan and Kane Williamson addressed the world’s media, both captains calm yet excited. Both sides lauded the qualities of their opponents. Morgan acknowledged the influence of Brendon McCullum, one of his best friends, in England’s resurgence. Given McCullum was also Williamson’s predecessor as Kiwi captain he is in the happy position of being able to claim some responsibility whichever side prevails, though he is too much of a gentleman to do that.Given the Kiwi press corps would struggle to fill a minibus, here was a reminder that cricket’s greatest global event was about to take place. Yet all was serenity out in the middle, at least until the crucial advertising mats were being meticulously pinned down 30 yards beyond the stumps.As ever the outfield resembles a massive putting green, albeit a tricky one given the slope. On Sunday the ball will slide across what always appears to be frictionless grass at a remarkable pace. The pitch looked surprisingly green from a distance though Morgan said that the covering of grass was sparser when viewed from close quarters.Even so, whichever captain wins the toss may have pause for thought.

The side batting first in the four games here in this tournament has won every time.Only one batsman, Albert Trott back in 1899, has launched a cricket ball over the pavilion at Lord’s, but Jason Roy has his sights set on joining him after escaping a ban for today’s World Cup final against New Zealand.It\u0027s a fanciful notion, but Roy’s response when this feat was put to him – \u0027Oh really? Let’s try to get an opportunity tomorrow\u0027 – was in keeping with the relaxed mood as England prepared for the game of their lives.Having struck three successive sixes twice in this tournament – including an effort off Steve Smith that found the Edgbaston\u0026nbsppavilion’s upper tier – Roy is probably as equipped as any to repeat Trott’s blow.But the incendiary opener, averaging 71 in the campaign, nearly missed out on the final following a significant show of dissent towards the umpire during the win over Australia. Roy has apologised to the umpire,\u0026nbspKumar Dharmasena, and was fined.\u0027To get out like that was slightly disappointing, and I probably showed it more than I should have,\u0027 Roy said. \u0027But\u0026nbspit’s\u0026nbspprofessional sport\u0026nbspand emotions run high.\u0027 Ali MartinHopefully the quality of the best team will decide the outcome. Most certainly a new team will win the trophy. After 12 tournaments West Indies, India, Australia, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have won the World Cup. This will be England’s fourth time in the final. In 1979, against West Indies, they fell 92 runs short despite an opening partnership of 129 between Mike Brearley and Geoff Boycott. The problem was they took so many overs to get there.After Brearley’s dismissal, the first in the innings, England scored another 65 runs. I have been trying to think of a parallel between Brearley and Boycott and Jonny Bairstow and Jason Roy, who are opening the batting 40 years later – and I have failed.In 1987, England were closer to the trophy, losing to Australia by seven runs in Kolkata in a match always signposted by Mike Gatting’s unsuccessful reverse sweep to Allan Border’s first delivery.In 1992, in Melbourne, England controlled much of the final against Imran Khan’s cornered tigers but the irresistible combination of Wasim Akram and Mushtaq Ahmed saw them off when they were 22 runs short of their target. Thereafter, England have consigned themselves to the wasteland after a sequence of hapless campaigns – until now.New Zealand will have five players who appeared in their nation’s one and only final four years ago against Australia in Melbourne: Williamson, Ross Taylor, Martin Guptill, Trent Boult and Matt Henry.In that World Cup under the leadership of McCullum, New Zealand were fearless and refreshing and, as far as Australia’s wicketkeeper, Brad Haddin, was concerned, much too nice. The Kiwis captured the imagination of their nation but upon crossing the Tasman for the final they were swept away by Australia.Perhaps that experience will help them. Even so, New Zealand enter this match as the underdogs. It might suit them if the grass stays on the surface and their bowlers spy some encouragement. They have prospered in low-scoring matches in this tournament, which may also explain why so few of their batsmen are in mid-summer form.Williamson has stapled their batting together quite brilliantly in his understated way. He has been dismissed once under 40 and that was when he was run out for 27 at the bowler’s end at Chester-le-Street via Mark Wood’s fingertips. He has not devastated but he has not needed to he has batted at an old-fashioned tempo as his side compiled old fashioned scores that have often been sufficient to win the game.His main ally has been the veteran Ross Taylor. The disappointment has been Martin Guptill, who has tormented England in the past, though he has done his best to atone by a serious of brilliant manoeuvres in the field.Williamson’s bowlers have been more helpful. His banker is Trent Boult on a ground where left-arm pacemen – such as Mitchell Starc and Jason Behrendorff – have enjoyed themselves recently against England. Lockie Ferguson has been one of the more unexpected stars in a tournament where few new names have barged in to the cricketing firmament. Matt Henry and Jimmy Neesham have provided handy support along with the stately Colin de Grandhomme, whose batting has been more threatening than his bowling.England are fortified by the fact that they have won three do-or-die matches on the way to the final. All of their batsmen have made runs along the way. Recently, they have not been required to do much because of the excellence of the Bairstow and Roy, who have struck four century partnerships in a row.Morgan has even been spared selectorial dilemmas. He has used 13 players in the tournament and there will be no change at Lord’s. He has picked the same team in the past three games and he is likely to stick with that combination. Chris Woakes and Adil Rashid have become more confident about their bowling and their bodies.There are logical reasons for English supporters to be optimistic. No doubt the same was true among West Indian fans in 1983 and Australian ones in Lahore in 1996 when India and Sri Lanka were victorious against the odds. Take nothing for granted. After all, this is a World Cup final."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afe1261bc72f3ee3c76b7b79e645d3989307fab0/143_135_4325_2595/master/4325.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=51f455e1a3169a8e2eef46ae49ff029a","title":"ryan moore aidan obrien ten sovereigns july cup newmarket","story":"The bookmakers have spent the past few weeks dodging Frankie Dettori’s mounts whenever possible. On Saturday, they ran into Ryan Moore instead. Ten Sovereigns, Moore’s ride from the three Aidan O’Brien-trained runners in the Group One July Cup, was a 10-1 chance in the morning, the 3-1 clear favourite by lunchtime and a 9-2 shot at the off, when he quickly grabbed a lead he never looked likely to surrender.This was a hugely significant and lucrative success for O’Brien and the Coolmore Stud operation that backs his stable, not so much for the £280,000 first prize as it was for the huge boost to the stud value of Ten Sovereigns. Last season, he was an unbeaten, Group One-winning two-year-old. His second campaign, though, had delivered defeats in two starts at Newmarket and Ascot before this emphatic success.Advertise, who beat Ten Sovereigns with something to spare in the Commonwealth Cup at Royal Ascot, was the only runner to launch himself out of the chasing pack but Dettori’s urgings could carry him no closer than two and a half lengths adrift of the easy winner.Listening to O’Brien in the winner’s enclosure, it was difficult to believe that Ten Sovereigns had sat almost friendless in the betting at a double-figure price for 24 hours after the final declarations. “His works and times were unbelievable,” he said. “His last piece of work, he broke 11 seconds every furlong for four furlongs, so for a horse to be doing that, it’s very, very quick.While Advertise and Dettori set off as the favourites, the early gamble on Ten Sovereigns left a big dent in the bookies’ profits on the busiest day of Flat racing’s summer. “Turnover on the day was grand, but the July Cup result was a shocker,” Paul Binfield of Paddy Power said. “We laid Ten Sovereigns all day from the word go.”A successful afternoon for the King Power Racing operation, founded by the late Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, turned sour in a single stride at Ascot as Beat The Bank, one of the first horses to carry their blue and white colours, broke down shortly after winning the Summer Mile Stakes.Silvestre de Sousa, King Power’s retained jockey, pulled up Beat The Bank immediately but he was found to have suffered an injury to his hind pastern and could not be saved.The same colours had earlier come home in front in the Superlative Stakes at Newmarket and the John Smith’s Diamond Jubilee Cup at York, one of the season’s most valuable handicaps. Mystery Power was a convincing winner on the July course as King’s Command, the favourite, finished last of eight while Pivoine, at 14-1, held off Setting Sail on the Knavesmire to secure the £125,000 first prize."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/354f735321ae1f844e8f6cd16d17fcc9116929e3/173_252_3177_1906/master/3177.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5cd356f753d30314d3011784663a41e9","title":"england new zealand cricket world cup final lords","story":"The Black Caps were once the inspiration, now they are the last obstacle standing between a daring England and the World CupAs it was in the beginning, so shall it be in the end. Four years on from the start of English cricket’s great white‑ball paradigm shift, Eoin Morgan’s band of buccaneers return to Lord’s on Sunday for the World Cup final. In the process they find themselves facing the most poignant of opposition.Through that period of revamp and clearing out it is New Zealand who have been a significant constant for this new model England. First as an inspiration, then as a yardstick of progress and now as the final obstacle in the path of this brilliantly planned and executed sporting project.Four years ago it was New Zealand who induced what future white-ball historians might refer to as The Event, that moment of rock-bottom introspection born of a pitiless thrashing in Wellington at the last World Cup.Tim Southee took seven wickets that day as Morgan’s side staggered to 123 all out, the definitive expression of the white ball as a source of apparently irresolvable agony for a generation of England batsmen. In reply, Brendon McCullum came out and swung with gleeful, murderous intent. New Zealand won with 226 balls to spare. James Anderson, Stuart Broad and Steven Finn went for 113 in nine overs. The clock seemed to have stopped.Morgan’s captaincy was almost broken by Wellington. He was sustained, in part, by his close friendship with McCullum, a one‑man model for high-rev white‑ball cricket. At the end of a craven tournament Morgan and the new interim coach, Paul Farbrace, made a decision: England would chuck out everything. They would become something else. Four months later, it was New Zealand again at Trent Bridge as England fielded seven new players and blazed their way to 408. The new age of Eoin and Brendon, the age of the ruthlessly executed white-ball plan, was born.Four years on, England faced new Zealand again at Chester-le-Street with their World Cup one defeat away from collapse. They pressed the throttle. Southee, the hammer of Wellington, was smashed for 70 in nine overs. And now we have this: New Zealand again the opponents as England look to enter Avalon, Agincourt, the Field of Cloth of Gold, the dawning of the age of ... well, what exactly?That four-year transformation of tone, texture, method and, indeed, results has been a product of will and personality as much as any great change in the wider system. England have won 65 and lost 26 ODIs since Wellington, compared with 42 won and 42 lost in the previous four years. But the change has been more than results. It goes to the basic idea of how it should feel to play the game.There are certain well-worn themes to any examination of how England got from there to here. Words such as mindset and attitude are used so often they tend to become dead sporting cliches. But England’s long and troubled history of batting against the white ball spoke to exactly this, to that cloud of doubt, a fear not just of failure but of playing in a way that transgresses against the old cobwebbed imperial tone of cricket in England of straight bats and high elbows. The sanctity of the batsman’s wicket.Only one batsman, Albert Trott back in 1899, has launched a cricket ball over the pavilion at Lord’s, but Jason Roy has his sights set on joining him after escaping a ban for today’s World Cup final against New Zealand.It\u0027s a fanciful notion, but Roy’s response when this feat was put to him – \u0027Oh really? Let’s try to get an opportunity tomorrow\u0027 – was in keeping with the relaxed mood as England prepared for the game of their lives.Having struck three successive sixes twice in this tournament – including an effort off Steve Smith that found the Edgbaston\u0026nbsppavilion’s upper tier – Roy is probably as equipped as any to repeat Trott’s blow.But the incendiary opener, averaging 71 in the campaign, nearly missed out on the final following a significant show of dissent towards the umpire during the win over Australia.

It has been a feat of will to cast it aside. Even in the defeat of Australia on Thursday, with England sprinting to the line, it was notable that Morgan batted with restless urgency, still hitting and swiping and carving to the end. This is an act of defiance not just against opposition bowlers, but the past.The creation of a club atmosphere and the cutting back of the player pool have also been key. After Wellington, Morgan decided he needed certain nonnegotiable elements in his team. England would choose their most talented hitters – and not in the old patronising, bits and pieces mode, but those with the explosive skill to hit the best bowlers in the world through and over the field. This might seem obvious. The previous 25 years suggest otherwise.Morgan wanted a leg-spinner, quick bowlers and destructive batting right down the order. England were lucky here. Creating a supportive atmosphere is all very well. But the players have also got to be good enough, and Morgan, Farbrace and Trevor Bayliss have shown forensic skill in identifying the right bodies for those roles. They also stuck with them. Winning teams create stability. Stability creates winning teams. Either way, England have given an ODI debut to 10 players in the past three years. Most were necessary fill-ins. Only Jofra Archer of those 10 is in the team now. In the three years before that, 18 new players were capped. Between 2003 and 2006 England reeled in 25 new ODI players.Watching this it has been easy to portray Bayliss as little more than a floppy hat, a pair of glasses and a slightly puzzled expression. But creating the sense of freedom in the batting order has been a masterful feat of light touch control.And there is also a flexibility. England came to this World Cup hoping to blast their way to victory. They found a set of pitches that demanded something else, an ability to win other ways. The pace bowlers, led by Archer, have stepped up.There is a legitimate question about where this all leads. Four thrilling years in the making, there is still something temporary about this England team, a group of cricketers who play like there will be no more World Cups, just this one, and for whom this is invariably the case. Two months from now the coach will be gone. Only Archer in the current first XI is younger than 28. The captain is 33. The absence of an even vaguely comparable fill-in at the top of the order when Jason Roy was injured demonstrated the huge gulf between this top tier of players and what lies outside the elite system.Taking players away from the domestic game, encouraging them to play franchise and international cricket, has been key to getting the most out of them. This success has nothing to do with any system beneath. It is a feat of elite talent management, taking the very top and throwing care and resources at it, with shades of the way Team GB’s Olympians dish up their own four‑yearly gold rush.There is no obvious pathway from here. It is instead the culmination of something. Four years on from Wellington England have been geared with a fearless sense of certainty towards Sunday, Lord’s and a final meeting with those familiar Black Caps. Victory really is everything now."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bbbd041a28c982f1691f45a7a400649926f55774/0_262_5229_3137/master/5229.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c51bf67eae1b3c3854db889e2558bc61","title":"life of pi review crucible sheffield lolita chakrabarti","story":"Everything about this production is amazing, extraordinary: the play of lights and colours that suggest a zoo in India the puppeteers who bring to vivid, visceral (sometimes vicious) life its animals the projections that turn a backdrop into a ship and a bare stage into an ocean - now calm, now stormy. All of this is achieved in full view of the audience with almost no trickery (Pi’s disappearing e into the waters is an astonishing exception).In Lolita Chakrabarti’s brilliantly dramatic adaptation, the staging itself embodies the key question at the heart of Yann Martel’s Booker prize-winning novel: what is believable? Even as we see the illusions created, we accept their reality in the story.Chakrabarti sets Pi’s experiences as a series of flashbacks told from a hospital room in Mexico, where a teenage boy is recovering after spending months at sea, the only survivor of a shipwreck in which his family, the crew and all the animals in the zoo they were relocating to Canada were drowned. Pi is forced to relive his ordeal by Mr Okamoto (David KS Tse), a company assessor, determined to discover the “facts” of the accident. Pi’s account involves his being alone in a lifeboat with a Bengal tiger called Richard Parker. Mr Okamoto challenges these “unbelievable… fantastical fictions”. Pi offers another version. “Which story do you prefer?” he asks. As in the novel, the performance connects the question to choices at the core of our existence.The technical virtuosity of the team realising Pi’s adventures is dazzling and, under Max Webster’s direction, all the acting is superb, but the centre around which the whole revolves is Hiran Abeysekera as Pi.

I wonder about the presenting, I unpick the construction, I notice how music and other sounds are recorded, how they come in and out. I think about tone, and how we’re led through a story. I don’t do this all the time, by the way. It’s a bit pointless over-analysing a political phone-in show, or a bro-ski podcast where everyone talks over each other. Also, I often let a show take me over and take me where it wants. Still, it’s interesting to properly listen, try and work a programme out.Understanding how audio is made is important for a reviewer. And I have some practical experience: I’ve presented and interviewed for radio for over 20 years. But though I’ve been in many rooms with producers, pointing at lines dancing across a screen, saying, “I think that bit should go there, not there,” I’ve never made a programme myself. So I decided to learn.Which course to pick? Well, the best teachers are those whose work you admire, and, for me, Cathy FitzGerald is one of contemporary audio’s best. She makes beautiful, award-winning audio documentaries, and is encouraging via email. She’s based in a small town in Buckinghamshire, and runs her Strange \u0026amp Charmed audio school there. I pick her Absolute Beginners course. A weekend’s introduction, “all the basics of recording and editing audio for documentary and podcasts.” Last weekend, I tried it out.There were six of us trainees. A visiting Australian who wanted to make a podcast for the Aussie national parks a Belgian investigative journalist learning how to make audio as well as write a DJ who could edit, but wanted interviewing skills a presenter who could interview, but wanted editing skills an arts facilitator who just really loves podcasts and wanted to make them. And me. Six very different personalities, all sitting around a table, fuelled by tea and excellent cake, learning. Listening, and then making. Fun.FitzGerald let us try out recording equipment, practising inside before letting us loose to interview people in the street, as well as each other. She got us to think about audio, played us different pieces, asked us to imagine what we would do differently. We edited an interview transcript on paper. She told us about pitching, the places to try, when and how to do so. She gave us tips: build a kid’s den from a duvet and a chair and record your links inside ask interviewees to walk you through a situation. On Sunday, she taught us an editing software in about 20 minutes flat. Then we made short pieces from our interviews, clipping voices, adding music, sound effects, all in a couple of hours.This, of course, was the best bit. Editing reminds me of writing: the constraints of time and information, the storytelling, the communication of information, the madness of being in the middle of it. Like writing, audio editing is utterly absorbing but it’s also more physical, weirdly. The sound waves rollercoaster across your screen. You see, as well as hear, what people are saying, down to their breaths, their umms and errrs. We all made completely different pieces. One made me cry.The course was practical value for money, pitched so nobody was left behind, and nobody was bored. Tick, gold star, recommended.But what was more remarkable was the atmosphere FitzGerald created: collaborative, confiding, careful. It reminded me, naturally, of her work. On her website, she says she loves making audio, but it can be lonely: “I create this stuff in slippers and isolation, mainlining cups of tea and ginger nuts.” She set up her school to collaborate, and describes her job as “caretaker”, because she takes care. FitzGerald wants to expand the community of audio storytellers, and she makes you feel as though you, too, could do it. You listen differently afterwards. Ear- and mind-opening stuff.Power Your Podcast with StorytellingThis online video class is presented by Alex Blumberg, CEO and co-founder of podcast network Gimlet Media. Gimlet made headlines when it was sold for trazillions of dollars to Spotify earlier this year, but listeners really know it for StartUp, Reply All, Homecoming, Conviction, Mogul and other excellent podcast series. Blumberg has made and presented audio for years now – he was an executive producer at This American Life – and knows what he’s doing. The course is for beginners and is on offer at half-price ($24£19) until tomorrow.How to Create a Successful PodcastThis is a one-off  masterclass on 18 September. It’s only three hours long and is a lecture, as opposed to a hands-on practical lesson. You might think this isn’t enough time to learn much, but the class is being led by two very experienced audio-makers: Craig Templeton Smith and Jack Soper, both of whom have made interesting and erse work, and who know what they’re talking about.

It quickly weakened back to a tropical storm but it promised heavy rains that could last for days, testing flood-prevention systems built after Hurricane Katrina.Officials warned that the storm could still cause disastrous flooding across a wide stretch of the Gulf coast.“This is just the beginning,” said Louisiana governor John Bel Edwards. “It’s going to be a long several days for our state.”The US Coast Guard rescued more than a dozen people from the remote Isle de Jean Charles, south of New Orleans, where water rose so high that some clung to rooftops.Later, officials in Terrebonne Parish, a rural coastal area, ordered an evacuation due to water overtopping a levee. It was unclear how many people would be affected. Evacuees with nowhere to go were directed to a shelter in Houma. The Lower Dularge East Levee was overtopped as Barry was moving ashore. Surge and heavy rains led to the overtopping of another levee in coastal Plaquemines Parish, where fingers of land extend deep into the Gulf of Mexico. The storm’s flood potential, rather than its winds, posed the greatest danger. New Orleans authorities were keeping an eye on the levee system built to contain the lower Mississippi, which winds through the heart of the city and is already well above flood stage from months of heavy rainfall over the midwest.Officials said Barry was unlikely to push the Mississippi over the levees. A US army corps of engineers official, Mark Wingate, noted that the river was at 16.6ft (5m) and was predicted to rise to about 17ft, down from the previously anticipated 20ft. Wingate said all canal locks were in good shape.The storm made landfall near Intracoastal City, about 160 miles west of New Orleans, and its winds fell to 70mph, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. Forecasters encouraged residents in New Orleans to be patient and stay vigilant.“We are sensing a great deal of impatience with the onset of impacts from Tropical Storm Barry,” said the New Orleans office of the National Weather Service (NWS) early on Saturday. “Plenty of very heavy rainfall parked off the coast to move through the area throughout the day Saturday into Sunday. Be patient and DO NOT drop your guard.”Forecasters warned that Barry’s glacial pace would give it time to gather moisture from the Gulf of Mexico. Weather models suggested it could dump between 10in and 20in over south-central and south-east Louisiana and south-west Mississippi.In a statement on Saturday morning, the Weather Forecast Center said the area should “expect some pretty impressive rainfall rates … with some values likely exceeding 3in in an hour”.Experts also warned that because of the erratic and lopsided shape of the storm, its most intense bands of torrential rain may not occur until well after landfall.Downpours also lashed coastal Alabama and Mississippi. Parts of Dauphin Island, a barrier island in Alabama, were flooded by rain and surging water from the Gulf, said Mayor Jeff Collier, who was driving around in a Humvee to survey damage. He said the island still had power and wind damage was minimal.Flooding closed some roads in low-lying areas of Mobile county in Alabama and heavy rains contributed to a number of accidents, said John Kilcullen, director of plans and operations for Mobile county emergency management agency. The NWS issued a flash flood warning for much of the two coastal Alabama counties.Mississippi governor Phil Bryant said parts of the state including areas of the rural Delta north of Vicksburg have been flooded for months. At a Saturday news conference, Bryant noted that “there is a lot of water out there, and it is headed our way.” The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency stationed search-and-rescue teams at the Camp Shelby military base near Hattiesburg and in Pike county, near the Louisiana line. The Mississippi national guard had 3,200 soldiers on standby. Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for Louisiana, for the first Atlantic hurricane of 2019. While New Orleans authorities refrained from ordering evacuations, tourism officials reported an exodus of hotel guests on Friday. Airlines including British Airways, Delta and Spirit cancelled outbound flights from the city.A performance scheduled for Sunday by the Rolling Stones at the Superdome, which was an emergency shelter during Katrina in 2005, was postponed until Monday. Katrina inundated much of the city and killed about 1,800 people.Most residents elected to stay. Officials urged them to secure their homes, stock up on supplies and prepare to stay indoors. Bread and water aisles at several local supermarkets were picked clean by Friday.A number of coastal areas without sufficient protection were evacuated.

And you may not be able to get back inside your house if it’s not safe.Our camping stuff was stored in the garage, but instead I took it all and moved it outside, so we could camp, cook, and live in our yard. I also put a big box of survival gear in the trunk of my car. And then you’re supposed to store water as well – so that’s where the jacuzzi comes in. It’s not usually water you’d want to drink or cook with, but it is a huge water supply. Our barbecue has propane tanks which would allow me to cook food using the jacuzzi water for a few weeks without power. It’s not what I would usually use to drink from, since we’ve been sitting in it, but when it comes to an emergency, it would work. We might want to put a little bleach in it.We need to be reminded of the topic on a regular basis. I have it easier in that regard, as people asking me about preparedness puts it back in my own mind. Actually, after I first heard from the , I finally bought a solar cellphone charger earlier this week. I also made sure I still have a flashlight in my night table.We used to live in Atlanta, and while we were there we had a rare 5.0 earthquake. I was sitting in the kitchen, working, when the house started shaking. I couldn’t figure out what it was, so I walked over to my computer and logged on to the US Geological Survey website. Studies show that people tend to not to drop, cover and hold, which is what you’re supposed to do. Instead, they do what I did and freeze. When we moved back to Seattle, I knew I’d have to prepare for the risk for large earthquakes. I study risk perception, and it’s really hard to think about preparing for a high-consequence but low-probability event. It might or might not happen in your lifetime – or even your child’s lifetime.In our household such plans are a household affair rather than my personal plans. We have a designated meeting spot should a quake happen during the workday, a generator, a box of emergency boat rations, a water heater and a rain barrel that could provide backup water supplies, and canned goods.We provided one of our neighbors with backup power for their freezer in a power outage this last year. Friends and family figure large in our thinking about preparedness – how we could help them and one another. We live on a cul-de-sac and we know everyone around us.And we’ve joked about grilling the wild bunnies and ducks who live in the park behind our house, more frequently as the bunnies have multiplied and invaded everyone’s gardens this summer.My work takes me to immediate post-disaster settings, so I have witnessed, repeatedly, the on-the-ground realities of what the world is like after a major natural hazard event, and this has informed my “planning”.Last fall, for instance, I traveled to Indonesia in the aftermath of the Sulawesi earthquake. It was there that I saw thousands of people who had survived the quake, but who were suffering because of lack of sanitation, medical services and housing, and had to wait for relief efforts which ned many weeks.This has taught me that we must not only make it through the event but also its aftermath. My plan is a full tank of gas in the car, as I plan to leave the area for days or weeks, provided that road damage does not close the highways. In the case of Seattle, I expect that there will be no water, nor electricity, nor fuel available for quite a while after a major earthquake.And when I leave the house, I will close the door, but I will not be too concerned about locking it down, because I know from experience in past disasters that there will be no looting, only people searching for food, bottled water and other essentials for survival.Los Angeles sits atop the San Andreas fault. A 7.8 earthquake along the southern section  could cause about 1,800 deaths and $213bn in damageAs a scientist I assess everything in my house for its utility. I keep two spare tanks for my gas grill, so in case of an earthquake I can use the grill to cook food. I used to have an on-demand tankless water heater – but I got rid of it because I want to use my water heater as a tank for water. It holds 40 gallons, which is a great supply – though you want to make sure it’s strapped down.The biggest thing, especially in LA, will be water. I’m in the process of putting a pool in my backyard, and if you distill the water to remove salts, I would not be shy about drinking pool water. Plus: with the salt in it, it’s already useful for cooking pasta.I keep a few hundred dollars in small bills, one- and five-dollar increments, because if we do have power outages and you have 20-dollar bills only, you won’t be able to purchase anything.I sleep with a hammer under my bed so I can break out of a window in my house. They sell earthquake hammers that also include a key to the gas main in the street – you’d need a tool to remove the plate and turn off the gas in the case of a gas line break. You can buy these hammers for around $10 at Home Depot.In my car, I always keep running shoes, a warm shirt and a few gallons of water. You never know where you’re going to end up and you may have to walk home."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d8e4679bd8cd02a7a14d26140b0d1c8802d08186/400_608_3676_2207/master/3676.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a776fc505c9c0f5971e732238e121e4d","title":"bent pyramid egypt opens ancient oddity for tourism","story":"Pharoah Sneferu’s structure marks key step in Egyptian architecture, as builders had to change the angle when it started to crack Egypt has opened to visitors the “bent” pyramid built for the pharaoh Sneferu, a 101-metre structure south of Cairo that marks a key step in the evolution of pyramid construction.Tourists will now be able to clamber down a 79-metre long, narrow tunnel from a raised entrance on the pyramid’s northern face, to reach two chambers deep inside the 4,600-year-old structure.They will also be able to enter an adjoining 18-metre high “side pyramid”, possibly for Sneferu’s wife Hetepheres, opened for the first time since its excavation in 1956.The “bent” Pyramid is one of three built for Fourth Dynasty founding pharaoh Sneferu in Dahshur, at the southern end of the Memphis necropolis, a Unesco world heritage site. Its appearance is unusual. The first 49 metres, which have largely kept their smooth limestone casing, are built at a steep 54 degree angle, before tapering off towards the top. It has been reopened to the public for the first time since 1965, when it was closed for restoration works.The angular shape contrasts with the straight sides of Sneferu’s Red Pyramid just to the north, the first of ancient Egypt’s fully formed pyramids and the next step towards the Great Pyramid of Giza.Architects changed the angle of the “bent” pyramid when cracks started appearing in the structure, said Mostafa Waziri, secretary general of Egypt’s Supreme Council of Antiquities.“Sneferu lived a very long time … the architects wanted to reach the complete shape, the pyramid shape,” Mohamed Shiha, director of the Dahshur site, said.Authorities are seeking to promote tourism at Dahshur, about 28km (17 miles) south of central Cairo. The site lies in the open desert, attracts just a trickle of visitors, and is free of the touts and bustle of Giza.As they opened the pyramids, archaeologists presented late-period mummies, masks, tools and coffins discovered during excavations that began near the Dahshur pyramids last year and are due to continue.“When we were taking those objects out, we found … a very rich area of hidden tombs,” Waziri said.The promotion of Dahshur is part of a wider push to boost tourism, an important source of foreign revenue for Egypt that dipped steeply after the country’s 2011 uprising but has gradually recovered. Archaeologists also unveiled the nearby tomb of Sa Eset, which has been closed since its excavation in 1894 and contains finely preserved hieroglyphic funerary texts.Foreign ambassadors invited to attend the archaeological announcements were led sweating into the tight spaces of the tomb, which is not expected to be opened to the public for another two years."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f451e88a0f74f943ae5be8d902bde8fea3c7ff10/0_275_7031_4218/master/7031.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb5eaf5c768d79a0ee36c4cc16cfa88b","title":"viktor orban budapest hungary christianity with a twist","story":"“Europe can ignore or deny or struggle against its own identity and its Christian roots. But by doing so the society commits suicide,” said László Kiss-Rigó, the bishop of Szeged, as he drove into Budapest on a recent afternoon. “And the more migrants that come, the more Christian values will be watered down.”Christian values, or a particular interpretation of them, have become the centrepiece of Hungarian government messaging under its far-right leader, Viktor Orbán, and Kiss-Rigó operates at the nexus of the prime minister’s interests.As well as his role as bishop, he is also the chairman of Szeged’s local football team, which is owned by the church. He was in Budapest to make arrangements for the inaugural concert at a new multipurpose stadium, which will be opened later this summer with an appearance by Placido Domingo – just one part of the massive investment that the football-mad Orbán has made into the sport.On the matter of migration, and much else, Kiss-Rigó and Orbán are singing from the same hymn sheet. The bishop denies, for example, that putting up walls to keep people out of the country doesn’t fit with Christian values. “Everyone who knocks at your door and asks admission is welcome to be examined. But people who jump into your house through the roof should be protected against,” he said.Now in his third consecutive term, Orbán has increasingly used far-right and anti-migrant rhetoric as he cements control of the country in increasingly authoritarian fashion. He used to describe his system as an “illiberal democracy”, but recently he has changed focus, preferring instead to call it a “Christian democracy”. The government’s messaging is still based around stopping immigration and protecting a “besieged” Europe from outsiders, but it now comes in increasingly Christian packaging, both at home and abroad.At a lavish party to mark US independence day in Budapest, Orbán told guests that finally, with the accession of Donald Trump, there was an “overlap of values” between the US and Hungary. “Neither of us is willing to accept the hypocrisy of modern politics, which neglects the fact that Christianity is the most persecuted religion globally,” he said. In a sign of just how much things have changed in the relationship over the past few years, Trump’s ambassador David Cornstein called Orbán a “perfect partner” and arranged for his old friend, the singer Paul Anka, to serenade the Hungarian prime minister.Trump himself lavished praise on Orbán during a May visit to the White House that ended years of isolation in which top US officials shunned Orbán’s government over rule-of-law concerns. “You have been great with respect to Christian communities. You have really put a block up and we appreciate that very much,” said Trump, apparently referring to the fence Orbán’s government has built along Hungary’s southern border to keep out migrants.The Hungarian Catholic church, the largest church in the country, has been supportive of Orbán’s hardline policies on migration, despite frequent calls from the pope for Europe to be more tolerant and understanding of the suffering of those who have fled war and poverty.Since then, he has frequently invoked Christian values, but of late the intensity has increased.Now, barely a month goes by without Orbán hosting a delegation of Christian leaders from somewhere in the world. Next year, Budapest will host the International Eucharistic Congress, an international gathering of tens of thousands of Catholics from across the world designed to celebrate the actual presence of Jesus in the Eucharist, which will be accompanied by a vast outdoor mass and various entertainment programmes. The Hungarian State Opera has even announced its forthcoming season will showcase only works that deal with Christian themes.But there’s one problem with all this: the policies of Orbán’s government don’t seem to be particularly Christian. One recent law saw the criminalisation of homelessness, penalising the street sleepers who are a frequent sight in the underpasses and courtyards of Budapest, rather than dealing with the problem’s causes. Asylum seekers are held in shipping containers in special transit zones near Hungary’s border fence, and the country’s policy of denying food to failed asylum seekers was branded “an unprecedented human rights violation in 21st-century Europe” by a human rights group. Government-controlled media often uses dehumanising rhetoric about migrants and refugees.Kiss-Rigó, who believes that most migrants at the Hungarian border are wealthier than the police repelling them, and that “only a tiny minority” are actually refugees, sidestepped questions on whether he agreed with the pope’s calls for tolerance.Others have been less reticent. A journalist and founding member of Orbán’s Fidesz party, Zsolt Bayer, said in 2016 that the pope was “either a senile old fool or a scoundrel” for his pro-refugee sentiments.Not all of Hungary’s religious leaders feel the same. Gábor Iványi, a Methodist priest with a flowing, white beard who runs a homeless shelter in the scruffy eighth district of Budapest, was formerly on good terms with Orbán and even officiated at his (second, religious) wedding ceremony, but now decries the prime minster’s policies as being the opposite of Christian teachings. Last summer, he tried to distribute food to people being held in the transit zones, but was denied access. Some critics suggest that “Christian values” is code for something else altogether. “There’s just no doubt that this is organised as a way of saying that ‘Christianity’ means ‘white conservative Europe’. It’s a trope. Say the world ‘Christian’ and it says everything else that you want to say,” said Michael Ignatieff, rector of the Central European University, which is moving part of its operations from Budapest to Vienna after the government denied it accreditation.Kiss-Rigó would perhaps agree. He conceded that Hungarians are much less religious than Poles, for example, but defined “Christian values” in vague cultural terms: as much about shutting out the Muslim “other” as about any sense of personal religious belief. His favourite author is the British anti-Islam commentator Douglas Murray, and he said Europe was in danger of being turned into a “easily manipulable faceless mass” by unspecified dark forces.“I’m not saying all of this because I hope that next Sunday more people will come to church. In Europe, even an atheist is a Christian,” he said.Hungary’s foreign policy has also been taking on an increasingly Christian hue. A special “Hungary Helps” programme has been set up to provide aid to persecuted Christians in Africa and the Middle East. “Help should be provided where the trouble lies instead of bringing the trouble to Europe,” said a spokesman for the programme. He said it had disbursed $30m in aid in the past two years, almost exclusively to help Christian communities or projects backed by Christian groups.As Budapest has come in for increasing criticism from Brussels over rule-of-law concerns and democratic backsliding, Orbán has wooed other far-right leaders who use Christian rhetoric. He was the only EU leader to attend the inauguration of Brazil’s president Jair Bolsonaro in January, while he enjoys a warm relationship with the Law and Justice government in Poland.Katalin Novák, Hungary’s minister of state for family, youth and international affairs, has also had a busy travel schedule, meeting rightwing and Christian groups in many countries to showcase the government’s policies on improving birth rates and promoting traditional values. In March, she gave the keynote address at a conference organised by the Hungarian embassy in Washington entitled “Making Families Great Again”, attended by a number of rightwing American Christian groups.“We think that the problems of Europe can be traced back to the denial of Christian roots. We see the misinterpretation of tolerance many times. Being tolerant should not mean that one gives up his or her identity,” said Novák, in written responses to questions.These talking points have hit home with some rightwing Republicans, improving the standing of Orbán in Washington, and meaning some officials ended up more suspicious of NGOs and opposition activists than of Orbán’s government. “Wrapping itself in the words of being a Christian nation, with traditional values, created a subtext that critics are not legitimately concerned about the deterioration of the rule of law, but instead motivated by a progressive and pro-LGBT agenda,” said Scott Cullinane, who until last year was professional staff member on a White House subcommittee dealing with Hungary.Orbán’s position in Europe looks to be weakened after the recent European elections and a series of scandals among potential far-right allies, which means the approval of Trump and rightwing republicans is a useful blessing.“We are very happy that there are a few politicians like Orbán and Trump who really represent those values which we Christians believe to be important,” said Kiss-Rigó, when asked if it was plausible to hold up the US president as a paragon of Christian virtue. For him, as for Orbán, the backlash against liberalism is more important than any specific Christian virtues.“I don’t think he will be canonised in the Catholic church but this is not the point. After the attempted dictatorship of nihilism, manipulated by the PC-talkers, his personality is a refreshing one.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Green Line disrupted as technicians examine overhead wiresShop workers form guard of honour as founder of clothing chain laid to restMotion ruling out coalition with Fine Gael and Fianna F\u0026aacuteil rejected by large majorityDaughter Maria Bailey TD said father reared her to be a \u0026lsquostrong, independent woman\u0026rsquoBarrister and political commentator was driven by \u0026lsquopassion for democracy and fair, equal society\u0026rsquoGarda\u0026iacute appeal for other victims and witnesses to come forwardPriest says Joshua \u0026lsquoradiated an energy that was beautiful\u0026rsquoIncident happened on the M9 near junction 10 - road remains closed southboundNew British PM, be it Johnson or Hunt, will have \u0026lsquoreality check\u0026rsquo on taking officeDNA data could be used by Chinese to devise biological weapons, say senatorsUnion says community mental health services curtailed as overtime ban introducedHSE says it became aware of an IT issue at US laboratory analysing tests in FebruaryKenneth Darby said he could not understand why he was going in the wrong directionA doctor writes: Contact GP if you\u0026rsquore worried about a recent test, says Muris HoustonAnother new record for outpatient waiting lists following industrial action in hospitalsMan and woman remanded in custody over death of William \u0026ldquoPat McCormick (55)Judge Karen Fergus throws out three cases taken by same solicitor at Longford courtParty\u0026rsquos success in European elections could see it win up to 12 seats in general election"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3956199.1563039590!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"green party must be open to coalition with major parties ryan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEamon Ryan: ‘Stop-start policies will not work’. Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WireGreen Party leader Eamon Ryan has set his party on a firm path to coalition after the next election by saying it “must be open and prepared to enter government”.In his keynote speech to the party’s national convention in Dublin, Mr Ryan has argued that entering government was the most effective way to address the climate emergency.Referring back to the Green’s first experience in coalition, which saw the party losing all its seats in 2011, Mr Ryan said: “I know from experience how hard that can be but also what can be achieved. To prepare properly it is important to set out the principles that we would approach any programme for government negotiations.”He said the party should be willing to talk to any party who shared its core belief in constitutional, democratic and peaceful politics.He also lambasted the Government’s transport policies for favouring cars and road development and called Fine Gael and Minister for Transport Shane Ross “a waste of space”.“Their only road map is to build yet more roads. Their only climate initiative is to switch from fossil fuelled cars to ones powered by a battery. They are blind to the unsustainable sprawl, long distance commutes, and gridlock,” he said.Setting out his thinking, Mr Ryan said the situation was now so urgent that action needed to be taken now.“The scale and speed of change we need to make is so great that we have to make sure that at least the next five governments in a row are bought into taking real climate action.“Stop-start policies will not work and the story behind the transition is that every person and every place matters. We should not be ruling out people on the basis of how they vote.“We will not make the leap we need to make if we allow this to become a politically isive issue. We should celebrate rather than worry about people stealing our political clothes.”TransitionAnother principle, said Mr Ryan, was for a just transition. “Ecological transition has to also deliver real social justice. The old story that the market knows best and economic growth is the measure of success is shot.”He also emphasised the party’s tradition of consensus and working together as a team. “We don’t run away from hard decisions or run to the media every time there is an opportunity for some spin.”The debate on coalition illustrated a slight generational bias with younger members such as Saoirse McHugh and Lorna Bogue arguing trenchantly against any agreement with Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil. They also argued the party should identify itself as “explicitly anti-capitalist”. That was amended by delegates to “explicitly antineoliberalism”.A capacity audience of 400 people attended the event, which has come less than two months after the party quadrupled its council seats to 49, and also won two seats in the European parliament.In his speech, Mr Ryan pointed to the party working to form coalitions on every council it had strong representation on, to give effect to is policies on planning, transport, the environment and sustainability. He said its goal of switching the transport policy to favour a ratio of two to one in favour of public transport would start locally.He praised some aspects of the climate action plan but said it had failed in a number of areas but said it was “weaker when it comes to changing land use in our country.He said the industrial model of farming being promoted by Fine Gael need to be challenged. He contended the current practice was impacting ordinary farmers who were “only getting a bargain basement commodity price.”Deputy leader Catherine Martin told delegates that being green meant standing up for bioersity but also for social justice.“We are working for a caring compassionate Ireland,” she told delegates."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3956230.1563088902!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"france to create new space force command macron","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t French President Emmanuel Macron delivers a speech at the residence of French Defense Ministry on the eve of Bastille Day in Paris, France.

It is part of a drive by the Department for Education to address the rise in students who report mental health issues during their time at university.Data released earlier this year showed that the number of students declaring mental health problems on arrival at university has surged.Figures obtained via freedom of information requests showed a 73 per cent rise between 2014-15 and 2017-18 in students stating that they had a condition such as depression or anxiety before starting their courses.Missed Poldark?

ten students get less ddd a level leave university top","story":" 69 per cent of students with DDD at A-level went on to graduate with either a first class or upper second degreeUniversities have been warned over degree class inflation as an analysis reveals that seven in ten students who get less than DDD grades at A-level go on to graduate with top degrees.  Of the 3,025 students who went to university last year after achieving less than DDD, 69 per cent went on to graduate with either a first class or upper second degree.  This is seven per cent higher than the previous year, and a 73 per cent increase since 201011, according to a major report published on Thursday by the Office for Students (OfS).    Those who left school with less than DDD last year were four times more likely to graduate with a first class degree compared to seven years ago, the data showed.  The watchdog noted in its report that it had observed the “greatest increase in attainment” in degree outcomes for those who left school with less than DDD in their A-levels or the equivalent.  The Education Secretary urged universities to take “rapid action” so that degree class inflation is “stamped out”.  He called the figures “disappointing”, adding that they “risk compromising the public trust in the high standards of our universities”.  The Education Secretary urged universities to take “rapid action”Damian Hinds said that quality in higher education must be protected “at all costs” and called on the regulator to demand that universities with unjustified rises provide evidence of what they are doing about it.     The OfS analysed the degrees awarded by 148 universities in England between 201011 and 201718.  It found that four in five of all students (79 per cent) now graduate with either a first or upper second class degree, up from 29 per cent seven years ago.  Almost a third (29 per cent) are awarded a first class degree compared to 16 per cent in 201011. After controlling for factors such as students working harder and improvements in teaching, the OfS said that 13.9 per cent of the increase in first class degrees remained unaccounted for.  The higher education watchdog has previously threatened institutions with sanctions, including fines or even de-registration, if they fail to take action over the issue.Institutions found to be artificially inflating their grades can be hit with sanctions by the OfS, including fines or even stripping them of their status as a university. Secondary legislation will be passed later this year to beef up the regulator\u0027s powers and allow it to levy fines of whichever is greater out of £500,000 or two per cent of the university\u0027s income.   Susan Lapworth, director of competition and registration at the OfS, warned that concerns over grade inflation “threaten to devalue a university education in the eyes of employers and potential students”. She said that the OfS will contact universities with the most significant and unexplained increases in degree classification.A committee of vice-Chancellors and other sector leaders reviewed ways to tackle grade inflation and published a “statement of intent” in May which set out their plans to tackle the issue.They agreed that “strong and decisive action” was needed to tackle perceptions that degrees are being “dumbed down”.Chris Hale, director of policy at Universities UK, said: “It is important not to forget that students working harder, improvements in teaching, investment in academic support and widening participation initiatives are also all leading to legitimate grade improvement and such improvements are to be celebrated,” he said.Missed Poldark?

Let\u0027s see them aliens.A prop at the International UFO Museum in Roswell, New MexicoThe idea, posted by a popular figure in the video game world, stated as a joke, but was propelled by the enduring fascination with Area 51.A spokeswoman for the US Air Force said they were aware of the Facebook campaign.The US Air Force always stands ready to protect America and its assets.Signs around Area 51 make clear that intruders will face deadly force.Seth Shostak, senior astronomer at the SETI Institute in California, which pursues the search for extra-terrestrial life, said: Area 51, as a rationale in support of visiting aliens, is an argument from ignorance.Area 51 was first used by the US government in the 1950s to test the U2 spy plane, because of its remote location.The government refused to even acknowledge it existed until 2013, and it continues to be sued for testing sensitive aircraft.In 2017 there as renewed enthusiasm among conspiracy theorists when the Pentagon confirmed it had spent $22 million on a secret programme examining UFOs sightings, which it referred to as anomalous aerospace threats.Luiz Elizondo, the former military intelligence officer who ran the real-life X-Files programme, subsequently told The Daily , he had seen convincing top secret evidence of extra-terrestrial craft.He told The Daily : In my opinion, if this was a court of law, we have reached the point of \u0027beyond reasonable doubt\u0027. I hate to use the term UFO but that\u0027s what were looking at.I think it\u0027s pretty clear this is not us, and it\u0027s not anyone else, so one has to ask the question where they\u0027re from.Missed Poldark?

The distinctive patterned dresses have been worn by stars such as Margot Robbie, Holly Willoughby and Kylie Minogue and are generally seen by fashionistas as a must-have item.The co-founders have recently decided to change their sizes while they originally stocked small as a size eight, medium as a 10 and large as a 12, they have now added three extra sizes. This means the small dresses are now a 10, medium a 12 and large a 14.Henrietta Rix, the co-founder at RIXO, told The  that they made the change as soon as they were big and established enough to do so.She said: “Our customers are at the centre of everything we do! We want women of all ages, shapes and sizes to be able to wear one of our pieces and feel amazing. “To this day we are still self-funded and as soon as we had grown enough to be able invest back into the business the first this we did was focus on size and fit, firstly offering three more sizes and expanding our size range from size XXS (UK 6) to XL (UK 16). Since we expanded the amount of sizes we were able to offer, it allowed us to re-look at exactly what we called our sizes and make sure they were true to size.”She and her co-founder Orlagh McCloskey have also recently hired a permanent garment technologist to perfect the fit of their dresses so they are more flattering.Ms Rix added: “We are constantly taking into account customer feedback and genuinely listening to the women who wear RIXO, so we can keep improving and give our customers the best experience. We will be including even more sizes as we grow to ensure that we can be as inclusive, empowering and inspiring as possible for our customers and to continue to grow our amazing community of #HumansOfRIXO.”Last year, high street fashion outlet H\u0026ampM made a similar move after customers complained its sizing was too small.Their european sizing meant that clothes often came up small. While a UK size 12 equates to a EUR 40, size conversion at H\u0026ampM meant that clothes in this size were labelled as a EUR 38, which is actually a size 10. However, after customer complaints, the shop made a change which meant an item which would have previously been labelled as size 12 is now size 10, and an item that was previously labelled a 20 is now an 18.Missed Poldark?

As for UK businesses, about 90 per cent have some form of contingency planning in place, he said,\u0026nbspand the government has made progress in readying the country’s trade infrastructure such as ports and customs for a no-deal Brexit.But the government is not “all the way there”, Mr Carney added, making the same observation about some UK exporters and noting that firms overall still expect “sales to go down, they expect employment to go down, they expect costs to go up and they expect the economy to slow” if Britain leaves without an agreement.“Even with a smooth adjustment, this would be a major economic adjustment, a major economic shock,” Mr Carney told reporters after the central bank released its half-yearly financial stability report.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe report warns\u0026nbspof a negative impact on consumers and businesses from a likely “sharp” adjustment in the sterling exchange rate and in the prices of other UK assets following a disorderly Brexit.The pound has already lost 15 per cent of its value since the start of 2016 against a basket of currencies that includes the dollar and the euro, according to the document.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersPressed further on the government’s preparedness, Mr Carney said: “It’s a huge exercise to rebuild the customs system from scratch and to build the necessary capacity in order to operate it in an economy that’s a just-in-time economy.\u0026nbsp“It’s a marvel of just how integrated these economies are and how efficient they are under the current system, and it needs to shift from one system to another – potentially overnight…\u0026nbsp“There is progress, but there is more to be done in terms of capacity and infrastructure, there is more to be done in terms of companies being plugged into the system, which is under the WTO rules as opposed to under a common market.”Mr Carney also noted that the EU authorities have more to do to prevent disruption to financial services in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Although such disruption would primarily affect households and businesses on the continent, it could “spill back to the United Kingdom in ways that can’t be fully anticipated or fully mitigated”, he said.Boris Johnson, the frontrunner to become the next prime minister, has insisted he will take Britain out of the EU on 31 October with or without a deal.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Supply-side shocks include events such as a sudden rise in the cost of imported raw materials or components, or disruption to the supply chain, which raise companies’ costs.“I remain concerned about the vulnerability of households to a downside surprise in income or employment, given the very low savings rate,” said Mr Vlieghe, who sits on the BoE’s interest rate-setting committee.\u0026nbsp“Vacancies, while high, are no longer rising. In fact, over the past months, vacancies have experienced a rate of decline that is modest but has nevertheless not been experienced since 2012. So it is not clear that the labour market is tightening further.”Official data, which measures vacancies in rolling three-month periods, shows consecutive declines since December.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.England\u0027s captain Eoin Morgan, left, celebrates with teammate Joe Root after winning their Cricket World Cup semi-final match against Australia at Edgbaston in Birmingham.

Voting got under way in Britain early on Thursday in elections to the European Parliament - a contest the country had not expected to hold nearly three years after the Brexit referendumAn abrupt departure from the EU may dent businesses’ confidence and therefore their willingness to hire, Mr Vlieghe said. Companies’ response to a no-deal Brexit also depends on how prepared they are for such an outcome, he added, noting: “It is difficult if not impossible to expect businesses to incur the substantial costs to be fully prepared for a scenario that the government says it does not want.”Both contenders to become Britain’s next prime minister have said they hope to negotiate a new agreement with the EU but that they would be prepared to leave without a deal if that was necessary to meet the 31 October deadline.Businesses’ actions will be one of many things the BoE will look at before deciding what to do about interest rates if Britain crashes out of the EU, Mr Vlieghe said.\u0026nbspBut he concluded that the central bank is more likely to keep rates on hold or to reduce them than to raise them in response to “temporarily higher inflation that would result from the weaker exchange rate and possibly tariffs”, and that a cut to close to zero would be his own preference.\u0026nbspThis puts him in the same camp as his fellow Monetary Policy Committee member Silvana Tenreyro, who said earlier this week that a cut in interest rates following a no-deal Brexit would be “more likely than not”.\u0026nbspApart from a smooth Brexit and a no-deal one, there is a third possibility, where a new deal is not agreed later this year but a no-deal departure is also avoided temporarily, Mr Vlieghe said. The economic damage from this outcome would fall somewhere between the first two scenarios.“That would likely involve ongoing headwinds to the economy from uncertainty, while avoiding the disruptive supply-side impact of no deal,” he said.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He was listening to music on his phone using Spotify, and watching films on Netflix, but he was struggling to buy textbooks or find them in the library when he needed one. Surely, he thought, it must be possible to access books in the same way I access music, film or data? Easily and cheaply, anywhere, any time. But, he realised, there was no subscription service for books. Thus was born Perlego (Latin for “I read through” or “I scan”), the Spotify of textbooks. Van Malderen even went on to write his thesis on the subject, “Why the Old Textbook Model is Broken”.There is a scandal, verging on a scam, in the realm of textbooks. Since 1982, the price of textbooks has risen at three times the rate of inflation. Some figures depict a tenfold increase. As if students didn’t have enough trouble already with tuition fees. They would be justified in feeling it’s a rip-off, up there with secondary ticketing for gigs and flights to Madrid when there’s a Champions League Cup Final on. Perlego aims to make learning accessible, without perhaps killing off libraries completely. “Students can still go to the library to study,” says its CEO and co-founder Van Malderen.Gauthier Van Malderen, 26, was born in Belgium, lived in Henley-on-Thames as a kid, and was an undergraduate in economics and management at Bocconi University in Milan. His dad is in banking and his parents expected him to go into finance. “They nearly had a heart attack when I mentioned textbooks online.” They’ve swung around since. Van Malderen the younger is really responding to student need. When he was still an undergraduate he noticed that most students were using notepads so he set up a business producing very classy notepads, called\u0026nbspIconic Matter (“made by students for students”) with advertising from big companies at the bottom of the page, selling them in Belgium, Switzerland and Morocco. He made enough money out of that scheme to launch Perlego, together with backing from the founder of Zoopla, Alex Chesterman.There are a couple of open access websites where you can download books for free, such as OpenStax, funded by Bill Gates – but it’s non-profit, and Van Malderen is on the side of writers as much as readers.\u0026nbsp“If you’re going to produce high quality work, then it would be nice to get paid.” Van Malderen is sympathetic towards professors. “They don’t want students to have to pay through the nose. They don’t ‘adopt’\u0026nbsptextbooks anymore” (i.e. making them required reading). In the context of universities trying to open up access, the question of affordability becomes more crucial than ever.We see ourselves as complementing rather than replacing traditional institutionsThe other possible avenue for impecunious students is, of course, theft, not so much nicking books from the library, more using piracy websites. Sitting at a laptop in his offices in Holborn, Gauthier showed me how he could illicitly download the pdf of a classic textbook, Corporate Finance: Theory and Practice, entirely for free. “No wonder publishers are having a hard time,” says van Malderen. “There is a vicious spiral effect. They lose 28 per cent\u0026nbspto piracy, 30 per cent\u0026nbspto second-hand sales.” In short, at present, publishers, authors, and students all end up feeling ripped off.Apparently 88 per cent\u0026nbspof students don’t see piracy as a crime. Van Malderen thinks legal can be cooler. “We can show them the convenience of having one space – a one-stop shop – where you can get all your books. And no one gets ripped off.” The average spend on textbooks in the UK is £439 (medicine will cost a lot more than English) in the US it’s $1,200. The cost of subscribing to Perlego is £12 a month.Perlego also hosts all those public domain books, like The Odyssey and Das Kapital. “The culture has changed,” Van Malderen says. “It’s like music – you don’t want to own the book anymore.” Perlego is a streaming service. You don’t download, you read the book page by page online, on your phone if you like. It’s a “mobile-first learning experience”, as Van Malderen describes it. You can create your own library, like a playlist. And unlike the books in the university library, you can legitimately scribble in the margins and underline sentences, personalising the text.You can become part of a network of readers, with input from other students, so you can compare notes, and get comments from professors too. It’s a virtual seminar that feels like it could make the real, traditional learning environment redundant. “We see ourselves as complementing rather than replacing traditional institutions,” says Van Malderen. “We’re just aiming to make learning more efficient.” It’s like reading, plus social media, where you can “follow” other readers if you like. There is potential for “lifelong learning” too. 25 per cent\u0026nbspof Perlego subscribers are not students, but professionals (or would-be professionals) seeking to upgrade.How do you plan Wimbledon? It’s all about attention to detail‘If we get one person to give up cow’s milk, we’ve made a difference’Why women don’t need a science degree to be successfulAccording to the aggregate data Perlego has collected, psychology is the biggest growth area in higher education, which is good for psychology professors\u0026nbspand publishers to know. But the main intellectual advantage of the online system is that, whatever subject you’re studying, you can always dabble in something else – you’re not restricted to the books specified in your course. “For example,” says Van Malderen, “I was doing economics, but say I wanted to branch out into political science or philosophy, it’s right here”. It’s a whole online library rather than just a bunch of textbooks.A declaration of interest: I teach at Cambridge. I know from personal experience that one thing that always drives students mad is how to put in references at the end of their essays. I’m not one for making recommendations, but I think the next time a student asks me how to do it (and I know it’s going to go wrong somehow), I might say, “Have you tried Perlego?”. All you have to do is skip to the references section, highlight, copy, then paste. Full marks.

As for UK businesses, about 90 per cent have some form of contingency planning in place, he said,\u0026nbspand the government has made progress in readying the country’s trade infrastructure such as ports and customs for a no-deal Brexit.But the government is not “all the way there”, Mr Carney added, making the same observation about some UK exporters and noting that firms overall still expect “sales to go down, they expect employment to go down, they expect costs to go up and they expect the economy to slow” if Britain leaves without an agreement.“Even with a smooth adjustment, this would be a major economic adjustment, a major economic shock,” Mr Carney told reporters after the central bank released its half-yearly financial stability report.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThe report warns\u0026nbspof a negative impact on consumers and businesses from a likely “sharp” adjustment in the sterling exchange rate and in the prices of other UK assets following a disorderly Brexit.The pound has already lost 15 per cent of its value since the start of 2016 against a basket of currencies that includes the dollar and the euro, according to the document.Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersPressed further on the government’s preparedness, Mr Carney said: “It’s a huge exercise to rebuild the customs system from scratch and to build the necessary capacity in order to operate it in an economy that’s a just-in-time economy.\u0026nbsp“It’s a marvel of just how integrated these economies are and how efficient they are under the current system, and it needs to shift from one system to another – potentially overnight…\u0026nbsp“There is progress, but there is more to be done in terms of capacity and infrastructure, there is more to be done in terms of companies being plugged into the system, which is under the WTO rules as opposed to under a common market.”Mr Carney also noted that the EU authorities have more to do to prevent disruption to financial services in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Although such disruption would primarily affect households and businesses on the continent, it could “spill back to the United Kingdom in ways that can’t be fully anticipated or fully mitigated”, he said.Boris Johnson, the frontrunner to become the next prime minister, has insisted he will take Britain out of the EU on 31 October with or without a deal.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Supply-side shocks include events such as a sudden rise in the cost of imported raw materials or components, or disruption to the supply chain, which raise companies’ costs.“I remain concerned about the vulnerability of households to a downside surprise in income or employment, given the very low savings rate,” said Mr Vlieghe, who sits on the BoE’s interest rate-setting committee.\u0026nbsp“Vacancies, while high, are no longer rising. In fact, over the past months, vacancies have experienced a rate of decline that is modest but has nevertheless not been experienced since 2012. So it is not clear that the labour market is tightening further.”Official data, which measures vacancies in rolling three-month periods, shows consecutive declines since December.Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.England\u0027s captain Eoin Morgan, left, celebrates with teammate Joe Root after winning their Cricket World Cup semi-final match against Australia at Edgbaston in Birmingham.

Voting got under way in Britain early on Thursday in elections to the European Parliament - a contest the country had not expected to hold nearly three years after the Brexit referendumAn abrupt departure from the EU may dent businesses’ confidence and therefore their willingness to hire, Mr Vlieghe said. Companies’ response to a no-deal Brexit also depends on how prepared they are for such an outcome, he added, noting: “It is difficult if not impossible to expect businesses to incur the substantial costs to be fully prepared for a scenario that the government says it does not want.”Both contenders to become Britain’s next prime minister have said they hope to negotiate a new agreement with the EU but that they would be prepared to leave without a deal if that was necessary to meet the 31 October deadline.Businesses’ actions will be one of many things the BoE will look at before deciding what to do about interest rates if Britain crashes out of the EU, Mr Vlieghe said.\u0026nbspBut he concluded that the central bank is more likely to keep rates on hold or to reduce them than to raise them in response to “temporarily higher inflation that would result from the weaker exchange rate and possibly tariffs”, and that a cut to close to zero would be his own preference.\u0026nbspThis puts him in the same camp as his fellow Monetary Policy Committee member Silvana Tenreyro, who said earlier this week that a cut in interest rates following a no-deal Brexit would be “more likely than not”.\u0026nbspApart from a smooth Brexit and a no-deal one, there is a third possibility, where a new deal is not agreed later this year but a no-deal departure is also avoided temporarily, Mr Vlieghe said. The economic damage from this outcome would fall somewhere between the first two scenarios.“That would likely involve ongoing headwinds to the economy from uncertainty, while avoiding the disruptive supply-side impact of no deal,” he said.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

These are charged by online services used by financial advisers\u0026nbspto build and manage customers’ portfolios. In 2017, £311bn of investments was managed on adviser platforms.\u0026nbspAdviser platforms charge on average around 0.3 per cent of the latest value of investments annually –\u0026nbspa cost that is usually passed on straight to savers and pension holders. AFH Wealth Management, which commissioned the research, provides an example: on a pot of £50,000, invested over 25 years and growing 5 per cent a year, the investor will fork out a hefty £12,500 in platform fees alone, in addition to payments for financial advice.The 41 per cent of oblivious investors is made up of 27 per cent who know about the fees but are not sure how they affect their investments, and 13 per cent who do not even realise they are paying platform fees.While in some cases investors themselves can be blamed for the lack of awareness, AFH sees the problem elsewhere. “These findings simply highlight the crucial need for greater levels of transparency, engagement and education of investors”, it says in a report on the research.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Andy Murray and Serena Williams talk as they play Bruno Soares and Nicole Melichar during their mixed doubles third round match of the Wimbledon Championships.

Voting got under way in Britain early on Thursday in elections to the European Parliament - a contest the country had not expected to hold nearly three years after the Brexit referendumLarry the cat sits in the street, at Downing Street in LondonBut it goes further and questions the very practice of passing platform\u0026nbspfees onto investors.“If a platform offers superior service to advisers, increasing operational efficiencies, is it fair that customers should pay for these very indirect benefits?” AFH asks in the report.In another quirk of the current system, adviser platforms are chosen by advisers but are paid for by consumers, as the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) pointed out in a report published in March.AFH suggests that financial advisory firms should absorb the cost of platform fees and do so without increasing other charges to make up for the expense.“Unlike ongoing adviser charges and active fund management, which seek to add direct value for clients, platform costs are a dead weight and only subtract from performance,” the firm says.The FCA stopped short of making the same recommendation in its report on investment platforms.AFH also found broader uncertainty about fees among a quarter of investors: 8 per cent of those surveyed were confused about what they pay for, an equal share didn’t understand the fees they pay, and another 8 per cent weren’t even aware they pay any fees.The share of perplexed investors was matched almost exactly by the 26 per cent of advisers who said they had always felt uncomfortable talking about fees and charges.\u0026nbsp“Perhaps they feel they can’t justify their expense or there are simply too many charges to explain,” AFH says.\u0026nbspThe research is based on two online surveys carried out in November, involving 221 financial advisers in the UK and 1,026 British adults with over £100,000 in personal savings who have seen a financial adviser.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Villanelle’s new vulnerability invites us to question what it is exactly she wants from Polastri. First time around she was toying with a more worthy adversary, but why now? Polastri, by contrast, is frayed around the edges, a terrible wife to her husband Nico (Owen McDonnell) and an even worse intelligence agent to her boss Carolyn Martens (Fiona Shaw). The script is still tight and the jokes are still there, as are Villanelle’s accents, outfits and abrupt killings, but without the will-theywon’t-they energy of the initial plot, it is harder to care.226 Years and YearsYears and Years, then, is favoured by some wit, a cornucopia of fab talent and promising characters. The dominant one as we continue our quest into the 2030s and beyond, will be Vivienne, or Viv, Rook, played brilliantly by Emma Thompson. As a bit of a long-term Emma-sceptic I was actually startled by how good she is in the role of the epitome of everything she has spent her life hating and campaigning against, for Viv is a horrifically nasty businessperson turned populist politician with the most terrifying of views. Viv Rook makes Ann Widdecombe look like, well, Emma Thompson at an Extinction Rebellion sit-in.Joseph is almost never out of shot, whether seen from afar, contemplating a bottle of strong cider in a playground, or in visceral close-up, clutching his doner to his face. There are few actors you could trust with so much screen time, especially with such a pared back and naturalistic script. The fact any of it is remotely watchable is testament to Stephen Graham’s abilities. No man working in Britain today can drink a pint with more pathos.\u0027Good Omens is a hugely enjoyable, imaginative premiere, as close to Pratchett’s vision as anyone could have dared dream. And while the melancholy tone may not be for everyone, fans of the book will surely be sated.\u0027526 Line of Duty (BBC)Plausibility is a spectrum Bodyguard became ridiculous but Line of Duty stays just the right side, and as usual there is more plot in an hour than in whole series of other programmes. As well as being gripping entertainment, Line of Duty has become an effective examination of the relationship between the state and the inidual. The shadowy government forces are elected the organised crime gangs are fuelled by the drug trade. The police are there to save us from ourselves but can only do it if they are subjected to constant scrutiny. It’s exhausting work, policing the police.The footage is glorious, especially the side-on tracking shots of the birds and the hunting, where it is as if the cameramen were able to set up a rail along the ocean. Most spectacular of all is the sequence of a glacier collapsing into the ocean, where 75m tons of ice being sloughed off in less than 20-minutes. But at times Our Planet feels a little unfocused. Attenborough’s last big BBC series, Dynasties, won almost unbearable amount of emotional resonance through its focus on animal families. Our Planet is more of a greatest-hits parade, with overblown orchestral soundtrack and ponderous intonation. You can’t buy love, even if you pay for David Attenborough.726 Road to Brexit (BBC)The Road to Brexit is easily the best thing to emerge from the whole brexit imbroglio. OK, not much competition, but still... Despite the po-faced title, you realise very quickly that it’s not yet another drama starring Benedict Cumberbatch or yet another attempt by Laura Kuenssberg to explain the inexplicable, or yet another show with the public arguing about stuff they don’t understand. Rather, it’s a very clever, very funny, very \u0027different\u0027 parcel of bollocks to Brexit.While there are plenty of well-turned one-liners, the deeper attraction of Fleabag is schadenfreude. The character is as old as Daisy Buchanan or Lydia Bennett or Scarlett O’Hara. The best compliment to Waller-Bridge and her cast is that they find fresh clothes in which to dress these ancient monsters.It is sometimes remarked that the Troubles in Northern Ireland make for an unpromising backdrop for a sitcom about adolescent kids. Well, yer man’s wrong, as they might say. Derry Girls, returning for a triumphant and exuberant second run, proves that humour, dark or otherwise, can be quarried from even the most unlikely of locations.1026 The Murder of Jill Dando (BBC)A tremendously sad, strange story then, and just as unfathomable today. Dando’s friends, family and the producer and director of the film have made a fitting and balanced tribute to her, something she deserves. I can’t really add anything to that.Home is a rather gentle, unobtrusive variation on the sitcom theme – but one that is built on a quite a bizarre premise. The twist is that a family who returns to Surrey from a holiday touring around France discover a Syrian refugee stuffed in the back of their SUV. Not only that, but, after a few moments of blind terrified panic about a suicide bombing, they eventually adopt him like he’s stray cat that’s just wandered in.Michael Jackson has long looked like a burning tire yard. There were the allegations, the out-of-court settlements, the arrest, the trial and not-guilty verdict. But there has been nothing like Leaving Neverland” 1326 This Time with Alan Partridge* (BBC1)This Time with Alan Partridge is such a consistently strong creative achievement that fears for the future of Alan Gordon Partridge, may, once again, be allayed. Or Alayned, perhaps.” “Like all the best detective dramas, Shetland engages the audience in the very process of detection. That way we grow intrigued, and we care. And so we find ourselves sitting next to Henshall in his (prominently featured) Volvo V70 estate, sharing his thoughts, intercepting suspects and being driven off the road by unidentified enemies.” “It is both a revisionist – and frequently batty – take on the caped milieu and a winningly knotty mystery. And it surely is the first big-budget superhero tale more indebted to Wes Anderson than to Stan Lee.” “Yet again the Williams have woven a brilliantly tangled web, helped in no small part by Karyo’s quietly arresting central turn” “There’s really been nothing quite like Catastrophe on our screens before, and it deserves its cult status for the quality of everything the production team do, not least the stunning cinematography in this finale. Thanks, all. I’m glad Catastrophe died happy. 1826 Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil (BBC2)“For anyone who’s not altogether sure how British politics turned so suddenly into a rolling dumpster fire from which all exits are blocked then Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil is a necessary public service to explain exactly, and exactly how needlessly, we all came to be here.”“West believes Valjean to be “the greatest hero in all literature”, and he plays the part with all the care and intricacy such a character deserves.” “You see, saint or sinner, prince or pauper, we are all part of one race, the brotherhood of man. And the saintly and regal Danny Dyer stands as its finest ambassador.” 2126 The Secret Life of the Zoo (Channel 4)“This documentary goes behind the shrubbery to show off these animals and their s. The humans are a pretty exotic bunch too, judging by some of the lines they come out with.”2226 A Year of British Murder (Channel 4)“The programme-makers must have done much to win the confidence of so many friends and families, as they went through unspeakable personal pain but they repay that confidence with an understated and powerful film.” “Despite what some feared, the casting of Cumberbatch doesn’t simply flatter Cummings – the A-lister is too good a chameleon for that. But, inevitably, as he scrawls out his campaigning brainwaves on a whiteboard, there is a touch of that deductive maverick Sherlock in his portrayal of this scruffy, balding political saboteur.” 2426 The Paras: Men of War (ITV)“From the outset the production is elevated by its sensitive handling of the men – and the Paratroopers remain exclusively male – involved. These kinds of programmes have a tendency to fetishise toughness, lingering on assault courses and weaponry.”2526 Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland (BBC2)“Billy Connolly: Made in Scotland is a meandering look back over his life, career, and national identity – a “Proustian wander through Scotland”. There’s a lot of mordant chat about the weather, illustrated with shots of dark grey clouds above even darker grey lochs.” “As a slightly cheesy reminder of what we love about Doctor Who – i.e. the fact it gives us an intergalactic eccentric in a big flappy overcoat shouting at Daleks  – this is a New Year treat that more than delivers” As the series develops, it’s clearer than ever that Eve and Villanelle are more similar than they are different.

These are charged by online services used by financial advisers\u0026nbspto build and manage customers’ portfolios. In 2017, £311bn of investments was managed on adviser platforms.\u0026nbspAdviser platforms charge on average around 0.3 per cent of the latest value of investments annually –\u0026nbspa cost that is usually passed on straight to savers and pension holders. AFH Wealth Management, which commissioned the research, provides an example: on a pot of £50,000, invested over 25 years and growing 5 per cent a year, the investor will fork out a hefty £12,500 in platform fees alone, in addition to payments for financial advice.The 41 per cent of oblivious investors is made up of 27 per cent who know about the fees but are not sure how they affect their investments, and 13 per cent who do not even realise they are paying platform fees.While in some cases investors themselves can be blamed for the lack of awareness, AFH sees the problem elsewhere. “These findings simply highlight the crucial need for greater levels of transparency, engagement and education of investors”, it says in a report on the research.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Andy Murray and Serena Williams talk as they play Bruno Soares and Nicole Melichar during their mixed doubles third round match of the Wimbledon Championships.

Jake went down again and again and she just remained still for him\u0027Click to followThe IndependentA giant manta ray has been filmed appearing to beg a professional er for help saving her life.The three-metre-wide sea creature is shown swimming up to snorkelling guide Jake Wilton and flipping over in the water – apparently to show him fish hooks embedded in her right eye.The footage, caught near Ningaloo Reef off Western Australia’s north west coast, seems to show the manta ray then staying perfectly still as Mr Wilton gently removes the potentially deadly spikes.The animal – well known to locals and affectionately nicknamed Freckles – then swims away with a flourish as the er emerges triumphantly with the hooks.Monty Halls, a British marine biologist aboard the boat at the time, said: “That manta absolutely understood what was going on. Jake went down again and again and she just remained still for him.”Created with Sketch.Underwater Photographer of the Year Show all 45Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Winner: Behaviour and overall winner. I worry that this image will refuel the public\u0027s imbalanced perception of sharks but as an image capturing behaviour it has drama, adrenaline, grace, beauty and finality. That\u0027s a very rare combination in one image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: Wide Angle. The first moment I viewed this image I knew it would be a strong contender. For me it\u0027s the symmetry of the Humpback and the balance between the er and calf. Everything about it is in perfect alignment. The shape of the tail in relation to the four corners of the frame, not to mention the position of the free er and calf. Superb imagery at its very best.  Many congratulations Francois. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Winner: Macro. Fabio’s use of long exposure and panning has turned a classic portrait of a Sepiola into an unforgettable one. The sharp and ghosted images of the bobtail squid balance pleasingly in the frame and combined with the outstretched tentacles give the feeling of the cephalopod lunging for its prey. An innovative and most deserving category winner. - Alex Mustard (Judge) It is hard to imagine what it must have been like to have experienced such a large scale natural spectacle as this but this image, perfectly composed and timed, gets close. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: British Waters Macro. A mantra of mine is \u0027It\u0027s not what it is. It\u0027s where it is\u0027 and this long clawed Squat lobster is in a perfect position to make a memorable image. The author, instead of \u0027blasting\u0027 it with light, has gone in the opposite direction by restricting the strobe into a snooted spotlight in order to illuminate just the features of the lobster and the dainty sea loch anemones. It\u0027s an example of \u0027Isolation lighting\u0027 at its very best. A great deal of uw photographers invest their time in what they want to illuminate. This is an example which in my opinion illustrates features that they do not want to illuminate, hence the punchy black background and the soft delicate hues of dark sand, facial features topped off by the sea loch anemones. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Marine Conservation. The problems of plastic pollution and ghost fishing are both illustrated by this struggling loggerhead turtle. I am happy to learn this inidual was lucky enough to survive this deathtrap thanks to the photographer - Alex Mustard (Judge)What a chin, what a forehead, what a character. This picture has portrait written all over it, and such a fascinating species ideally suited to this close focus wide angle approach. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Portrait. Superb impact from the very first moment it was presented. Perfect composition within the image frame and the understated colours. To top it off the authors comments above say it all... a Smiling Happy Angel\u0027s Face. One of my favourites from the entire competition. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Winner: Up \u0026amp Coming. Beautiful split shot with both a perfect under and over split. A very strong favourite with all the judges and one of the best examples I have seen of this type of image for some time. Just Superb! - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Black \u0026amp White. It must be 11 out of 10 for this groundbreaking image. Conception, interpretation and perseverance coupled with black and white’s ability to concentrate on the key elements. It gets better with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Grey seals are a perennial favourite in UPY as one of the UK\u0027s star wildlife attractions. This upside-down portrait is quirky and cute and easily won the affections of the judging panel. Great to see an overseas photographer coming to the UK to show us how it\u0027s done! - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: Compact. This image was a very popular choice between the panel. Ideal for a split rendition. What makes this a winner for me, not withstanding the double exposure is the sympathetic balance of light \u0026amp colour connected  between the top half and bottom of the image frame. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: British Waters Compact. Does British ing get any better than a fun encounter with a grey seal pup? This youngster’s relaxed and curious face is captured perfectly by Martin, making us all want to be there too. - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: British Waters Living Together. Images tell stories but well thought out and executed ones speak volumes. This is such an example which feeds the eye with tales of the seaside on summer days, lively marine spectacles and excited human interaction. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)1545 Isles of Scilly, UKWinner: British Waters Wide Angle. Photographers often feel competition shots must be packed with new tricks to win. At UPY we always appreciate classic technique when it raises the bar of what has been done before. Rob\u0027s full technicolour wide angle scenic reveals the richness of UK seas with an elegant simplicity that is incredibly challenging to pull off in British conditions. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Wrecks. So simple yet so powerful the additional lighting of the turret and the main er perfectly positioned. This was a very strong category this year with a deserved winner and it\u0027s refreshing to read the acknowledgement to Leigh Bishop\u0027s pioneering work. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) The iconic silhouette of a seahorse is a graphically powerful picture. Here Zarina has raised that to another level with the addition of a red filter to her snooted strobe, reminiscent of a rim-lit animal at sunset. - Alex Mustard (Judge) All the judges found this to be probably the most distressing image to view but its uncompromising message must be seen by as many people as possible. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)As a subject we have seen our fair share of these colourful characters but this one shone through and the eggs almost look as if they have been inidually lit! - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Superb image with a perfect line across the split. Good exposure both above and below the water line and such an ideal subject to cap it all off. Excellent work. - Martin Edge (Judge)This is an excellent example for this category. It takes a tried and trusted angle but completely lifts it by using the fabric. It becomes more than an image a concept, a transition, a rebirth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)2245 Isles of Scilly, UKThis image stood out on many levels. Composition, colour vibrancy and contrast combined with an unusual angle kept us coming back to it and helped it rise in the rankings with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Perfect control of angle, light and focus. This was always up there with all of the judges. A clear favourite just like Nick Park’s genius creations. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I\u0027ve seen many images of eel and shrimp around Indonesia, however you have taken this two steps forward. 1) With your excellent idea to snoot the eye and 2) with your backlight on the shrimp. You can expect many photographers to practice your technique in the months to come. Congratulations for your vision. Very well thought out and executed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    It’s not what you’ve got, it’s what you do with it. The split may have been elusive but well worth the effort. This is a deceptively subtle excellent delivery. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)I have witnessed this behaviour from the surface with its high velocity \u0027testosterone and tonnage\u0027 and I remember thinking how happy I was to be in the boat. To have the presence of mind to time this shot whilst one\u0027s senses are being bombarded is heroic in my view. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) What an amazing moment. From the expression on the face of the unicornfish fleeing for its life, to the hunting pack of sharks, especially the leader with its mouth snapping open that fan out diagonally across this composition. And that is without considering what a great challenge it is to shoot these images of split second action, in the dead of night, underwater. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  There is so much energy in this image. If you look at it long enough you can begin to see just a hint of movement of all the fish around the coral. The colours are realistic and this top down shot works well.  - Martin Edge (Judge)A jaw-dropping wide angle scene with sharks, rays and mountains. A winning combination in the Up \u0026amp Coming category. - Alex Mustard (Judge)3045 Loch Long, Argyll and ButeThis is a subtle image with light and detail that are a delight to explore. The sunset, trees and underwater scene combine to create a wonderful feeling of the place. We particularly like how the composition allows the line of the shore to be continued underwater by the seaweeds.  - Alex Mustard (Judge)Photographing pike underwater is one thing but finding your own underwater artistic stamp is quite another matter. With this particular image the author has done just that! By using a slow shutter speed of 18th sec and a panning technique from right to left gives the impression of movement whilst the pike is pin sharp. - Martin Edge (Judge)Arthur’s image scores with both its foreground and background. The deadman’s fingers soft coral make an attractive foreground, enhanced by the crab sheltering within, and the striking sunbeams create beauty and atmosphere in the background. I also love the feeling of depth created by the legs of the jetty reaching up for the surface. - Alex Mustard (Judge)In recent UPY competitions UK macro images have lacked their overseas counterpart\u0027s flair and imagination but this magnificent shot raises the bar for everyone else to follow. World class from the UK at last. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Memorable photographs of people underwater are deceptively difficult and require both the photographer and model to be at the top of their game. The simplicity of the composition works to highlight the delicious details in the girl\u0027s pose. - Alex Mustard (Judge) This is a timeless scene that communicates a detailed story. The cavern, the silversides sheltering, the tarpon hunting and the er kneeling reverentially, taking it all in. It is a fabulous use of black and white to tell this story of shadows and light. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Sometimes it is the small detail which contributes so much. The white of the eye and the row of teeth in what could be construed as a smile convey mischief and menace in equal measures. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Once again Tobias you have succeeded in capturing one of the most photographed wrecks in the Red Sea and photographing it in a completely different way. You push the boundaries of wreck photography and I congratulate you for your vision and forward thinking of new ideas. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Perfect composition and framed against the stark black background. However it\u0027s the contrast of white on black which attracts the eye again and again every time this particular image popped up to greet us. The colour of the nudibranch was sufficiently bright enough to raise our senses again and again as it proceeded through the competition.  The soft delicate treatment of the snooted flash is also very well managed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    This shot puts you right in the picture and records a special encounter in a very special place. Every element contributes and the lucky or intended curve of the split creates great spatial depth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Symmetry, graphic simplicity and for once in UK waters a black background which contributes to a positive outer worldly delivery. A mould breaker. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I see and judge many images of the sockeye salmon but this is one of the best. The alignment of the two salmon not to mention the composition within the frame.  The surgy peak of the action is in perfect symmetry with the window which provides the viewer with topside influences of the trees against a vivid blue sky. There is so much image depth in this example. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Such a delicate image yet so full of emotion. There are times when there are no more words needed. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)UPY loves seahorse photos! Especially when they capture a fleeting behaviour, such as this. But we hadn\u0027t realised during judging that this was a new species of seahorse, nor did with know the incredible backstory behind this picture, we just loved the moment. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  Whether or not you like fashion photography underwater you would be hard pressed to see a more beautiful combination of complimentary colours and a very elegant pose. A very well executed image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)A portrait must leave you in no doubt. Simple lighting, illuminating all that is needed, captures this character. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Winner: Behaviour and overall winner. I worry that this image will refuel the public\u0027s imbalanced perception of sharks but as an image capturing behaviour it has drama, adrenaline, grace, beauty and finality. That\u0027s a very rare combination in one image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: Wide Angle. The first moment I viewed this image I knew it would be a strong contender.

It\u0027s an example of \u0027Isolation lighting\u0027 at its very best. A great deal of uw photographers invest their time in what they want to illuminate. This is an example which in my opinion illustrates features that they do not want to illuminate, hence the punchy black background and the soft delicate hues of dark sand, facial features topped off by the sea loch anemones. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Marine Conservation. The problems of plastic pollution and ghost fishing are both illustrated by this struggling loggerhead turtle. I am happy to learn this inidual was lucky enough to survive this deathtrap thanks to the photographer - Alex Mustard (Judge)What a chin, what a forehead, what a character. This picture has portrait written all over it, and such a fascinating species ideally suited to this close focus wide angle approach. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Portrait. Superb impact from the very first moment it was presented. Perfect composition within the image frame and the understated colours. To top it off the authors comments above say it all... a Smiling Happy Angel\u0027s Face. One of my favourites from the entire competition. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Winner: Up \u0026amp Coming. Beautiful split shot with both a perfect under and over split. A very strong favourite with all the judges and one of the best examples I have seen of this type of image for some time. Just Superb! - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Black \u0026amp White. It must be 11 out of 10 for this groundbreaking image. Conception, interpretation and perseverance coupled with black and white’s ability to concentrate on the key elements. It gets better with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Grey seals are a perennial favourite in UPY as one of the UK\u0027s star wildlife attractions. This upside-down portrait is quirky and cute and easily won the affections of the judging panel. Great to see an overseas photographer coming to the UK to show us how it\u0027s done! - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: Compact. This image was a very popular choice between the panel. Ideal for a split rendition. What makes this a winner for me, not withstanding the double exposure is the sympathetic balance of light \u0026amp colour connected  between the top half and bottom of the image frame. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: British Waters Compact. Does British ing get any better than a fun encounter with a grey seal pup? This youngster’s relaxed and curious face is captured perfectly by Martin, making us all want to be there too. - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: British Waters Living Together. Images tell stories but well thought out and executed ones speak volumes. This is such an example which feeds the eye with tales of the seaside on summer days, lively marine spectacles and excited human interaction. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)1545 Isles of Scilly, UKWinner: British Waters Wide Angle. Photographers often feel competition shots must be packed with new tricks to win. At UPY we always appreciate classic technique when it raises the bar of what has been done before. Rob\u0027s full technicolour wide angle scenic reveals the richness of UK seas with an elegant simplicity that is incredibly challenging to pull off in British conditions. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Wrecks. So simple yet so powerful the additional lighting of the turret and the main er perfectly positioned. This was a very strong category this year with a deserved winner and it\u0027s refreshing to read the acknowledgement to Leigh Bishop\u0027s pioneering work. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) The iconic silhouette of a seahorse is a graphically powerful picture. Here Zarina has raised that to another level with the addition of a red filter to her snooted strobe, reminiscent of a rim-lit animal at sunset. - Alex Mustard (Judge) All the judges found this to be probably the most distressing image to view but its uncompromising message must be seen by as many people as possible. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)As a subject we have seen our fair share of these colourful characters but this one shone through and the eggs almost look as if they have been inidually lit! - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Superb image with a perfect line across the split. Good exposure both above and below the water line and such an ideal subject to cap it all off. Excellent work. - Martin Edge (Judge)This is an excellent example for this category. It takes a tried and trusted angle but completely lifts it by using the fabric. It becomes more than an image a concept, a transition, a rebirth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)2245 Isles of Scilly, UKThis image stood out on many levels. Composition, colour vibrancy and contrast combined with an unusual angle kept us coming back to it and helped it rise in the rankings with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Perfect control of angle, light and focus. This was always up there with all of the judges. A clear favourite just like Nick Park’s genius creations. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I\u0027ve seen many images of eel and shrimp around Indonesia, however you have taken this two steps forward. 1) With your excellent idea to snoot the eye and 2) with your backlight on the shrimp. You can expect many photographers to practice your technique in the months to come. Congratulations for your vision. Very well thought out and executed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    It’s not what you’ve got, it’s what you do with it. The split may have been elusive but well worth the effort. This is a deceptively subtle excellent delivery. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)I have witnessed this behaviour from the surface with its high velocity \u0027testosterone and tonnage\u0027 and I remember thinking how happy I was to be in the boat. To have the presence of mind to time this shot whilst one\u0027s senses are being bombarded is heroic in my view. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) What an amazing moment. From the expression on the face of the unicornfish fleeing for its life, to the hunting pack of sharks, especially the leader with its mouth snapping open that fan out diagonally across this composition. And that is without considering what a great challenge it is to shoot these images of split second action, in the dead of night, underwater. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  There is so much energy in this image. If you look at it long enough you can begin to see just a hint of movement of all the fish around the coral. The colours are realistic and this top down shot works well.  - Martin Edge (Judge)A jaw-dropping wide angle scene with sharks, rays and mountains. A winning combination in the Up \u0026amp Coming category. - Alex Mustard (Judge)3045 Loch Long, Argyll and ButeThis is a subtle image with light and detail that are a delight to explore. The sunset, trees and underwater scene combine to create a wonderful feeling of the place. We particularly like how the composition allows the line of the shore to be continued underwater by the seaweeds.  - Alex Mustard (Judge)Photographing pike underwater is one thing but finding your own underwater artistic stamp is quite another matter. With this particular image the author has done just that! By using a slow shutter speed of 18th sec and a panning technique from right to left gives the impression of movement whilst the pike is pin sharp. - Martin Edge (Judge)Arthur’s image scores with both its foreground and background. The deadman’s fingers soft coral make an attractive foreground, enhanced by the crab sheltering within, and the striking sunbeams create beauty and atmosphere in the background. I also love the feeling of depth created by the legs of the jetty reaching up for the surface. - Alex Mustard (Judge)In recent UPY competitions UK macro images have lacked their overseas counterpart\u0027s flair and imagination but this magnificent shot raises the bar for everyone else to follow. World class from the UK at last. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Memorable photographs of people underwater are deceptively difficult and require both the photographer and model to be at the top of their game. The simplicity of the composition works to highlight the delicious details in the girl\u0027s pose. - Alex Mustard (Judge) This is a timeless scene that communicates a detailed story. The cavern, the silversides sheltering, the tarpon hunting and the er kneeling reverentially, taking it all in. It is a fabulous use of black and white to tell this story of shadows and light. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Sometimes it is the small detail which contributes so much. The white of the eye and the row of teeth in what could be construed as a smile convey mischief and menace in equal measures. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Once again Tobias you have succeeded in capturing one of the most photographed wrecks in the Red Sea and photographing it in a completely different way. You push the boundaries of wreck photography and I congratulate you for your vision and forward thinking of new ideas. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Perfect composition and framed against the stark black background. However it\u0027s the contrast of white on black which attracts the eye again and again every time this particular image popped up to greet us. The colour of the nudibranch was sufficiently bright enough to raise our senses again and again as it proceeded through the competition.  The soft delicate treatment of the snooted flash is also very well managed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    This shot puts you right in the picture and records a special encounter in a very special place. Every element contributes and the lucky or intended curve of the split creates great spatial depth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Symmetry, graphic simplicity and for once in UK waters a black background which contributes to a positive outer worldly delivery. A mould breaker. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I see and judge many images of the sockeye salmon but this is one of the best. The alignment of the two salmon not to mention the composition within the frame.  The surgy peak of the action is in perfect symmetry with the window which provides the viewer with topside influences of the trees against a vivid blue sky. There is so much image depth in this example. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Such a delicate image yet so full of emotion. There are times when there are no more words needed. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)UPY loves seahorse photos! Especially when they capture a fleeting behaviour, such as this. But we hadn\u0027t realised during judging that this was a new species of seahorse, nor did with know the incredible backstory behind this picture, we just loved the moment. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  Whether or not you like fashion photography underwater you would be hard pressed to see a more beautiful combination of complimentary colours and a very elegant pose. A very well executed image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)A portrait must leave you in no doubt. Simple lighting, illuminating all that is needed, captures this character. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)The footage was released on Thursday by Ningaloo Marine Interactions, the tour company which Mr Wilton works for.The hero himself suggested it was all in a day’s work.First known nursery for giant manta rays discovered in Gulf of Mexico“I’m often guiding snorkellers in the area and it’s as if she recognised me and was trusting me to help her,” he said.“She got closer and closer and then started unfurling to present the eye to me. I knew we had to get the hooks out or she would have been in big trouble. I went for a few es down to see how she’d react to me being close to her.”When the animal stayed calm, he approached and took out the hooks.The manta stayed completely still in the water,” he said.“It’s pretty incredible behaviour if this is what happened,” said David Boyle, lecturer in marine biology at the University of Plymouth. “It’s not uncommon for animals – generally mammals – to interact with ers but for one in distress to seek out assistance would be novel indeed.”Manta rays are believed to be some of the most intelligent creatures in the ocean. Unlike stingrays, they don’t have an external spike and are generally harmless to humans.Experts believe the injured eye would have become infected, leading to blindness and possible death.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

First of all, the pound is likely to drop significantly against other major currencies, as happened in the aftermath of the 2016 referendum.‘Many thousands’ of jobs lost in no-deal Brexit, minister warnsThis will rapidly increase the cost of imported raw materials and components at the same time as businesses have to deal with disruptions to their supply chain as the free movement of goods and services ends abruptly.Additional tariffs will further add to the cost of doing business as will non-tariff barriers such as customs checks, additional paperwork and quotas.Some businesses, such as those which rely heavily on sourcing parts from across the continent, will become unprofitable and inevitably have to lay off staff or even shut down completely.We have a number of forecasts of what this might mean for employment.In December, academics at the University of Sussex predicted that a no-deal scenario will cost 750,000 UK jobs, including 150,000 in London and over 80,000 in the northwest of England.Analysis by Cambridge Econometrics commissioned by the mayor of London forecasts 87,000 jobs lost in the capital by 2030 out of a nationwide total of half a million.Across the EU, around 1.2 million jobs would be lost, according to a recent paper from the University of Leuven. It concluded that Ireland, Belgium and the Netherlands would be the worst affected by a no-deal Brexit, with Dublin losing 50,330 jobs or 2.6 per cent of its entire workforce.This week the Northern Irish government sounded the alarm with a warning that the country would lose 40,000 jobs after a no-deal Brexit, primarily as a result of disruptions to trade with the Republic.While there is considerable variation in the predictions, all certainly support the business secretary’s assertion.The Bank of England’s Gertjan Vlieghe pointed to a further problem on Friday: that British workers,\u0026nbsphighly indebted and with low levels of savings, are ill-equipped to deal with the sudden slump in the labour market that Brexit may bring.“I remain concerned about the vulnerability of households to a downside surprise in income or employment, given the very low savings rate,” said Mr Vlieghe, who sits on the BoE’s interest rate-setting committee.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I started running in 1948 when I was a boy and since that time I have never left.”For the 20th time, and since its inception, Ruengo has crossed the finish line holding his national flag at the Safaricom Marathon in Lewa Wildlife Conservancy (LWC), a Unesco World Heritage site.\u0026nbspThe marathon is one of the toughest races in the world, and the only one to take place through a wildlife reserve. With an altitude of more than 5,500ft above sea level, a large part of the course is uphill, rolling across savannah plains and acacia woodland. There’s no respite from northern Kenya’s harsh sun, and participants battle the dust whipped up from the dirt road.\u0026nbsp“It’s got all the worst combinations,” says David Thuo, an aircraft engineer from Nairobi who completed the half marathon. “The altitude is very high, it goes uphill ... but I did get to see giraffes.”Runners say it’s the wildlife and landscape that draws them to these remote plains in\u0026nbspLewa. Sixteen-year-old runner\u0026nbspWinfred, who came in the top 10 in the children’s\u0026nbsp5km\u0026nbsprace, says she “enjoyed seeing the wildlife. It’s a special race.”Created with Sketch.On a walking safari in Kenya\u0027s Maasai Mara Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Sunrise over the conservancyCheetahs at Naboisho CampSundowners at Naboisho CampA starry night at Naboisho CampSunrise over the conservancyCheetahs at Naboisho CampSundowners at Naboisho CampA starry night at Naboisho CampA 61,000-acre area of protected land, the conservancy is home to critically endangered black rhino and Grevy’s zebra, as well as elephant and the big cats. The wildlife isn’t blocked from the course – runners often pass herds of zebra or giraffe lingering in the distance.\u0026nbsp“We’ve been trying to train the lions to become vegetarian but we haven’t succeeded,” Tusk CEO Charlie Mayhew said in the briefing the night before the race, drawing a nervous laugh from the crowd.\u0026nbspLed by conservation charity Tusk and LWC, the idea to organise a marathon though the reserve came from a conversation between Mayhew and the then-CEO of Lewa conservancy in the late Nineties.500ft above sea level, a large part of the course is uphill, rolling across savannah plainsTourists staying at the lodge would often ask if they could go for a jog. “And the answer is of course you can’t – but then it sparked an idea,” says Mayhew. “What about organising a running event here and using it as a way to raise money for conservation and the LWC?”Over the years Tusk has raised $5m for conservation efforts here in Lewa and across Kenya. The conservancy and the neighbouring communities who live here are supported by funds raised by the marathon – a medical clinic has opened, while a water irrigation project in nearby farmland has reached more than 4,000 people. \u0026nbsp“When great minds come together good things happen,” says Henry Wanyoike, 45-year-old Kenyan Paralympic champion. “I’m happy to be a part of it because the community benefits, and the environment, the animals. It’s very important for everyone.” \u0026nbspWe only interfere if the less friendly species are getting close to the trackFor organisers the impact is far-reaching, “planting a seed” for future conservationists.\u0026nbspFrom just 180 runners two decades ago, the race has grown to 1,400 participants from more than 27 countries. Runners from across Kenya take part, including wildlife rangers carrying full kit who represent the neighbouring conservancies, and warriors from local communities.\u0026nbspOrganisers say they’ve reached the limit – any more infrastructure to cater for participants and spectators would have too much of an impact on the reserve and its wildlife.\u0026nbspOn the race weekend you find rows of tents, stalls and music stages for post-race celebrations making it feel like its own version of Glastonbury (it takes place over the same weekend in June as the festival). There’s airport-style security, medical staff, caterers. “It’s a logistical nightmare,” says Mayhew.Indeed, the very nature of organising a marathon through a wildlife reserve brings its own set of challenges over the safety of humans, animals and landscape.\u0026nbspIndependent researchers conduct an environmental impact assessment of the marathon on the reserve every two to three years. But Mayhew claims the impact is “remarkably low”.\u0026nbsp“There’s a huge amount of conservancy left untouched. Any wildlife that is being spooked by the race has a huge amount of space,” he says. “We only interfere if the less friendly species are getting close to the track.”It’s not an easy course. To me, if I can make it here, I can make it anywhere in the worldHelicopter and a light aircraft fly overhead looking out for wildlife, while spotters are on hills overlooking the course.\u0026nbspIf any of the more dangerous species like buffalo, rhino or lion decide to get a bit too close to the track the airplane or helicopter will guide them away, using the sounds and the wind generated from the aircraft.\u0026nbspLast year a black rhino was spotted close to the course. Undeterred by the helicopter, organisers were forced to briefly stop the race until the rhino was a safe distance away.\u0026nbsp“This is what makes it so unique,” Mayhew says. “The whole idea of running in a game reserve really captures people’s imagination.”\u0026nbspOn race day the early morning haze soon turned to harsh heat.\u0026nbspRuengo\u0026nbsp(centre) celebrates at the finish line with his children“It’s not an easy course. To me, if I can make it here, I can make it anywhere in the world,” says Wanyoike. “But it’s one of the best races. We’re running on our own soil which means a lot.”Wanyoike is visually impaired, and is guided with his running partner Paul holding a cord. “It’s like an umbilical cord. He has to guide me through this, tell me when we are going up hill… he’s my eyes.”This was Wanyoike’s 17th marathon at Lewa, where he achieved a personal best for the half at just over 1hr 25min. The full marathon was won by Duncan Maivo at 2hr 20min, and Emmah Kilole at 2hr 50min in the women’s race.\u0026nbspFor Kevin Bliss, a regular marathon runner based in the US, it was “by far the toughest race given the terrain and the undulation. But when it got tough, I looked around at the landscape, heard the bird noises. It was awesome.”The oldest runner, Ruengo, celebrated at the finish line with his children. “I like running because I can’t grow old so quickly.

A\u0026nbspvery rich area of hidden tombs.”The\u0026nbsppyramid marked a key step in the evolution of pyramid construction.

The move is likely to be met by opposition within the Senate.Strait of Hormuz\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And the direct but illicit involvement of Magic Grandpa himself in what were meant to be independent investigations.Even before that came out, three peers resigned from the party because of the vast numbers of Jew-haters in Labour.One of those to quit is Lord Triesman, a top bloke. He was once a very capable boss of the Football Association. He resigned saying Labour was “instit- utionally anti-Semitic”.And he added that “the experience of le in the party has become sickening”.Even Corbyn’s closest allies among Labour MPs have had enough of him. Diane Abbott, for example. And the Shadow Chancellor, the sinister John McDonnell.Other Labour MPs are sick of being bullied by the convocation of weird Maoists, Trots and Leninists who surround Corbyn. People such as Seumas Milne and Andrew Murray .All of this has helped Labour sink to an astonishing all-time low of  per cent in the polls — at a time when we’ve had the worst Conservative Government in memory. Or at least since John Major was in charge.And now the party has finally turned its back on the people it was set up to support, the working class.It has decided to back the idea of a second referendum on Brexit, junking its previous decision to “respect the vote”.Hundreds of thousands of Labour voters in the North of England will be lost to the party as a consequence, possibly for ever.So the knives are out for Grandpa and I don’t see him lasting much longer. It is now a case of WHEN he goes, not IF he goes. But even when he goes, what can a new leader do with this rabble Don’t forget, the party is controlled entirely by the activists. And those are the , middle-class, liberal lefties and perpetual adolescents who joined the party en masse for three quid to ensure Corbyn was elected leader.They have nothing in common with Labour’s old voter base, the working class. They are opposed to Brexit. They are in favour of Hamas, Venezuela and Cuba. They support identity politics, with its endless hierarchy of victimhood groups.So the likelihood, then, is that a new leader will also come from the juvenile far Left.There are some great Labour MPs who would make excellent leaders of the party — Caroline Flint, for example, or Jon Cruddas. But do they stand a chance any more, seeing how the party is It’s more likely we’ll end up with John McDonnell, an unrepentant Marxist who thought IRA bombers should be given honours by the British government. Or one of his and Corbyn’s proteges.It could well be the end of the party as a viable political force full-stop.Ah well. Time to say goodbye to Jezza. It was fun while it lasted, mate. In a really grim kind of way.GRIM viewing, wasn’t it  That leadership debate.Smirky Hunt trying to convince everyone he has charisma and stands a chance of winning. And our next Prime Minister, Bozo, incapable of giving a straight answer to anything.Can you imagine asking Boris the time “Well, ha ha, I think that’s a very interesting question. And some people may be prepared to tell you it’s eleven o’clock, or perhaps five to five. But I’m not going to do that. No. Not me. That’s for others to say.“I will tell you, beyond all doubt, that it is definitely not seven o’clock, and that’s the important thing, the thing voters care about. And that’s why I think I should be your Prime Minister. Because I will never tell the electorate it is seven o’clock when it isn’t. And, indeed, even when it is.“Does that answer your question, Julie ”GOOD – he’s gone. Sir Kim Darroch, our ambassador to the US.Caught out when leaked messages revealed he thinks Donald Trump is “inept” and the White House dysal.He had to go, evenhe has become a darling of the liberal establishment here for hating Trump.Here’s a suggestion. How about we get as his replacement someone who understands Trump and Trump’s appeal to US voters DO you really think Boris Johnson is going to get us out of the European Union  Properly, I mean, much as we voted for If so, pass the hallucinogens. I could do with getting out of my head too.My guess is we will leave in part, with a deal slightly weaker than the dog’s breakfast Theresa May put before us. And don’t be too surprised by a general election pretty soon. That will cheer us all up.Never have so many people been let down by their leaders. You can read about how Brexit was betrayed in my new book, The Great Betrayal, out next week.It’s a sorry story and it should make you angry. Mind you, it’s also quite funny,you have a warped sense of humour.THIS is Geronimo the alpaca. Take a good look at him because he’s not going to be around much longer.The Government has decided he must be slaughtered because, according to a possibly flawed report, he carries a strain of bovine tuberculosis. His owner, Helen Macdonald, is utterly distraught.The killing of Geronimo, and the wholesale slaughter of our badgers, has been forced on the Government by the farmers. They have way too much power.They create sterile landscapes on vast subsidies.It’s time for all this to stop. For our sake, as well as Geronimo’s.HAVE we ever had a member of the Royal Family who was smugger, more full of herself, more truly bloody irritating, than Meghan OK, King John was a bit of a t***er . . . but things were dferent in the th century. And more recently there’s been Fergie, I suppose.She had a few airs and graces and, like her ex-husband Andrew, was a bit of a . But at least she wasn’t a hypocrite.Meghan is insufferably woke – forever bleating about social-justice “ishoos” but happy to swan around in a private jet and have us pay millions for her cottage in Windsor.Now she’s decided she doesn’t like people taking pics of her when she’s on another freebie to Wimbledon.Get real, love, before you alienate the entire British public . . . instead of just chippy little monkeys like me.Or: “We had fizzy pop delivered.”More pertinently, “I have six teeth left,” or: “I remember hating Leeds United even before Don Revie arrived.”But that’s ten words and thus inadmissible.I SEE that Nicki Minaj has cancelled her concert in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.Everyone told her it’s a foul country where they don’t treat women especially well.But she seemed determined to push on.My worry is thatNicki dressed on stage the way she usually dresses on stage, she’d be on permanent display in Saudi, with her head on top of a pole. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

As he himself said, his job had become “impossible”.But this whole episode has been utterly depressing, and there is plenty of blame to go around.Perhaps Sir Kim was a little loose in his language, but no diplomat could ever expect his confidential notes to senior figures in London to end up on the front of the papers.The tributes since his resignation certainly suggest that this was the first time he’d put a foot even slightly wrong in his entire career.And the President — who is a friend of Britain — should have realised that when it comes to diplomacy, the shoot-from-the-hip style he uses on social media can have consequences.No newspaper complains about a leak, but whoever undermined Sir Kim by releasing his not-quite-diplomatic cables should reflect on the damage it has done to not just our international standing but to the Foreign Office’s ability to do its job.As for the Boris “row”, it’s unedying to see his detractors weaponising this sorry saga against him.Whatever he had said on the TV debate, Sir Kim’s position was already sadly untenable.Moving forward, the Special Relationship must remain special.Our links with America are stronger than one ambassador, from security to our shared culture.But we must never be complacent about the ties to our closest ally.YOU can see why Labour has turned on the journalists behind last night’s Panorama investigation into the party’s dreadful handling of anti-Semitism in its ranks.The programme was damning from start to finish. It details the most extraordinary levels of racism in all corners of the party and a total refusal of the leadership to do anything about it.Indeed the party appears to have actually tried to strangle worthwhile investigations at birth, and to have actively interfered in the disciplinary process.Corbyn’s useful idiots have predictably turned on the whistleblowers – ironic, considering Labour’sShadow Chancellor once handed a petition to No calling for better protection for those brave enough to call their employers out for bad practice.Hypocrites, the lot of them.It may not be the case that Corbyn himself is a racist, but goodness, he does seem to attract an awful lot of them — and be too thick or ignorant to notice they’re there.The party’s rotten, from top to bottom.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Repeated attempts to find out about this shameful case through freedom of information have been rebuffed.”Lord Maginnis contrasted the treatment of Mr Hegarty – now a senior figure in the Parades Commission – with that of victims of historical abuse.“We have lost all sense of reality when a portrait of Her Majesty can cause offence to a civil servant but we do not bat an eyelid when we deny closure and justice to unfortunate people who have been abused in the most outrageous manner imaginable.”He urged the department to restore the portraits of the Queen and her husband.Last night the NIO, which has offices in Belfast and London, said: “We will not comment on inidual personnel matters.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The back part of the building is essential a windowless shed.”She described the flats in Purley as ridiculously small, with more light in the corridor than in the actual property.Instead of external windows, owners will be able to view an internal atrium garden with only seven trees, The Times reported.Other lucky owners will share a corridor with offices, and instead of windows, the apartments will be developed with privacy film.The Barnet Society, a residents’ organisation, described the proposal as “a cynical exploitation of planning loopholes — compounded by disregard for basic human needs”.Their submissions come after it was revealed landlords were planning to convert offices into small flats.In Purley, the newspaper reported more than  of the sized flats will be able to fit on to a tennis court.The Cowell Group and Dandi Living said that they “take great pride in their track record for delivering high end, aesthetic and affordable housing”.Croydon council told the newspaper: “As in this case, the law restricts councils’ right to refuse approval for permitted development orders.Unless there are issues with contamination, flooding and transport, factors including size and suitability cannot be considered.”It said that it inspected properties under a landlord licensing scheme to ensure “they meet decent standards on space and fire safety, and pass building control checks” and it planned to investigate the Purley building.The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: “All homes created under permitted development rights must meet building regulations and the prime minister last month called for new regulations to mandate developers to build higher-quality housing, including ensuring the Nationally Described Space Standard applies to all new homes.”"},{"url":null,"title":"man claims pub discriminated strange looks","story":"Bearded and long-haired Nicolai Gamulea Schwartz, , says his locals attitude towards him changed after he stopped offering professional photography services for free - and now he has been banned for creepy behaviour towards women.Nicolai was asked to leave his favourite bar, The Polar Bear, in Hull after some women complained that his behaviour made them feel uncomfortable.I got banned from my favourite pub because, allegedly, some female customers have complained that I was creepy and stood too close to them on the dance floor, Nicolai said.I may look strange with my long hair and beard, and people sometimes do say that I look scary, but Id never do anything inappropriate to upset someone, so being kicked out with no warning is so shocking.I wasnt even given the chance to explain myself or apologise when the event allegedly happened - I just got told by bouncers the next time I walked in [to The Polar Bear] that I couldnt go there anymore.Nicolai explained that he felt that he had done nothing wrong, I know that I did not do any touching, twerking, talking, or making sexual advances, jokes. I wasnt rude, or displaying threatening body language, or even drunk and starting fights, he said.There was no breaking of glassware on my part, no puking, no p***ing or drawing on the wall. No.Simply by being there, in their proximity and doing nothing, I was creepy and for that I got banned from The Polar Bear completely out of the blue, with no warning whatsoever.I used to be treated as a VIP there while I was offering them professional photography work for free, but then I stopped doing that and I was instantly demoted to tolerated.But in the long run, middle aged foreign male creeps who do nothing cant be tolerated forever, can they Its really upsetting - I feel hurt and have friends that always go there that I wont be able to see.According to their Facebook page, The Polar Bear has been going since the s and claims to have represented every facet of Hulls unique nightle at some point during its letime.The Polar Bear describe themselves as A unique venue set within the surroundings of a traditional boozer, and  a hub for Hull’s creative types boasting an enviable roster of DJ’s each with monthly offerings provide a erse range of nights to suit all music tastes.The Sun Online has contacted The Polar Bear for comment."},{"url":null,"title":"mps lords houses in order karren brady","story":"Nearly two years on from #MeToo, two new reports paint a bleak picture of sexual harassment in Westminster.The first report, about the House of Lords, found that one in five peers was considered to behave in an inappropriate or high-handed way to staff. One Lord was described as a “notorious bullying pervert” by a Westminster worker.The verdict was that the prevailing culture and behaviour in the House of Lords “has not been conducive to an open and supportive culture to ensure all those working there are treated with dignity and respect”.Worse, the report concluded those staff on the receiving end of bullying and harassment generally did not complain because they thought nothing would change, or feared reprisal.Clearly, the House of Lords has issues. But it’s nowhere near as bad as the House of Commons. The second report, by Gemma White QC into inappropriate conduct in Westminster, concluded MPs’ staff face “unacceptable risk of bullying and harassment”.It found sexual harassment in Parliament is seen by young staff as a “necessary evil”they want to progress. Witnesses describe speaking out against any abuse as “career suicide”.Even though both reports state only a small minority of MPs or Lords behave in unacceptable ways, this has been tolerated for too long and shining a light on it will bring about change.What’s clear to me, both from reading the report and working at the House of Lords, is that this is a generational issue. The House of Lords is full of older people stuck in a time warp.Many of them live in a world where it’s still acceptable for women — often females of a lower status to them — to be patted on the bottom or on the head.The House of Lords can feel a bit like a boys’ boarding school, or Hogwarts. It’s populated predominantly by old white men, many of whom lead a le insulated from the real world.That said, the worst behaviour I witness is usually in the library, where Lords often retire after lunch and which rings with the sound of ear-deafening snoring and, I am sorry to say, farting.The only time I’ve ever seen anyone being actively rude was when one Lord commanded a member of canteen staff to get him a bag of crisps. He was so close he could have reached out and got it himself.I’ve also been on the receiving end of the odd condescending comment, such as when a Lord looked me up and down and said: “You’re dressed rather casually.” I was wearing Stella McCartney trousers at the time, so not exactly jeans.Crucially, though, I wasn’t wearing a dress. So I looked him up and down and said: “Dressing casually is better than dressing badly” — and that was the end of that.It must be horrible to work in an organisation where you feel inferior and can’t speak your mind — and,you do, people either shrug or shut you down. The report about the House of Lords suggested it should be mandatory for all employees to go on a “how to value people” course. Some people might see it as unnecessary — but we send West Ham staff on them and they are good.But that’s not the only change required. There’s neither enough women, nor cultural ersity. The only way that will change is by electing a more erse chamber.In the meantime, I hope this report does not diminish, in people’s minds, the important legislation work the House of Lords does and the role it plays in holding the Commons to account. I hope these reports don’t stop people from remembering what an important institution it is.As Spider-Man said: “With great power comes great responsibility” — and as one who sits in the House of Lords, I know I am not the only one who feels it is a great responsibility.BIG news. MPs have voted to make same-sex marriage legal in Northern Ireland.By a massive margin of  to , the House of Commons backed an amendment demanding the province be brought into line with the rest of the country by October  . . . unless Stormont s and decides otherwise.

He said many big stores rarely call police as the force is so stretched.Instead, the detectives working for the flagship stores use citizen’s arrest powers to detain dippers. They then record details from their ID cards, take their mug shots and issue le-time store bans.The experienced private detective, who did not want to be named, said: “We do call the police sometimes. If the dipper has thousands of pounds on them we’ll flag it as important but it can still take up to four hours for the police to turn up.”The investigator said the women compete with one another to be the best and have their own league table “similar to the Premier League”.A thief calling herself Diana the Express is currently No. in the world based on her hauls. Another group has been dubbed the Spice Girls, because they always operate in a group of five.The detective added: “One is Scary, one is Baby but the others are known as Old Spice, Chubby Spice and Pretty Spice because it best fits their descriptions.“Dippers bounce from city to city once their cover has been blown and move all over the country. Only the best come to Oxford Street. It’s basically the equivalent of playing in a Champions League final at Wembley.“When they’ve got enough they go home to their huge houses. I’ve seen pictures on their phones. They live in mansions with marble floors and marble beds.”The women are reported to be from the Plov, Sofia and Varna areas in Bulgaria and Bucharest, in Romania. The private investigator said they first began arriving in London in around  when EU rules on movement were eased.Initially, most carried only their Bulgarian or Romanian ID cards but since the Brexit poll many have UK driving licences as they think it will help them re-enter the UK. On world-famous Oxford Street, he said, their favourite places are Harrods, Selfridges or bureau de change desks.Lting the lid on their daily le, he said: “They work quite civilised hours. They start when shops get busy, so any time from am really. They have lunch in McDonald’s at around pm.“Their witching hours are between pm and pm. We don’t have enough manpower to detain or deter them all during those hours as they’re all over the place.“If we see a pair they will Romanian. If they are in larger groups they are generally Bulgarian. We tend to stick with the ones we are following andwe see others we hope to pick them up later.He said the thieves wear designer sunglasses and expensive handbags to blend in with their wealthy intended victims. “We recognise them straight away. They dress up but wear trainers so they can move quickly.”Many wear headscarves to try to hide their identity. He went on: “They’re very aware of us. We’ve detained most of them before so they often recognise us. We often work in pairs so it’s more dficult for them to spot us.”Describing their techniques, he added: “They’ll pick up a victim but don’t speak to each other. They float around the shops. Their favourites tend to be busy and expensive but also like more mainstream shops like Gap and Topshop as they are large stores.“Once in a store they get a load of clothes off the rail to use to block themselves from view. They spot the person they want to pick up and do the dip in the store or follow the victim into the street.“They use distraction techniques. One dipper, for example, will go in front of the victim and stop them. They might bend to pretend to do up their shoelace or make out they are on the phone.When the victim stops the other dipper will get their purse or cash envelope. They also use maps. One will stop a victim and say they are lost while the other gets the money.“They work with military precision. Hand and eye gestures are enough for them to know what the other is doing. If they notice that we are trailing them they go into the nearest McDonald’s.They won’t commit a crime once they’ve seen us and it is only when we witness a crime that we can detain them.”He went on: “These women know every trick in the book. They’ve been trained since they were born. We teach our kids to read and the families that these women come from teach them how to dip.They very, very rarely get caught and I have to take my hat off to the level of skill and also confidence they have.“I think the public would struggle to comprehend how frequent and organised dipping is here now.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Another video recorded on a camera left in an unattended room picks up a knocking noise and the same voice saying release. Mr Moss said: Hearing it say it wanted to burn my eyes was terrying at the time and to have members of the public along with us who witnessed it was just crazy. What is also signicant is that a few years ago we also captured a voice saying something along the lines of reap your eyes and a number of people have had the sensation of their eyes burning but we never thought too much of it until this incident. We believe this doll gained its attachment in Ruthin and over the last few months we have recorded some good evidence including knocking sounds and the same voice several times which has been captured and heard in real time.  Weaposve had knocking sounds and a voice saying release me which was captured on the box and the camera shows nobody  was in the room. It is interesting as it is always three knocks wherever we take the doll and always the same voice.Mr Moss has compared the Grace doll to the famous Annabelle doll which has been the subject of a series of horror films.The first Annabelle film was released in  as a prequel to The Conjuring, and the latest movie in the series Annabelle Comes Home hit UK theatre screens yesterday .  The supernatural horror film is inspired by the story of a raggedy Anne doll which was given to a student nurse in America in the s.

Paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, who have since died, were called in to help and the doll is now kept in a glass box at the Warrenaposs Occult Museum in Connecticut. Mr Moss said: Some people may compare it to the doll Annabelle from the films. Hollywood have dramatised the Annabelle a lot and things are dferent in real le. Things donapost go flying around the room and people donapost get possessed like you see in the films. People may be skeptical and say our Grace doll findings are fake but we have caught them in real time and Iaposll admit even I was never a big believer but this item is just amazing. Iaposve never seen anything like it. Without a doubt it is the most haunted item in the UK. A lot of people have experienced it.

Humberside Police burst into a home in Hull equipped with an arrest warrant in a bid to crack down on drug dealing. While they did arrest two men at the property and said they found a numerous amount of drugs, the real takeaway was the filthy state of the house. Photos of the squalid home show rubbish piled almost as high as the ceiling and a staircase rotten close to the point of falling down, Hull Daily Mail reported. Bags of human faeces wrapped in tin foil were found hanging from the backs of doors close to toilets caked in filth.    It appeared the houseaposs occupants had been sleeping on a chair surrounded by the squalor. The filth continued into the back garden, where dumped shopping trolleys, televisions and fridges lay around four cars, one of which was a Rolls Royce. The raid was not the first time officers had searched the rancid residence.    Over the last  years the property had been visited several time by cops, with a dead dog in the freezer a previous notable find. PC Scott Greenwood said: This is one of the worst houses the officers have ever been to. I think only one of them had said they had seen worse than this.    The officers are wearing forensic-type suits over their unorms because our highest priority is their safety while we conduct the searches, and we don’t want them catching anything. This is a privately-owned home that has been in the same family for over  years, and it has been a problem for residents for a long time now. The house was in such disrepair the ten raiding officers were unable to search upstairs.    Since the police intervention Hull City Council moved to close the house off. This is a great outcome for us, PC Greenwood continued. Not only have we secured and closed a house but we have two in custody and found drugs.    “It’s a great feeling to know we have done our job for the community and sorted what has been a problem for them for years. “The men in custody will now have access to our nurses and doctors, and help for any mental health needs.” Residents living in the street spoke of their ongoing issues with the propertyaposs occupants.    One man, who said he knew the occupants from  years ago, said: The woman who once owned the house was salt of the earth, and would go to church every Sunday. Now the people living there are living in squalor. I’ve been in that house and I can tell you it’s disgusting. They have no respect for themselves, let alone other people and property.

Gurvinder Gill, the mother of -year-old Calum, said her le has never been the same since the death of her intelligent and handsome son on May , . A University of Hull law student, Calum was on a bus ride to Radio One Big Weekend when he developed a horrid grey pallor on board the bus and was moaning without making sense. The bus was stopped and an off-duty nurse tried to help him before an ambulance arrived. He later died in Hull Royal Infirmary surrounded by his family.  Facing Connor Tyler-Treanor, , who has been jailed for three years after he was found to have supplied drugs to the student, Ms Gill said her son was an intelligent, talented, handsome, and loving child. The pain of losing my son Calum is indescribable. I spend my le now wishing I was dead, hoping that when I go to bed at night I donapost wake up in the morning. You see I also died on the th May because I have no future, as this has been stolen from me along with any dreams or hopes I had for this family.Police investigating the tragedy discovered Tyler-Treanor - using the pseudonym Saul - and another unidentied man had set themselves up as drug dealers deliberately targeting students in the city,  Hull Crown Court  heard. Tyler-Treanor was not prosecuted on the basis he had supplied the fatal drugs, but sentencing judge Recorder Caroline Goodwin QC said Calumaposs death was an aggravating feature of the case, Hull Daily Mail reports.   In the harrowing victim statement read out to the court on Friday, Mrs Gill Gurvinder revealed how Calum had only finished his final exams the previous day. He planned to work as a leguard in an American summer camp before teaching at an English language school in China. She also spoke about how her family had moved out of the home they had been in for the past  years because of all the memories, and that she could no longer work in the finance sector despite decades of experience. But she nonetheless said she will strive to pull together for her other son, who is  years old.  Prosecutor Phillip Evans said when police searched Calumaposs accommodation, they found a typed note in the kitchen advertising the sale of drugs, which said MDMA, Molly, Mandy. It was said to be  per cent pure, was offered in  quantities of up to two grams, and had a price list.  The note also offered made to order bombs costing between £ and £. A delivery service was also advertised to areas of the city heavily populated with students. A telephone number under the name Saul was also given.That number led police to Tyler-Treanoraposs address, who initially tried to evade officers to dump cannabis in some foliage. But he quickly realised the futility of his actions and showed police what turned out to be  grams of cannabis.  Police found further cannabis inside the property worth a total of £.. Tyler-Treanor was arrested and further drugs paraphernalia was seized, including grip-seal bags, a grinder, a list of numbers, scales, and mobile phones. An expert drugs officer analysed messages on the phones and found a conversation between Calum and Saul, in which Calum was trying to acquire MDMA for the forthcoming Radio One event, Mr Evans said. Saul offers to supply these drugs to Calum, the prosecutor said. The officer said the messages showed Tyler-Treanor was engaged in the street-level dealing of MDMA and cannabis between January and June .

Concern over Northern Rail grew so severe that Manchester’s Mayor Andy Burnham and Liverpool City Region Mayor Steve Rotheram both called for it to be stripped of its franchise. Reacting to the big pay rises given to Arriva chief Dr Manfred Rudhart and other bosses, Mr Burnham said: “This will stick in passengers’ throats.    “The company has failed to provide a good service but is rewarding its top bosses with lavish salaries. It shows how broken our rail system is.” Mr Burnham also blasted the fact that £million was taken out of Arriva and given to its German shareholders, Deutsche Bahn. He added: “The franchising system allows a foreign-owned company to siphon money from our railways whilst failing to do what they were contracted to.” Deutsche Bahn, which announced plans to sell Arriva to plug a cashflow crisis, took idends of £.million and £.million that could have gone back into services.

Emily Oliver is receiving end of le care at a hospice as her family vows to leave no stone unturned in trying to fight for a cure. The University of Nottingham student fell ill in January  and it was later confirmed she has a glioblastoma brain tumour. And despite being ill, she selflessly used her st birthday in October as a way to collect money to fund research. She has already raised more than £,.But she is now receiving end of le care at the Princess Alice Hospice in Esher, reports Nottinghamshire Live.   Dad Tim Oliver, the Conservative leader of Surrey County Council, said Emily was overwhelmed by the support she got on her birthday last year. She was very proud of that, he said. Emily has been unbelievable just in the way she has coped with this illness. Never has she said aposwhy me apos Nobody is to blame. Itaposs just a horrible quirk of nature. She has gone through some horrendous treatments. But she has fought all the way through and we will continue to fight for her. The reality is there is no cure for these types of tumours. Our hope is one day, this dreadful disease, we will find a cure for it. It wonapost help us but hopefully it will help other parents.  Brain tumours are the biggest cancer killer of children and adults under  - , deaths each year - and just  percent of adults survive for five years after diagnosis, the charity says. It adds that brain tumour research accounts for less than  percent of more than £ million spent on cancer research in the UK every year. Glioblastomas are the most common cancerous brain tumour in adults and are fast growing and likely to spread. It is not known why they start to grow but the charity is funding research into possible causes, focused around genes. Emily underwent radiotherapy and chemotherapy, then followed the same treatment route as Tessa Jowell. Baroness Jowell, a Labour MP, was diagnosed with a glioblastoma in May  and campaigned for better funding and treatments until her death a year later.  Emily saw a consultant in Los Angeles and was referred to a teaching hospital in Germany where DNA was taken from the tumour to create a vaccine. Another trial drug was tried in an effort to slow down the growth of the tumour but Emily started to deteriorate in April this year. There is no further treatment, Mr Oliver said. We are just waiting for the tumour to do what itaposs going to do. We have done absolutely everything that could be done. We have left no stone unturned.

The lunar-tics who say the Apollo  landing was all a hoax – staged in a Hollywood Studio to distract from the ­unpopular Vietnam war, boost America’s esteem and stuff it up the Soviets. Because that footage watched by  million people around the world ­really was incredible. The lunar module looked like it was made of Meccano and the bouncing astronauts could have been Thunderbirds figures. And that iconic image of Armstrong’s first ­footprint in the dust – was it faked as the doubters say  Of course not, because ALL the ­conspiracy theories have been debunked countless times. Yet,  years later,  per cent of Americans and millions of other earthlings still believe it was a massive con. Even though the computers, tablets and mobiles they share their theories on couldn’t existman hadn’t landed on the moon. Even though their cordless vacs, LED lights, memory foam mattresses, cushioned trainers, power tools, Alexa, Instagram ­images and much more would never have been invented without the giant leaps of Nasa science. But there is real tragedy in denying the truth of the moon landing.   It is also denying the joy of knowledge, the wonder of discovery and the power of beauty.And it squanders the unying power of shared humanity and awe at the cosmos which swept the globe when Armstrong set foot on the powdery surface on July , .Don’t we need that more than ever today  In  when JFK made his famous “we chose to go to the moon” speech he said this: “We set sail on this new sea because there is new ­knowledge to be gained and new rights to be won. And they must be won and used for the progress of all people.” Astronauts who have looked back at our Earth from the surface of the moon talk of the overview effect – the sense of the sense of the futility of wars and national conflicts and how vital it is to protect our own planet. As one Russian cosmonaut said: “It isn’t important in which sea or lake you observe a slick of pollution or in which country a fire in the forest breaks out. You are standing guard over the whole of our Earth.” Armstrong and Aldrin’s footprints are still up there on the surface of the moon as there is no wind to blow them away. And we must never allow the conspiracy theorists to trample on their legacy. I say bra-vo to Stella for not washing every stitch    People got their knickers in a knot this week when fashion designer Stella McCartney revealed she rarely washes her bras. She hates washing ANY clothes, actually, and would never clean a suit but “let the dirt dry and brush it off”. “Eugh!” went the youngsters who can’t go anywhere without anti-bac and throw their togs in the machine – sorry, on the floor next to the washing basket – after a few hours wear. But eco-conscious Stella is quite right. We’ve become paranoid about dirt, wound-up by TV and internet cleaning gurus who make a fortune plugging products. But one machine wash can release nine million plastic microfibres into our rivers and oceans, damaging wildle. If you’re “clean in your habits” – as my nan used to say – and wash yourself every day there’s no need to overload the Hotpoint. So, like Stella’s bras, I support her fully.I did like to be beside the seaside I had a lovely time on the beach at Weymouth the other day. It was the first time I’d visited the Dorset resort since my ninth birthday in , so I expected it to have changed beyond recognition. Especially as it’s now one of the most-Instagrammed seaside resorts in the UK.    I thought – and feared, to be honest – that it would be all cocktails, bistros and fake-tanned Love Island types in their designer cozzies. But I was thrilled to discover that it has hardly changed, with plenty of cream teas, fish and chip shops and sunburned blokes with big bellies in too-small Speedos. The BBs are a bit pricier of course, but Weymouth still has all the joys of the traditional British seaside. And the lack of pink, fur-trimmed Kiss Me Quick hats, rude rock and willy-shaped inflatables prove it’s yet to be ruined by the stag and hen do hordes.Lying tuckers Men who have had facelts appear more honest to women, according to new research. Experts at a US university found blokes who had nips and tucks to knock a few years off got the benefit of appearing more trustworthy too. I bet plastic surgeons start doing BOGOF deals now. For all those two-faced b******s.    Iaposll veer off the Vermouth When I first started going out-out as a teenager in the s my favourite drink was Cinzano and lemonade. It was the height of sophistication, plugged on TV by the glam Joan Collins who’d always get a cleavage-full thanks to her bumbling beau Leonard Rossiter. “Getting your head down, sweetie  Jolly good idea.” I was also partial to a Martini Rosso, advertised by that racy roller skating waitress and the innuendo-laced slogan: “Any time, any place, anywhere.”  They’re unlikely to resurrect either of those ads but it seems vermouth, the spirit in both drinks, is the trendy new tipple. Specialist bars are popping up around the country and Instagram influencers are posting pictures of themselves sipping vermouth over ice with soda or tonic in all sorts of exotic locations. I can’t touch the stuff now, though. A night on Cinzano and Martini in  wasn’t a jolly good idea and resulted in me getting my head down with the world’s worst hangover. So I won’t be raising a glass of vermouth – any time, any place or anywhere. Iaposd get the bird on the dancefloor Snowball the head-banging cockatoo has worried me for years. I laughed myself silly at videos of him bopping to Queen, Cyndi Lauper and the Backstreet Boys, posted online by his US owner. Until some bird fans said his dancing was a distress display, brought on by over-loud music.  But university experts in Massachusetts have studied Snowball closely and concluded that he is, truly, a feathered Fred Astaire with  separate dance moves to match dferent rhythms. It indicates “he has circuits in the brain for processing beats similar to our own”. Eh   moves  They clearly haven’t seen my distressing displays on the dance floor.

Maybe that is because we are self-employed, so we are more in control of when we want to work and how often. We also love what we do.

Shocking new figures show nearly one in four of the Ministry of Defence’s entire housing stock is not being used. And this includes , homes that have not been lived in for more ­than THREE YEARS. Of the , empty properties, , are available for occupancy. Last night Labour MP Gareth Thomas blasted the situation as ­a ­scandal and called for the empty homes to be given to our homeless heroes. He said: “I’m gobsmacked by these figures. It really is shocking that all these homes are sitting empty and not being used when they could be used to house homeless former members of the armed services.” Defence bosses admit that up to four per cent of Britain’s estimated , homeless are ex-forces. That means up to , veterans – many suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder – don’t have a home.    Mr Thomas, MP for London’s Harrow West, said: “All the empty homes could plug that gap immediately. Given that these men and women have served their country – some of them going in harm’s way for us all – the very least we can do is provide them with a home at their time of greatest need.” The MP wants the MoD to copy America where empty homes are given to military charities for them to set up housing co-operatives. He said: “These housing cooperatives can provide accommodation for veterans but also back that up with support such as counselling and ­employment advice to help them get their lives back on track.” Some of the properties left empty are riddled with damp and mould – as we revealed earlier this year.

Celebration was once hailed as the ultimate dream town for Disney aficionados where they could escape to their very own fantasy land. Around billion was invested by The Walt Disney Company into developing it on the outskirts of Disney World in Florida  years ago. And envious homes - painted white, yellow, pink, tan or blue - and its lush green gardens, bordered by white picket fences, lined the streets. In autumn, the town used to import fallen leaves to waft around, and in winter fake snow was put on rooftops. While trees were fitted with speakers playing never-ending bird song.    It appeared to be every inch “The Happiest Place on Earth”. The town soon expanded and became equipped for , with a hospital and school nearby. Residents even referred to it as aposThe Bubbleapos because it was like living in a separate universe. While some compared it to something out of the Stepford Wives film.But cracks soon began to show with aposdodgyapos buildings, strict rules, a dysal and weird school - and death, reports News .Celebration might have been many things, but it was not a Disney theme park. It was a real town with real problems, said historical writer LJ Charlston. Plans for the town were first announced in . Demand was so high that the company asked people to enter a lottery to be in with a chance of snapping up one of the  homes. Around , people entered longing for a piece of perfection.  The original sales brochure boasted: There once was a place where neighbours greeted neighbours in the quiet of summer twilight. Where children chased fireflies. And porch swings provided easy refuge from the cares of the day. The movie house showed cartoons on Saturday. The grocery store delivered. And there was one teacher who always knew you had that special something. Remember that place  But as residents came and went complaints of the painfully contrived ­prettiness and physical ­perfection began to emergeIt was claimed that every house had to have a Mickey Mouse hidden somewhere in the property - just one rule in the -page regulations book that residents were said to have been expected to follow.Only certain plants were reportedly allowed in gardens, and special lanes were built behind homes to hide cars and rubbish bins. While residents are said to have only been allowed to have certain coloured curtains and had to keep their manicured lawns at a specic height.Residents Ory and Jan Schiesel, a retired ­couple from Michigan, told the Daily Mail in : If you don’t like rules, you don’t want to live here.They said no two adjoining houses could look alike, no home could have more than two cars on the street, while the blinds or curtains had to be white on the outside.  Mr Schiesel added: Technically,you don’t have enough bark in your ground cover or you have dead plants in your porch, they’ll send you a letter. As the years passed, there were also complaints of leaking roofs and other issues with the properties.An inquiry set up to investigate found that at least  homes needed new roofs.The school also came under fire with classrooms supposedly rammed with  children between three teachers. Many families chose to sell their homes and move away over the “serious academic shortcomings.” But more sinister things were to come. In , the town was rocked by an armed home invasion. A couple were bound and gagged in their home by a gang of masked burglars. Then in November , resident Matteo Patrick Giovanditto, , who lived alone with his Chihuahua, Lucy, was strangled with a shoelace and bludgeoned to death with an axe.    The alarm was raised by neighbours who called police after they had not seen the teacher for several days. Police then made the grisly discovery. David Israel Zenon Murillo, who was  and homeless at the time, received a le sentence for the murder. He told police he flew into a rage after Mr Giovanditto tried to sexually assault him. After the slaying, former pupils of Mr Giovanditto came forward and claimed he had molested them and invited them to sleepovers at his house.An anonymous mother alleged to The Daily Beast  that Mr Giovanditto - who she has described as a aposcunning paedophile predatorapos - developed a close relationship with her -year-old son.She claimed he treated him to trips abroad to countries including Mexico, Japan and China. But the boy suddenly cut all ties with Mr Giovanditto at the age of  and she alleged she later learned her sonaposs aposmentorapos had been sexually abusing him for years. Days after Mr Giovandittoaposs death, a man named Craig Foushee, , also a Celebration resident, barricaded himself in his own house for  hours. He began shooting at police officers outside. None were injured, but when they entered the house they found Mr Foushee dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.  The former airline pilot was said to have been deeply depressed following his orce, loss of home and the failure of his security business. Meanwhile, there was also talk of a aposdeath pondapos near the idyllic town with the cookie-cutter homes. Up until  there was no warnings on the road that,you took a wrong turn, you risked driving into the water. There were several incidents that gave the pond its macabre name. The most well-known involved three young men who’d been holidaying in Florida in the summer of  before they mysteriously vanished. Their bodies were discovered nine months later inside a car at the bottom of the lake. Malcolm Longley, a property investor who moved to Celebration from Maidenhead, also claimed there was a seedy side to Celebration with aposwe-swappingapos being re. He said in : We call it Celebration Separation. Pretty much all the British people I know who have moved here have come happily married and ended up orced. It’s an incestuous town, and there’s an element of we-swapping.    I’d never met swingers that much until I came here. Gavin Todd admitted that he had seen some move to Celebration to hide away from problems and find some fairytale ending, but they don’t get it. Disney sold Celebration in  to a New York company. Some residents have since rallied behind their town and hit out at the creepy image it has been portrayed as.Responding to a blog post, one said: I have lived in Celebration for nine years and I love it. The best part of Celebration is the wonderful and caring people.Another added: I absolutely love living in Celebration. It is not creepy at all. Everyone is really friendly and it is beautul. The current problems are for people living in condos, not houses. So many people that live here think it is the best place in the world to live and that they are truly blessed.

The British and Irish duo unknowingly risked their lives when they filmed themselves flinging the deadly sea creature about after accidentally catching it on a fishing trip. Just five inches in size, the blue ring octopus packs a deadly punch, containing enough venom to kill  people in a matter of minutes.Unimpressed viewers online commented on the pairaposs Facebook video showing them dicing with death saying: Iaposve poured concrete that is less thick than you.Another said: Wow this guy could have died so easily.    The men, who clearly thought they stunt was hilarious, filmed themselves dangling the live animal then resting it on their bare arms while laughing and joking. One of the men joked how fishing in Australia is dferent in a Facebook post, and said they hadnapost clocked the species theyaposd caught was so venomous. He said: Been an interesting two day introduction to fishing...caught a blue-ringed octopus, one of the most dangerous animals in the world and didn’t even realise.    Commenting, someone said: Enough venom to kill  people in minutes, a painless bite until breathing problems set in later. Can’t believe he put that on his arm. If it bites you, it paralysis you and you stop breathing within minutes, another added. Others added they were amazed the pair hadnapost been killed, called them dumb and lucky to be alive. Confirming the men could have been dead within minutes, the Australian Museum said that due to the small size of the animalaposs injecting apparatus the men may not have felt a bite.  However within minutes symptoms include numbness of the lips and tongue, dficulty in breathing, followed by complete paralysis of the breathing muscles, its website reads. Victims appear to lose consciousness as they cannot respond to their name being called. In January, an unwitting tourist had a close call with a blue ring octopus in a video uploaded to Redditt.

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"dunadd drubbing for league leaders","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowArdnamurchan Women#s Camanachd AssociationDunadd ladies closed in on the top of the table with a thumping win against the league leaders.The Mid Argyll girls travelled to Spean Bridge for the game against undefeated Ardnamurchan but proved too strong for the home team.The game started evenly, but two early goals from top goal scorer Eilidh Cameron settled Dunadd.Against the run of play, however, Ardnamurchan broke away and scored, giving the home team hope and momentarily shaking Dunadd.

Most people are excited about the prospects and possible future developments here, and Irsquod hate people to get the wrong impression of the overall community support based on the reported views of a few people who were disturbed in the eventrsquos first year.ldquoHaving said that, I hope the organisers take on board the negative feedback and incorporate improvements into any future events.

This educational programme and the informal weekly gardening clubs allow both adults and children to experience a connection to nature in a supported environment and take home some of the produce theyrsquove grown too.Shirley explained: ldquoAll of the children at the school benefit from the fruit and vegetables grown in the enclosed garden but also from the orchard and the fruit bushes at the schools entrance. They can pick their own five-a day where the food hasnrsquot ever met a plastic tray or a supermarket checkout.The gardenrsquos outreach doesnrsquot stop at the food though.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"letter open letter to dog owners","story":"While responsible dog owners take care to ensure their dogs are under control at all times, there are still a number who do not # and seem unaware of the potential consequences of their actions.There has been a disturbing rise in the number of sheep and other livestock attacks, and we are hoping to enlist your help in raising awareness of dog #worrying# which will, in turn, assist the authorities, farmers and land-users.If a dog worries livestock on any agricultural land the owner, or person in charge of the animal at the time, is guilty of a criminal offence.Section  of the DogsAct  defines #worrying# as:Such incidents cause distress to the animals and often lead to them being injured and or killed.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too. He told the committee: ldquoIt has been dficult attracting sponsorship and corporate hospitality because of the uncertainty however, this seems to be improving."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-for-11-flats-on-car-park-in-haddington","story":"A decade ago the former Courier building on the corner of Haddingtonrsquos Market Street and Newton Port was bought by East Lothian Housing Association .ELHA converted the Market Street side of the building into its headquarters while the northern part was turned into  flats called The Granary.Now, the seven-space car park immediately adjacent to The Granary ndash used by residents there but also available to the general public ndash could be turned into  flats and associated car parking.A planning application has been lodged with East Lothian Council by developer Whiteadder Limited.If approved, there would be a total of  car parking spaces for the whole site ndash the new and the old flats.According to a design and access statement, which is included with the planning application, the site is ldquocurrently an unattractive car park which detracts from the town centre setting.It goes on: ldquoGiven the sitersquos location within the Haddington Conservation Area it represents an opportunity to redevelop a brownfield site.ldquoThe design of the new building will respect its historic context and character to create a positive contribution to the area.The ground floor would be home to a two-bedroom flat, with the first and second floors containing four two-bedroom properties and a one-bedroom flat.Outside, there would be a total of  car parking spaces, as well as a cycle store for  bicycles.Jan Wilson, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, had concerns about the plans.She said: ldquoWe did object to that for the simple reason that although they are providing car parking spaces, the existing cars that park there are going to have nowhere to park.ldquoYou are just adding that onto the congestion in the town.Councillor Tom Trotter, who represents Haddington, acknowledged the removal of general parking spaces could prove an issue.He said: ldquoIf the council came up with a solid idea and created a car park before they started going down the line of losing spaces, it would probably take the edge off the negativity surrounding any development, especially in the town centre.

I have heard many dferent versions of this tale, and most recently come across one version in a book by Taffy Thomas, who is a renowned storyteller. Here is my version of the story, which I have titled lsquoThe Riddle Rulersquo:IT WAS to be the final race of the tournament. The two knights had been equally matched, and now they would race each other for the prize of a gold cup filled with gold coins.There was an air of excitement as the crowds gathered for this race. Sir John and Sir Harry arrived together, each mounted on their stallions. Sir Johnrsquos horse was called Lightning, while Sir Harryrsquos horse was named Spear.They were equally matched, both knights had won an equal amount of races, and both had won against each other. There was no favourite, everyone knew this race would be very close.The atmosphere was electric with anticipation.Then the kingrsquos storyteller leaned over to whisper in the kingrsquos ear: ldquoYour majesty, this race is the last of the tournament. I feel it should be a race with an extra challenge, so that the crowd are better pleased.The king agreed, but asked the storyteller what he thought the extra challenge should be.ldquoThe race should be a test of the knightsrsquo wits as well as their riding ability, replied the storyteller. ldquoSet them a riddle rule and see how they solve it.ldquoAnd what is the riddle rule to be  asked the king.The storyteller smiled: ldquoDeclare the rules of this race to be thus: the horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and coins for its owner.And so the king declared the riddle rule just before the beginning of the race: ldquoThe horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and gold for its owner.There was a murmuring amongst the spectators. The knights looked at each other, thinking.When the starter flag was lowered and the king cried ldquogo, both knights stayed at the starting line. ldquoYou go first, said Sir John to Sir Harry. ldquoNo, after you, said Sir Harry to Sir John. But neither knight was willing to leave the start line lest they be deemed to be first.Soon there were boos and clapping from the crowd, but the prize was too great for either knight to risk going first.ldquoThis race is no fun, said the king to the storyteller, annoyed now that hersquod agreed to the change in rules.ldquoGive them until this afternoon to find a way to race, replied the storyteller, ldquothere is a way but they must discover it. It will challenge their wits and also their riding skills.And so the king stood: ldquoThe race is postponed until pm this afternoon. The knights must find a way to race to the riddle rule, otherwise the prize will be forfeited.For the rest of the day there was an excited buzz as people began to discuss possible solutions to the riddle rule with the knights.ldquoWhy donrsquot you agree to cross the finish line together  was one suggestionldquoBut then they would be equal first and the prize would be lost, commented another.ldquoBesides, said Sir John, ldquoI do not trust Sir Harry not to pull his horse back at the last moment. ldquoI do not trust you either, said Sir Harry.The deadline was fast approaching and no solution to the riddle rule had been found.ldquoPerhaps being first is more important than winning the gold, said an old woman.The knights looked at each other, thinking about this. Then they both said ldquonaw and shook their heads.It was  minutes before the race and a child came up to the knights and said: ldquoI have an idea. Everyone looked down at the child and laughed. How could a poor child know the answer when the knights themselves and all the spectators were scunnered But the storyteller was walking by and overheard the laughter. ldquoChildrenrsquos wisdom is not to be laughed at, he scolded them.And so the knights asked the child for the solution.The child said two words to the knights.In a flash, the knights got mounted and prepared to race. When the starter flag was lowered and the king shouted ldquogo, both Sir John and Sir Harry raced as fast as they could, each being desperate to be first across the finish line. Their riding skills were well challenged by this race.Who won does not matter in this story. What matters are the two words that were said by the child. They were the answer to the riddle rule, and so made the race possible.What were those two words If you havenrsquot already worked it out then re-read the story carefully. If you still donrsquot know, and want to know the answer, then I will give it next week.Or perhaps you could ask a child. I know some children from P in St Gabrielrsquos Primary School who know the answer to this."},{"url":null,"title":"plan-to-turn-prestonpans-town-hall-into-a-digital-paradise","story":"Prestonpans Community Council is bidding to take control of the High Street venue and turn it into an audio-visual and digital haven.A sub-committee of the community council that was formed when the option for a Community Asset Transferof the Town Hall to the group was first offered has come up with a lsquodigital destinationrsquo concept ndash and garnered positive feedback from the community council.The community council is the only group to have put in a note of interest for the Town Hall, and the sub-committee ndash featuring DJ Johnston Smith, Calum Miller and Professor Roger Bromley ndash has now made public its vision for the building.Their initial idea is to create an audio-visual centre within the Town Hall for gamers and competitions, as well as running educational classes on technology and creating a ldquodigital destination for all with k audio-visual displays, fibreoptic network, high-speed computers, floor space and a cafe.In the subcommittee strategy, the members state: ldquoThe activities which once occupied our Town Hall are not filling it today we need to think creatively to identy new audiences.ldquoAll of the traditional activities can now be accommodated where in our town.ldquoOur Town Hall needs to offer something unique to the community: our challenge is to use our assets to create richer social interactions for all.ldquoWe live in a world where the social networks that helped us advance are increasingly replaced by the digital iety.

History is the way we view and see things that happened in the past. That view is limited by a number of factors. The availability of surviving records and evidence is one.The vast majority of what happened in the past is inevitably lost to us. This is true even for our own personal memories. So history is the small tip of the iceberg of events and times gone by, brought to the surface by the survival of some accounts more than others.And these records are never unbiased. Often historical records and evidence are purposely partial, influenced by ideology and personal allegiances. But all are biased in some way, as the limited viewpoint and interests of those recording events is based on their experience or motives.As a result, we can only see historical events through a narrow keyhole, with most characters and goings on out of view. Itrsquos the common people who are most always invisible in history. Our own ideological preference and belief in what is important will then affect how we interpret the limited evidence we have.This is why history is often subject to furious debate, and rightly so. Irsquod say itrsquos almost impossible not to allow our own perspectives, interests and values to influence the way we interpret the broader meaning of historical events and their signicance for contemporary society.Such a debate is being had in East Lothian just now, as to the name of the new town to be built on the Blindwells site, between Prestonpans and Longniddry and just to the north of Gladsmuir and Tranent.The name can be romantically translated to mean lsquohidden springsrsquo and it was across this once-marshy ground that the Jacobites crept stealthily at night to mount a surprise attack on the Redcoats on September , . That famous battle lasted  minutes and was a victory for the Jacobites, and the launchpad of Bonnie Prince Charliersquos march into England.Consequently, the Scottish Battlefields Trust has submitted a petition, as reported in the Courier last week, to name the new community Charlestoun and build a statue of Charles.When I was at school, he seemed a dashing and heroic figure. The songs and stories about him are infectious and I totally understand how the stories told about him have created a romantic and thrilling image.But then I studied the topic in more depth, at both university and afterwards. The period has suffered from the romantic treatment but there are fascinating stories of loyalty and sacrice to a man who, in reality, saw the common people chiefly as cannon fodder for his personal and family ambitions.It is for this reason I feel there are enough name places and statues to aristocratic and powerful men whose main historical role was to make and wage war, evenhe has a famous and romantic reputation.This is not to say we shouldnrsquot remember the fascinating history of the area, including that fateful day of battle when the Jacobites crossed the land.But itrsquos how we commemorate it and who we include. What makes the Jacobite period truly fascinating is the tapestry of stories of the many people involved, on both sides. It was a brutal time, in which there was certainly deep loyalty on both sides, but there were many other reasons why people found themselves on one side or the other. It was a brutal civil war, brought on by the aspirations of the exiled Stuarts.Do we commemorate the memory of the man who caused that war or do we commemorate those who were caught up in it  Is it really the case thatwe do the former we do the latter  Irsquom not convinced.There are other stories to consider of course for the site. There was coal mining there for generations. The lives of mining families, men, women and children who toiled in horric conditions, still remains mostly unheralded by history. Maybe itrsquos not lsquoromanticrsquo enough. Likewise with farming, which was a constant economic activity in the area for generations.There was also another unusual underground activity on the site after the early mine closed. Smugglers made an illegal whisky still deep down in the mine shaft once it was disused. It took a while for the customs men to realise East Lothian had an illicit whisky-making enterprise deep below ground in the old mine workings. When they finally raided the mine, they found the still, but no sign of the makers of the whisky. It kind of gives new meaning to the name lsquohidden springsrsquo!It is suggested the children in schools should have the final say in the new name, which is a great idea. But let our children be introduced to all aspects of our local history and allow them to understand how the way history is taught influences what we believe is important in contemporary society as well, and that there is no lsquocorrectrsquo view on this.Irsquod love to be part of that discussion and debate."},{"url":null,"title":"parents-launch-petition-school-bus-operator-change","story":"Families whose children attend two secondary schools in East Lothian were stunned to discover that local firm PrenticeCoaches would no longer be used to transport the youngsters when schoolsafter the summer.The news was broken to them by Prentice, which is based in Haddington, last week, sparking a furious reaction from a number of parents.Now a petition has been launched calling for Prentice to have the contract, which has allegedly been awarded to a rival firm, given back.One mother whose children attend Knox Academy in Haddingtonand are bussed in from Gford said that she was shocked by the news.She said: ldquoPrentice have been looking after our children for  years and they are being replaced with no consultation or discussion.ldquoParents know the drivers and trust them to look after their children.ldquoIt is beyond belief that the council would simply put a dferent company in place without even consulting with the families affected.A petition calling for theof Prentice has collected more than  signatures since it was launched online.It says: ldquoPrentice provide a community service where parents feel reassured and comfortable putting their children on the buses.ldquoWe believe East Lothian [Council] has chosen to put cost over service and safety.ldquoThere is absolutely nothing wrong with the current service.ldquoThis is simply a cost-cutting exercise which could potentially put our children at risk.Prentice provided bus services for Knox Academy and North Berwick High School but has now lost the contract for those services.Ross Prentice, the company boss, admitted that he was ldquodisappointed by the councilrsquos decision.The company said: ldquoIt is a sad day.

So when Police Scotland officers employ Anglo-Saxon colloquialisms in the course ofduty, I must always assume it has been a wholly justiable belittling of female genitalia.The officerrsquos inquiry had apparently been deployed to ascertain the character of one particularly disruptive inidual ndash who was scurrilously attempting to spoil the buoyant mood of a glorious loyalist parade by blasting ldquorebel music from his car. How he got so close to these patriotic footsoldiers and joy-fuelled revellers with all the city-centre roads closed off, surrounded by motorway tailbacks, I have no idea. A truly disruptive person indeed.On these thankfully rare occasions, when officers of the law cross the line and let vile sexual crudities slip, I believe we must put our shock to one side and attempt to understand the context of such outbursts. And, as always, it seems all blame can be directed towardsthe fractured and Godless nature of todayrsquos society, where indference toine retribution has led to standards of the Queenrsquos English falling lower than the groin glands of the snake in the Garden of Eden.Itrsquos a truly sad day when the only way a dutul servant of Her Majesty can impose their authority is to attempt communicationwith these primitive creatures in their native tongue.The ides of marchDespite thisdisruption, it was wholly invigorating to witness so many of Her Majestyrsquos loyal defenders stride valiantly and gallantly through the city streets, glorying the Union as their ominous tribal thump echoed around the so-called Dear Green Place!It certainly filled my heart with optimism for the nationrsquos future.There were only eight arrests and apart from that, all more or less passed without incident. Unless you count jubilant cheering from the masses lining the route as a breach of the peace! Or the woman fallingfoul of the strictly-observed ldquodonrsquot cross the march rule who was shoved and spat on, butshe should perhapsbe grateful tohave DNA for any forthcoming trial. At least it wasnrsquot a Catholic priest this year!Although there was a distinct lack of reportage on this exhuberantannual celebration in the mainstream media ndash even in the so-called unionist press ndash I can confirm this was a rousing, joyous, inclusive, family parade. This was evident in the child-friendly aesthetic of Disney-like toy soldier unorms, comedygoose-stepping and Les Dawson-style musical timing ndash performed by men all clearly in robust health despite their advanced years, with the beetroot hue on their faces indicative of a burning internalpassion.Indeed, the jubilant onlookers could have lit cigarettes off the marchersrsquocheeksthey had so wished, an act perhapssymbolicof the undying torchflameof unionist fervourpassed on through countlessfuture generations.On evidence of this annual celebration of inherited reality tunnels, it will surely not be long until Orangefest ndash first and last held in  ndash makes a triumphantto George Square. Although the bouncy castle and marquees couldnrsquot be erected last time due to a freakishly unseasonal ill wind on the day, the children were still ldquoblown away by the informative speakers and stirring history lessons-highlightingthe truefacts on our nationrsquos history thatthey willhopefullypass onto their ownoffspringone day. And surely even the most staunch republican has to admit Orangefest had a better line-up than this yearrsquosTRNSMT.Out of OrderMY hopes that this mass display of Scotch support for peace, harmony and the Union might signal the end of the countryrsquos binarytribalism soon soured, however. It came to my attention that on the same day, , members of the republican McCult were congregating to insult Her Majesty by marching upon the Royal Burgh of Ayr ndash despite being firmly told five years ago that their shortbread tin cos-play had been cancelled by popular demand!Languidly marching ldquoAll Under One Banner, this flag-waving rabble would apparently prefertheir chainsattached to the EU rather than England ndash clearly ignorant to how it was the mighty Union itself that elevated their beloved Ayr to global glory!The  Act opened up trading opportunities with our colonies across the seas, resulting in myriad improvements to the town and lting its global standing. Ayrrsquos textile, wool, linen and shoemaking industries thrived for centuries afterwards. Crown funding provided by the Convention of Royal Burghs led to a lighthouse being built on the River Ayr in , a quay in  and also paid for much-needed repairs to the harbour and High Tolbooth. The CRB then installed street lighting for all ndash but little did they know that  years later a shameful display of open rebellion would cast the town back to the dark ages!After the procession in Glasgow, it was no surprise to hear that one of these so-called Bravehearts ndash many sporting battle re-enactment outfitsndash ended up on social media spouting a crude torrent of foul language, accusing a small gathering of pro-unionists of being female genitalia with unionist affiliations.And unlike the Orange Order, who have always worked closely with the council and police, the AUOB organisers apparently refused to apply for a licence or take out public liability insurance, claiming their ldquopeaceful rallies havenrsquot experienced any issues that required such legalities! Clearly then, it is somehow perfectly acceptable for nationalists to shout loudly about womenrsquos genitals in Ayr ndash but heaven forbid you are a loyal servant of Her Majesty doing the same thing in Glasgow while simply trying to maintain Order!And finally...YOU might be aware of yet another march that took place on the same day ndash Pridein London. I hadnrsquot seen so many men in leather masks living out their submissive fantasies since my time in the Conservative party.With . millionin attendance, one couldnrsquot get moving in the capital that day ndash yet such a commotion could perhaps have been avoidedmy previous solution of conversion therapy to tackle ldquounhappy homosexuality had been heeded.I once wrote: ldquoIf anybody turns to a properly qualied practitioner for help, there must be a presumption that he or she can get it. It is not a state crime to want to change onersquos sexual leanings. It still isnrsquot! And there will also perhaps be room to move in the streets on Pride dayscience finds the answer to the issue, like I said last week.Irsquove previously admitted that I am proud to remain a virgin, and although some might suggest this disqualies me from commenting on the sexual lives of others, remember it certainly doesnrsquot stop the Pope!

Is it the thin end of a wedge  Municipal neglect has a habit of creeping outwards like a bad stain.And so wersquore heartened to see some benign citizen development up on the Gallowgate at the old Bairdrsquos Bar next door to Barrowland. This is the cleverest, the most respectful of renovations. Residues of Celtic green paint cling to the ceiling. The materials- dark wood , brick, sandstone, clunking Victorian iron, obscure glass- encapsulate Glasgowrsquos vernacular architecture for me. Whatever was sound has been kept along with the odd bit of evocative whimsy. The old tenement stairs that now lead to nowhere have been kept above the bar. You pass a deep ceramic sink for washing clothes, the sort that was once commonplace in old ldquosteamies\". Such artacts are on display at the Peoplersquos Palace, and  Gallowgate only adds to the collection.In other ways  Gallowgate marches to its own tune, eschewing copycat menus. Its offering manages to be original, yet it fits its setting and location: simple, unfussy dishes, forgotten classics, such as corned beef hash, at reasonable prices that are realistic for its neighbourhood.Everything that reasonably can be is made in the kitchen, apart from the sourdough bread from the Freedom Bakery, and only ace bakers could better that. But the kitchen cures its own salt beef, we discover, as we kick off with the meaty, peppery salt beef fritters perched on frills of amiably mild sauerkraut, napped by punchy Reuben sauce and melting cheese.  Gallowgate clearly isnrsquot immune to cooking trends though. On todayrsquos specials menu therersquos caullower, pale-roasted, in a tumble of mint leaves, pea shoots, soft soaked raisins, toasted pine kernels, and grated Manchego cheese with perhaps a bit of sherry vinegar in its dressing, an idea I intend to steal for home cooking purposes.Boiled gammon and buttered cabbage with spring onion mash  Itrsquos got to be well done, or itrsquos dull. But this ham is a dream, not too salty, with a pale pink blush, it disintegrates in the mouth. The scallions, and a generous dosage of butter, make the mash unctuous the cabbage, Savoy Irsquod say, glistens with even more butter. No complaints from me on that last point.For pound, our hot salt beef sandwich is a steal. Our second chance to taste the succulent, well balanced cured beef, to appreciate just how well that Freedom Bakery bread with its tangible, but not overly chewy, crust works brilliantly in this context.

It has featured in films like Bonnie Prince Charlie, with the unlikely David Niven in the role in , The Master of Ballantrae with Erroll Flynn , Highlander and even the Bond movie The World is not enough. Itrsquos a staple of dozens of Bollywood movies too, soyoursquore visiting and see a group of dancers in brightly-coloured dhoti practising their steps yoursquove come to the right place.The castle was a stronghold of the Clans Mackenzie and McRae from the th Century before it was destroyed, in , by the Royal Navy in the Jacobite rebellion. Three ships anchored up and bombarded the castle and the clansmen and their Spanish allies for three days, reducing the place to rubble and taking dozens of prisoners. It lay as an empty ruin for more than  years until John MacRae-Gilstrap bought the pile in  and set about restoring it. So what you see today is a modern-day rendition although, fortunately, sans breeze blocks and polystyrene. It is now owned by a charitable MacRae family trust and the , visitors a year undoubtedly provide the upkeep.Scotland surely must have more castles per acre than any other country, and certainly per head of population, with around  and counting ndash more than the population of Aberfeldy or Drumnadrochit ndash although some are no more than relics of the past, hardly a stone upon a stone. Therersquos not agreed definition of a castle ndash every Englishmanrsquos home is one after all ndash but itrsquos generally accepted that it has to be a fortied structure built in the Middle Agesby a ruler or noble. One who was generally carnapcious, didnrsquot get on with his neighbours and had hundreds of serfs of clans people to provide the wherewithal, a bit like Historic Environment Scotland today.The latest castle to come up for private sale is Bardowie, eight miles from Glasgow, an A-listed, eight-bedroomed property with a walled garden, tennis court, jetty and frontage to the eponymous loch, which is a mere puddle in water terms. It was built in  and was a stronghold of the Galbraiths and passed on to the Hamiltonrsquos of Bardowie.Its more recent history is that it was owned by Jack Black ndash not the Rock School star or it would be no more than sandstone dust now ndash but the other one, the one who charges thousands to make motivational speeches. He used to be a social worker in Glasgowrsquos East End so he must wake up every day, even before he makes up a pithy epithet, to thank his lord he escaped the snotty weans and junkies.To quote the guru: ldquoThe greatest gt in le is the ability to think great thoughts and have the strength to take action so that those thoughts become reality in this wonderful and abundant world.Er, moving on it seems that Jack sold the castle at the end of  and the present owner is Glasgow vegetable dealer Alex Faithfullthrough his company Bardowie Holdings. He certainly lives there, unless he flitted very recently. The castle is now on the market for around pound million although the agents arenrsquot confirming the price. .The Hollywood star Chris Pine stayed there for a couple of months at the end of  to get into the method for his role in Outlaw King, as Robert Bruce.Most of the surviving castles are either in public ownership or in charitable trusts. Edinburgh, Stirling and Culzean most famously, although exceptions are Inveraray Castle, the seat of the Dukes of Argyll and now a popular tourist attraction, Stobo Castle a health spa, and the quirky Kelburn, owned by Patrick Boyle, the th Earl of Glasgow ndash continuously occupied by the same family since the th century, longer than any other caste ndash who invited some famous Brazilian artist to graffiti the entire facade which, despite the sneers of the traditionalists, has become a tourist attractionCastles first arrived in Scotland in the th century as royal authority was centralised and rewards were doled out. It was King David  who introduced them and encouraged Norman and French nobles to settle here, in an attempt to establish royal power throughout the country.Robert the Bruce must also take credit,thatrsquos the proper term, for what became known as ldquoslighting, that is capturing castles and destroying their fortications, which he did systematically, after wresting them from English control and presumably slaughtering the survivors. He even destroyed his own ones, at Ayr and Dumfries, Roxburgh and Edinburgh rather than allow them to be retaken by the English.When gunpowder was invented and guns and cannons evolved in the th century the design of castles changed, to the look we expect today, bombardment resistant walls, letter box gun ports and s to mount artillery. Ravenscraig, in Kirkcaldy, begun in  and now partially ruined, is reckoned to be the first in Britain to be built as an artillery fort.If a castle isnrsquot quite your choice of residence and you are shopping at the top end of the market then what about Boraston House, in Ravelston Dykes Road, Edinburgh, which is a seven-bedroom Edwardian mansion house on the edge of Ravelston Golf Course.

This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmA brand new cruise ship is set to call into Kirkwall on Sunday, on her inaugural voyage around the UK.

And I understand that it is very unfortunate that this problem, while unrelated to the air traffic controllers’ industrial action, has coincided with it. However, that is not much consolation to frustrated users of the service.“The issue here is that this is a leline service and there are no alternatives for people who simply have to fly. Local people and businesses in the Northern Isles need a reliable service, and we simply cannot afford local service-levels to be reduced. We accept that we have to live with unavoidable weather events, but the recent disruptions have been workforce-related.“HIAL is a Scottish Government-owned organisation and one of the reasons for that is a recognition that it provides a strategically critical part of our transport infrastructure in the Highlands and Islands. It’s way past time for ministers to take a long hard look at the situation and reassure us that they are prepared to intervene on behalf of the travelling public.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is disheartening to have received a counter-offer from Prospect that is beyond our affordability.“Over the past eight months, we have discussed ious options with the union and have been clear throughout that any proposal must be affordable and within the terms of Public Sector Pay Policy.

The United States of America is a figment of our imagination. Russia is as real as the fake news that pours out on to the internet from within its fictional borders.However real they might seem, nation states belong in the realm of ideas, not tangible things, and John Lennon’s Imagine had it the wrong way round.OK, I admitTheresa May, Boris Johnson or whoever was to send a distinctly real British Army Challenger tank on to my front lawn and invite me to reconsider the non-existence of the United Kingdom, I most definitely would, might even start singing Land of Hope and Glory. Or at least try to, it would quite quickly descend into mumbling what I’d be hoping sounded like the words. But, thankfully, using the military to ensure the loyalty of its subjects runs counter to ideas about what the UK is all about. And ideas – such as, of course, nation states – can be powerful things. Good ideas have saved countless lives, just as bad ideas have ended them.Being ideas, countries can change and are probably always doing so, albeit usually in subtle, small ways that are barely noticeable but become apparent as time marches on. Some politicians today talk about British or Scottish values. In my book, this is a “categorisation error” and I’d much rather we talked about “democratic values”, but whatever values are held today in Scotland or the UK, they are very dferent to Victorian ones.There is no particular patch of planet Earth that must always be a liberal democracy – a haven of free speech, the rule of law and human rights – just as nowhere is eternally fated to languish in the grip of despotic rulers who think punishing people they don’t like with a lethal dose of nerve agent is a reasonable way to behave.So it is really important to keep up the pressure on whatever nation you happen to inhabit to move towards the light of freedom and away from sinister ideas that seem to have been re-emerging from the shadows in recent years.Here’s William McNeil, of the “hipster fascist” movement, Scotland for Generation Identity, attempting to explain to The Scotsman this week why his group did not promote a hateful, white supremacist ideology. “Anyone making this claim, intentionally or not, refuses to understand Identitarianism. It is not about skin colour, nor is it about anyone being better than another. All peoples have a right to preserve and promote their group identity in their homelands.”In case you don’t know, Generation Identity’s leader in Austria, Martin Sellner, exchanged emails with and accepted a donation of €, from Brendan Tarrant, the Australian charged over the murder of  people at two mosques in New Zealand in March. Sellner insists he doesn’t believe in violence, but clearly Tarrant was a fan.There are no dferent human “peoples” or races, these are ideas entirely invented by racists. Tarrant killed people at random simply because they were Muslim just as Isis killed Salford taxi driver Alan Henning – despite the pleas of Islamic scholars to spare the le of someone who went to Syria to deliver aid. Both Isis and Tarrant bought into the idea that their victims were so defined by their religion or their nation that they could be killed for that reason alone.For some self-described patriots, nationality plays just as strong a part in defining a human being as race does for racists or religion does for the most fanatical of religious bigots .In his short poem Patriot, the late Norman MacCaig – I first wrote that he was a “Scottish poet” but then decided to delete that bit – offered a dferent vision:My only countryIs six feet highAnd whether I love it or notI’ll dieFor its independenceThe Person’s Republic of Ian Johnston wholeheartedly agrees and, however tall we are, most of us know we are an inidual – insert the funny line from Monty Python’s Le of Brian here – even those prone to seeing others as nothing but the faceless members of some group of millions of people. Despite all this, I am happy to say that countries – even though they are just ideas – are very important. I’m also happy to pay my taxes and do all the things you are supposed to do as a citizen of the UK. However, nations are important as a unit of democracy, perhaps the fundamental unit of democracy. They help human beings organise themselves into large groups in which their rights as iniduals are protected. That’s what countries should do anyway. How big that group is, what territory it controls or who is a member should not be the main concern.But medieval ideas about nation states still persist.In the not-so-good-old days, kings who led armies to conquer were heroes. Those who questioned their power too much were traitors whose heads would likely end up on a spike. With no genuinely legitimate claim to power – the hereditary principle not being one – loyalty had to be enforced on pain of death. This is still true in today’s tyrannies.In countries that are liberal democracies, where iniduals agree to put people into power, knowing they can be removednecessary, strict penalties for treason are not necessary. As a criminal offence, it has all but died out in the UK. And yet, amid the passionate debates about Scottish independence and Brexit, bitter accusations of treason have been thrown about quite a lot. That, in my view, is a slippery slope that risks a slide through the mire towards the insanity of Isis, Generation Identity and the rest.Inidual human beings are real. Nations are not. They are ideas that we have made effectively real because we believe in them so much and because it is useful in a practical way. But, we must resist the temperation to believe in them too much or we will lose touch with reality.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"former lib dem leader ming campbell says constitutional reform is needed in uk","story":"The UK constitution needs #root and branch# reform to take the antagonism out of the relationship between governments in London and Edinburgh, the former leader of the Liberal Democrats has said.Sir Menzies Campbell, who was the architect of the Lib Dems’ modern proposals for Scottish Home Rule, called for a constitutional convention to create a settled will around devolution in England and set the agenda for a federal UK.And he criticised the recent decision by the Foreign Office to withdraw support from Nicola Sturgeon’s overseas trips, calling it “foolish” and “unnecessary”.Speaking to Scotland on Sunday to mark the th anniversary of the Scottish parliament, and following the announcement of the UK government launching a review of how Whitehall interacts with devolution, Campbell said good relations between Edinburgh and London were based on “personality, personality, personality”.The peer, who led the Lib Dems from  to , said the early successes of devolution were based on relationships between Donald Dewar and Tony Blair, and between Dewar and Lib Dem deputy Jim Wallace.And he hailed the close partnership between Lib Dem Scottish Secretary Michael Moore and then-Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in delivering the Edinburgh Agreement, that saw both governments sign up to a legally-recognised independence referendum in .Asked about the more recent constitutional deadlock over Brexit, Campbell said: “Part of the problem is that the relationship between Edinburgh and Westminster has not really grown in the way it should have done, and I think both parties are to blame.“Edinburgh’s default position is that it’s all Westminster’s fault, and Westminster’s position is that these bloody Scots are just making a nuisance of themselves.”In the latest sign that relations between the two governments are at an all-time low, Foreign Secretary and Tory leadership contender Jeremy Hunt announced that his department would no longer routinely provide support to the First Minister’s overseas travel, unless she agrees not to “promote independence”.“I thought that was foolish … it’s unnecessary,” said Campbell, who was the foreign affairs spokesman for the third party at Westminster for  years. “I think it is nitpicking, and politically parsimonious to say to her, we’re not going to help with the visits.“What’s the point of that  She’ll go anyway. And she’ll make a thing of the fact that she’s able to achieve these visits without the help of the Foreign Office.“The Foreign Office isn’t just for Westminster, it’s for the United Kingdom. Would they have tried to do that with [David] Trimble and [Martin] McGuinness [the leaders of devolved power-sharing in Northern Ireland]  Of course they wouldn’t.“My view is that it’s completely unnecessary and it simply creates a sense of grievance, and anyway she’ll get the visits, because the people on the other side of the Atlantic will be anxious to know what she’s about.”Campbell led the Lib Dem Home Rule Commission, reporting on the need to overhaul the UK’s constitution in .An update shortly before the independence referendum helped build momentum towards the creation of the Smith Commission in the wake of Scotland’s vote to stay in the UK, which resulted in signicant new tax and welfare powers being devolved to Edinburgh.The Lib Dem peer now sits on the steering committee of the cross-party Constitutional Reform Group, which has put forward its own proposals for a “new Act of Union”.Campbell said that after  years of devolution in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, England “needs a constitutional convention”.“The English have to decide what they want,” he said, going on to question the piecemeal approach to local devolution south of the border. “English local government – you need a PhD to understand it.”He revealed that Baroness Bryan, who is developing Labour policy on a “People’s Constitutional Convention” that Jeremy Corbyn says will lead to a federal UK, has met with him and examined the Constitutional Reform Group’s proposals.But Campbell said she faces a “pretty tricky job” with just nine months left to produce a report, and a single researcher supporting her.He called for Westminster to be “much more open minded” to a major overhaul of the constitution, but defended the Lib Dems’ refusal to take part in Scottish Government-organised citizens’ assemblies on new powers for Scotland unless independence is parked.“[The constitution] needs a root and branch approach,” Campbell said. “For that you’ve got to have co-operation on both sides of the argument.“If Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP say it’s independence or bust, then that makes it very dficult, but you can nonetheless say, park your independence for the moment, we understand that’s what you’re about, but we can have a sensible and logical discussion about how we improve the relationship ... The problem is that Joanna Cherry gave the game away because she said it’s leading to independence.”The Lib Dem peer said there was a “legalistic” case for the UK Government to retain devolved responsibilities ing from Brussels after Brexit, which are at the heart of the row between Edinburgh and London over claims of a “power grab”, and which saw the two governments face each other in the Supreme Court over rival Brexit legislation.But he is critical of how the UK Government went about resolving the dispute.“There’s a legalistic argument that Britain joined the EU, and Britain leaves the EU. Therefore those powers which were ceded to the EU come back to Britain … but they were so dog in the manger about it, and that of course was Theresa [May]. You can’t have seen Blair being so dyed in the wool about it.”And Campbell said the decision of the UK Government to press ahead with Brexit legislation without the consent of the Scottish Parliament, in breach of the Sewel convention, set an “uncomfortable” precedent.“We don’t have a written constitution in this country, people say. Well actually, we have a half written constitution becauseyou think about it, a huge amount of what we regard to be constitutional law, it’s by statute.“I think the marriage of statute and convention has been shown to be a rather uncomfortable one, particularly in the context of Brexit. Sewel is a very good example of that.”With critics in the SNP, Labour and the Conservatives all calling for the role of the Scotland Office to be reviewed and potentially abolished, Campbell defended Dover House.“There are strong administrative reasons for saying yes, and there are strong political reasons for saying no,” he said about eliminating the Scotland Office.“You can make the argument that, OK,there is a proper relationship between Edinburgh and London, then no, you don’t need it.“But you can equally make the argument thatthere is someone in London who’s in the tent … then you have the opportunity to influence events.”An SNP spokesperson said: “It is entirely legitimate for Scotland’s First Minister to speak to the views that she was democratically elected on, but withdrawing Foreign Office support did not impede on the plans of the First Minister’s visit to Europe.“Andthe Tories’ position is now that Scotland shouldn’t be afforded the same level of representation as the rest of the UK, then they are making our case for us – it shows how we need to be independent.“The Citizens’ Assembly will be an entirely independent body – a position that has been made clear by the Scottish Government and the co-convener of the Assembly. There remains plenty of opportunity for the Lib Dems to rediscover their liberal and democratic values and to support the assembly, however as it will be made up of citizens, the decision of any party to opt out will not impact on its success.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Daily Mail!! grow up. Ask yourself the following question, how does today#s GlobalWarming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age  Anyone who cannot answer that question is too ignorant to hold an informed opinion on today#s climate change.Stops PC Plod and the band of merry men, from going in with batons to quell the grown-ups waffling on about, why their leader Comrade Corbyn inspires them with his words.How about giving them a half decent education concentrating on sciencesubjects. Then they would have an informed and considered opinion, not just the usual Greenwash so popular with the ignorant. If gted they may even go on to contribute with useful research and technological ideas so unlike are present green, ignorant and wholly ill-informed flock in thecouncil chamberAn area of industry which has not been looked into with any proper statistical information is thisof Agriculture. This industry produces more green house gases than the all of transportation. In fact, it is several times greater than transportation. The catch  scenario is this industry has had no regulation or legislation is regard to reducing greenhouse gases, infact, due to population growth, the pollution created by agriculture is vastly on the increase. Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well. It is a dilemma which will become more relevant as the population increases.I can assure you these bairns weren#t pushed into anything. They were toldthey wanted to go they had to complete a form. One of mine wanted to go, the other didn#t. One asked a question at the Town Hall and I am very proud # not that she had to protest # but that she had the courage to do so, and silence many there.Well done young folk # out of the mouths of babes as they say.It hardly takes any courage to join a protest, especially one being encouraged and congratulated onby so many folk! The courage comes from not following the crowd herd and forming an independent and educated view. Jumping headlong onto the bandwagon is easy, understanding the science and striving to do something about it the hard bit. Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid.Especially a meaningless strike from school, what child would not love a day off among mates  No doubt the pig ignorant and stupid will be so impressed. A bit like supergluing yourself tp a bus or train, outstanding!!!I didnt say it took courage to join a protest, I said it takes courage to speak at the Town Hall. Andit was about time off school, they all would have gone. Please have more respect for our bairns and young folk.And these bairns are, for your information, studying the stem subjects at school.It is not a case of having respect for the bairns, Johan Adamson. It is just a case of having absolutely no respect whatsoever for those who politicise them and drive them like sheep. Primary children used in a political strike!! Repulsive behaviour, you should be ashamed, so socialist, child exploitation is the words that come to mind.They had to complete a form, primary children! What next, form a political Union and become militant  Little Orwellian sheep bleating for the Pigs.These were AHS pupils Ian, not primary pupils, and no one has politicised them.Educated them yes, but then I forgot you have the monopoly on climate change education and stem subjects.The organisers were I think over , so young adults.The fact is I will always criticise revolting behaviourand ignorance and I am not referring to the children.Yes I do believe sixth year pupils are capable of organising thisWhy do you assume Ian that these bairns are not studying stem subjects and that only you know about climate change then Ian Infantile comments  Pot kettle springs to mind.Now just who printed these forms the children had to fill in  Which teachers OKed the strike and arrange for Brae and Aith schools also took part, as well as bairns from the Sound Primary School and organised and paid for transport  I do not believe that was AHS sixteen-year-olds for one second.Whether by accident or design this provides a very convenient fig leaf for the council#s lamentable performance on child poverty.Much was made of the #children#s march# at the SIC#s education committee meeting today however in a news report about the part of the same meeting that dealt with the council#s child poverty action report, it was clear that the council have done next to nothing since the Shetland Inequalities Commission reported in March .know. All these admirable young citizens are guilty of is taking a stand based on commonly accepted information. I could ask what special knowledge does Ian think he has that allows him to lord it over them# but nerves fail me.On Ian’s earlier point, it is self-evident thatwe need some people with a high level of competence in STEM subjects who can take critical stand on matters scientic. Gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included! Learners on this path can also become alert to common logical fallacies. Even those who like Ian, with a preference for physical sciences, can benefit. Happily don’t need to be much of a scholar to spot an ad hominem attack. With all due respect for Ian’s past achievements in the physical sciences, it would be nicehe could make his points without belittling others #kids included. That’s a normal standard “of decency and tolerance” btw.I so agree with these word #gaining some depth in the Arts and Humanities, however, increases the likelihood of developing sensitivity and compassion, concern for humanity and the future of our planet, self-awareness and insight into common human foibles, hubris and self-aggrandisement included!#. You do so hold yourself in such regard high Peter, now go glue yourself to a train or bus to prove your point!But just at that moment, as though at a signal, all the sheep burst out into a tremendous bleating of- #Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better! Four legs good, two legs better!# It went on for five minutes without stopping. And by the time the sheep had quieted down, the chance to utter any protest had passed, for the pigs had marched back into the farmhouse ”.And what are you doing Ian to save the planet And what would you suggest the AHS and the SIC do Ad Hominem attacks # playing the man not the ball # are often used by those who don’t have much of an argument to begin with. Instead of dealing with whether the young people have a point or not, generous-spirited Ian opted to have a go instead.Logical fallacies show lazy thinking, masking an absence of creativity and independent thought. Ian’s trollswipe above looks Ad Hominem in approach st first, but he is also using the Tu Quoque Fallacy. This is where you accuse the opponent of hypocrisy to avoid answering their charge. Self-effacing Ian thus avoids addressing the possibility of his own hubris or lack of self-knowledge.Should I have made things easier for him and asked what his actual beef with the climate protestors was  He says “Joining a not fully educated and scientically ignorant caucus is just so stupid”and demands that everyone should be able to answer “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ” before taking a view. Perhaps he will educate us by answering his own question # sticking to terms that demonstrate tolerance and decency of course. Nuclear Free Council, Declair Climate emergency,climate justice what a load of utter bunkum. Especially stop allowing political activists to exploit our children.I put forward the question : Is nuclear power the only solution to stop greenhouse gas emissions and the only way to stop climate change progressing further  It may be the worse case scenario in terms of our power demand solution, but what are the alternatives to our demand for energy without causing further environmental and ecological damage to the planet by in using fossil fuels or cleaner alternatives like wind or solar   It has been suggested the Sahara Desert could be used for solar energy to power Europe, but how much land would be required and could this be expanded  The alternatives to fossil fuels may be cleaner, but how would this affect global weather patterns or the depletion of species due to the destruction of natural habitats being replaced for energy production Very sadly the SG SNP has committed to wind energy with its catastrophic environmental damage and only intermittent supply, but that is the policy of the scientically ignorant and utterly stupid.Thank you for your comments, Ian. I fear humanity will have no choice but to go nuclear for its energy production in the future.Alternative resources, like wind or solar, may be the short term answer, but as mentioned, the downside to this is the large amount of land which will be required with the ability to vastly expand as demand increases. What would be the environmental damage and the destabilization of le on the planet have in the long term with such technologies  There is also the issue of economics dictating progress on future energy production, and would this be counter-productive due profits taking priority over progress and the reduction of the pollution into the environment  I agree with your comments Ian, in regard to nuclear based energy production. However, like many issues to do with progress, something catastrophic will have to take place before we realize we should have acted sooner.There it is again, the abusive and arguably ignorant use of that word “stupid”. Having reread all contributions above it seems Ali denies there’s a problem by saying there are dangerously low CO levels, John distracts by arguing the council should care more for child poverty, and Ian disparages, disparages and disparages again. Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet Ian’s singular approach is getting between him and his key message. I’ve long been puzzling as to what makes the good doctorso determined to overuse petty insult so freely, but it would be helpful to know just whathis specic problem with climate change protests is. If he could but answer his own Ice Age question to Brian , his motive might become a little clearer. And apologies in advance to Ianhe has already made his point and I’ve missed it, but it wasn’t me who thought it smart to surround it with invective. Wouldn’t it be just lovelyIan could contribute tolerantly without using putdowns  It’s almost as though he needs them to build himself up# Oh. Hold on# Eureka!#Are all three attempting to harmonise from the same alt-right reactionary hymn-sheet # What a plonker, Peter, just cannot resist going political. Is thisLabour or SNP talking, he often points in both directions or is he now Green Maybe the characters on here who hate the idea of young people protesting about climate change should head down to the school and start shouting some of this stuff over the wall.But, then again, that might make them see . . . well . . . insane.Folk writing to the paper to have a go at the protesters is one of the most depressing contributions to local public debate imaginable.Hopefully, though, the usual naysayerswill only encourage them to do it more.There#s nothing wrong with anyone, of any age, having an opinion on whatever they like, and expressing it. But in their own time, only.The problem with this is that participation in this protest was permitted and facilitated,not encouraged by the education authority, which by default is an endorsement of the opinion being expressed in the protest and the timing method by which the protest was made, by the education authority.Education authorities and schools are supposed to be impartial, by granting #authorised absence# status to a politically motivated protest, that impartiality is now seriously called in to question and a dangerous precedent has been set.There was no reason other than a cynical publicity stunt for this protest to take place during the school day. If those still at school feel strongly enough to organise a protest like adults do, that#s fine, let them, but also like adults, it#ll have to happen in their own time, or they suffer the consequences of #unauthorised absence#, for it to be taken seriously.If they want to play in the big bad world, they play by the big bad world#s rules, not by special favours like this was.Only a few nutters are #impartial# about climate change these days.Do you mean that civil disobedience would have been better Well said Mark! The evident concern trollingis intended to deligitimise the voice of young people who, lets remember, are meant by right to have a say in matters that concern them. Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens. Therefore no one involved in supporting the reported protest has done any wrong, other than in the eyes of seemingly knee-jerk reactionaries who may well be hiding their true motives. Artfully comparing these identiable young people to Orwell’s unthinking farm animals, in order to subvert their point# well it more than lacks sensitivity and compassion. It is desperate, pitul and contemptible in equal measure. It may well also fall foul of observing normal standards of decency and tolerance that contributors to these pagesare meant to adhere to. Those joining the protest were not “stupid”, as has been claimed above. The overuse of that intolerant word may be though. I note you mention #Scotland’s national curriculum intends younger learners become active and responsible global citizens.# now could you explain how taking time off school and striking for the declaration of aclimate emergency makes the child an active and responsible global citizen  I rather feel they are being played by our Greeny ignoramuses and SNP political propagandists! Never mind, I am sure they enjoyed their day off school.Nuclear power  Thatgreat physicistRobert Oppenheimer , on seeing the first atomic bomb explode said with horror—-“ I am become death , the destroyer of worlds.”. The people of Japan and Chernobyl have had a taster and I suspect they arenot eager for a repeat. .However,Shetland is####..Hmm.Rock on.Haydn, Thorium reactors, not Uranium! no atom bombs, no long term isotopes decaying for millennia. Almost infinite clean energy with really cheap fuel.Where would your preferred site be for the Shetland nuclear power station be Dr Tinkler  Aith  Bigton  Would bring plenty work to the west side. You could include it in your manestoyou stand for the council again.Well, Ray Purchase, it is already here. Thousands of Shetlanders have had radiotherapy and had their lives saved by a nuclear atomic reactions of one type or another.I seriously doubtthere is a single person on Shetland who has not had their own, a member of their family or close friends le saved by the products of nuclear reactors.Are you so moronic as to deny that or is that a bit too deep for you to understand or Oh dear Dr Tinkler, it seems you’ve come down with a nasty case of whataboutery. I didn’t ask you about the undoubted benefits of x-rays and radiotherapy I asked you where you would build a nuclear power station in Shetland. Now do you think you could give a straight answer to a straight question  Physician heal thyself!If thorium proves viable, I would be happy for such a station in Lerwick. Safe, clean, small and less damaging than the district heating woodchip waste burner we have at present and infinitely less toxic. I also asked is that a bit too deep for you to understand  # So it seems to be!!Well done Ian, you answered the question! There was a lot of unnecessary waffling and needless aggression but you got there. So, in the incredibly unlikely event of a, totally safe, nuclear power plant being built in Shetland you’d still want it as far away from where you live as possible. Fair dos.Instead of nuclear power or gas have you ever put any thought into wind power  I’ve heard that they don’t cause any carbon pollution at all, so they’d be ideal. They’re very pretty too and scientic. Like an actual windmill, I’m a big fan.Sadly Ray, you are being misled. take Viking for example. Peat disturbance alone. over  kilometres of tracks, the ground footprint of over  square kilometres. A fair amount of COreleased there. Then tens of thousands of tons of concrete basses.emissions, Chatham House.  kilometres of the interconnector, Copper plastic!!! Now just imagine the peat is so unstable that helicopters are being used, just to move survey teams to reconnoitre the site. Tracked vehicles to damaging for the peat!! . Just what is that carbon footprint  Laughableit was not so sad!How something you and Mark Ryan Smith may understand. The very latest scientic information on controlling climate change “Tree planting #has mind-blowing potential# to tackle climate crisis” , now would not planting a tree be a more rational action for these children  That would be the sensible, intelligent and educated option. PS, could someone please inform the SIC SNP SCT and Green Lunatics!No one here has denied climate change Brian Smith. Just a discussion on the merits or otherwise of the School children#s strike. Our youngsters being encouraged to jump on the #Greta Thunberg# bandwagon. There you really do have a sacricial lamb to the European Green lunatics but that is another really sad story!You mustcarefully, Mr T.Well, Brian, I have never denied Climate change. I just dispute the best way to combat it.Deft footwork here from Ian. His, and his hero Farage’s position # not that he cares to own up to it # is not that there is no climate change. Obviously the climate changes over time. What he is conveniently avoiding are the questions around cause and appropriate response.Please do not make up speculative little stories porkies Peter. Farage is not my hero, however, I find him infinitely preferable to Corbyn and Salmond, however, here is not the place to digress further.Will Hell freeze over before Ian tells us what he presumes the protestors are ignorant of  Answering the question he posed Brian is not too mammoth a task for him surely. I suspect he is trying to dodge it for a reason.Read and weep Peter. If your intellect stretches that far. !! In the most simple of Science, It is set out below. The protestors are ignorant of the very most basic understanding of carbon capture and the prevention of climate change. Trees!! Only the very most utterly stupid, like yourself cannot see the wood for them!It is not clear the protest had a position on biomass, however Ian has firmly stated the need for those taking any position to be able to answer #how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age #Ian has thus far excitedly cited three articles, none of which reference any ice age. The first: #Tree planting ‘has mind-blowing potential’ to tackle climate crisis#, has Professor Crowther emphasising #it remains vital to reverse the current trends of rising greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuel burning and forest destruction, and bring them down to zero# this is needed to stop the climate crisis becoming even worse and because the forest restoration envisaged would take - years to have its full effect##Reafforestation, necessary as it is, isn#t no silver bullet, nor a speedy enough solution, though many on the protest would likely love to plant some trees.The second and third articles focus on biomass, which is contested.To help Ian make his point, does he mean the Cryogenian, the second last ice age or the Little Ice Age  Again, other than to spread scorn and belittle, what is Ian#s actual point Sorrymy point is beyond you Peter. My question # “how does today’s Global Warming compare with the Global Warming scientically after and during the Second Ice Age ”That would require a thesis at post-graduate level to answer. Hardly space here! My point was that these children simple to not have the science to have a considered and informed opinion based on knowledge. The science is actually simple, I suggest you look it up and read it.Lest anyone thinking of studying the sciences, physical or social, be put off, Ian’s approach to advancing a scientic argument is far from typical. Thomas Kuhn made a very useful contribution by proposing that as a science advances some innaccurate claims will inevitably be made and indeed built on, but will later be corrected as sufficient contrary evidence emerges. Hawkins himself corrected some of his own foundational work. A settled consensus generally emerges over time through reasonable and reasoned dialogue and argument in which peer reviewed sources, research evidence and the thinking they provoke are made apparent.This is perhaps one reason why the Shetland Times asks contributors to observe normal standards of decency and tolerance for the opinions of others. It helps to bring forth the truth.It is, however, more than unusual for anyone taking themselves seriously to make a strong central scientic claim then refuse to back it up, clary it’s meaning or intent# unless of course Ian is proposing rhetoric, cant and distracting insult are now sciences, in which case top marks are due to the happy fellow.What a load of pretentious twaddle. You have outdone yourself here Peter. The word Science simply means knowledge, no more no less. It is just as simple as that.Whilst he remains intent on running away from clarying and substantiating his own point, here is an easier question for Ian: Why does he call Greens lunatics  There must be some point of disagreement between him and them, in his own head at least.That would be self-evident Peter. Read up the following. Bio-Fuels, palm oil plantation. Diesel fuel promotions, particulates. Germany non-nuclearpolicy,brown coal burning. Shetland exports clean gas imports polluting wood chip. Tree planting reverses CO build up, wood chip more polluting than coal burning and deforests huge areas. The EU % of renewable, Biomass .Greenies promote non-nuclear. more people killed in wind farm accidents in Uk than nuclear ever has. All the above would indicate a somewhat lunatic approach from the Greens. Now we have, using helicopters to survey Viking Energy sites as peat too unstable for tracked vehicles to reach, unbelievable!!! I hate to say the cult of #Greta Thunberg#,depression, eating disorders, and anxiety attacks,Asperger’s syndrome, high-ing autism, and OCD. She also suffers from selective mutism and self-harm. The sacricial lamb of the Greens across Europe. The inspiration behind the school strikes!!!!! Nowthat#s not lunatic, what is Ian’s position on global warming is either well grounded or is, well, hot air. He knows how this goes. Either he has a reputable theorist publishing an article in a reputable journal, or even a weblink to a news story referencing such, or he doesn’t. Because some vested interests have bought and paid for their own pet scientiststhere may be dferent opinions regarding whatever his as yet unclear point was with his unnamed and undated second ice age. If he really wants to be taken seriously he should put up or# consider his alternative.C’mon Ian, one reference to one reputable scientist backing up whatever it is you so obviously don’t want to say. You know you can do it.I am would be intrigued to opinions relating to climate change due to agriculture and what would be the answer to providing food but reducing or stopping climate change due to agriculture. I may be wrong but I believe agriculture produces  times more greenhouse gases than all of transportation put together, but this has, conveniently, been avoided by the media and scientic community. There is a terrible dilemma between producing food to this of attempting to reduce green houses gases and the progressive climate change taking place Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough and we are confused.One minute providing grants to preserve Shetland#s peat carbon store, and the next proposing digging acres of it up, releasing all that carbon, to build Viking.Giving out paper straws in McDonalds with juice in a plastic cup .I mind askingabout planting trees on my croft. They said #oh we dont want these clumps of trees any more, not our landscape#, when I had always thought tree planting was good.Such a mixed message. Why dont we have a green rating system like we have for our washing machines. You could rate biomass, nuclear, windfarms from construction to operation in terms of green to red, so we would know where we are in the scale with our choices.Any way, still have a patch of high hill that would be great for a mini woodsI referenced Greta with a very heavy heart, a truly exploited child whose background would fire concern with any child specialist in the UK, psychologist or Social worker.Sorry, Johan, who isn#t #taking climate change seriously# Theresa May and the Tories are taking it very seriously, indeed, passing Mrs May#s unilateral # net zero# plan into law. The Treasury says it will cost over £ trillion , enough to fund the salaries of , nurses for  years.Too little for Greta Thunberg and her #Extinction Rebellion pals, apparently.This will find its way on to consumers# electricity bills, including those in fuel poverty, a clear majority of homes in Shetland #  percent, before the recent price hikes.The Shetland Labour Party that I grew up with was concerned with alleviating poverty, not creating it. They were not interested inwinning #Green Blue Peter Badges# for futile, bourgeois bagatelles like#tackling climate change#, without any hope of success.Britain, far less, Shetland, can achieve nothing alone.The only candidate to exhibit concern for Shetland#s poor is Ian Scott.Im confused. You state that the Tories are proposing  net zero and then you say Labour creating poverty.I am very seriously concerned about fuel poverty everywhere and especially in Shetland. I hope that there are no price hikes in our fuel bills, this is something we need to resist, and I also hope more help is forthcoming for retrofitting better heating systems and more insulation to improve housing quality.Please do not try to tell me what I believe.Johan, I don’t recall you ever mentioning fuel poverty before. Do you support or oppose “ net zero”, which was done in knee-jerk response to the campaigns of Greta Thunberg and her pals “Extinction Rebellion” Only, you have been supporting Ms Thunberg’s “climate emergency” campaign at local level, have you not Mrs May’s , nurses salaries for  years isn’t “emergency” enough for them, they want more.You can huff and puff as much as you like, the cost will find its way to the fuel poor, increasing their number.I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Greta Thunberg AND the fuel poor, whom you have now mentioned for the first time.Mr Scott has been arguing for Shetland’s poor since long before he became a councillor.No John I have not been supporting Greta#s campaign locally and yes I have mentioned fuel poverty before and I think I can support greener politics and the poor. It is an important point tho, how we are going to pay for it all. I heard somewhere the Tories are going to pay for it from the proceeds of G.Johan, I responded to your comment above that Greta Thunberg is right .You have also defended the Shetland schools strike “climate emergency” demonstration in this self, same thread.I quote: “Both Ian and Greta Thunberg are right tho. We are not taking climate change seriously enough#..etc..”That sounds awful like you think Mrs May committing  years’ worth of , nurses salaries isn’t “taking climate change seriously enough” If you are now saying that you do not support Greta Thunberg and do wish to tackle Shetland’s lamentable fuel poverty, will you be making a clear, prominent statement to that effect in your campaign literature Including your and Shetland Labour’s proposals for solving the fuel poverty The twisting of my words is really uncalled for, and completely ignoring the main point of my post which is that we need a green rating system to stop you all arguing about what is green and what is not # but then you enjoy the fight too much and would poo poo any system anyway I suppose.Strange move of support from Wir Shetland to Ian Scott  You#re scraping the barrel, now, Johan, getting personal. After your Up Helly-Aa performance, your comment about #enjoying the fight# is, frankly,a bit rich.It appears you are not prepared to make the campaign commitment I suggested. That#s ok.I#m not supporting anyone yet as I haven#t heard from all the candidates. I merely pointed out that Mr Scott is the only one so far to have shown any real concern for Shetland#s poor. He needs to say more about that. Under the present arrangements #climate emergency# will dump on the fuel poor. They have votes, too, of course # more than  percent of the electorate.Good luck with your campaign.Given his concern for the fuel poor John Tulloch will presumably be supporting whichever candidate puts the cancellation of Brexit first and foremost in their manesto  The largest driver of upward pressure on heating bills over the past two years is the devaluation of the pound following the Brexit vote. Greta Thunberg had nothing to do with it. In the event of further declines in the value of the pound post prime minister Johnson increased hard Brexit probability, the suffering of the fuel poor will continue to worsen as the wholesale price of gas becomes relatively more expensive when purchased in pounds sterling.The  dilemma that John Tulloch posed to Johan Adamson could equally well be phrased thus: I put it to you that you cannot simultaneously support Brexit AND the fuel poor.I apologiseI have gotten personal. Be as naesty as du wants, I just cant fathom why you need to be so  Breakfast TV only this morning were talking about how the market is not working, people not changing utility supplier and these people paying more as a consequence.Its surely not fairyour contract runs out that they are able to leave you on a higher rate Action on fuel poverty needs to include tackling the inequalities in the market as well as action to make our houses warmer.Ok, Johan. I’ve made my points about fuel poverty and there’snothing I want to add.So forgive meI don’t digress into bickering about who has or hasn’t been “naesty”. Readers may judge.Good luck with your campaign.Yes, Ian can answer a question when he chooses to. And there is sense in some of what he says. Wind farms on peat, for example, happen when commercial interests chase subsidies, so it is up to governments to get the correct approach. Not all that blame goes at the Green’s door, and they are either correct to claim there is a climate emergency or they are not.On the climate emergency Ian’s thoughts can only be guessed at. They have something to do with an ice-age, which is appropriate as progress towards getting him to answer his own question is, as yet, glacial.A big problem inside these debates stems from some people get beguiled by fake scientic claims. This is why genuine people making genuine scientic claims are generally happy to back them up by referencing the work of the real scientists involved. This offers folk who may or may not be less expert than Dr. Ian Tinklersome protection from charlatans with an axe to grind. Again,Ian is serious, rather than just being a contraryIan, he will reveal his ice-age source s. Or would doing so would reveal his actual movitation  C’mon Ian, youknowyouwantto.I actually sent them to the Times. They failed to print them as perhaps regarded as irrelevant pertaining to the school strike. I will do so again so Peter can untwist his knickers.The book you really should read, Mr T., is The Uninhabitable Earth by David Wallace Wells. Things are far more precarious than you think.David Wallace Wells. I would rather believe scientic specialists in ious fields than blindly take the word of a Journalist, Brian. He appears to hold no scientic qualication of any type. Writing for theis not reliable science training any more than writing for the Mail..Try reading it.Abruptclimate change , at younger dryasfor years also because of meteorite strike in Greenland. We still haven#t founda proper way of storing spent nuclear fuel, i can seethe repository at Sellafield being under miles of snow through the many ice ages to come before it issafe again.The nuclear nonsensewas never about cheap and safe electricity it was of course about weapons grade plutonium tons,produced here in Scotland alone,why that amount when a few tons could polish off the entire planet does anyone know Do we trust Boris and fruitcake farm with this ,aye right- their record speaks for itself! Maybe the bairns protesting about climate change holds a candle of hope up - -we are all going to need it.Graham Fleming, Thorium breakdown isotopes have short half-lives. Long term storage is nor an issue. Ask a standard grader that is beyond your understanding.Incidentally, the global stockpile of separated plutonium is about  tonnes. That is  tonnes too much, however Thorium reactors produce none at all. Sad you cannot get your facts straight Graham Flemming, so very SNP.Having read these pages for a long time Peter, it should be apparent by now that Ian is a dental surgeon by training and therefore qualies for Dr status.No need to have a PhDor any other bits of paper !Ok, well thanks to Ian, andthe Times did withhold the links as irrelevant to the school strike they maybe had a point. It was Ian that insisted to Brian Smith way back when that this issue was relevant, for whatever reason.I#m still not clear what Ian draws from these articles though, or why anyone would have to have this knowledge to take a view on the current level of threat, but I get that global warming isn#t about to lead to another ice age. I don#t recall the protest saying it would# It#s a welcome change to have Ian express himself without resort to petty insult though. Long may that continue. On his earlier point on science, however, I#m not sure most scientists would agree science means knowledge only, as Ian proposed, without including the search for it by using scientic methods.But here is the big unanswered question # whatever it is Ian take from these links # does he, or does he not, think we are facing a climate crisis  If we are then surely the kids are right to be concerned, especially as some government sponsored action on climate change is potentially green-wash.Slight problem with the colour test Johan.About % of men have problems when distinguishingbetween red and green .

The Loch Ewe farm has failed the required environmental standards for nearly  years. Mowi, despite virtually unlimited resources, were apparently unwilling or unable to make the necessary changes. broadcast in May.In January , the Scottish Parliament#s Rural Economy and Connectivity Committee agreed to undertake an enquiry into the state of salmon fishing in Scotland and in November  the regulatory body SEPA published proposals for a revised regulatory regime for the finfish sector. Within these proposals, SEPA said it would begin a programme of work to #modernise the regulation of existing sites#.Mowi#s head of environmental management, Stephen MacIntyre, said that the company wanted to #align its growth# with recent recommendations. The company had plans to sustainably grow their fish production levels over the next few years by #expanding into new high-energy farming areas located further offshore#.Bill Whyte, convener of the Wester Ross Area Salmon Fishery Board, said he welcomed Mowi#s recognition of the wild salmonid habitats and added: #We will expect further clarity about the process of biomass relocation. However,Mowi can provide evidence through EIAplanning and SEPA regulatory structure that the relocated biomass will have reduced potential impact on wild migratory fish, then we would be prepared to support biomass relocation on a conditional basis.#*A spokesperson from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency , said: “It is really encouraging to see that industry is proactively choosing to consider more sustainable locations for fish farms, away from more sensitive waters where pressures on the marine environment are greatest. “SEPA’s new regulatory framework for marine cage fish farming, launched on  June, , combines more accurate modelling and enhanced monitoring to encourage a more sustainable approach to the siting of fish farms. “In practice, we anticipate this will lead to fewer fish farms in shallower, slow-flowing waters and more fish farms in offshore locations where the environment capacity can better assimilate wastes. The new framework is designed to actively support operators who are seeking to relocate to more sustainable locations, and through improved practices and the innovative use of new technologies, reduce their impact on the marine environment.#They went on to add: “Indeed, our new framework provides exactly the type of flexibility and outcome-focus Mowi outlines it is looking for.Within this new framework, we will consider each inidual proposal on its merits against the legal standards.We encourage Mowi and other operators to work with us and other interested parties to explore their innovative proposals under our new framework.We look forward to doing so."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Kara-with-100m-IM-Gold.jpg","title":"inspirational western isles swimmer kara hanlon wins four gold medals at international island games in","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine July.And the -year old was not the only WesternIsles athlete to celebrate a podium place in the shadow of the famous rock, asmore joy followed in the pool and in the athletics stadium.Isla Budge won bronze in the -metres freestyle event, while in Thursday’s triple jump final Mary Macleod won silver and Heather MacKinnon took bronze.Eriskay jumper MacKinnon had won gold in the event in Gotland two years ago with a shorter jump than it took to win third this time around.Hanlon’s week of glory began on Monday whenshe retained the  metres breaststroke title she won in Gotland in .

He was killed by a bullet passing through his brain so that I am glad to say that he suffered absolutely no pain. I have known your brother personally for nearly two years and I feel that I have lost a real friend as well as an excellent sergeant. I have never met anyone whom I trusted more than your brother. He was absolutely fearless and could always be depended upon to do anything.“Perhaps you have heard that he was recommended for bravery at the battle of the Somme, when, after three attempts had been made, he collected eight men of his platoon and was going to make another attack, when, luckily, he was stopped as the chance was hopeless.

Lauren, who has two children aged  and , has just taken up a new position as cook in a Galgorm nursing home.A past pupil of Ballee High School, Lauren admits that it took her a while to realise what she wanted to do after leaving school.When she signed up for the Professional Cookery course at Northern Regional College, it was a case of third time lucky.Lauren said: “I did both Level  Childcare Diploma and then Level  Diploma in Business and Retail Administration at the College but they weren’t for me. “When I finished the second course, I got a temporary job working in a school kitchen and that was when I knew what I wanted to do.”She admits that the job as a cook really whetted her appetite for working in a kitchen and she hasn’t looked back.“I loved the Professional Cookery course and I’m already missing College! The emphasis was on practical skills rather than written work and this really suited me. I enjoyed every minute of it.”Lauren’s proud parents, Marbeth and Brian were there to see her collect her award.Marbeth said: “Lauren deserves great credit and we’re so pleased for her.“She struggled with her work at school and we now realise that this was as a result of her dyslexia. “All her hard work has paid off and we’re delighted for her.”Northern Regional College offers a range of Professional Cookery courses at its campuses in Ballymena and Ballymoney.

If you or a young person you know is faced with the habitual struggle to fill those days with excitement, then look no further than the New Lodge Art’s packed programme of summer events.The inimitable arts group will once again host a range of activities in the coming weeks including drama, sports, comedy, music and dance. The programme will culminate in the jam-packed Festival of Fun in Lepper Street on August  and there will be no shortage of events and activities along the way, such as a local production of Disney’s High School Musical.Speaking to the North Belfast News, Anne Delaney, Arts Programme andOperations Manager at New Lodge Arts, said: “For a lot of the young people that we work with they may not be going on summer holidays, or they may not be getting out of the area. These types of activities are ersionary activities for them to take part in.“It brings young people from ious communities across North Belfast together. We work with kids from the Lower Shankill right up to Rathcoole. It’s about the personal and social development of young people, but also the good relations is really important in the work that we’re doing. It also provides ersionary activities around the time of unrest related to the internment bonfires. We see these projects as bringing a positive outlook to these areas during these times.”She continued: “We have our festival of fun event, which is on the th of August on Lepper Street. It’s our headline event, so it will be full of comedy, street theatre, music, dance, amusements, a roller disco – there is loads happening that day. Over the last few years there has been a lot of negativity around the bonfire so we’re working with Féile on this event as part of their wider Belfast ersionary programme.“It’s a good opportunity for young people to meet new friends, it gives them something outside of their school le and it helps to improve confidence and self-esteem. It’s brilliant for the young people themselves, but also then you see parents coming along who are so proud of what their child has achieved. I think bringing the likes of High School Musical to the Mac, which is one of Belfast’s best theatres, is brilliant. It’s a great opportunity for young people to be involved. It’s on our doorstep and a lot of young people might not have the chance to use it. Tickets are £, so they’re affordable for local families – no other tickets at the Mac are that price. We really want to encourage people to come and support their local young people.”"},{"url":null,"title":"10k for northern ireland civil servant offended by portraits of queen and philip peer","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The portraits were removed and the offended party, a Mr Lee Hegarty, was consulted on what should replace them.”“He suggested that the portraits of Her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh should be replaced with photographs of, at best, the Queen meeting people during engagements in Northern Ireland,\" said Lord Maginnis.“One such photograph features Her Majesty the Queen shaking hands with the former deputy first minister, Martin McGuinness, at the Lyric Theatre in Belfast.“I do not mind that what I mind is that the case brought by the complainant was settled secretly and that the sum of £, was handed over, presumably for hurt feelings and distress.“This settlement was signed off by the then secretary of state, Theresa Villiers MP, on the recommendation, I am informed, of her permanent secretary Jonathan Stephens.“I have been told to look at the annual accounts to find out where the money came from – but it is not to be found. That should concern us.”After some time had passed after the issue of compensation was settled, Lord Maginnis said that last year Mr Hegarty was promoted to become accounting officer of the Parades Commission.He said this contrasted with what he described as the years of delay in compensating victims of historical institutional abuse in Northern Ireland. He said they had been “shamefully left out in the cold when it comes to their justiable claims for compensation”.“This is scandalous. It is an indictment of the Northern Ireland Office and of this government,\" he said.“We have lost all sense of reality when a portrait of Her Majesty can cause offence to a civil servant but we do not bat an eyelid when we deny closure and justice to unfortunate people who have been abused in the most outrageous manner imaginable.“I urge the Northern Ireland Office not only to restore the original portraits of Her Majesty and the Duke of Edinburgh but to expedite payment of the comparatively paltry compensation due to the people who are more deserving than this opportunistic civil servant who, surely, must now be compromised in his position in the Parades Commission because of his bigoted stance over the Royal Family.”The Northern Ireland Office said in a statement: “We will not comment on inidual personnel matters.”"},{"url":null,"title":"belfast beauty revealed again as scaffolding comes down on the mac","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Mr O Cadhla was raised in the Ring Gaeltacht and previously represented the Cobh area on Cork County Council.After receiving summonses on charges of criminal damage in , Mr O Cadhla wrote to the clerk of Cork District Court asking that his trial be conducted in Irish. But when the matter came before Judge Olann Kelleher in November , the judge said he intended to conduct the hearing in English as he knew the applicant could speak English.At later hearings an interpreter was provided, but Mr O Cadhla complained the interpreter could not translate both for him and the judge simultaneously.The case was adjourned after Mr O Cadhla asked the High Court to consider the constitutionality of Judge Kellehers decision. Mr O Cadhla claimed he would be placed at a disadvantagehis evidence was heard by a judge \"through the prism of a translation\" rather than in its original form.He argued this amounted to unequal treatment and was in conflict with Article  of the Constitution. This article provides that Irish is the first official language and English the second.It also says that provision may be made by law for the exclusive use of either language for official purposes.Mr O Cadhlas action was opposed by the State, which argued that any disadvantage he alleged could be cured by the process of translation. However, the court heard from a number of solicitors that it was \"usual practice\" for a bilingual judge to be found where one was requested.Ms Justice Ni Raeartaigh said that, in a nutshell, the case concerned whether or not there was any right to be heard and understood in Irish by the district judge, as distinct from the right to speak and present ones case in Irish. She said the refusal to provide a bilingual judge appeared to her to be contrary to the spirit of Article  and previous jurisprudence. The judge said she was inclined to grant a declaration that there was a duty to make reasonable efforts to assign a bilingual judge for Mr O Cadhlas forthcoming trial and that she did not believe this would cause any signicant practical problems."},{"url":null,"title":"shop staff form guard of honour as primark founders hearse passes","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsThe TwelfthNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop #IAMMANUFACTURINGEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The Inquest hearings took place over a twelve-day period last year.The British Army have claimed for the last  years, that Mr Bradley a -year-old IRA member, was armed when they opened fire on him close to the Bishop’s Field area of Creggan. This claim has consistently denied by the Bradley family over the decades.Danny Bradley, brother of the deceased man told the Derry News: “At the end of the day this is good news.

Durkan come after the latest public consultation attracted over  objections which he now believes will scupper plans for similar schemes in areas such as Rosemount and Bishop Street.Mr Durkan said the Department for Infrastructurehas been “extremely ham-fisted” in its handling of the consultation process.The parking scheme issue stretches back around ten years, with ious public consultations having taken place in that time. At one stage, it was expected to be introduced in  but had to be pushed back until .In  then Roads Minister Danny Kennedy gave assurances that, “in the absence of signicant objections”, the scheme would be in place no later than Spring .However, this week, after a consultation ended last April and a further information session was held in November, a spokesperson for the Department explained that the proposed Rossville Street Residents’ parking scheme received a large number of objections from the residents.Of the  responses received, there were  objections to the scheme.The DfI told the Derry News that key areas of concern coming out of the consultation included the number of permits allocated for visitors, access for family carers and concerns over costs.The Department has since confirmed that the resident and visitor permits would be free and that a special permit would be available for family carers, also free of charge.The DfI spokesperson added: “The Department acknowledges that there is still a need to manage car parking in the Bogside and is now considering how to progress matters.“Consideration is being given to advancing a smaller scheme within the Rossville area to include Abbey Park, Glenfada Park and Columbcille Court, possibly as a pilot. The Department would hope to commence consultation for a smaller scheme in September.“The Department will write out to all residents living within the limits of the original Rossville scheme as soon it is confirmed how an alternative scheme will be progressed.“The Department is not in a position to consider other schemes at this time.”StaggeringMark H. Durkan is worried that delays to the Bogside parking scheme will now hamper the roll-out of similar schemes.“The fact this is happening will now block progress on any residents’ parking scheme where in the city.“Bogside residents want a parking scheme so it must be the design of it that people are objecting to. It’s staggering that a much-needed parking scheme in an area where residents struggle and have been crying out for a solution to the problem of getting parked outside their homes during the day has been scrapped.“This scheme has been deliberated over for ten years and the department has brought proposals forward that have been met with such opposition. It begs the question, was enough done to liaise and interact with objectors, and could they respond in turn to these objections.“Bogside was identied as a key area, as was Bishop Street and the next was the lower Rosemount university area. But now it seems asthe department has pulled the plug on those schemes and there is no chance of progress.”Parallel schemesThe SDLP representative had enquired about the possibility of a similar scheme in other areas which are badly impacted by students such as Rosemount, and Abercorn Place and Terrace which are both affected by city centre workers.“These could have been done in parallel so that at least one scheme could be advanced. People in Rosemount are frustrated that they’ve been put on the back burner while this other scheme was being progressed, but they’ll be even more frustrated to see it isn’t being progressed.“Rosemount and Bishop Street will now be way down the line, the handling of this by the Department of Infrastructure seems extremely ham-fisted,” Mr Durkan added.The Rossville Street area Residents’ Parking Scheme would be the first such scheme for the City and involves over  residential properties mainly in the Rossville Street, Fahan Street, Little Diamond, Creggan Street and Chamberlain Street areas.A DfI publication in March stated that, proposals for the Scheme were first announced by the previous Minister for Infrastucture, and following informal consultations “there has proven to be signicant support from residents who are experiencing increasing dficulties parking outside their homes.”The Department wrote to all residents within the area and encouraged all interested parties to formally respond to the proposals before  April.If introduced as proposed, the scheme would have designated free of charge parking places for residents only between the hours of . am and noon and between . pm and . pm from Monday to Saturday inclusive.Visitors would have been able to park within areas designated for residents provided a valid visitor’s permit is displayed on the vehicle.

There needs to be swt action as an enhanced facility could alleviate the problem people are currently facing.A Department for Infrastructure spokesman said the current Driver and Vehicle test centre network was built around  years ago.ldquoMuch has been done to maintain and modernise the test centres in that time, particularly to meet the growing demand for vehicle tests. However, present and future legislative requirements, coupled with increasing and changing demands for testing services, mean that the current network is no longer sustainable, he said.ldquoAs such, we have been reviewing the network with a view to determining the most appropriate network of test centres to meet our future needs. To date, with the exception of a new test centre being built at Hydebank in Belfast, no decisions have been taken on the size of any other specic test centres within a future network.The spokesman said the new test centre at Hydebank and will provide additional testing capacity for the Greater Belfast area.He added: ldquoOur plans for a new network are continuing to be progressed, specically in terms of the design for the new test centres and the acquisition of land.ldquoHowever, in the absence of the NI Executive there is currently no means to progress proposals beyond the construction of the new test centre at Hydebank..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Carryduff man honoured with major accolade  ","story":"A CARRYDUFF country sports enthusiast has been honoured with a major award.John Leighton, who is the president of the Ulster Gundog League, has been presented with The Great Game Fairs of Ireland letime achievement award.The awards, made each year at the Irish Game Fair at Fine Food Festival held at Shanes Castle, Antrim, are designed to recognise and reward outstanding iniduals who devote themselves to nurturing rural heritage.Announcing Johnrsquos award, Albert Titterington, managing director of The Great Game Fairs of Ireland, said: ldquoIt is an absolute pleasure each year to have the opportunity publicly to recognise some of the outstanding members of the game show family who commit their time, talents and enthusiasm to preserving rural traditions and promoting country sports.ldquoThese people work tirelessly behind the scenes and without any thought of reward mdash and John epitomises that blend of modesty and high achievement.ldquoOver the years John has enjoyed considerable sporting success with the dogs he trains and we have been proud to have enjoyed his support and insight as he served as spaniels directorrsquo with our fairs, shaping competitions and ensuring top quality entries.Mr Titterington said Mr Leightonrsquos  years of gundog competition experience commanded ldquoinstant respect in gundog circles and described him as a ldquopopular figure across this island and beyond..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Cormac delivers at Irish Open  ","story":"ARDGLASS golfer Cormac Sharvin has just had the biggest week of his le.The  year-old was the top Irish finisher at the Dubai Duty Free Irish Open at Lahinch.He finished joint th place on nine-under par to earn the biggest payday of his le, pocketing a cheque for euro,.It was almost three times the amount he has earned on the European Challenge Tour so far this season.Unfortunately, he missed out on securing a dream spot at next weekrsquos Open Championship at Portrush.After signing off with a final round  on Sunday he said: ldquoI felt I didnrsquot play much dferent from the first three days.

These are two key elements of Delamontrsquos future success.Cllr Walker said he hopes that the public will be given time to view the content of the master plan when it is completed and that money to provide a raft of new facilities can be secured to allow work to potentially start next year.ldquoThe Education Authority stuck to its promise to invest in Delamont and I hope that the local authority will honour its commitment and start planning to provide more facilities at the country park which offers huge development potential, he said.ldquoWhile already a signicant tourism attraction, there are not that many facilities apart from a childrenrsquos playground, stunning walks and the hugely popular Steamerrsquos cafe and miniature railway.ldquoWhile I am not advocating that the beauty of the area is spoiled in any way, there are hundreds of acres of space which could be used to boost the parkrsquos tourism offering.Cllr Walker said the availability of finance to enhance the park is critical to its future development, providing new attractions and creating a boost for nearby businesses in Killyleagh.He added: ldquoThe eagerly-awaited master plan is the key to unlocking Delamontrsquos future development and can also pave the way for much-needed investment.

If Fascism hadnrsquot been beaten we would be living in a very dferent world today. ldquoWe would be living in fear of a regime which would not tolerate any descent. We are very lucky and should be thankful to those veterans who risked all and gave their tomorrow for our today.Cllr Hanna said the districtrsquos surviving veterans were small in number and well into their nineties, and that society owed a debt to them for their part in the battle to secure the freedom people enjoy today.He said he included the Merchant Navy in his proposal because many risked their lives on merchant ships to ferry supplies which helped win the war.ldquoThis was a cruel war where many lost their lives and I really hope we never have to face anything like this again. Those from Northern Ireland who fought and served during World War Two came from all sections of the community.ldquoBefore it is too late, I believe this council should acknowledge what these brave people did for us all by presenting surviving veterans with a silver poppy at a cross community service in November, said Cllr Hanna.He added: ldquoI hope that the council will support this motion as a mark of respect for the generation which has given us freedoms we take for granted.The SDLPrsquos Declan McAteer said he was ldquosomewhat dubious about the suggestion for the council ldquoto go out on a limb and procure silver poppy medals.ldquoI fully respect the sentiment of those wishing to identy with what is essentially a British symbol which wonrsquot by endorsed by all Irish men or women. The poppy, for better or worse, is associated with all conflicts that Britain was involved in from the First World War right through.ldquoI would say that perhaps thatwe do anything around this we take a lead from the British Legion in Ireland which decided on a shamrock poppy which has been worn by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar.Cllr McAteer proposed that the issue be referred to the local

Forum was the ldquoideal committee to send the issue to.He added: We need to look at this issue and decide what event we are going to have and come to a respectful decision.At the debate conclusion, Cllr Hanna reaffirmed he had no issue referring his proposal for further debate, highlighting the need for the matter to be dealt with quickly.He also said he had no dficulty with awarding veterans a

problems within the districtrsquos planning department have been laid bare in a Newry, Mourne and Down Council report which has been made public.The local authority mdash which is responsible for district planners mdash has revealed in its annual audit committee report that the current number of live planning applications in the system is just over ,.The confirmation comes after local politicians recently pointed to what they described as ldquoserious problems at council management level for not taking the planning backlog seriously enough.Politicians have expressed concern that planners are not responding to their telephone calls and emails, with people who lodge applications also concerned that they are not getting any information from officials.Elected representatives say while all the fault does not rest with planners, they are firmly of the view that there are simply not enough staff to deal with the huge volume of work.Concern has also been expressed that the planning department is having problems retaining staff to work in a department that receives the second highest number of applications across the Provincersquos  councils.Politicians say there is a need to ensure the planning department is running properly which the council explains in the new report is exactly what it aims to do.A major review of planning has already been undertaken and amendments made to the so-called scheme of delegation which is a set of rules which determines whether a planning application will be decided by the local authorityrsquos Planning Committee or planning officers.A critical look has also been taken at staffing structures in tandem with the arearsquos chief planner, with council officials conceding that while there are issues with staff turnover, positions are filled as quickly as possible.In addition, the council has admitted there is a communication issue within the planning department with the change that needs to happen something that cannot be achieved overnight.Signicantly, the new council report warns that failure to deliver timely planning decisions is a ldquorisk within the corporate risk register, with the number of live planning applications increasing, not decreasing, with the figure standing at , at the end of May.The report says an internal audit of the planningrevealed that there are a number of key controls absent from the local authorityrsquos planning system, in particular, its performance against legislative targets, the completeness and validation of documentation supporting applications and enforcement actions.The audit also points to a lack of clarity in respect of key performance indicators within the planning department and the lack of non-compliance by the local authority with its own planning and enforcement procedures.The report says senior council management is considering ways forward to ensure compliance with policy and legislative targets, while maintaining the number of live cases to an acceptable level.Council officials say that over the coming months they intend to take steps to address the ious issues within the planning department to further enhance governance arrangements and are satisfied that these steps will address the need for improvements..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Plans for new

Sir Billy, who not only helped keep the hotel trade open during the Troubles, but expanded it as Northern Ireland emerged from the worst years of the s, said that NI never became part of golfing circuit for Japanese golfers, in the wayScotland did, despite us having two of the best golf courses in the world .We should, he said, try hard to tap the predicted + million Chinese overseas travellers. A mere % of that is a million visitors a year.In China a decade ago I travelled up a mountain in a group including a Chinese student who said she and her boyfriend avidly watched the supernatural ABC drama Lost.Game of Thrones, one of the most successful ever TV series, has already helped bring global fans of the show to our Province.No one is surprised now to see coaches of Chinese tourists at the Carrick A Rede rope bridge.Theof the Open to Portrush after  years will further boost NI’s global profile.There are other things we should do to boost our tourist industry.My suggestion of a single transatlantic hub airport in Northern Ireland at Aldergrove, with motorways coming from north and south, M and M, and a train link shows no sign of taking off. Keeping three airports means there will not be enough air passengers to justy reopening the rail line near the international airport, but even so numbers will rise and we should improve road access .I also think the upgrade of the A and A road from Aughnacloy Belfast to Londonderry needs to be followed by a motorway that goes toLetterkenny.

We also need to reform drink licensing laws, as the hospitality industry is seeking. There was a plan to give premises a small number of am late licences annually. It was said to be good for tourists. But how  Which tourist who plans to come to NI in September will change their visit to August because a particularbar plans to use one of its limited late licences that month  Better to earmark one late night a week, Saturday, when am licences are available .Saturday would become ‘party night’.We could build further on the Ulster American folk park and presidential homesteads. The Scots Irish link is not as known as it might be. We could toughen legal protections for old buildingsand tighten slack planning restrictions on standalone homes in our scenic countryside.There has been recent disagreement over Troubles murals. My view is that they are a key part of NI’s ided story and appeal to visitors, and we need a strategy to keep the best that have local support.Then there is the Twelfth. Some people loathe it – fine, they can stay away. But there is barely a spectacle in Europe like the snaking Belfast parade .The music is extraordinary, particularly the drums. Yesterday in Donegall Place, amidst other striking renditions I noticed Omagh Protestant Boys play Penny Arcade, Shankill Defenders belt out the Halls of Montezuma, Sydenham Blues and Royals play World In Unionand Ballymacarett Defenders on Long Way to Tipperary.The BBC schedules many hours of GAA and Irish language programming, which gives pleasure to enthusiasts of one or both. Yet live Twelfth coverage is only  minutes.

Six prize winners from Ballymena Academy took part in interactive workshops, lectures and experiments with  other students from London and the North of England. The inspiring lectures covered everything from ‘Black Holes’ to ‘When Baking meets Engineering’ with interactive workshops as erse as ‘Robotics’, ‘The People’s Moon’, ‘Meterology’ and ‘Augmented Reality’.The students won the opportunity to attend the Science Summer School as part of the Year of Engineering Initiative hosted by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council’s Manufacturing Task Force ..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p The Taskforce was formed in the wake of the economic loss of both Michelin, JTI-Gallaher and others in recent years. A key focus of the MTF is to support young people make informed career choices and to explore opportunities to progress careers within the manufacturing sector.Chair of the Borough’s Growth Committee, Cllr Gregg McKeen said: “Mid and East Antrim Borough Council held a Year of Engineering event last year which brought together leading local manufacturing companies to engage directly with the next generation of budding engineers and entrepreneurs.“The Professor Brian Cox Science Summer School is now in its eighth year and sees an inspirational programme mixing the best of STEMsubjects through a series of seminars, discussions and hands-on experiments“What better way than to inspire the next generation than through exciting and innovative experiences and this fantastic prize shows council’s commitment to nurturing this talent for generations to come to ensure the survival, and growth of the manufacturing sectors.”Erin Moore, Year  from Ballymena Academy said “It was amazing: The Science Summer School really opened my eyes to the ied careers you can explore in the manufacturing and engineering sectors. It’s was a great experience meeting Brian Cox as well, he was really interesting and good at making the topics exciting. I feel very lucky to have enjoyed this prize thanks to the MTF competition by Mid and East Antrim Borough Council and can’t wait to see where my career will go.”Belfast bonfire organisers urged to leave leisure centre site Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingMan dies in tragic incident on major N.I. roadMet Office cancels N.I. thunderstorm weather warningThe  cheapest homes on sale in N.I. and how much they are going forN.I.

[Press gangs, which seized men for naval service, were hated. As war with Spain neared, the News Letter often reported on them.This dramatic report on the attempt to seize the ‘young lad’ then lurches into commentary about how such seizures would not be necessarypay was appropriate.It is never clear who makes such commentaries in the newspapers back then, whether it is the News Letter editorial staff, or an English paper, with whom the report is perhaps shared, or the author of the original letter.The letters always have a date that is earlier than the paper publication date. That is the date the letter was sent]On Tuesday and Wednesday night above  persons were taken by the constable of the tower liberty, pursuant to their orders of impress but on examination yesterday before the justices at the court-house on Tower-hill,  of them only were found proper for his majesty’s service, and the rest discharg’d.We hear that the number of seamen wanted to man his majesty’s ships are ,.[War with Spain was on the verge of being declared] A great number of fresh hands are taken in at the victualling-office, where they work night and day in getting ready stores for the new commissioned ships of war.The rulers of the watermen’s company having takenthe oaths directed for them regarding their impressing, viz. that they shall, neither through favour or affection spare, or through spleen or malice take any man, but with impartiality execute their orders, have now issued their warrants, and are gathering up with all diligence the men demanded of them by the government.Fteen officers of the first, ten of the second, and the like number of the third regiment of foot-guards, properly attended with serjeants, corporals, and drums, are ordered out for raising recruits with all expedition.We hear that orders have been given to the guards not to be absent from their quarters, but to be ready at a minute’s warning.The Twelfth  -  photographs that will make you proud to be from N.I.

We are assur’d, by letters from London, that the Jane and Draper, capt. Hamilton, was safely arrived there [from Belfast] having had four of her hands impress’d at Plymouth, and that the vessel with linen cloth from Dublin was not arrived, when those letters came away.Letters from Virginia import, that several bushels of English gold and silver coins of queen Elizabeth, king James, and king Charles the st. were found in a house, at Williamsburg, formerly inhabited by col. Bridgar, being first discovered by a negro. It was thought to have been concealed there in the time of the baron’s rebellion.

Petersburg, June .We had a report a few days ago that a body of , Swedes had appear’d before Wybourgh in Finland but we have just received positive advice that they have not yet made any movements on that side, and it is even thought that the Swedish court will not undertake any thing this year: however this does not hinder us from taking all the necessary precautions to be ready against any event. [Russia was in a major war with the Ottomans but some Swedes wanted to regain territory lost in a war that ended on , potentially leading to two wars and two fronts]They advise from Dantzick of the th inst. That great preparations are making at Petersburg for a vigorous defence, in case of an attack from the Swedes.It has been resolved, that on the first advices of any hostilities, count Lacy shall embark on board the gallies, with , men, and endeavour to make strong ersion in some provinces of Sweden,That count Munich shall command in Finland, where are army of , regular troops is to be formed.That , men shall be drawn from the Ukraine, which in six weeks time may reach the neighbourhood of Petersburg and that these troops shall be reinforced by , men from the garrisons.We hear, that the fortress of Wyburg in Finland, is plentully provided with all necessaries for a vigorous defence.try catch  TrendingMet Office cancels N.I. thunderstorm weather warningThe  cheapest homes on sale in N.I. and how much they are going forThe Twelfth  -

The TUV leader was commenting after the News Letter published the claim made by Lord Maginnis in Parliament, that Lee Hegarty – who was later promoted to become secretary and accounting officer of the Parades Commission – had received a £, payout in a case “shrouded in secrecy”.Addressing the Lords, the unionist peer urged the NIO to “restore the original portraits of Her Majesty and the Duke of Edinburgh,” and said Mr Hegarty ”must now be compromised in his position in the Parades Commission because of his bigoted stance over the Royal Family”. The former Fermanagh and South Tyrone MP contrasted what he said had happened with the civil servant to the years of delay in compensating victims of historical institutional abuse, who Lord Maginnis said had been “shamefully left out in the cold when it comes to their justiable claims for compensation”..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p He added: “This is scandalous. It is an indictment of the Northern Ireland Office and of this government. We have lost all sense of reality when a portrait of Her Majesty can cause offence to a civil servant but we do not bat an eyelid when we deny closure and justice to unfortunate people who have been abused in the most outrageous manner imaginable.”Mr Allister said: “Given Mr Hegarty now holds a senior position in the Parades Commission, there is a strong argument for absolute clarity on this matter.“How can unionists have confidence in his ability to be impartial when it comes to paradinghe was so opposed to the culture and identity of the British people of Northern Ireland that he couldn’t stand seeing portraits of Her Majesty and Prince Philip ”Mr Allister added: “If what Lord Maginnis said proves to be accurate, my view is that it is imperative that Mr Hegarty is removed from the already discredited Parade Commission immediately.”When asked about what Lord Maginnis had said, the Northern Ireland Office said in a brief statement: “We will not comment on inidual personnel matters.”Couple in s ‘being terrorised in sectarian attack on home’ Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"try catch  TrendingMan dies in tragic incident on major N.I. roadMet Office cancels N.I. thunderstorm weather warningThe  cheapest homes on sale in N.I. and how much they are going forHighly distressed N.I. man douses himself in petrol before he is restrained by emergency servicesN.I. weather thunderstorm warning worse than originally thought -

They want their truth – truth on their terms.”He added: “If history portrays them for what they were – terrorists – then rewrite the history and reinvent the English language.”It was noted that the security forces have enjoyed no amnesty of the kind which has de facto been given to many terrorists, adding that “the Orange Institution unapologetically supports our security forces and we pay tribute to their service and sacrice”.He also made reference to a recent news story, covered by the News Letter, about Tyrone GAA players bursting into song on their bus while a loyalist parade took place outside the static vehicle.The song, Come Out You Black And Tans, glories the IRA, and the incident drew an apology from Tyrone GAA boss Mickey Harte.The singing “could have led to an incident of a serious nature”, said Rev Gibson, adding that it “demands a police investigation”.And on the subject of the recent Westminster developments on marriage and abortion, Rev Gibson said: “The world may have moved from God’s word on these matters, but the Orange Institution remains committed to the whole counsel of scripture – there can be no ambiguity.“October  will be a sad day for Northern Irelandthere is no Assembly in place it will show that both lives don’t matter, a child in the womb will become a mere medical procedure, God’s ordained purpose of marriage will be thwarted ... Sadly, some changes are inevitable, so it is important that we respond to such moral changes with compassion and grace.Leak of bonfire names is unlikely to have come from PSNI, says top officerIrish tricolour is hoisted above rural Orange lodge Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"“We may not agree with these new changes, but our response must be that of Christ – love and compassionate action, not mere condemnation and criticism.”When it came to the parade itself in the west Tyrone village, around  lodges and a similar number of bands took part.A total of six districts with lodges representing Killen, Sixmilecross, Fintona, Newtownstewart, Omagh, and Strabane were on parade.This year also saw street performers incorporated into proceedings including Lambeg drums, highland dancers and much more.The main parade left the assembly field on the Longland Road at .pm and proceeded to the Berryhill Road where the demonstration field was located.Speaking with Rev Gibson was Brother Derek Reaney, assistant grand master, and the religious service was conducted by Co Tyrone Grand Chaplain, Brother Rev David Reid, assisted by Brother Rev Alan Irwin.William Scanlon, secretary of Bready LOL and Strabane district secretary, said: “Everything was %. Everybody had a fantastic day.

I had hoped to work constructively with them and take their concerns on board.ldquoThose who were elected as Conservatives but have chosen to betray the faith that was shown in them by their constituents should have the courage to resign and face by-elections. They should defend their decisions at the ballot box.ldquoAn establishment stitch up between these councillors and Labour is not in the interest of residents of the Vale of Glamorgan. They have explicitly argued that they know best and that the public should be ignored.ldquoI will be proposing a minority Conservative administration at the Vale Councilrsquos AGM with a plan that delivers on the priorities of local people. I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I also had the pleasure of meeting campaigners from across the UK as part of the Extinction Rebellion protests in Parliament.And I recently bumped into some students from Stanwell School who have been taking part in the climate strike movement and standing up for action on climate change and the climate emergency. I was glad to help get their and other constituentsrsquo voices heard on this in Parliament, because itrsquos not being debated enough - itrsquos getting lost behind other things.So whether itrsquos local action we can take on recycling and packaging, or global action on climate change and carbon emissions, we all need to do more to deal with an emergency thatrsquos going to affect us all for generations to come.I was out and about again in Penarth this weekend, along with a team of our fantastic Labour town and Vale councillors, talking to people about the forthcoming European elections. There was a lot of support for our clear Welsh Labour position backing a final say in a peoplersquos vote for the public on any Brexit deal.Following the mixed results in the local elections in England and Northern Ireland last week, there was much talk about Labour lsquobailing outrsquo the government. Let me be crystal clear on this ndash I will never lsquobail outrsquo the disastrous Tories on Brexit, and neither will the overwhelming majority of Labour MPs.We can resolve the situation, but not by any backroom stitch-up that would risk letting down both those who voted Leave and Remain.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take. Itrsquos something we have to take some time about.ldquoWhat Irsquom not going to do is jump or kowtow to people who shout the loudest.Cllr Burnett has previously tweeted the closure of Llancarfan ldquowouldnrsquot be happeningLabour were running the council.New roadsWork continues on outline business cases for two major new roads being proposed ndash the A to M link around Pendoylan and Dinas Powys Bypass between Barry and Cardf ndash but no decision has been made whether either will actually go ahead.The future of both roads rests on whether Welsh Government and the council deem them viable, and whether ministers cough up the cash to fund them.But Cllr Moore said he doesnrsquot think Welsh Government will find the money required for the Dinas Powys Bypass.ldquoItrsquos out of our hands, he said.IncineratorCllr Moore said he believes Welsh Government will order the Barry Biomass incinerator to carry out an environmentalimpact assessment.Cllr Moore, who has previously attacked what he termed ldquoscaremongering and lies around the biomass plant, said he did not want the facility in Barry Docks.He said: ldquoWe opposed it vehemently, both as a council and as a party and personally. It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

A full floor penthouse has a roof terrace to the front and back with panoramic views.Dorothy Foulkes, daughter of Stanley Sadler, who designed and built the distinctive building and ran his business from there for many years, still lives in Penarth and recently visited the site of the development.She said: ldquoI have many memories of the garage over the years. Having stood empty for many years, I am delighted it is being given a new and exciting future. It is wonderful that the key features of the original beautully designed building are being preserved and transformed.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Her classmates think shersquos odd, her best friend, Flo, doesnrsquot understand, her brother says she canrsquot, and her grandad is behaving strangely. Ellie doesnrsquot want to give up on her dream and the book seesshe can make it in a world that can be so negative.Penarth author Alison Powell has been involved from the projectrsquos beginning and helped bring Ellie and her family and friends to le.Ms Powell said: ldquoWhen I was approached I was delighted ndash as a mother of two children, I know how important it is to re-enforce positivity through all aspects of le, to challenge stereotypes and ensure they know they can strive for any career they choose, regardless of gender, race or orientation.Evan, a year two Rhws Primary pupil, said: ldquoI loved the bit in the story where Ellie got a job. People didnrsquot think she could be an engineer, but she proved them wrong. We can do what we want when we work hard.Whatrsquos a girl to do  will be distributed to schools across the area and copies from the initial print run, funded by Tarmac Cement and Lime, can be requested by emailing kara.bennett@tarmac article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/nstreet1.jpg","title":"belfasts north street arcade to be redeveloped","story":"Posted on Tuesday  June  by John Mulgrew A former Belfast shopping arcade left derelict after being gutted in a blaze more than a decade ago could be brought back to le amid fresh development plans. North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

The awards, now in their th year, rank Ireland’s fastest growing technology companies and recognise the indigenous technology companies that have demonstrated outstanding growth in turnover over the previous four years.

A total of  firms from Northern Ireland made the list last year, with Belfast-based Repstor the highest-ranking Northern Ireland business at number  in the rankings. Peter Allen, partner at Deloitte, said: “For  years, the Technology Fast  awards have celebrated the success and growth of Ireland’s leading indigenous technology companies. “It is fantastic to be able to look back and see how some of the companies which appeared on the Fast  list in the early days have become global businesses and market leaders. “The likes of First Derivatives and Novosco, who were early stage tech companies when they first made the Fast , are now major employers and shining lights within the NI economy.” One of the few Northern Ireland companies to have topped the Fast , appearing in it  out of the  years since the ranking’s inception, is Newry-headquartered financial software company First Derivatives. Shane Mulholland, senior vice president of marketing and operations at First Derivatives, said: “We’ve been involved with the Fast  programme since it began and have found it to be not only great recognition of every stage of the company’s growth but also a chance to meet peers and like-minded businesses who are striving to be leaders in their own fields.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/brexit_123234324234_web.jpg","title":"no deal brexit could cost ni  jobs","story":"Posted on Wednesday  July  by John Mulgrew Northern Ireland faces losing , jobs in a ‘no deal’ Brexit which could have ‘immediate and severe consequences for its position as an all-island and UK economy, a government paper has warned.

Among its key points, it says a ‘no deal’ “could lead to a sharp increase in unemployment, with at least , jobs at risk, based on EU export exposure”. “The impact of EU tarfs could reduce NI’s exports to Ireland by % and the inclusion of non-tarf barriers could see a decline of %,” it says.
